====== son, son of ======


===== Definition: =====

The term "son" refers to a boy or man in relation to his parents. It can refer either to someone's male offspring or to an adopted son.

  * "Son" is often used figuratively in the Bible to refer to any male descendant, such as a grandson or great-grandson.
  * The term "son" can also be used as a polite form of address to a boy or man who is younger.
  * Sometimes "sons of God" is used in the New Testament to refer to believers in Christ.
  * The phrase "son of" often has the figurative meaning, "having the characteristics of." Examples of this include, "sons of the light," "sons of disobedience," "a son of peace," and "sons of thunder."
  * The phrase "son of" is also frequently used to tell who the person's father is. This phrase is used in genealogies and many other places.
  * Using "son of" to give the name of the father frequently helps distinguish people who have the same name. For example, "Azariah, son of Zadok" and  "Azariah, son of Nathan" in 1 Kings 4, and "Azariah, son of Amaziah in 2 Kings 15 are three different men.


===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * In most occurrences of this term, it is best to translate "son" using the literal term in the language that is used to refer to a son.
  * When translating the term "Son of God," the usual, common term for "son" should be used.
  * When used to refer to a descendant rather than a direct son, the term "descendant" could be used, as in referring to Jesus as the "descendant of David" or in genealogies where sometimes "son" refers to a male descendant.
  * Sometimes "sons" can be translated as "children," when both males and females are being referred to. For example, "sons of God" could be translated as "children of God" since this expression also includes girls and women.
  * The figurative expression "son of" could also be translated as "someone who has the characteristics of" or "someone who is like" or "someone who has" or "someone who acts like."
