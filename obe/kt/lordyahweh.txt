====== Lord Yahweh, Yahweh God ======

===== Facts: =====

In the Old Testament, these terms are used many times to refer to the one true God.

  * The term "Lord" is a title and "Yahweh" is God's personal name.
  * God's personal name "Yahweh" is also often combined with the term "God" to form "Yahweh God."


===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * If you use some form of "Yahweh" for his personal name, you can translated these terms literally as "Lord Yahweh" and "Yahweh God."
  * Some languages put titles after the name and would translate this as "Yahweh Lord." Consider what is natural in the project language: should the title "Lord" come before or after "Yahweh"?
  * If the translation renders "Yahweh" as "Lord" or "LORD," it is best to render "Lord Yahweh" as a phrase like "Lord God" or "God who is the Lord."
  * But the term "Lord Yahweh" should not be rendered as "Lord LORD" because readers may not notice the difference in letter size that has traditionally been used to distinguish these.
  * "Yahweh God" could possibly be rendered as "God who is called Yahweh" or "God who is the Living One" or "I am, who is God."
