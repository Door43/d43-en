====== church, Church ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Bible, the term "church" refers to a local group of believers in Jesus who regularly meet together to pray and hear God's word preached. It can also refer to all Christians.

  * When this term is used to refer to all believers everywhere in the whole body of Christ, some Bible translations capitalize it (Church) to distinguish it from the local church.
  * The original meaning of this term is "called out (to meet together)." It refers to an assembly or gathering of people for a special purpose.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * The term "church" could be translated as a "gathering together" or "assembly" or "congregation" or "ones who meet together."
  * The word or phrase that is used to translate this term should also be able to refer to all believers, not just one small group.
  * Make sure that the translation of "church" does not just refer to a building.
  * Also consider how it is translated in a local or national Bible translation. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:translateunknowns|How to Translate Unknowns]].)
