====== church, Church ======

===== Definition: =====

In the New Testament, the term "church" refers to a local group of believers in Jesus who regularly met together to pray and hear God's word preached. The term "the Church" often refers to all Christians.

  * This term literally refers to a "called out" assembly or congregation of people who meet together for a special purpose.
  * When this term is used to refer to all believers everywhere in the whole body of Christ, some Bible translations capitalize the first letter ("Church") to distinguish it from the local church.
  * Often the believers in a particular city would meet together in someone's home. These local churches were given the name of the city such as the "church at Ephesus."
  * In the Bible, "church" does not refer to a building.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * The term "church" could be translated as a "gathering together" or "assembly" or "congregation" or "ones who meet together."
  * The word or phrase that is used to translate this term should also be able to refer to all believers, not just one small group.
  * Make sure that the translation of "church" does not just refer to a building.
  * The term used to translate "assembly" in the Old Testament could also be used to translate this term.
  * Also consider how it is translated in a local or national Bible translation. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown|How to Translate Unknowns]].)
