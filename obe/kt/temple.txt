====== temple ======


===== Facts: =====

The temple was a building surrounded by walled courtyards where the Israelites came to pray and to offer sacrifices to God. The temple building had two rooms, the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place.

  * Sometimes the term "temple" refers to the whole temple complex, including the courtyards that surrounded the main building. Other times it refers only to the building.
  * God referred to the temple as his dwelling place.
  * In the New Testament, the term "temple of the Holy Spirit" is used to refer to believers in Jesus, because the Holy Spirit lives in them.
