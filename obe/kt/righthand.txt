===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Sometimes the term "right hand" literally refers to a person's right hand, as when Roman soldiers put a staff into Jesus' right hand to mock him. This should be translated using the term that the language uses to refer to this hand.
  * Regarding figurative uses, if an idiom that includes the term "right hand" does not have the same meaning in the language of translation, then consider whether the project language has a different idiom with the same meaning. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * Depending on the context, the phrase "at the right hand of" could be translated as "in the place of honor beside" or "in the position of strength" or "as his most important helper."
  * Ways to translate "with his right hand" could include, "with authority" or "using power" or "with his amazing strength."
  * When talking about Yahweh, a phrase such as "his right hand and his mighty arm" is a figure of speech that refers to his power and great strength. These two ways of saying the same thing emphasize this point. It could be translated as, "his amazing strength and mighty power." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * Depending on the context, other ways to translate "at the right hand of" could include, "to the right of" or "beside him to the right" or "in the place of honor" or "on the right side of."
  * The expression "their right hand is falsehood" could be translated by, "even the most honorable thing about them is corrupted" or "their place of honor is corrupted by deception."
  * In Psalm 105:9, God calls for an accuser to be at the "right hand" of a wicked leader sent to punish a rebellious people. This could be translated as, "appoint an accuser to have the place of honor beside that wicked leader" or "appoint an accuser to help that wicked leader punish them."
