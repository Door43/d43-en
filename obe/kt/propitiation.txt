====== propitiation ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "propitiation" refers to a sacrifice that is made to satisfy or fulfill the justice of God and to appease his wrath.

  * The offering of the sacrificial blood of Jesus Christ is the propitiation to God for mankind's sins.
  * Jesus' death on the cross appeased God's wrath against sin. This provided a way for God to look on people with favor and offer them eternal life.


===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * This term could be translated as "appeasement" or "causing God to forgive sins and grant favor to people."
  * The word "atonement" is close in meaning to "propitiation." It is important to compare how these two terms are used.
