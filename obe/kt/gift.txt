====== gift ======

===== Definition: =====

A gift is something that is given from one person to another person for free.

  * The gift of salvation is something God gives us in the form of Jesus, His Son, who took our punishment on the cross.
  * A common practice in biblical times that we still do today is to give money to the poor. These "gifts" could also be food or clothing.
  * The New Testament also teaches about the "gifts of the Spirit" which refers to special abilities that God gives Christians; they use these abilities to love and serve other people. The word for "gift" in this context literally means "a divine grace" or "a divine favor."
