//from comment below:
It is important to not define, focus on, or be confined by applications of the root word of “bless” that suggest primarily the flourishing or abundance of material things or physical wellness. Consider the extensive teachings in Scripture on God's love, mercy and grace that is not only ancient, but current. Consider care, protection, and presence of God's Spirit. And for us to bless God, we can offer thankfulness, appreciation, and understanding as we learn of and follow (obey) him.//
