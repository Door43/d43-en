====== Lord ======

===== Facts: =====

The term "Lord" refers to someone who has ownership or authority over people. When it is capitalized, it is a title that refers to God. (Note however that when used as a form of addressing someone or at the beginning of a sentence it may be capitalized and have the meaning of "sir" or "master.")

  * In the Old Testament, this term is also used in expressions such as, "Lord God Almighty" or "Lord Yahweh" or "Yahweh our Lord."
  * In the New Testament, the apostles used this term in expressions such as, "Lord Jesus" and "Lord Jesus Christ," which communicate that Jesus is God.
  * The term "Lord" in the New Testament is also used alone as a direct reference to God, especially in quotations from the Old Testament. For example, the Old Testament text has,  "Blessed is he who comes in the name of Yahweh" and the New Testament text has, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord."
  * In the ULB and UDB, the title, "Lord" is only used to translate the actual Hebrew and Greek words that mean "Lord." It is never used as a translation of God's name (Yahweh), as is done in many translations.


===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Some languages translate this term as "Master" or "Ruler" or some other term that communicates ownership or supreme ruler.
  * In the appropriate contexts, many translations capitalize the first letter of this term to make it clear to the reader that this is a title referring to God.
  * For places in the New Testament where there is a quote from the Old Testament, the term "Lord God" could be used to make it clear that this is a reference to God.
