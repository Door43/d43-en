====== Lord ======

===== Facts: =====

The term "Lord" refers to someone who has ownership or authority over people. When it is capitalized, it is a title that refers to God.

  * In the Old Testament, this term is used in references to God such as "Lord God Almighty" or "Lord Yahweh" or "Yahweh our Lord."
  * In the New Testament, the apostles used this term in expressions such as, "Lord Jesus" and "Lord Jesus Christ," which communicate that Jesus is God.
  * In the ULB and UDB, the title, "Lord" is only used to translate the actual Hebrew and Greek words that mean "Lord." It is never used as a translation of God's name (Yahweh) as is done in other versions.


===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Some languages translate this term as "Master" or "Ruler" or some other term that communicates ownership or supreme ruler.
  * Many translations capitalize the first letter of this term to make it clear to the reader that this is a title referring to God.
