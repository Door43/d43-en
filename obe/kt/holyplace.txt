====== holy place, most holy place ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Bible, the terms "holy place" and "most holy place" refer to the two parts of the building of the tabernacle complex and later on, of the temple complex.


  * These rooms were called "holy" because they were where God came to meet with his people the Israelites.
  * It was only the high priests who were permitted to enter these rooms as representatives of the people.
  * The holy place was the first room and it contained two things: the altar of incense and the table with the consecrated bread on it.
  * The most holy place contained the ark of the covenant.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * The term "holy place" could also be translated as, "room set apart for God" or "special room for meeting God" or "place reserved for God."
  * The term, "most holy place" could be translated as, "room that is the most set apart for God" or "most special place for meeting God."
