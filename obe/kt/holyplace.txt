====== holy place, most holy place ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Bible, the terms "holy place" and "most holy place" refer to the two parts of the building of the tabernacle complex and later on, of the temple complex.


  * These rooms were called "holy" because they were where God came to meet with his people the Israelites.
  * It was only the high priests who were permitted to enter these rooms as representatives of the people.
  * The holy place was the first room and it contained two things: the altar of incense and the table with the consecrated bread on it.
  * The most holy place contained the ark of the covenant.
  * Sometimes the phrase "holy place" is more general and refers to the whole temple  or tabernacle complex.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * The term "holy place" could also be translated as, "room set apart for God" or "special room for meeting God" or "place reserved for God."
  * The term, "most holy place" could be translated as, "room that is the most set apart for God" or "most special place for meeting God."
  * When "holy place" is more general as in "a holy place," it could be also translated as "a consecrated place" or "a place that God has set apart for himself" or "in the temple complex that is holy" or "a courtyard of the temple" or "tabernacle courtyard," depending on the context.
