====== holy place, most holy place ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Bible, the terms "holy place" and "most holy place" refer to the two rooms in the tabernacle or temple.

  * These rooms were in a building that was surrounded by the walled courtyards of the tabernacle or temple. They were separated by a thick, heavy curtain to block the entrance to the most holy place.
  * God came to meet with the high priest who represented all the Israelites.
  * The high priest was the only one who was permitted to go into the most holy place.
  * The "holy place" was the first room and it contained two things: the altar of incense and the table with the consecrated bread on it.
  * The "most holy place" was the second, innermost room and it contained the ark of the covenant.
  * Sometimes the phrase "holy place" is more general and refers to the whole complex of the temple or tabernacle.

  * The term "holy place" could also be translated as, "room set apart for God" or "special room for meeting God" or "place reserved for God."
  * The term, "most holy place" could be translated as, "room that is the most set apart for God" or "most special place for meeting God."
  * When "holy place" is more general as in "a holy place," it could be also translated as "a consecrated place" or "a place that God has set apart" or "in the temple complex that is holy" or "a courtyard of the temple" or "tabernacle courtyard," depending on the context.
