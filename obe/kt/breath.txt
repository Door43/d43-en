====== breathe, breath ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Bible, the terms "breathe" and "breath" are often used figuratively to refer to giving life or having life.

  * The Bible teaches that God "breathed into" Adam the breath of life. It was at that point that Adam became a living soul.
  * In the time of the great flood, the Bible says that every creature that "breathed" was drowned in the water.
  * When Jesus breathed on the disciples and told them to "receive the Spirit," he was probably literally breathing out air onto them to symbolize the Holy Spirit coming to them.
  * Sometimes the terms "breathing" and "breathing out" are used to refer to speaking.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * The phrase "breathed his last" is a figurative way of saying "he died." It could also be translated as, "he took his last breath" or "he stopped breathing and died" or "he breathed in air one last time."
  * Describing the Scriptures as "God-breathed" means that God spoke or inspired the words of the Scriptures which human authors then wrote down. This could be translated as, "inspired by God" or "authored by God" or "spoken by God." It could also be said that "God breathed out the words of Scripture."
  * It is probably best if possible to translate "God-breathed" somewhat literally since it is difficult to communicate the exact meaning of this.
  * The expressions "put breath in" or "breathe life into" could be translated as, "caused to breathe" or "made alive again" or "enabled them to live and breathe."
