====== veil ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "veil" usually refers to a thin piece of cloth that is used as a head covering, to cover the head or face so that it cannot be seen.

  * Moses covered his face with a veil after he had been in the presence of Yahweh, so that the brightness of his face would be hidden from the people.
  * In the Bible, women wore a veil to cover their head, and often their face as well, when they were in public or in the presence of men.
  * The verb "to veil" means to cover something with a veil.
  * In some English versions, the word "veil" is used to refer to the thick curtain that covered the entrance into the most holy place. But "curtain" is a more accurate term in that context, since it refers to a heavy, thick piece of cloth.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * The term "veil" could also be translated as, "thin, cloth covering" or "cloth covering" or "head covering."
  * In some cultures, there may already be a term for a veil for women. It may be necessary to find a different word when it is used for Moses.
