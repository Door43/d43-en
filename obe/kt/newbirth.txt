====== new birth, born again ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "born again" or "born anew" (John 3:3) was first used by Jesus to describe what it means for God to change a person from being dead spiritually to being alive spiritually. He also said that such a person has been "born of the Spirit" (John 3:8).

  * All humans are born spiritually dead and are given a new, spiritual birth when they accept Jesus Christ as their Savior.
  * At the moment of the spiritual new birth, God's Holy Spirit begins to live in the believer and begins to empower the new believer to produce good spiritual fruit in his life.
  * It is God's work to cause a person to be born again and become his child.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * The state of being born again is also referred to as "rebirth" or "new birth" or "regeneration".
