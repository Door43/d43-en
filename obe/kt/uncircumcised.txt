====== uncircumcised, uncircumcision ======

===== Definition: =====


The terms "uncircumcised" and "uncircumcision" refer to the state of a male who has not been physically circumcised.

  * In the Old Testament, physical circumcision was required as a sign of being part of God's people, Israel. It was typically done on male babies eight days after birth. A male who has not had this procedure done is uncircumcised.
  * This term is also used figuratively. In the Bible, people who have an "uncircumcised heart" or who are "uncircumcised in heart" are people who are stubbornly disobedient to God and who are not his people.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * If a word for circumcision is used or known in the language, "uncircumcised" could be translated as "not circumcised" and "the circumcision" could be translated as "people who are not circumcised" or "Gentiles, who are not circumcised" or "people who do not belong to God."
  * Other ways to translate figurative senses of this term could include, "not God's people" or "rebellious like those who don't belong to God" or "people who have no sign of belonging to God."
