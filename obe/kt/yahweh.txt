====== Yahweh ======

===== Facts: =====

The term "Yahweh" is God's personal name that he revealed to Moses at the burning bush.

  * The name "Yahweh" comes from the word that means, "to be" or "to exist."
  * Possible meanings of "Yahweh" include, "he is" or "I am" or "the one who causes to be."
  * This name reveals that God has always lived and will continue to live forever. It also means that he is always present.
  * Many Bible versions in major languages (such as English, French, and Spanish) use the term "the LORD" to represent "Yahweh." For example, the literal text "I am Yahweh your God" is often translated as, "I am the LORD your God." The word is written with all capital letters to show respect for God's personal name.
  * For this reason, most Christians do not know that the literal term is "Yahweh" and so use the term "LORD" instead. Some churches strongly prefer using "LORD."
  * However, the ULB and UDB always translate God's personal name as "Yahweh," as it literally occurs in the Old Testament Hebrew text.
  * In the New Testament, the personal name "Yahweh" does not occur. In quotations from the Old Testament that include the Hebrew word Yahweh, the Greek text of the New Testament uses "Lord" instead. So the ULB and UDB also use Lord throughout the New Testament, since this is what the text literally says.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * "Yahweh" could be translated by a word or phrase that means "I am" or "living one" or "the one who is" or "he who is alive."
  * This term could also be written in a way that is similar to how "Yahweh" is spelled.
  * Note that it is best //not// to translate this term with "Jehovah," which is a word made by mixing the vowels of the Hebrew word, "Lord" with the consonants of "Yahweh."
