====== God ======

===== Facts: =====

In the Bible, the term "God" refers to the eternal being who created the universe out of nothing. He alone existed before anything else, and he will continue to exist forever. He is the only true God and has authority over everything in the universe.

  * God exists as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
  * God is perfectly righteous, infinitely wise, holy, sinless, just, merciful, and loving.
  * God is a covenant-keeping God, who always fulfills his promises.
  * People were created to worship God and he is the only one they should worship.
  * God has revealed his name as "Yahweh" which means, "he is" or "I am" or "the One who (always) exists."
  * The Bible also teaches about false "gods" which are idols that people worship.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * "God" could be translated with a word or phrase that means, "Deity" or "Creator" or "Supreme Being."
  * Other ways to translate "God" might include, "Supreme Creator" or "Infinite Sovereign Lord" or "Eternal Supreme Being."
  * Consider how God is referred to in a local or national language. There may also already be a word for "God" in the language being translated. If so, it is important to make sure that this word fits the characteristics of the one true God as described above.
  * Many translations refer to a false god using a small "g" and write God with a large "G" when referring to the one true God. Another option would be to use a different word to refer to the false gods.
