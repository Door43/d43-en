====== forsaken ======

===== Definition: =====

Forsaken is the act of abandoning another person or persons.

  * Just before Jesus dies on the cross, He cries out to God the Father saying, "My God! My God! Why have you forsaken me!", meaning that Jesus felt abandoned by God at that moment because all of the sin of the world was placed upon him by God.
