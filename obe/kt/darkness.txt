====== darkness ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "darkness" literally means an absence of light. There are also several figurative meanings of this term:

  * As a metaphor, "darkness" means "impurity" or "evil" or "spiritual blindness." It is the opposite of light.
  * Satan's dominion is called the kingdom of darkness.
  * Darkness refers to anything related to sin and moral corruption.
  * People who do not know God are said to be living in darkness, which means they do not understand or practice righteousness.
  * God is light (righteousness) and the darkness (evil) cannot overcome that light.
  * The place of punishment for those who reject God is referred to as "outer darkness," which may refer both to being without any physical light as well as being away from the righteousness of God.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * It is best to translate this term literally, with a word in the target language that refers to the darkness of a room with no light or to the time of day when there is no light.
  * For the figurative uses, it is also important to keep the image of darkness in contrast to light as a way to describe evil and deception in contrast to goodness and truth.
  * Some translations may prefer to use a phrase to explain this idea. One way to translate this could be, "...evil, like a dark place."
