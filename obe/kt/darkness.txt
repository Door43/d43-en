====== darkness ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "darkness" literally means an absence of light. There are also several figurative meanings of this term:

  * As a metaphor, "darkness" means "impurity" or "evil" or "spiritual blindness."
  * It also refers to anything related to sin and moral corruption.
  * The expression, "dominion of darkness" refers to all that is evil and ruled by Satan.
  * The term "darkness" can also be used as a metaphor for death. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * People who do not know God are said to be "living in darkness," which means they do not understand or practice righteousness.
  * God is light (righteousness) and the darkness (evil) cannot overcome that light.
  * The place of punishment for those who reject God is sometimes referred to as "outer darkness."

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * It is best to translate this term literally, with a word in the project language that refers to the absence of light. This could also be a term that refers to the darkness of a room with no light or to the time of day when there is no light.
  * For the figurative uses, it is also important to keep the image of darkness in contrast to light, as a way to describe evil and deception in contrast to goodness and truth.
  * Depending on the context, other ways to translate this could be, "darkness of night" (as opposed to "light of day") or "not seeing anything, like at night" or "evil, like a dark place".
