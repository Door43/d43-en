====== hail ======

===== Facts: =====

This term usually refers to a type of frozen precipitation that falls from the sky.

  * Hail comes down in the form of balls or chunks of ice. Usually the hailstones are small (a few centimeters wide), but there are also very large hailstones that are up to 20 centimeters wide and weighing over a kilogram.
  * The book of Revelation in the New Testament describes God's judgment on people, which will include enormous hailstones that weigh 50 kilograms.
  * Do not confuse this term with a word that is spelled the same but which is a kind of formal greeting in older English. This could be translated as "Greetings!"
  * The soldiers who placed a crown of thorns on Jesus' head mocked him by calling out to him, "Hail, king of the Jews."
  * Some older English versions of the Bible translate the angel Gabriel's greeting to Mary as "Hail, you whom God highly favors!" Many modern English versions instead begin this greeting with "Greetings," which is more natural in present-day English.
