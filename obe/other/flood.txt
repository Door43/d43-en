====== flood ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "flood" literally refers to a large amount of water that completely covers over the land. 

  * This term is also used figuratively to refer to an overwhelming amount of something, especially something that happens suddenly.
  * In Noah's time, people had become so evil that God caused a worldwide flood to come over the entire surface of the earth, even covering the mountaintops. Everyone who was not in the boat with Noah drowned. All other floods cover a much smaller land area.
  * This term can also be an action as in, "the land was flooded by river water."

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Ways to translate the literal meaning of "flood" could include, "an overflowing of water" or "large amounts of water."
  * The figurative comparison, "like a flood" could keep the literal term, or a substitute term could be used that refers to something that has a flowing aspect to it, such as a river.
  * For the expression "like a flood of water" where water is already mentioned, the word "flood" could be translated as "an overwhelming amount" or "an overflowing."
  * This term can be used as a metaphor as in, "do not let the flood sweep over me," which means "do not let these overwhelming disasters happen to me" or "don't let me be devastated by disasters" or "don't let your anger devastate me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * The figurative expression, "I flood my bed with tears" could be translated as "my tears soak my bed with water like a flood."
