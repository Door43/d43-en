====== reproach ======

===== Definition: =====

To reproach someone means to criticize or disapprove of that person's character or behavior. A reproach is the negative comment about the person.

  * Saying that a person is "above reproach" or "beyond reproach" or "without reproach" means that this person behaves in a God-honoring way and there is little or nothing that could be said in criticism of him.
  * The word "reproach" can also be translated as "accusation" or "shame" or "disgrace."
  * "To reproach" could also be translated as, "to rebuke" or "to accuse" or "to criticize," depending on the context.
