====== snare, trap ======

===== Definition: =====

The terms "snare" and "trap" refer to devices that are used to catch animals and keep them from escaping. Usually the snare or trap is hidden so that its prey is taken by surprise.

  * These terms are also used figuratively to refer to anything that traps or ensnares a person in a spiritual way.
  * A "snare" usually has a loop of rope or wire that suddenly pulls tight when an animal steps into it, ensnaring its leg.
  * A "trap" is often made of metal or wood and has two parts that close together rapidly and powerfully in order to catch some part of the animal's body in it so that it can't get away.
  * In the Bible, these terms are used figuratively to talk about how sin and temptation are like snares that trap people. 
  * The Bible says that Satan and evil people can place snares or traps to try to get people to sin.
  * The phrase "set a trap" means to get the trap ready to close in order to trap someone.
  * To "fall in a trap" refers to falling into a deep hole or pit that was dug and hidden in order to get someone to fall into it.
  * The comparison that is made in the figurative uses is that, like being caught in a trap or snare, giving in to sin or temptation often happens quickly and forcefully, and takes the trapped person by surprise.
  * Also, the result is very harmful to the person who is trapped or snared by a sin.
