====== declare, declaration ======

===== Definition: =====

The terms "declare" and "declaration" refer to making a formal or public statement, often to emphasize something.

  * A "declaration" not only emphasizes the importance of what is being proclaimed, but it also calls attention to the one making the declaration.
  * For example, in the Old Testament, a message from God is often preceded by, "the declaration of Yahweh" or "this is what Yahweh declares." This expression emphasizes that it is Yahweh himself who is saying this. The fact that the message comes from Yahweh shows how important that message is.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * The term "declaration" could also be translated as, "statement" or "proclamation."
  * The phrase, "this is Yahweh's declaration" could be translated as, "this is what Yahweh declares" or "this is what Yahweh says."
