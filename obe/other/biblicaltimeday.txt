====== biblical time: day ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "day" refers to a period of time lasting 24 hours.

  * For the Israelites and the Jews, a day began at sunset of one day and ended at sunset of the next day.
  * Sometimes the term "day" is used figuratively to refer to a longer period of time, such as the "day of Yahweh" or "judgment day" or "last days."
  * Some languages will have a different idiom for these concepts or will prefer to use nonfigurative language.
