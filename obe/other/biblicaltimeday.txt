====== biblical time: day ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "day" literally refers to a period of time lasting 24 hours beginning at sundown. It is also used figuratively.

  * For the Israelites and the Jews, a day began at sunset of one day and ended at sunset of the next day.
  * Sometimes the term "day" is used figuratively to refer to a longer period of time, such as the "day of Yahweh" or "last days."
  * Some languages will use a different idiom to translate these figurative uses or will translate "day" nonfiguratively.
  * Other translations of "day" could include, "time" or "season" or "occasion" or "event," depending on the context.
