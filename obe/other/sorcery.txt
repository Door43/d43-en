====== sorcery, sorcerer, witchcraft ======

===== Definition: =====

"Sorcery" or "witchcraft" refers to using magic, which involves doing powerful things through the help of evil spirits. A "sorcerer" is someone who does these powerful, magical things.

  * The use of magic and sorcery can involve beneficial things (such as healing someone), or harmful things (such as putting a curse on someone). But all kinds of sorcery are wrong, because they use the power of evil spirits.
  * In the Bible, God says that the use of sorcery is as evil as other terrible sins (such as adultery, worshiping idols, and child sacrifice).
  * The terms "sorcery" and "witchcraft" could also be translated as, "evil spirit power" or "black magic" or "casting spells."
  * The term "sorcerer" could be translated with a word or phrase that means, "worker of magic" or "person who casts spells" or "person who does miracles using evil spirit power."
  * Note that "sorcery" has a different meaning than the term "divination" which refers to attempting to contact the spirit world. Divination is another evil practice that God condemns.
