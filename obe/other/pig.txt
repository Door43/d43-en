====== pig, swine, pork ======


===== Definition: =====


A pig is a type of four-legged, hoofed animal that is raised for meat. Its meat is called "pork." The general term for pigs and related animals is "swine."


    * God told the Israelites not to eat pig meat and to consider it unclean. Jews today still view pigs as unclean and do not eat pork.
    * Pigs are raised on farms to be sold to other people for their meat.
    * There is a kind of swine that is not raised on farms but rather lives out in the wild; it is called a "wild boar." Wild boars have tusks and are considered to be very dangerous animals.
    * Sometimes large pigs are referred to as "hogs."
