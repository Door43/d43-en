====== wine ======


===== Definition: =====

Wine is a kind of fermented drink made from the juice of a fruit called grapes, which grow on vines. This term was also used to refer to grape juice that was not fermented.

    * To make wine, grapes are crushed so that the juice comes out. The juice eventually ferments and alcohol forms in it.
    * In Bible times, wine was the normal drink with meals. It did not have as much alcohol in it as present-day wine has.
    * Also, wine was often mixed with water before serving.
    * If wine is unknown in your culture, it could be translated as, "fermented grape juice" or, "fermented drink made from a fruit called grapes" or, simply "fermented drink."
