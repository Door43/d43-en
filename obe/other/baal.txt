====== Baal ======

===== Facts: =====

Baal was the name of a false god that was worshiped by several people groups in the land of Canaan.

  * The name "Baal" means "lord." The worship of Baal was therefore a direct challenge to the authority of Yahweh, who alone is the true Lord.
  * The worship of Baal included acts of prostitution and sometimes involved burning children as a sacrifice.
  * At different times, the Israelites sinned by also worshiping Baal.
  * During the reign of King Ahab, there were 450 prophets of Baal in the northern kingdom of Israel. The prophet Elijah challenged these prophets to a test, which proved that Baal does not exist and Yahweh is the only true God.
  * As a result, the people killed the prophets of Baal and turned back to worshiping Yahweh.
