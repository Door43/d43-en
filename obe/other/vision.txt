====== vision ======


===== Facts: =====

The term "vision" refers to something that a person sees. It especially refers to something unusal or supernatural that God shows people in order to give them a message.

    * Usually, visions are seen while the person is awake. However sometimes a vision is something a person sees in a dream while asleep.
    * God sends visions to tell people something that is very important. For example, Peter was shown a vision to tell him that God wanted him to welcome Gentiles.

===== Translation Suggestion =====

    * The phrase "saw a vision" could be translated as, "saw something unusual from God" or "God revealed to him something special."
    * Some languages may not have separate words for "vision" and "dream." So a sentence such as, "Daniel had dreams and visions in his mind" could be translated as something like, "Daniel was dreaming while asleep and God caused him to see unusual things."
