====== winepress ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Bible, a winepress was a place where the juice of grapes was extracted in order to make wine.

  * In Israel, winepresses were usually large, wide holes that were dug in the ground. Clusters of grapes were put on the flat bottom of the hole and people trampled the grapes to get the grape juice to flow out.
  * The term winepress is also used figuratively to refer to God's wrath being poured out on the nations.
