====== threshold ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "threshold" refers to the bottom part of a doorway or the part of a building that is just inside the door.

  * Sometimes a threshold is a strip of wood or stone that must be stepped over in order to enter a room or building.
  * Both a gate and the opening to a tent can also have a threshold.
  * This term should be translated with a term in the project language that refers to the place at the very entrance to a home that a person steps across.
  * If there is no term for this, "threshold" could also be translated as, "doorway" or "opening" or "entranceway," depending on the context.
