====== Jebusites ======

===== Facts: =====

The Jebusites were a tribe in the land of Canaan, who were descended from a man named Jebus.

  * Jebus conquered the ancient city of Jerusalem and named it after himself, so it was called "Jebus" for awhile. Later the name was changed back again.
  * Melchizedek, the priest-king in both the Old and New Testaments, was of Jebusite origin.
