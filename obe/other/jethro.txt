====== Jethro, Reuel ======

===== Facts: =====

The names Jethro and Reuel were both used to refer to the father of Moses' wife, Zipporah.

  * When Moses was a shepherd in the land of Midian, he met a Midianite man named Reuel, whose daughters were watering their sheep at a well there.
  * Moses married Zipporah, one of Reuel's daughters.
  * Many years later, Reuel, also called Jethro, met up with Moses as the Israelites were wandering from place to place in the wilderness.
  * At this point, Jethro is referred to as a priest.
  * Jethro gave Moses good advice about how to get others to help with the task of judging the affairs of the people.
  * The Old Testament records two other men with the name Reuel, including one of  Esau's sons. Some translators may decide to spell the name differently for each of these men, to make it clear that they were different people.
