====== kind ======

===== Definition: =====

When "kind" is a noun, it refers to a group or classification of things that are connected by shared characteristics.

  * A group or classification of plants or animals that share characteristics are called a "kind".
  * The main thing that distinguishes each "kind" as a separate group of animal or plant is that it can reproduce more of its same "kind".

  * There is a different English word that looks and sounds exactly the same, but is an adjective meaning to be caring and thoughtful toward others as in, "He is a kind person".
