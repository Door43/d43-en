====== kind, kinds ======

===== Definition: =====

The terms "kind" and "kinds" refer to groups or classifications of things that are connected by shared characteristics.

  * In the Bible, this term is specifically used to refer to the distinctive classifications of plants and animals that God made when he created the world.
  * Often there are many different variations or species within each "kind." For example, horses, zebras, and donkeys are all members of the same "kind," but they are different species.
  * The main thing that distinguishes each "kind" as a separate group is that members of that group can reproduce more of their same "kind."

===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * This term could be translated as "type" or "class" or "group" or "category."
  * The word "species" would //not// be an accurate translation of this term, since "kind" is a broader category with several species within it.

[Note: This term is not the word that is related to kindness.]
