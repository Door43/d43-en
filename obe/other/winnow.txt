====== winnow, sift ======

===== Definition: =====

The terms "winnow" and "sift" mean to separate grain from unwanted materials. In the Bible, both words are also used in a figurative sense to refer to separating or dividing people.

  * To "winnow" means to separate grain from the unwanted parts of the plant by tossing both the grain and chaff into the air, allowing the wind to blow the chaff away.
  * The word "sift" refers to shaking the winnowed grain in a sieve to get rid of any remaining unwanted materials, such as dirt or stones.
  * In the Old Testament, "winnow" and "sift" are used figuratively to describe hardship that separates the righteous people from the unrighteous people.
  * Jesus also used the term "sift" in this figurative way when he was telling Simon Peter about how he and the other disciples would be tested in their faith.
  * To translate these terms, use the words or phrases in the project language that refer to these activities; possible translations might be,  "shaking" or "fanning." If winnowing or sifting are not known, then these terms could be translated by a term that refers to a different method of separating grain from chaff or dirt, or by describing this process.
