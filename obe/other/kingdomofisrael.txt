====== kingdom of Israel ======


===== Facts: =====

After King Solomon died, the nation of Israel was divided into two kingdoms: the kingdom of Israel, which had ten tribes, and the kingdom of Judah, which had two tribes.

  * All the kings of the kingdom of Israel were evil. They influenced the people to  to serve idols and false gods. So God eventually sent the Assyrians to attack them and to take many of them away as captives.
  * The Assyrians brought foreigners to live with the few remaining people of the kingdom of Israel. These foreigners intermarried with the Israelites, and their descendants became the Samaritan people.
