====== trance ======

===== Definition: =====

A trance is a state of mind in which a person is awake but is not aware of what is around him because he is seeing and experiencing something else.

  * In the New Testament, this word describes the supernatural state of mind that Peter and Paul had when God spoke to them in a vision.
  * In each case, Peter and Paul were in prayer when they experienced a trance state.
  * God is the one who caused them to be in a trance.
  * The term "trance" is a different word from "vision" or "dream" and should be translated differently.
  * The expression "fell into a trance" means to "suddenly be in a sleeplike condition" while still awake.
