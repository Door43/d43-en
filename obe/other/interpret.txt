====== interpret, interpretation ======

===== Facts: =====

The terms "interpret" and "interpretation" refer to understanding and explaining the meaning of something that is not clear.

  * Often in the Bible these terms are used in connection with explaining the meaning of dreams.
  * When the king of Babylon had some confusing dreams, God helped Daniel to interpret them and to explain their meanings.
  * The "interpretation" of the dream is the "explanation" of the meaning of the dream. Sometimes this interpretation was written down.
  * In the Old Testament, God often revealed to people what would happen in the future. So the interpretations of those dreams were also prophecies.
  * The term "interpret" can also be used for figuring out the meaning of other things, such as interpreting what the weather is going to be like based on what is happening in the natural world.
