  * A "carved image" or "carved figure" is a wooden object that has been made to look like an animal, person, or thing.
  * A "cast metal figure" is an object or statue created by melting metal and pouring it into a mold that is in the shape of an object, animal, or person.
  * These wooden and metal objects were used in the worship of false gods.
  * The term "image" when referring to an idol could either refer to a wooden or metal idol.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * When referring to an idol, the term "image" could also be translated as "statue" or "engraved idol" or "carved religious object."
  * It may be more clear in some languages to always use a descriptive word with this term, such as "carved image" or "cast metal figure," even in places where only the term "image" or "figure" is in the original text.
  * Make sure it is clear that this term is different than the term used to refer to being in the image of God.
