===== Facts: =====

Abimelech was a Philistine king in the region of Gerar during the time when Abraham and Isaac were in the land of Canaan..

  * Abraham deceived King Abimelech by telling him that Sarah was his sister rather than his wife.
  * Abimelech took Sarah into his household, but returned her immediately when God appeared to him in a dream and rebuked him.
  * Abraham and Abimelech made an agreement regarding disputed ownership of wells at Beersheba.
  * Many years later, Abraham's son Isaac and his family settled in the region ruled by Abimelech.
  * Another man by the name of Abimelech is also mentioned in the Bible. Some translations may decide to change the spelling of his name slightly to make it clear that he is a different person from King Abimelech.
