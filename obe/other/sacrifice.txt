====== sacrifice, offering ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Bible, the terms "sacrifice" and "offering" refer to special gifts given to God as an act of worshiping him. People also offered sacrifices to false gods.

  * The word "offering" generally refers to anything that is offered or given. The term "sacrifice" refers to something that is given or done at great cost to the giver.
  * Offerings to God were specific things that he commanded the Israelites to give in order to express devotion and obedience to him.
  * The names of the different offerings, such as "burnt offering" and "peace offering," indicated what kind of offering was being given.
  * Sacrifices to God often involved the killing of an animal.
  * Only the sacrifice of Jesus, God's perfect, sinless Son, can completely cleanse people from sin. Animal sacrifices could never do that.
  * The figurative expression "offer yourselves as a living sacrifice" means, "live your life in complete obedience to God, giving up everything in order to serve him."


===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * The term "offering" could also be translated as "a gift to God" or "something given to God" or "something valuable that is presented to God."
  * The term "sacrifice" could also be translated as "thing given in worship" or "a special animal killed and presented to God" or "to kill an animal and give it to God."
