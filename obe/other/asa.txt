====== Asa ======

===== Facts: =====

Asa was a king who ruled over the kingdom of Judah for forty years, from 913-873 BC.

  * King Asa was a good king who got rid of many of the idols and the worship of false gods, restoring the worship of Yahweh.
  * Yahweh gave King Asa success in his warfare against other nations.
  * Later in his reign he made an alliance with Aram to help him in war against Israel, instead of trusting in Yahweh.
  * Because he stopped trusting Yahweh, he was inflicted with a disease which eventually killed him.
