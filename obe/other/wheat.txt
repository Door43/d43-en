====== wheat ======


===== Definition: =====


Wheat is a type of grass, or grain, that people grow for food.

    * The seeds grow at the top of the wheat plant.
    * After harvesting the wheat, the seed is separated from the stalk of the plant. This is called "threshing."
    * The stalk of the wheat plant, or straw, is often placed on the ground for animals to sleep on.
    * The small hulls that surround the seed are called "chaff." They are worthless and are thrown away.
    * People grind the seed into flour, and use this for making bread.
