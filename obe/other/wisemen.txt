  * Some wise men studied the stars and assigned meanings to the positions of the stars in the sky.
  * Wise men were often called on to interpret dreams. Daniel was one of King Nebuchadnezzar's wise men and god gave him the ability to interpret the king's dreams.
  * In some Mediterranean countries, wise men were seen as professional scholars.
  * Sometimes wise men were users of magic arts, such as divination or other activity that called on power from evil spirits.
  * In the New Testament, the group of men who came from eastern regions to worship Jesus are called "magi" or "wise men." It is very probable that these men were astrologers who studied the stars.
