====== wise men ======

===== Facts: =====

In the Bible, the phrase "wise men" often refers to men who serve God and act wisely, not foolishly. This is also a special term that refers to men with unusual knowledge and abilities who served as part of a king's court.

  * Sometimes the term "wise men" is explained in the text as "prudent men" or "men with understanding." This refers to men who act wisely and righteously because they obey God.
  * The "wise men" who served pharaohs and other kings were often scholars who studied the stars, especially looking for special meanings for the patterns that the stars made in their positions in the sky.
  * Often wise men were expected to explain the meanings of dreams. For example, King Nebuchadnezzar demanded that his wise men describe his dreams and tell him what they meant, but none of them was able to do this, except Daniel who had received this knowledge from God.
  * Sometimes wise men also performed magical acts such as divination or miracles that were done through the power of evil spirits.
  * In the New Testament, the group of men who came from eastern regions to worship Jesus were called "magi," which is often translated as "wise men" since this probably refers to scholars who served a ruler of an eastern country.
  * It is very probable that these men were astrologers who studied the stars. Some have thought that they may have been descendants of the wise men whom Daniel taught when he was in Babylon.
  * Depending on the context, the term "wise men" could be translated using the term "wise" or with a phrase such as, "gifted men" or "educated men" or some other term that refers to men who have an important job working for a ruler.
  * When "wise men" is simply a noun phrase, the word "wise" should be translated in the same or similar way to how it is translated elsewhere in the Bible.
