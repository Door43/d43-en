====== Meshech ======

===== Facts: =====

Meshech is the name of a son of Noah's son Japheth. A different person named Meshech was a grandson of  Noah's son Shem.

  * As with many names of people, later the Bible mentions a region of land called Meshech. It is probable that this land was named after one of the men with this name.
  * Some ways to make it clear that this name refers to different things would be to say (in the appropriate context), "the region called Meshech" or "another man named Meshech."
