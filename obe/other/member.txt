====== member ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "member" refers to one part of a complex body or group.

  * The New Testament describes Christians as "members" of the Body of Christ. Believers in Christ belong to a group that is made up of many members. 
  * Jesus Christ is the "head" of the Body and individual believers function as the members of the body. The Holy Spirit gives each member of the body a special role to help the entire body to function well.
  * Individuals who participate in groups such as the Jewish Council and the Pharisees are also called "members" of these groups.
