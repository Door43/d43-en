====== tunic ======


===== Definition: =====


In the Bible, the term "tunic" refers to a garment that was worn next to the skin, under other clothing.

    * A tunic reached from the shoulders down to the waist or knees and was usually worn with a belt. Tunics worn by wealthy people sometimes had sleeves and reached to the ankles.
    * Tunics were made of leather, haircloth, wool, or linen, and were worn by both men and women.
    * A tunic was normally worn under a longer over-garment, such as a toga or outer robe. In warmer weather a tunic was sometimes worn with no outer garment.
    * This term could be translated as "long shirt" or "long undergarment" or "shirt-like garment." It could also be written in a similar way to "tunic," with a note to explain what kind of clothing it was.
