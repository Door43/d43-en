===== Definition: =====

These terms refer to a special wooden chest, covered with gold, that was constructed for the purpose of holding the stone tablets on which the Ten Commandments were written.

  * This ark, or chest, was placed in the most holy place of the tabernacle (or later on, the temple).
  * God told the Israelites to put certain objects in this special chest to remind them of his covenant with them: the two stone tablets with the ten commandments written on them, Aaron's staff and a jar of manna.
  * When God desired to speak to Israel through Moses in the tabernacle, God's presence would appear over the ark of the covenant.
  * The term "ark of the covenant decrees" is literally "ark of the testimony." The "testimony" refers to the Ten Commandments, which bore witness to God's covenant with his people.
