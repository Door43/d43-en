====== Hezekiah ======

===== Definition: =====

Hezekiah was the 13th king over the kingdom of Judah. He was a king who trusted and obeyed God.

  * Unlike his father Ahaz who had been an evil king, King Hezekiah was a good king who destroyed all the places of idol worship in Judah.
  * One time when Hezekiah got very sick and almost died, he earnestly prayed that God would spare his life. God healed him and allowed him to live 15 more years.
  * As a sign to Hezekiah that this would happen, God did a miracle and caused time to move backwards.
  * God also answered Hezekiah's prayer to save his people from King Sennacherib of Assyria, who was attacking them.
