====== Judas the son of James ======

===== Facts: =====

  * Another man named Judas was Jesus' brother. He was also known as "Jude."
  * The New Testament book called "Jude" was probably written by Jesus' brother Judas, since he identifies himself as the "brother of James". James was another brother of Jesus.
