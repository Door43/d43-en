====== creature ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "creature" refers to all the living beings that God created, both humans and animals.

  * The prophet Ezekiel described seeing "living creatures" in his vision of the glory of God. He did not know what they were, so he gave them this very general label.
  * Note that the term "creation" has a different meaning since it includes everything God created, both living and nonliving things (such as land, water, and stars). The term "creature" only includes living things.

====== Translation Suggestions ======

  * Depending on the context, "creature" could be translated as, "being" or "living being" or "created being."
  * The plural, "creatures" could be translated as "all living things" or "people and animals" or "animals" or "human beings."
