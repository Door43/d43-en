====== sister ======

===== Definition: =====

A sister is a female person who shares at least one biological parent with another person.

  * In the New Testament, "sister" is also used figuratively to refer to a woman who is a fellow believer in Jesus Christ.
  * Sometimes the phrase, "brothers and sisters" is used to refer to all believers in Christ, both men and women.
  * In the Old Testament book, Song of Songs, "sister" refers to a lover or a spouse.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * It is best to translate this term with the literal word that is used in the target language to refer to a natural or biological sister, unless this would give wrong meaning.
  * Other ways to translate this could include, "sister in Christ" or "spiritual sister" or "woman who believes in Jesus" or "fellow woman believer."
  * If possible, it is best to use a family term.
  * If the language has a feminine form for "believer," this may be a possible way to translate this term.
  * When referring to a lover or wife, this could be translated using a feminine form of "loved one" or "dear one."
