====== barley ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "barley" refers to a kind of grain that is used to make bread.

  * The barley plant has a long stalk with a head at the top where the seeds or grains grow.
  * Barley does well in warmer weather so it is often harvested in spring or summer.
  * When barley is threshed, the edible seeds are separated from the worthless chaff.
  * Barley grain is ground up into flour, which is then mixed with water or oil to make bread.
  * If barley is not known, this could be translated as "grain called barley" or "barley grain."
