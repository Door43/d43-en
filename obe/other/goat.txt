====== goat, kid ======

===== Definition: =====

A goat is a medium-sized, four-legged animal which is similar to a sheep and is raised primarily for its milk and meat. A baby goat is called a "kid."

  * Like sheep, goats were important animals of sacrifice, especially at Passover.
  * Although goats and sheep can be very similar, these are some ways that they are different:
      * Goats have coarse hair; sheep have wool.
      * The tail of a goat stands up; the tail of a sheep hangs down.
      * A sheep usually like to stay with their herd, but goats are more independent and tend to wander away from the herd.
  * In Bible times, goats were often the main source of milk in Israel.
  * Goat skins were used for tent coverings and to make bags for holding wine.
  * In both the Old and New Testaments, the goat was used as a symbol for unrighteous people, perhaps because of their tendency to wander away from the one taking care of them.
  * The Israelites also used goats as symbolic sin bearers. When one goat was sacrificed, the priest would lay his hands on a second live goat and send it into the desert as a symbol of the animal bearing the people's sins.
