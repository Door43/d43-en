====== Zion, Mount Zion ======

===== Definition: =====

Originally, the term "Zion" or "Mount Zion" referred to a stronghold or fortress that King David captured from the Jebusites. Both these terms became other ways of referring to Jerusalem.

  * Mount Zion and Mount Moriah were two of the hills that the city of Jerusalem was located on. Later, "Zion" and "Mount Zion" became used as general terms to refer to both of these mountains and to the city of Jerusalem. Sometimes they also referred to the temple that was located in Jerusalem. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * David named Zion, or Jerusalem, the "City of David." This is different from David's hometown, Bethlehem, which was also called the City of David.
  * The term "Zion" is used in other figurative ways, to refer to Israel or to God's spiritual kingdom or to the new, heavenly Jerusalem that God will create.
