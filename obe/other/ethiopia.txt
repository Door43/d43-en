====== Ethiopia, Ethiopian ======

===== Facts: =====

Ethiopia was a country in Africa located just south of Egypt, bordered by the Nile River to the west and by the Red Sea to the east. A person who is from Ethiopia is called an "Ethiopian."

  * Ancient Ethiopia was located south of Egypt and included land that is now part of several modern-day African countries, such as Sudan, modern Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Uganda, Central African Republic, and Chad. 
  * In the Bible, Ethiopia is sometimes called "Cush" or "Nubia."
  * The countries of Ethiopia ('Cush') and Egypt were often mentioned together in the Bible, perhaps because they were located next to each other and their people may have had a similar ancestry.
  * God sent Philip the evangelist to a desert where he shared the good news about Jesus with an Ethiopian eunuch.
