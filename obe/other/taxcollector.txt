====== tax collector ======

===== Definition: =====

A "tax collector" was a government worker whose job was to receive money that people were required to pay the government in taxes.

  * In the time of Jesus and and the apostles, the Roman government required taxes from everyone living in the Roman empire, including the Jews.
  * The people who collected taxes for the Roman government would often demand more money from the people than the government required. The tax collectors would keep the extra amount for themselves.
  * Because tax collectors cheated people in this way, the Jews considered them to be among the worst of sinners.
  * The Jews also considered Jewish tax collectors to be traitors to their own people because they worked for the Roman government which was oppressing the Jewish people.
  * The phrase, "tax collectors and sinners" is a common expression in the New Testament, showing how much the Jews despised tax collectors.
