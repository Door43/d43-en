====== Nazirite, Nazirite vow ======

===== Facts: =====

A Nazirite in Old Testament times was a man who had taken the Nazirite vow, a vow that a man took to refrain from any drink or food made from grapes and not cut his hair for a certain length of time.

  * Chapter 6 of the Book of Numbers describes the vow and the fulfillment of the vow.
  * When the time period of refrain was complete, that is, the fullfillment of the vow, the Nazirite would present himself before the priest and provide an offering, including the cutting and burning of his hair.
