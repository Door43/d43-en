===== Facts: =====

Thorn bushes and thistles are plants that have prickly branches or flowers. These plants do not produce fruit or anything else that is useful.

  * A thorn is a hard, sharp growth on the branch or stem of a plant. A "thornbush" is a type of small tree or shrub that has many thorns on its branches.
  * A thistle is a plant with prickly stems and leaves. Often the flowers are purple.
  * Thorn and thistle plants multiply quickly and can cause other plants or crops to not be able to grow. This is a picture of how sin keeps a person from producing good spiritual fruit.
