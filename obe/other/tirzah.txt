====== Tirzah ======

===== Facts: =====

Tirzah was an important Canaanite city that was conquered by the Israelites. It was also the name of a daughter of Gilead, a descendant of Manasseh.

  * The city Tirzah was located in the region occupied by the tribe of Manasseh. It is thought that the city was about 10 miles north of the city of Shechem.
  * Years later, Tirzah became a temporary capital city of the northern kingdom of Israel, during the reigns of four kings of Israel.
  * Tirzah was also the name of one of Manasseh's grand-daughters who asked to be given a portion of the land, since they had no brothers to inherit it as would normally be the custom.
