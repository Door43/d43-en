====== honey, honeycomb ======

===== Definition: =====

Honey is the sweet, sticky, edible substance that honeybees make out of flower nectar. Honeycomb is the waxy frame where the bees store honey.

  * Depending on the variety, honey can be yellowish or brownish in color.
  * Honey is sometimes used figuratively to represent something that is sweet or very pleasurable. Something is said to be honey or is described as being sweet "like honey." (See also:  [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_Simile:Simile]], [[Metaphor]])
  * Honey can be found in the wild, such as in the hollow of a tree, or wherever the bees make a nest. People also raise bees in hives in order to produce honey to eat or sell, but probably the honey mentioned in the Bible was wild honey.
  * In order to regain strength for fighting a battle, Saul's son Jonathan ate wild honey he had found in the forest.
  * Samson once found honey inside the carcass of a dead lion.
  * John the Baptist ate locusts and wild honey while living in the desert.
