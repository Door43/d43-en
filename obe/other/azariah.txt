====== Azariah ======

===== Facts: =====

Azariah was the name of several men in the Old Testament. It means, "Yahweh has helped."

  * Azariah was one of many Israelites from Judah who were captured by Nebuchadnezzar's army and taken to live in Babylon. He is more well-known by his Babylonian name, Abednego.
  * Abednego and his friends obeyed God rather than worship the king. God showed his power and protection by rescuing them from a blazing furnace. God honored these Israelite young men by giving them positions of leadership in the Babylonian kingdom.
  * Azariah was another name for Uzziah king of Judah.
  * There was also an Old Testament priest named Azariah.
  * In the time of the prophet Jeremiah, there was a man named Azariah who wrongly urged the people to not stay in their homeland of Judah as God had commanded them to.
