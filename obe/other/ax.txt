====== ax ======


===== Definition: =====


An ax is tool used for cutting or chopping trees or wood. 

    * An ax usually has a long wooden handle with a large metal blade attached to the end.
    * If your culture has a tool that is similar to this, the name of that tool could be used to translate "ax."
    * Other ways to translate this term could be, "tree-cutting tool" or "wooden tool with blade."
    * In one Old Testament, the blade of an ax falls into the river so it is best if the tool that is described has a blade that can come off the wooden handle.
