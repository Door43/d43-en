====== biblical volume ======

===== Definition: =====

The following terms were the most common biblical units of volume used to explain how much a certain container could hold. The containers and measurements are given for both liquids (such as wine) and dry solids (such as grain).

|  Dry |  omer |  2.00 |  liters |
|  Dry |  ephah |  22.00 |  liters |

|  Dry |  seah |  7.70 |  liters |
|  Liquid |  metrete |  40.00 |  liters |

How to translate units of volume in the Bible:

  - Keep the Bible term, spelling it in a way that is similar to the way it sounds or is spelled in the Bible. [See Transliterate]
  - An important reason for keeping the Bible terms is to show that the Bible is true and that people actually used these units of measure during that time period.
  - If it doesn't work to use the Bible term, then instead, state the equivalent amount using a unit of measure that is known.
  - These methods could be combined, using the Bible term, but then also giving the equivalent amount in the text or a note.

**measure** \\ 
Sometimes the Hebrew does not specify a particular unit of volume but only uses a number. In these cases, many English versions, and the ULB and UDB, add the word "measure." For example in Haggai 2:16 it has, "twenty (measures) of grain" and "fifty (measures) of wine."

Translation suggestions when the unit of measure is implied:
  - Translate literally, using the number without giving a unit.\\
  - Use a generic word like "measure" or "quantity" or "portion." \\ 
  - Use the name of an appropriate container, such as "basket" for grain and "jar" for wine. \\ 
  - Use a unit of measure that you are already using in your translation.
