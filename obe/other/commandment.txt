====== commandment ======

===== Definition: =====

A commandment is a formal, lasting order or rule from God that tells people what he wants them to do.

  * Commandments are given by someone who has authority, and those who are under that authority must obey them.
  * A commandment may say what people must do (“You must honor your father and mother”) or what they must not do (“You must not steal.)
  * Althought this term can have the same meaning as "command," the word "commandment" is usually a more formal and long-lasting ordinance, given by God.
