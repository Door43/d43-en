====== Kedesh ======

===== Facts: =====

Kedesh was a Canaanite city that was taken over by the Israelites when they entered the land of Canaan.

  * This city was located in the northern part of Israel, in the portion of land that was given to the tribe of Naphtali.
  * Kedesh was one of the cities that was chosen as a place where the Levite priests could live, since they did not have any land of their own.
  * It was also set apart as a "city of refuge."
