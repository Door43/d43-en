====== biblical time: hour ======

===== Definition: =====

The term **hour**  is often used in the Bible to tell more specifically what time a certain event took place.

  * The Jews counted daylight hours starting at sunrise (around 6 a.m.). For example, “the ninth hour” meant “around three in the afternoon.”
  * Nighttime hours were counted starting at sunset (around 6 p.m.). For example, “the third hour of the night” meant “around nine in the evening” in our present-day system..
  * Since references to time in the Bible will not correspond exactly to the present-day time system, phrases such as “around nine” or “about six o'clock” could be used.    
  * Some translations might add phrases like "in the evening" or "in the morning" or "in the afternoon" to make it clear what time of day is being talked about.
