====== command, to command, commandment ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "to command" means to order someone to do something. A "command" or "commandment" is what the person was ordered to do.

  * Although these terms have basically the same meaning, "commandment" often refers to certain commands of God which are more formal and permanent, such as the "Ten Commandments."
  * A command can be positive ("Honor your parents") or negative ("Do not steal").
  * To "take command" means to "take control" or "take charge" of something or someone.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * It is best to translate this term differently from the term, "law." Also compare with the definitions of "decree" and "statute."
  * Some translators may prefer to translate "command" and "commandment" with the same word in their language.
  * Others may prefer to use a special word for commandment that refers to lasting, formal commands that God has made.
