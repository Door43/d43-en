====== Greek, Grecian ======

===== Facts: =====

The term "Greek" refers to the language spoken in the country of Greece.  Greek was also spoken throughout the Roman Empire. The term "Grecian" means "Greek-speaking."

  * Since most non-Jewish people in the Roman Empire spoke Greek, Gentiles are often referred to as "Greeks" in the New Testament, especially when contrasted with Jews.
  * The phrase "Grecian Jews" referred to Jews who spoke Greek in contrast to the "Hebraic Jews" who spoke only Hebrew, or perhaps Aramaic.
  * Other ways to translate "Grecian" could include, "Greek-speaking" or "culturally Greek" or "Greek."
  * When referring to non-Jews, "Greek" could be translated as "Gentile."
