====== dove, pigeon ======

===== Definition: =====

Doves and pigeons are two kinds of small, gray-brown birds that have similar characteristics.


  * Some languages have two different names for them, while others use the same name for both.
  * Doves and pigeons were used in sacrifices to God, especially for people who could not afford to buy a larger animal.
  * A dove brought the leaf of an olive tree to Noah when the flood waters were going down.
  * Doves sometimes symbolize purity, innocence, or peace.
  * If doves or pigeons are not known in the language area where the translation is being done, this could be translated as "a small grayish brown bird called a dove" or "a small gray or brown bird, similar to a (name of local bird)".
  * In verses that use both names, for example talking about bringing a pigeon or a dove for a sacrifice, two different words for birds should be used, if possible.
