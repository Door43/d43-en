====== biblical time: year ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Bible, the term "year" literally refers to a period of time that lasts about 354 days. This is according to the lunar calendar system which is based on the phases of the moon.

  * A year in the modern-day solar calendar lasts 365 days divided into 12 months, based on the amount of time it takes for the earth to travel around the sun.
  * In both calendar systems a year has 12 months. But an extra month is sometimes added to the year in the lunar calendar to make up for the fact that a lunar year is 11 days less than a solar year. This helps keep the two calendars more in line with each other.
  * When the term "year" is used literally in the Bible, it is referring to a lunar year of 354 days.
  * The term "year" is also used in a figurative sense to refer to a general time when a special event takes place. Examples of this include, "the year of Yahweh" or "in the year of drought" or "the favorable year of the Lord." In these contexts, "year" could be translated as "time" or "season" or "time period."
