====== judge ======

===== Definition: =====

A judge is a person who decides what is right or wrong when there are disputes between people, usually in matters that pertain to the law.

  * In the Bible, God is often referred to as a judge because he is the one perfect judge who makes the final decisions about what is right or wrong.
  * After the people of Israel entered the land of Canaan and before they had kings to rule them, God appointed leaders called "judges" to lead them in times of trouble. Often these judges were military leaders who rescued the Israelites by defeating their enemies.
  * The term "judge" could also be called "decision-maker" or "leader" or "deliverer" or "governor," depending on the context.
