====== Herod the Great ======


===== Facts: =====

There are several rulers named Herod in the Bible. Herod the Great was a non-Jew who was ruling Judea at the time Jesus was born.

    * Caesar Augustus had named him King Herod and he ruled over the Jews in Judea for 33 years.
    * Herod the Great was known for the beautiful buildings he ordered to be built, including the rebuilding of the Jewish temple in Jerusalem.
    * He was cruel and had many people killed. When he heard that a "king of the Jews" had been born in Bethlehem, he had all the baby boys there killed.
    * His sons, Herod Antipas and Herod Philip, and his grandson Herod Agrippa later became rulers in Judea. His great-grandson Herod Agrippa II (called "King Agrippa") also ruled over the entire area of Judea.
