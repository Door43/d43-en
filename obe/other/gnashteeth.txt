====== gnash teeth, grind teeth ======

===== Definition: =====

To gnash or grind the teeth means to clench the teeth and scrape them back and forth against each other. This often shows extreme pain or anger.

  * The Bible tells us that gnashing teeth is one thing those in hell will do in their terrible distress.
  * If your culture does not associate grinding the teeth with anger, it can be translated as “grinding of teeth in anger.” Or you could use a way that people express anger in your culture, such as “stomping your feet” or “clenching your teeth” or “snarling.”
