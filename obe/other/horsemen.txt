===== Definition: =====

In Bible times, the term "horsemen" often referred to men who rode horses into battle.

  * Horses were used to pull chariots and carts.
  * The people of Israel, however, did not maintain a large number of horsemen.
  * They believed that the use of horses in battle was a pagan custom that placed too much emphasis on power for victory rather than on Yahweh.
