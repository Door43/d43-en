Antioch was the name of two cities in the New Testament. One was in Syria, near the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. The other was in Pisidia, near the city of Colosse.

  * The local church at Antioch of Syria and was the first place where believers in Jesus were called "Christians." The church there was also active in sending out missionaries to reach the Gentiles.
  * Paul, Barnabas and John Mark traveled to Pisidian Antioch to share the gospel. Some Jews from other cities came there to stir up trouble and tried to kill Paul. But many other people, both Jews and Gentiles, listened to the teaching and believed in Jesus.
