====== Dan ======

===== Facts: =====

Dan was the fifth son of Jacob and was one of the twelve tribes of Israel. Dan was also the name of the region settled by the tribe of Dan in the northern part of Canaan.

  * During the time of Abram, there was also a city named Dan located west of Jerusalem. This city probably did not exist during the time the nation of Israel entered the promised land, but a different city of Dan was located about 60 miles north of Jerusalem.
  * The term, "Danites" refers to the descendants of Dan, who are also members of his clan.
