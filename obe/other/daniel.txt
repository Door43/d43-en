  * Daniel was an honorable and righteous young man who obeyed God.
  * God gave Daniel ability to interpret several dreams or visions for the Babylonian kings.
  * Because of this ability and because of his honorable character, Daniel was <font 14px line-height: 13.066666603088379px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>given a high leadership position within Babylon.</font>
  * Many years later, Daniel enemies tricked the Babylonian king Darius into making a law forbidding the worship of anyone except the king. Daniel continued to pray to God, so he was arrested and thrown into a den of lions. But God rescued him and he was not harmed at all.
