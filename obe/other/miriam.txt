====== Miriam ======

===== Facts: =====

Miriam was the older sister of Aaron and Moses.

  * When she was young, Miriam was instructed by her mother to watch over her baby brother Moses who was in a basket among the reeds of the Nile River. When the pharaoh's daughter found the baby and needed someone to take care of him for her, Miriam cleverly brought her mother to do it.
  * When the Israelites escaped from the Egyptians and crossed the Red Sea, Miriam led the Israelites in a dance of joy and thanksgiving.
  * Years later as the Israelites were wandering in the desert, Miram and Aaron were not happy that Moses had married a Cushite woman and began speaking badly about him.
  * Because of her rebellion in speaking against Moses, God caused Miriam to become sick with leprosy. But later God healed her when Moses interceded for her.
