====== storehouse ======

  * In the Bible a "storehouse" was usually used to store extra grain and other food to be used later when there was a shortage of food because of famine. 
  * A "storehouse" was sometimes used as a way of building wealth in a family.
  * This term is also used figuratively to refer to all the good things that God wants to give to his people.
  * The storehouses of the house of Yahweh contained the valuable things that had been taken from conquered enemies and were dedicated or consecrated to Yahweh. These things were being saved to help repair the temple. Sometimes this is translated as "treasures."
