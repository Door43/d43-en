==== At the beginning of the first poetic passage in every chapter where needed: ====

**General Information:** - Jeremiah often wrote prophecy in the form of poetry. Hebrew poetry uses different kinds of parallelism. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

==== "This is Yahweh's declaration": ==== 

**this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])

==== "The word of Yahweh came": ====

**New** Notes Templates for **"The word of Yahweh came to [audience ... ] (saying)"**  -  
  * When writing notes, please replace "[audience]" with "me" or "Jeremiah."
  * When the audience is a pronoun, I prefer to word the AT differently than I would with a name. I think that should be ok. ("gave a message to Jeremiah" vs "gave me a message") 
  * The ellipsis in the first template represents an adverbial phrase. Don’t use the ellipsis if there is no adverbial phrase. If there is an adverbial phrase, put it into the snippet and ATs. (You can shorten the adverbial phrase by using its first and last words with an ellipsis in between.) 
  * When you write your notes, please do not end a snippet or AT with an ellipsis, and do not put any punctuation immediately before or after an ellipsis. 
  * After the six note templates, there is an example of how to write the AT in such a way that the ellipsis does not come at the end.

The note below is for when it does not introduce a message. It just announces that it happened. \\

  * Here is an example from Jeremiah [[:en:bible:notes:jer:36:27|36:27]] of how to write a note when an adverbial phrase follows the audience. I replaced [audience] with Jeremiah, and put the first and last words of the adverbial phrase in the snippet and ATs. Because this has the adverbial phrase, I did not just say "This idiom" because the adverbial phrase is not part of the idiom.

==== "The house of": ====

**the house of Israel**\\ 
There are two notes, because sometimes it refers to all of Israel's descendants, and sometimes it refers only to the kingdom of Israel made up of the ten northern tribes.

**1) the house of Israel** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house. In this case it refers to Israel's descendants. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:02:04|2:4]]. AT: "the Israelites" or "the Israelite people group" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

</code>


==== "As Yahweh lives": ====

**As Yahweh lives** - The ULB of 4:2 now has the same wording, so we can send the translators back to 4:2.

**As Yahweh lives** - "as surely as Yahweh is alive." The people use this expression to show that what they say next is certainly true. This is a way of making a solemn promise. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:04:01|4:2]]. AT: "I solemnly swear" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])

==== "days are coming" ====
Please replace [X] with the first word or first few words after "when."

  * **days are coming ... when [X]** - Future time is spoken of as if the "days are coming." Translate this metaphor as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:07:31|7:32]]. AT: "in the future ... [X]" or "there will be a time ... when [X]" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

<code>

</code>

Jeremiah 47:4 is the only occurrence of "the day is coming that." Its note can be similar.
