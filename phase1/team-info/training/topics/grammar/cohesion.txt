====== Cohesion ======

Cohesion in writing helps draw a reader further along in the text. Material that is written cohesively keeps the attention of the reader and increases understanding. Cohesion helps a reader understand how sentences relate to one another and the topic overall. While the foundation of cohesion in writing is clear, orderly thinking, there are techniques that increase cohesion.

Specific words and phrases that join sentences are common tools for increasing cohesion. Simple joining of sentences is typically done with a conjunction (e.g. and, but, or). (e.g. We went to the store, but John forgot his wallet.)

The use of sequencing or time order is another method to build cohesion; this includes such words as: next, then, first and second. (e.g. We went to his work first, and then we returned to our house.)

Providing visual cues with location words assists readers in moving through passages; this may be combined with other techniques as you saw in the previous example.

Cause and effect (i.e. consequently, therefore), comparison and contrast (i.e. in the same manner, instead) and conclusion (i.e. in summary, accordingly) are other typical techniques for building cohesion.

An expanded list of 'joining' words is given below. The use of transition words and conjunctions will help you build cohesion in your completed translation project.

//**CONJUNCTIONS:**// and, but, or, for, nor, yet, so, if only, then, since, whenever, while, unless, because

//**TRANSITION WORDS**//: specifically, chiefly, in the beginning, following, in conclusion, to summarize, as a result, moreover
