====== Parallelism ======

**Parallelism ** is the expression of one idea in two or more different ways. Parallelism is most commonly found in the book of Psalms and Proverbs but is found throughout the whole of the Hebrew Bible.

There are several reasons for parallelism in poetry:

  * Emphasizes something of great importance.
  * Much of the Hebrew text was sung and poetic writing is easier to sing.
  * Poems and songs are easier to memorize than straight texts.
  * The Hebrew writers believed that if something is worth saying, it is worth saying 'beautifully.'

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path.**  Psalms 119:105 \\ This can be written as: Your word is a lamp to my feet and your word is a light for my path. \\ Both 'lamp' and 'light' are parallel because they mean the same thing. The words 'my feet' and 'my path' also mean the same thing.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * When a parallelism is used in poetry, a sermon, or prophecy, either keep the parallelism, or use your own culture's way of emphasizing the point in poetry, sermons, and prophecies.
  * When the parallelism is used in a story (a narrative text), either keep the parallelism or use your own culture's way of emphasizing the point in narrative.
