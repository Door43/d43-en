====== Leader Response to Team Member Edits ======

The team leaders should following the edits and Discussion comments of the team members as they work on their pages. The team leader will often see things that they would like to correct or update. There are three ways to do that:

  - change the text
  - add a Discussion comment
  - contact the member directly (email, phone, Skype)

There may be occasions where it is efficient for the team leader to fix something, but in general, we prefer that the team leaders reserve their actually editing of the page for the review phase. Instead, the leaders should usually put their feedback into the Discussion so that the entire team can benefit from the comments, and that it can become a "teachable moment."

There will, perhaps, be times when the leader may feel that correcting something that a team member has done should not be done in view of the entire group. In those cases, it is preferred that the team leader contact the team member directly and individually.
