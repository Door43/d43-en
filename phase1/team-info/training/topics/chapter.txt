====== Chapter Links ======

The links in the pages are a bit confusing. They look like this:

<code>
https://pad.door43.org/p/en-ulb-luk-08
</code>

They are computer-generated. The one at the top of the content page is the link to the previous chapter. I've been working with them a while, and sometimes the even cause me to think I am in the wrong chapter.

The way to be sure is the look at the URL in your browser window at the top of the screen.

<code https://pad.door43.org/p/en-ulb-luk-09>

</code>

Also, the first thing on the page right below the previous chapter link will be a code such as __GESHI_QUOT__\c 8__GESHI_QUOT__ which is the Bible-publishing code that identifies this as chapter 8.

__GESHI_OPEN__code> \c 8

There is also another link at the very bottom of the content page that goes to the next chapter.
