====== See how you translated this ... ======

We often see a phrase repeated throughout a book. It would be good if the translators would translate that phrase consistently. So rather than write a note explaining the phrase each time it occurs, we prefer to direct the translators to see how they they translated it before. 

If the idea in the phrase is pretty simple, they may be able to keep translating it the way they translate it the first time. We can give them a link to that verse.

But if the idea is new to their readers, the translators might take more words to explain it the first time. The second time the phrase occurs, they should see how they translated it the first time, and then they might then shorten the phrase for the second occurrence. When it occurs again, they should see how they translated it the second time. So it would be good for us to give links to that.

==== UPDATE December 2016 ====
  * Please also include the explanation from the original note.\\ 
  * Please do not write "See how this is translated in 1:15." People may wonder which version you want them to look at.

**be fruitful and multiply** - This is God's blessing. He told Noah and his family to produce more humans like themselves, so that there would be many of them. The word "multiply" explains how they are to be "fruitful." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:28|1:28]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])


**That person must be cut off from his people** - A person being excluded from his community is spoken of as if he had been cut off from his people, as one would cut a piece of cloth or cut a branch from a tree. This can be translated in active form. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:07:19|7:20]]. AT: "that person may no longer live among his people" or "you must separate that person from his people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])


If there is no explanation on the first note, the phrase "See how you translated" should be changed to "Translate this as you did in."

**Yahweh of Hosts** - Translate this as you did in 1:24.


If the phrase is similar but not quite the same, the note can be modified. 

**to say only what Yahweh puts in my mouth** - The message is spoken of as if it is something that God put into his mouth. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:num:22:38|22:38]]. AT: "to say only what Yahweh wants me to say" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
