  - Clarifying translation - (optional)
  - **Explanation** - the meaning of the ambiguity unless clear in the alternate translation
  - **Alternate translation** - ways to translate the text, with or without the ambiguity, if not clear in the UDB
  - **TA link** - unless already in the notes for the chunk

  * **(1) ULB text**  - **(3)** Explanation. **(4)** Alternate translation. **(5)** (See: Ambiguity)


===== Bible Examples =====

Field reference numbers are included for clarity purposes only. They are omitted in the actual note.

=== 1 John 1:9===

"But if we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us."

  * **(1) he...him...his**  - **(3)** These pronouns are probably referring to Jesus, but they may refer to God the Father. **(4)** It is best to leave the pronouns ambiguous if your language will allow it. **(5)** (See: Ambiguity)
