====== Order of Events ======

===== Description =====

In English, events are not always told in the order in which they occurred. Sometimes the author may need to discuss something that happened at an earlier time. The English language does this by using different tenses or time words such as 'yesterday', 'last year' or 'before that.' Other languages clearly state the order of events to avoid confusion.
