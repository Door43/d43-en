See: [[:en:phase1:team-info:training:quick-reference:template]]

===== General Principles for Formatting Notes: =====

  * **Select a portion** from the ULB (Unlocked Literal Bible) that needs a note and copy it in bold, preceded by a bullet under "Translation Notes." The portion should be long enough to make the context clear for a targeted word or phrase. 
  * **Write a note** that will aid the translator. Put double quote marks around any part of it that can be used in place of the portion selected. Words inside quotation marks must fit the context of the ULB exactly. Do not use bold or italics in place of quote marks.
  * **Multiple occurrences** If there are multiple occurrences of the targeted word in a "chunk" of verses, which have the same meaning throughout, copy the first one and then explain that all occurrences have the same meaning. 
  * **Multiple wordings** If there is more than one possible replacement wording, separate them with the word "or."
  * **Sentence explanation** Write a sentence explanation if needed. It is preferred that all full sentences start with a capped word rather than the portion with a lowercased word, but starting with the lowercased first word of the portion is allowed. Example: //Here "fear God" means to respect God.// Or: //"fear God" means to respect God.// All alternate translations (ATs) need an explanation.
  * **Important Terms list** As a rule, notes on words that are already in the Important Terms list are not needed. But if an important term has multiple senses, you may need to write a note telling which sense is meant in the text.
  * **Translation Academy** Refer the translators to a pertinent Translation Academy page, if needed, at the end of the note. Example: //(See: Metaphor)//. Translation Academy links (tA links) topics and formatting may be found here: [[:en:phase1:team-info:training:reviewers:talinks]]. Be sure that every link includes an initial colon. If this colon is missing, then global searches are hindered.
  * **Quote marks** Avoid smart (curved) quote marks. Be careful about copying and pasting text from an external source (Notepad, Word, or even from another chunk). This may create "smart" quotes that hinder the system from working correctly. Make sure the quotation marks you see in edit mode are straight up and down and not curved at all.
  * **See above for the basic template regarding punctuating notes.** Multiple (two or more) types of notes on one portion demand that a period follow each one: (1) **ULB Text**  - **(2)**  Clarifying translation. **(3)**  Text meaning. **(4)**  Alternate translation suggestion **(5)**  (See: Translation Academy Topic)

  * Examples of notes:
    * "X"
    * "X" or "Y" 
      * **matters** - "reports" or "true stories" 
    * "X" or "Y" (ta-link)
        * **before God** - "in God's sight" or "in God's opinion" (See: Idiom) 
    * AT: "X" or "Y" 
        * AT: "You evil, poisonous snakes!" or "You are evil like poisonous snakes"
    * ...AT: "X" or "Y" 
      * **servants of the message** - You may need to specify what the message is. AT: "had served God by telling people his message" or "had taught people the good news about Jesus" (See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information)
    * "X." AT: "Y" (See: TA-LINK) 
      * **looked at me with favor** - "to look at" is an idiom that means to treat or to deal with. AT: "regarded me kindly" or "had pity on me" (See: Idiom)


===== Formats for Specific Types of Notes: =====

There are several ways to write translation notes. We would like them to fit into one of the following formats, so we can easily train the translators and so they will recognize the purpose of each note.

=== Definitions ===

Simple definitions of words or phrases can be added without quotes or sentence format. Note no period is needed at the end of such notes.

  * **marketplace**  - a large, open-air area where people would come to sell their goods
  * **flute**  - a long, hollow musical instrument that is played by blowing air in or over one end
  * **kings' palaces**  - a large, expensive house that a king lives in
=== Explanations ===

Simple explanations about words or phrases should be in full-sentence format.

  * **washing their nets**  - They were cleaning their fishing nets in order to use them again to catch fish.
  * **motioned**  - They were too far from shore to call, so they made gestures, probably waving their arms.
  * **behold** - The word "behold" alerts us to a new person in the story.
  * **the gospel of the kingdom** - Here "kingdom" refers to God's rule as king. 

=== Synonyms and Equivalent Phrases ===

Synonyms and equivalent phrases should simply be written in double quotes. They do not need to be full sentences and should not normally be punctuated. However, if they are followed by another sentence, they should have a final period to set them off from the following sentence (see last example).

  * **the way**  - "the path" or "the road"
  * **He went out**  - "Moses went out"
  * **feared God**  - "revered God" or "had reverence for God"
  * **in the spirit and power of Elijah** - "with the same spirit and power that Elijah had." The word "spirit" either refers to God's Holy Spirit or to Elijah's attitude or way of thinking. Make sure that the word "spirit" does not mean ghost or evil spirit.

=== Alternate Translation(s) ===

"Alternate Translations" are translation suggestions that have a different structure or that appear to have different content from the ULB. We give these suggestions because translators of some languages may not be able to use the structure in the ULB, or they may need to make certain information clear. All occurrences of "AT" need an explanation.

First give a reason for the alternate translation so that the MTT can understand why it is acceptable. For example, when you come across an active/passive note, add "This can be stated in active form." Then write "AT:"  followed by the translation and the TAlink to Active/Passive. The need for alternate translations include making information explicit, changing passive voice to active, explaining metaphors, stating rhetorical questions as statements, and more. Note the punctuation mark (period, exclamation point, or question mark) following the AT in these examples below occurs in order to show the change needed in the actual text substitution.

  * **see the salvation of God**  - This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "salvation" is expressed as the verb "save." AT: "learn about how God saves people from sin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Follow me**  - When Jesus said this, he meant more than walk behind me for a little bit. He was telling the man to be his disciple. AT: "Be my disciple" or "Come, follow me as your teacher" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **do likewise**  - "do the same thing." What Jesus was referring to when he said "do likewise" can be stated clearly. AT: "give food to someone who does not have any" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **And you—why do you violate the commandment of God for the sake of your traditions?** - Jesus answers with a question to criticize what the religious leaders do. AT: "And I see that you refuse to obey God's commands just so that you can follow what your ancestors taught you!" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **How is it that you do not understand that I was not speaking to you about bread?** - Jesus uses this question to rebuke the disciples. AT: "You should have understood that I was not really speaking about bread." (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * Here the question mark remains but with a different interpretation explained: **What is it that they are testifying against you?** - The chief priest is not asking Jesus for information about what the witnesses said. He is asking Jesus to prove what the witnesses said is wrong. AT: "What is your response to what the witnesses are testifying against you?"
  * **Your hands were not bound. Your feet were not shackled** - These two sentences express similar ideas. They can be combined into one sentence. AT: "You were in no way a criminal in prison" or "You were completely innocent of doing wrong" (See: Parallelism)



=== Translation Suggestion from the UDB ===

If the UDB provides a good translation that clarifies what is in the ULB, it is normally not necessary to include a note. However, on occasion it may be helpful to write a note or translation suggestion and also include text from the UDB, depending on the perceived need for clarity. In that case, append "(UDB)" after the text from the UDB 

  * **implored him**  - "begged him" or "pleaded with him" (UDB)
  * **he fell on his face**  - "he bowed down to the ground" (UDB) or "he knelt and touched the ground with his face"
  * **the sons of Heth**  - "the descendants of Heth" (UDB). AT: "the Hittites" (See: Translate Names)
  * **you will conceive in your womb and bear a son...Jesus...the Son of the Most High** - Mary will bear a son who will be called the Son of the Most High (UDB).

Please do not write notes that only say "See UDB."

=== Alternate Meaning(s) ===

Alternate meanings refer to different understandings of what the phrase means. In this case, prefix the meanings with "Possible meanings are" and number (use number followed by a right parenthesis) them with the preferred meaning first, which would be the meaning used in the ULB and/or UDB.

If the meaning is given as an explanation, do not put it in quotes.

  * **You are like a young lion...like a monster in the seas**  - Possible meanings are 1) he was like a lion and a monster or 2) he thought he was like a lion, but he was really only a monster.
  * **like a monster in the seas**  - Possible meanings are 1) he was powerful or 2) he was not doing anything important.

If the meaning is given in a way that can be used as a translation suggestion, put it in quotes:

  * **fell down at Jesus' knees**  - Possible meanings are 1) "bowed down at Jesus' feet" or 2) "lay down on the ground at Jesus' feet" or 3) "knelt down before Jesus." Peter did not fall accidentally. He did this as a sign of humility and respect for Jesus.

=== Numbers: Cardinals and Ordinals ===

  * **Cardinal numbers** under ten are normally written out in running text:
    * zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
  * **Cardinal numbers** of ten or over are normally written as numerals in running text:
    * 10; 23; 250; 3,250
  * **Cardinal numbers** with five or more digits should have commas inserted at multiples of 1,000:
    * 10,000; 23,000; 500,300; etc.
  * Exceptions to this rule:
    * mention of chapter and verse, where a numeral is always used: “in chapter 3, …”  “in verses 2-4.” Also, when a number begins a sentence, it is always spelled out: “Five hundred men …” 
    * the number "twelve" or "eleven" is used as a title. Such as "the twelve apostles," "the twelve," or "the eleven."

  * **Ordinal numbers** are always written out:
    * first, second, third, forth, fifth, sixth, seventh, etc.
  * If the number is large, usually a numeral is used followed by letters (not superscripted): 122nd or 1,000th. 


=== Ellipsis "..." ===

  * Ellipses in our notes are written as three periods "...".
  * We insert one space on each side of the ellipses and text.
    * He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. becomes in the note **He who ... worthy of me**
  * Sentences that are short probably do not need ellipses in the notes.
  * As a rule, do NOT end a quote/portion with an ellipsis.
    * "<del>**I completely understand ... **</del>" This is incorrect. Do not use ellipses this way!
  * When you need to include the final punctuation for showing contrast in the alternate translation add the final word before the punctuation.
  * Example: Jesus said to them, "Why are you afraid, you of little faith?" The note would be written: 
    * **Why are you afraid ... faith?** - Jesus was rebuking the disciples with this rhetorical question. AT: "You should not be afraid ... faith!" or "There is nothing for you to be afraid of ... faith." (See: Rhetorical Question).
    * The question mark in the original text is replaced by a period or an exclamation point in the alternate translation.
     
=== Identify Figures of Speech ===

When writing a note to identify and explain a figure of speech, use full sentences and then put the alternate translation in quotes, as usual.

  * **Make ready the way of the Lord**  - This phrase compares people preparing themselves for the arrival of the Lord to people who are repairing a road for someone to use it. AT: "Repent and be ready for when the Lord comes" (See: Metaphor)
  * **You offspring of poisonous snakes**  - Jesus uses this expression to emphasize how dangerous the Pharisees are. Poisonous snakes are dangerous and represent evil. AT: "You evil, poisonous snakes!" or "You are evil like poisonous snakes" (See: Metaphor)

  * **Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness** - Here "full" is an exaggeration and the word "mouths" here represents the people's thoughts. AT: "Much of what people say is harmful and meant to hurt other people" (See: Hyperbole and Synecdoche)

If there is a Translation Academy page that deals with a figure of speech, you can include it in the note. You can see the list of topics at: [[:en:ta:ta-topics|translationAcademy Topics]]

  * Refer to tA topics by writing, for example, "(See: Metonymy)" or "(See: Exclusive)" at the end of the note. You can see these at [[:en:ta:ta-topics|translationAcademy Topics]].

=== Indirect to Direct Quote ===

When adding the option for a direct quote, preface the alternate translation with "This can be translated as a direct quote:" followed by the new phrase.

  * **to tell no one**  - This can be translated as a direct quote: "Do not tell anyone." The implied information is "that you have been healed." (See: Direct and Indirect Quotes and Making Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information Explicit)

=== Explanation of Source Language ===

In general, we want to downplay the original languages because most of the notes users will not have had any training in them. This does not mean we avoid the content. Rather, we should look for simple ways to express it. When possible, use plain-language explanations in English.

  * **sinful man**  - The word here for "man" means "adult male" and not the more general "human being."
  * **Master**  - The word that is translated here as "Master" is not the normal word for "Master." This one refers to someone who has authority and not to someone who owns someone else. AT: "Boss" or "Foreman"

=== Multiple Notes on Long Phrases ===

Sometimes we need notes for a phrase or sentence and separate notes for portions of it. In that case, we list the larger phrase first, and its parts afterward, unless there is a compelling reason to reverse them.

  * **you say, 'Behold, he is a gluttonous man**  - This can be translated as an indirect quote: "you say that he is a gluttonous man" or "you accuse him of being a gluttonous man."
  * **he is a gluttonous man**  - "he is a greedy eater" or "he habitually eats too much food"

=== Repeated Phrases in a Book ===

Sometimes a phrase is used multiple times in a book. We can make it easier for the translators by reminding them of where they have already translated that phrase so they can now translate it the same way. We point them back to notes only in the book they are working on.

  * **be fruitful and multiply** - See how you translated these commands in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:28|1:28]].
  * **everything that creeps along the ground** - This includes all types of small animals. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:24|1:25]].
  * **will be blessed in him** - AT: "will be blessed because of Abraham" or "will be blessed because I have blessed Abraham" 
  * **in him** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:12:01|12:3]].

=== Connecting Statement & General Information ===

There are two special types of notes that concern information in the chunk. Not every chunk will contain these. They are **Connecting Statement:**  and **General Information:**.

  * **Connecting Statement:**  - This is a note that relates the current chunk to the overarching discourse. When present, it must be the first note and separated by a line space from the rest of the notes, unless there is also a general information note following it. There is only one connecting statement used per chunk, when needed.
  * **General Information:**  - This is a note that addresses other discourse topics not mentioned in the connecting statement. General information notes can occur alone or immediately following the connecting statement and are separated by a line space from the rest of the notes. There can be one or more general information notes in a chunk.

<code>
  * **Connecting Statement:** - [explanation]
  * **General Information:** - [explanation]
  [blank line]
  * **[Phrase]** - [Explanation]
</code>

  * **Connecting Statement:**  - Luke explains why he is writing to Theophilus.
