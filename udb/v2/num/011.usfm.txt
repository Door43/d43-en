\c 11
\s1 Yahweh sent fire because the people complained
\p
\v 1 One day the people complained to Yahweh about their troubles. When Yahweh heard what they were saying, he became angry. So he sent a fire which burned among the people at the edge of their camp.
\v 2 Then the people cried out to Moses prayed to Yahweh. Then the fire stopped burning.
\v 3 So they called that place Taberah, which means 'Burning,' because the fire from Yahweh had burned among them.
\s1 Seventy leaders were chosen to help Moses
\p
\v 4 Then some troublemakers from other people-groups who were traveling with the Israelites began to want better food. And when they started complaining the Israelite people also started to complain.
\v 5 They said, "We wish we had some meat!
\v 6 We remember the fish that we ate while we were in Egypt, fish that was given to us without cost. And we had all the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic that we wanted. But now we do not have any desire to eat, because all we have to eat is this manna!"
\p
\v 7 The manna resembled small white seeds.
\v 8 Each morning the people would go out and gather some from the surface of the ground. Then they made flour by grinding it or pounding it with stones. Then they added water and boiled it in a pot, or they made flat cakes with it and baked them. The cakes tasted like bread that was baked with olive oil.
\v 9 Each night the manna came down on their ground where their tents were, like dew from the sky.
\p
\v 10 Moses was also very perturbed.
\v 11 He?
\v 12 I am not their father.?
\v 13 Where can I get meat to feed to all these people? They keep complaining to me, saying, 'Give us some meat to eat!'
\v 14 I cannot carry all these people's burdens by myself! They are like a heavy load to me , and I cannot carry this very heavy load anymore.
\v 15 If you intend to act like this toward me, kill me now. If you are really concerned about me, be kind to me and kill me to end my misery of trying to take care of them!"
\p
\v 16 Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Summon seventy men whom you know are leaders among the Israelite people. Tell them to stand with you in front of the Sacred Tent.
\v 17 I will come down and talk with you there. Then I will take some of the power of my Spirit that you have, and I will put that power on them also. They will help you to take care of some of the things that the people are concerned about, in order that you will not need to do it alone.
\p
\v 18 Furthermore, say to the people, 'Make yourselves acceptable to me, and tomorrow you will have meat to eat. You were complaining, and Yahweh heard you when you were saying, "We want some meat to eat. We had better food in Egypt!" Now Yahweh will give you some meat, and you will eat it.
\v 19 You will eat meat not only for one or two days, or only for five or ten or twenty days.
\v 20 You will eat meat every day for one month, and then you will loathe."~'~"
\p
\v 21 But Moses
\v 22 Even if we killed all the sheep and cattle, that would not !"
\v 23 But Yahweh said to Moses have no power? You will now see if I can do what I say I will do."
\p
\v 24 So Moses gathered together the seventy leaders and told them to stand around the Sacred Tent.
\p
\v 25 Then Yahweh came down in the cloud that was above the tent and spoke to Moses, but they did that only once.
\p
\v 26 Two of the leaders whom Moses.
\v 27 So a young man ran and told Moses, "Eldad and Medad are prophesying where all their tents are!"
\p
\v 28 Joshua, who had helped Moses since he was a young man, said, "Sir, tell them to stop doing that!"
\p
\v 29 But Moses. I wish that Yahweh would give the power of his Spirit to all of them!"
\v 30 Then Moses tents.
\p
\v 31 Then Yahweh sent a strong wind from the sea. It blew quail into the area all around the camp, and caused the quail to fall onto the ground. They were piled up on the ground about 3 ft. high!
\v 32 So the people went out and gathered up the quail all that day, and all that night, and all of the following day. It seemed as though everyone gathered at least fifty bushels! They spread the quail out on the ground all around the camp, so that the quail would lose their moisture.
\v 33 Then they cooked them and started to eat them. But while they were still eating the meat  on them, and many people died.
\v 34 The people who died and were buried were the ones who had said they wanted to eat meat like they had formerly eaten in Egypt. So they called that place Kibroth-Hattaavah, which means 'graves of those who craved.'
\p
\v 35 From there, the Israelites continued walking east until they arrived at Hazeroth town, where they stopped and stayed for a long time.
