\c 7
\s1 The offerings brought to the Sacred Tent
\p
\v 1 When Moses also dedicated the things that are inside the tent, and the altar for burning sacrifices, and all the things that would be used at the altar.
\v 2 Then the leaders of the twelve Israelite tribes, the same men who had helped Aaron and Moses to count the men who could fight in battles,
\v 3 came to the tent, bringing gifts to Yahweh. They brought six sturdy carts and twelve oxen, one ox from each of the leaders and a cart from each of the two leaders.
\p
\v 4 Then Yahweh said to Moses,
\v 5 "Accept these gifts, in order that the descendants of Levi can use them for carrying the sacred items that are here at the Sacred Tent."
\p
\v 6 So Moses took the carts and oxen and gave them to the descendants of Levi.
\v 7 He gave two carts and four oxen to the descendants of Gershon for their work,
\v 8 and he gave four carts and eight oxen to the descendants of Merari for their work. Aaron's son Ithamar was the supervisor of all their work.
\v 9 But he did not give any carts or oxen to the descendants of Kohath, because they took care of the sacred items that were to be carried on their shoulders, not on carts.
\p
\v 10 On the day that the altar was dedicated , the twelve leaders brought other gifts to be dedicated and put them in front of the altar.
\v 11 Yahweh said to Moses, "Each of the next twelve days one leader should bring his gifts for the dedication of the altar."
\p
\v 12-83 These are the gifts that each of the leaders brought:
\pi —a silver dish that weighed more than 3 pounds, both of which were full of good flour and mixed with olive oil to be grain offerings; they both were weighed using the standard scales;
\pi —a small gold dish that weighed 4 ounces, filled with incense;
\pi —a young bull, a full-grown ram, and a one year-old ram, to be sacrifices completely burned on the altar;
\pi —a goat to be sacrificed to remove people's guilt for their sins;
\pi —and two bulls, five full-grown rams, five male goats, and five rams that were one year-old, to be sacrifices to restore the people's fellowship with Yahweh.
\p This was the order in which the leaders brought their gifts:
\pi on the first day, Nahshon from the tribe of Judah brought his gifts;
\pi on the next day, Nethanel from the tribe of Issachar;
\pi on the next day, Eliab from the tribe of Zebulun;
\pi on the next day, Elizur from the tribe of Reuben;
\pi on the next day, Shelumiel from the tribe of Simeon;
\pi on the next day, Eliasaph from the tribe of Gad;
\pi on the next day, Elishama from the tribe of Ephraim;
\pi on the next day, Gamaliel from the tribe of Manasseh;
\pi on the next day, Abidan from the tribe of Benjamin;
\pi on the next day, Ahiezer from the tribe of Dan;
\pi on the next day, Pagiel from the tribe of Asher;
\pi on the next day, Ahira from the tribe of Naphtali.
\p
\v 84-88 When the altar was dedicated to Yahweh, those twelve leaders brought these gifts:
\pi —twelve silver plates and twelve silver bowls, weighing a total of about sixty pounds, each of them weighed on the scales kept in the Sacred Tent;
\pi —twelve gold dishes filled with incense, weighing a total of about 3 pounds, each weighed on those same scales;
\pi —twelve bulls, twelve full-grown rams, and twelve one year-old rams, to be sacrifices that were completely burned, along with the grain offerings;
\pi —twelve goats to be sacrificed to take away the guilt of the people's sins;
\pi —and twenty-four bulls, sixty full-grown rams, sixty goats, and sixty rams that were one year-old, to be sacrifices to restore the people's fellowship with Yahweh.
\p
\v 89 Whenever Moses heard Yahweh's voice speaking between the two images of creatures with wings that were above the lid of the sacred chest.
