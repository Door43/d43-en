\v 52 you must force all the people who live there to leave. Destroy all their carved statues and all their idols made of metal. Wreck all the places where they worship their idols.
\v 53 Take their land from them and start to live there, because I have given their land to you for you to own.
\p
\v 54 Divide up the land by throwing lots to decide which group will get which area. Give the larger areas to the groups that have more people, and give the smaller areas to the groups that have fewer people. Each tribe will receive its own land.
\v 55 If you do not force the people who live there to leave, they will cause you to have much trouble. They will be like sharp hooks in your eyes, and like thorns in your sides. And they will bring trouble to you, in that land where you will be living.
\v 56 And then I will punish you, as I had planned to punish them.'~"
