\c 1
\s1 The people God is pleased with
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh is pleased with those who do not do what the  wicked people advise them to do,
\q2 and who do not imitate the behavior of  of sinful people,
\q1 and who do not join with people who ridicule God.
\q1
\v 2 Those whom God is pleased with delight in doing the things that Yahweh has instructed us to do.
\q2 They read and think about Yahweh's requirements every day and every night.
\q1
\v 3 They constantly produce things that please God
\q2 just like fruit trees that have been planted along the banks of a stream produce fruit at the right time every year.
\q1 Like trees that never wither,
\q2 they succeed in everything that they do.
\b
\q1
\v 4 But wicked people are not like that!
\q2 Wicked people are as worthless as chaff
\q2 that is blown away by the wind.
\q1
\v 5 Therefore, wicked people will not be acquitted when God judges people,
\q2 and furthermore, sinful people will not even be present when God gathers righteous people together,
\q1
\v 6 because Yahweh guides and protects righteous people,
\q2 but the path that the wicked walk on leads them to where they will be destroyed by God forever.
