\c 42
\s1 A psalm written by one of the descendants of Korah for the choir director
\q1
\v 1 Deer desire to drink water from a stream of cool water.
\q2 In the same way , God, I need you very much.
\q1
\v 2 I desire to have fellowship with  you, the all-powerful God.
\q2 I say to myself, "When will I be able to go back to the temple in Israel
\q2 and worship in your presence again?"
\q1
\v 3 Every day and every night I cry;
\q2 the only thing I have to drink is my tears;
\q1 and while I do that, my enemies are continually asking me,
\q2 "Why does your god not help you?"
\q1
\v 4 I am very distressed [IDI] as I remember
\q2 when I went with the crowd of people to the temple in Jerusalem,
\q2 leading them as we walked along;
\q1 we were all shouting joyfully and singing to thank God for what he had done;
\q2 we were a large group who were celebrating.
\b
\q1
\v 5 So I say to myself, "Why am I sad and discouraged?
\q1 I confidently expect God to bless me,
\q2 and again I will praise him,
\q2 my God, the one who saves me."
\b
\q1
\v 6 But now, Yahweh, I am very discouraged [IDI],
\q2 so I think about you.
\q1 You are there in Israel where the Jordan River rushes down from the bottom of Hermon Mountain and Mizar Mountain.
\q1
\v 7 But here, the great sorrow that I feel is like water that you send down ;
\q2 it is like a waterfall that tumbles down and floods over me.
\b
\q1
\v 8 I desire that  Yahweh will show me each day that he faithfully loves me,
\q2 in order that each night I will  sing to him
\q2 and pray to him, the God who causes me to live.
\b
\q1
\v 9 I say to God, who is like a huge rock under which I can hide ,
\q1 "Why have you forgotten me, with the result that I <mourn
\q1
\v 10 They make fun of me constantly;
\q2 they continually ask, "Why does your god not help you?" 
\q1 And when they insult me like that,
\q2 it is like wounds that shatter my bones.
\b
\q1
\v 11 But I say to myself,
\q2 "Why am I sad and discouraged?
\q1 I will confidently expect God to bless me,
\q2 and I will praise him again,
\q2 my God, the one who saves me."
