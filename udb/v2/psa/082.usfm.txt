\c 82
\s1 A psalm written by Asaph
\q1
\v 1 God gathers all the rulers and judges who think they are gods for a meeting in heaven;
\q2 and he tells them that he has decided this:
\q1
\v 2 "You must  stop judging people unfairly;
\q1 you must no longer make decisions that favor wicked people!
\qr (Think about that!)
\q1
\v 3 You must defend people who are poor and orphans;
\q2 you must act fairly toward those who are needy and those who have no one to help them.
\q1
\v 4 Rescue them from the power !"
\b
\q1
\v 5 Those rulers do not know or understand anything!
\q2 They are very corrupt,
\q2 and as a result of their corrupt behavior,
\q2 it is as though the foundation of the world is being shaken!
\b
\q1
\v 6 I previously said to them, "You think you are gods!
\q1 It is as though you are all my sons,
\q1
\v 7 but you will die like people do;
\q2 your lives will end, like the lives of all rulers end."
\b
\q1
\v 8 God, arise and judge everyone on  the earth,
\q2 because all the people-groups belong to you!
