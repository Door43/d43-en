\c 131
\s1 A psalm written by David for people going up to the temple to worship
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, I am not proud
\q2 and I have not thought highly about myself.
\q1 And I do not worry about things that you have done that are very big or very wonderful.
\q1
\v 2 Instead, I am calm and peaceful in my inner being,
\q2 like a small child who lies quietly at its mother's breast .
\q2 In the same way, I am peaceful within my inner being.
\b
\q1
\v 3 You my fellow Israelites, confidently expect that Yahweh will do good things for you,
\q2 now and forever!
