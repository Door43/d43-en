\v 1 Everyone in the world should shout joyfully to Yahweh!
\q2

\v 3 We should acknowledge that Yahweh is God;
\q2 it is he who made us, and so we belong to him.
\q2 We are the people that he takes care of ;
\q2 we are like sheep that are cared for by their shepherd.

\q1
\v 4 Enter the gates of his temple thanking him;

\q2 and is faithful.
