\s1 A psalm written by David for the choir director

\v 1 Only foolish people say to themselves, "There is no God!"
\q1 People who say those things are corrupt deeds;
\q2 there is not one of them who does what is good.
\b

\v 2 Yahweh looks down from heaven and sees humans;
\q1 he looks to see if anyone is very wise,
\q2 with the result that he desires to know God.
\q1
\v 3 But they are all corrupt;
\q2 no one does what is good.
\b
\q1
\v 4 Will those evil people never learn what God will do to punish them ?
\q1 They act violently toward Yahweh's people while eating the food that he provides),
\q2 and they never pray to Yahweh.
\q1
\v 5 But some day they will become very terrified
\q2 because God helps those who act righteously and will punish those who reject him.
\q1
\v 6 Those who do evil may prevent helpless people from doing what they plan to do,
\q2 but Yahweh protects them .
\b
\q1
\v 7 I wish and rescue us Israelite people!
\q2 Yahweh, when you bless your people again,
\q2 all of us Israelite people, who are the descendants of Jacob, will rejoice.
