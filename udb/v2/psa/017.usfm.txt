\c 17
\s1 A psalm written by David
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, listen to me while I plead with you to act justly toward me.
\q2 Hear me while I call out to you to help me.
\q1 Pay attention to what I say while I pray
\q2 because I am speaking .
\q1
\v 2 You are the one who is able to declare that I am innocent
\q2 because you see that I am telling the truth.
\b
\q1
\v 3 You know what I think, even at night;
\q2 you have examined what I say and do,
\q1 and you know that I have determined to never tell any lies.
\q1
\v 4 I have not done like others do;
\q2 I have always done what is right [IDI],
\q1 and I have not acted cruelly toward others.
\q1
\v 5 I have always done what you told me to do [IDI],
\q2 I have never failed to do those things.
\b
\q1
\v 6 O God, I pray to you because you answer me;
\q2 please listen  to what I am saying.
\q1
\v 7 Show me that you faithfully love me.
\q2 By your great power  you to protect them from their enemies.
\q1
\v 8 Protect me as carefully as people protect their own eyes;
\q2 protect me like birds protect their babies under their wings .
\q1
\v 9 Do not allow wicked people to attack me;
\q2 my enemies surround me, wanting to kill me.
\b
\q1
\v 10 They never pity [IDI] anyone,
\q2 and they are always boasting.
\q1
\v 11 They have hunted for me and found me.
\q2 They surround me, watching for an opportunity to throw me to the ground.
\q1
\v 12 They are like lions  that are ready to tear apart the animals that they capture;
\q2 They are like young lions that are hiding, waiting to pounce on some animal.
\b
\q1
\v 13 Yahweh, arise and oppose my enemies and defeat them!
\q2 With your sword, save me from those wicked people!
\q1
\v 14 Yahweh, by your power  rescue me from those people who are interested only in things here in this world.
\b
\q1 But you provide plenty of food for those whom you love dearly;
\q2 their children also have many things that their grandchildren will inherit.
\q1
\v 15 Yahweh, because I act righteously, I will some day see you .
\q2 When I awake, I will see you face-to-face, and then I will be happy.
