\c 61
\s1 A psalm written by David for the choir director, to be accompanied by musical instruments
\q1
\v 1 God, listen to me,
\q2 and answer my prayer .
\q1
\v 2 While I am discouraged and far from my home,
\q1 I am calling out to you.
\b
\q1 Lead me to a place that will be like a high rock 
\q2 on top of which I will be safe.
\q1
\v 3 You have been my refuge;
\q2 you have been like a strong tower 
\q2 in which I am safe from being attacked by my enemies.
\b
\q1
\v 4 Allow me to live close to your temple all during my life !
\q1 Allow me to be safe , like a little bird is safe under its mother's wings.
\qr (Think about that!)
\q1
\v 5 God, you heard me when I solemnly promised to give offerings to you;
\q2 you have given to me the blessings that belong to those who have an awesome respect for you .
\b
\q1
\v 6 I am the king of Israel;
\q1 please allow me to live and rule for many years,
\q2 and allow my descendants to rule also.
\q1
\v 7 Allow us to rule forever while you observe us;
\q2 watch over us while you faithfully love us and do for us what you promised.
\b
\q1
\v 8 If you do that, I will always sing to praise you 
\q2 while I offer to you each day the sacrifices that I promised to give to you.
