\c 129
\s1 A psalm written for people going up to the temple to worship
\q1
\v 1 I say that my enemies have afflicted me ever since I was young.
\q1 Now I request you, my fellow Israelites, to repeat those same words:
\q1
\v 2 "Our enemies have afflicted us since our nation began,
\q2 but they have not defeated us!
\q1
\v 3 Our enemies struck us with whips that cut into our backs 
\q2 like a farmer uses a plow to cuts deep furrows into the ground."
\q1
\v 4 But Yahweh is righteous,
\q2 and he has freed me from being a slave  of wicked people.
\b
\q1
\v 5 I wish will be ashamed because of being defeated.
\q1
\v 6 I hope that they will be of no value, like grass that grows on the roofs of houses
\q2 that dries up and does not grow tall;
\q1
\v 7 as a result no one cuts it and puts it in bundles and carries it away to thatch a roof with it.
\q1
\v 8 People who pass by and see men harvesting grain usually greet them by saying to them,
\q2 "We wish that Yahweh will bless you!"
\q1 But this will not happen to those who hate Israel
\q2 because they will not harvest any grain.
\q1 We, acting as Yahweh's representatives, bless you Israelites!
