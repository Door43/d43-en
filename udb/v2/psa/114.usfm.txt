\c 114
\q1
\v 1 When the Israelite people left Egypt,
\q1 when they who were descendants of Jacob left people who spoke a foreign language,
\q2
\v 2 the land of Judah became the place where people worshiped God;
\q2 and Israel became the land  that he ruled over.
\b
\q1
\v 3 When they came to the Red Sea,
\q1 it was as though the water saw them and ran away!
\q1 When they came to the Jordan River,
\q2 that water in the river stopped flowing so that the Israelites could cross it.
\q1
\v 4 When they came to Sinai Mountain and there was a big earthquake,
\q2 it was as though the mountains skipped like goats do
\q2 and the hills jumped around like lambs do.
\b
\q1
\v 5 If someone asks, "What happened at the Red Sea that caused the water to run away?
\q1 What happened that caused the water in the Jordan River stop flowing?
\q1
\v 6 What happened that caused the mountains to skip like goats
\q2 and caused the hills to jump around like lambs?"
\b
\q1
\v 7 I would reply that it was the presence of the Lord that caused those things to happen!
\q1 Everyone!
\q1
\v 8 He is the one who caused pools of water for the Israelite people to drink from to flow from a rock,
\q2 and who caused a spring to flow from a solid rock cliff!
