\c 8
\s1 A psalm written by David for the choir director, to be accompanied by a stringed instrument
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, our Lord, people all over the world know that you  are very great!
\q2 Your glory reaches up higher than the heavens!
\q1
\v 2 You have taught little children and infants to praise you;
\q2 they cause your enemies and those who try to get revenge on you to be silent.
\q1
\v 3 When I look up at the sky at night,
\q2 and see the things that you have made—
\q2 the moon and the stars that you have set in place—
\q1
\v 4 it is amazing to me that  you think about people,
\q2 that you are concerned about us humans!
\q1
\v 5 You made the angels in heaven to be only a little more important than we are;
\q2 you caused us to be like kings !
\q1
\v 6 You put us in charge of everything that you made;
\q2 you gave us authority over all things—
\q1
\v 7 the sheep and the cattle,
\q2 and even the wild animals,
\q1
\v 8 the birds, the fish,
\q2 and everything else that swims in the seas.
\q1
\v 9 Yahweh, our Lord,
\q2 people all over the world know that you  are very great!
