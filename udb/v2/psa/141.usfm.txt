\c 141
\s1 A psalm written by David
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, I call out to you;
\q2 please help me quickly!
\q1 Listen to me when I am calling to you.
\q1
\v 2 Accept my prayer as though it was incense being burned as an offering  to you.
\q2 And accept me while I lift up my hands to pray to you
\q2 like you accept sacrifices that are offered to you in the evening .
\b
\q1
\v 3 Yahweh, do not allow me to say  things that are wrong
\q2 as a sentry to enter a door of a building.
\q1
\v 4 Prevent me from wanting to do anything that is wrong,
\q2 and from joining with wicked men when they want to do evil deeds .
\q1 Do not even allow me to share in eating delightful food with them!
\b
\q1
\v 5 It is all right if righteous people strike me or rebuke me
\q2 because they are trying to act kindly toward me to teach me to do what is right,
\q1 but I do not want wicked people to honor me by anointing my head with olive oil;
\q2 I am always praying that you will punish them because of the wicked deeds that they do.
\b
\q1
\v 6 When their rulers are thrown down from the top of rocky cliffs,
\q2 people will know that what you, Yahweh, said about them is true.
\q1
\v 7 Like a log that is split and cut into small pieces ,
\q2 their shattered bones will be scattered on the ground near other graves.
\b
\q1
\v 8 But Yahweh God, I continue to request that you help me.
\q2 I request you to protect me;
\q2 do not allow me to die now!
\q1
\v 9 It is as though people have set traps for me;
\q2 protect me from falling into those traps,
\q2 It is as though they have spread nets to catch me;
\q2 keep me from being caught in those nets.
\q1
\v 10 I wish that wicked people will fall into the traps they have set to catch me
\q2 while I escape from them.
