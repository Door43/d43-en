\c 63
\s1 A psalm written by David when he was in the desert in Judea
\q1
\v 1 God, you are the God whom I worship.
\q1 I greatly desire to be with you
\q2 like [SIL] a person in a dry hot desert greatly desires some water.
\b
\q1
\v 2 So, I want to see you in your temple;
\q1 I want to see that you are great and glorious.
\q1
\v 3 Your constantly loving us is worth more than my life,
\q2 so I  will always praise you.
\q1
\v 4 I will praise you all the time that I live;
\q2 I will lift up my hands to you while I pray.
\q1
\v 5 Knowing you satisfies me more than [IDI, MET] eating a very big feast,
\q2 so I will praise you while I sing  joyful songs.
\b
\q1
\v 6 While I lie on my bed, I think about you.
\q1 I think about you all during the night,
\q1
\v 7 because you have always helped me,
\q2 and I sing joyfully knowing that I am protected by you
\q2 as a little bird is protected under its mother's wings .
\q1
\v 8 I cling to you;
\q2 and your hand protects me.
\b
\q1
\v 9 But those who are trying to kill me
\q2 will die and descend into the place of the dead;
\q1
\v 10 they will be killed in battles 
\q2 and their corpses will be eaten by jackals dogs.
\b
\q1
\v 11 But I, the king of Israel, will rejoice in what God has done;
\q2 and all those who ask God  to curse them if they do not do what they solemnly promise will praise him,
\q2 but he will not allow liars to say anything.
