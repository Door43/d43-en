\c 140
\s1 A psalm written by David
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, rescue me from being attacked by evil men;
\q2 and even more, keep me safe from being attacked by violent people.
\q1
\v 2 They are always planning to do evil things
\q2 and they are always inciting people to start quarrels.
\q1
\v 3 By what they say  they injure people like poisonous snakes do;
\q2 the words that they speak  do.
\qr (Think about that!)
\b
\q1
\v 4 Yahweh, protect me from the power  of wicked people.
\q2 Keep me safe from violent men who plan to ruin.
\q1
\v 5 It is as though proud people have set a trap for me;
\q2 it is as though they have spread their nets to catch me;
\q2 it is as though they have put these things along the road to catch me.
\qr (Think about that!)
\b
\q1
\v 6 I say to you, "Yahweh, you are my God;"
\q2 so listen to me while I cry out to you to help me.
\q1
\v 7 Yahweh, my Lord, you are the one who defends me strongly;
\q2 you have protected me during battles  as though you had put a helmet on my head.
\q1
\v 8 Yahweh, do not give to wicked people the things that they desire,
\q2 and do not allow them to do the evil things that they plan to do.
\qr (Think about that!)
\b
\q1
\v 9 Do not allow my enemies to become proud;
\q2 cause the evil things that they say  they will do to me to happen to them, instead.
\q1
\v 10 Cause burning coals to fall on their heads!
\q2 Cause them to be thrown into deep pits, from which they cannot climb out!
\q1
\v 11 Do not allow those who slander others to succeed;
\q2 cause evil things to happen to violent men and destroy them!
\b
\q1
\v 12 Yahweh, I know that you defend those who are oppressed,
\q2 and that you do what is just.
\q1
\v 13 Righteous people will surely thank you ,
\q2 and they will live in your presence.
