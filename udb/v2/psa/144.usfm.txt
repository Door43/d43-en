\c 144
\s1 Written by David
\q1
\v 1 I praise Yahweh, who is like a huge rock under which I get refuge!
\q1 He trains my hands so that I can use them to fight battles;
\q2 he trains my fingers so that I can shoot arrows in a war.
\q1
\v 2 He is the one who protects me;
\q2 he is like a fortress  in which I am safe,
\q2 he protects me like shields protect soldiers ,
\q2 and he gives me refuge.
\q1 He defeats other nations and then puts them under my power.
\b
\q1
\v 3 Yahweh, we people are very insignificant?
\q1 It is amazing to me that you pay attention to humans.
\q1
\v 4 The time that we live is as short as  a puff of wind;
\q2 our time to live disappears like a shadow does.
\b
\q1
\v 5 Yahweh, tear open the sky and come down!
\q2 Touch the mountains in order that smoke will pour out from them!
\q1
\v 6 Cause lightning to flash with the result that your enemies will run away!
\q2 Shoot your arrows at them and cause them to run away.
\q1
\v 7 It is as though my enemies are like a flood around me;
\q2 reach your hand down from heaven
\q1 and rescue me from them .
\q1 They are men from other countries
\q1
\v 8 who  always tell lies.
\q1 Even in a courtroom where
\q2 they tell lies.
\b
\q1
\v 9 God, I will sing a new song to you,
\q2 and I will play my ten-stringed harp while I sing to you.
\q1
\v 10 You enable kings to defeat their enemies;
\q2 you rescue those who serve you like I did.
\b
\q1
\v 11 So I ask you to save me from being killed by the swords that those evil people carry.
\q1 Rescue me from the power  of those foreigners
\q2 who  always tell lies,
\q2 and who raise their right hands in courtrooms when they solemnly declare that they will tell the truth.
\b
\q1
\v 12 I wish,
\q1 and I wish that our daughters will grow up to be straight and tall
\q2 like the pillars  that stand in the corners of palaces.
\q1
\v 13 I wish that our barns will be full of many different crops.
\q1 I wish that the sheep in our fields will give birth to tens of thousands of baby lambs.
\q1
\v 14 I wish that our cows will give birth to many calves
\q2 without having any miscarriages or deaths when they are born .
\q1 I wish that there will not be a time when the people in our streets cry out in distress
\q2 because foreign armies are invading.
\b
\q1
\v 15 If good things like that happen to a nation,
\q2 the people will be very happy.
\q1 The people whose God is Yahweh are the ones who will be happy!
