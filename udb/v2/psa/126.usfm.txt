\c 126
\s1 A psalm written for people going up to the temple to worship
\q1
\v 1 When Yahweh brought us Israelite people back to Jerusalem ,
\q1 it was wonderful;
\q2 it seemed as though  we were dreaming.
\q1
\v 2 We were extremely happy
\q1 and we  continued shouting joyfully.
\q1 Then the other people-groups said about us,
\q2 "Yahweh has done great things for them!"
\q1
\v 3 And we say, "Yes, Yahweh truly has done great things for us,
\q2 and we are very happy."
\b
\q1
\v 4 But Yahweh, when it rains, water flows in the streams again after they were dry .
\q2 Similarly, enable our nation to become great again like it was before.
\q1
\v 5 We cried when we planted seeds because it was hard work preparing the soil that had not been plowed for many years;
\q1 now we want to shout joyfully because we are gathering a big harvest.
\q1
\v 6 Those who cried as they carried the bags of seeds to the fields will shout joyfully
\q2 when they bring the crops to their houses at harvest time.
