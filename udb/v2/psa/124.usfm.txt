\c 124
\s1 A psalm written by David for people going up to the temple to worship
\q1
\v 1 You Israelite people, answer this question:
\q1 What would have happened to us if Yahweh had not been helping us?
\q1
\v 2 When our enemies attacked us,
\q1 if Yahweh had not been fighting for us,
\q1
\v 3 we would have all been killed [IDI]
\q2 because they were very angry with us!
\q1
\v 4 They would have been like  us away;
\q1 it would have been as though the water would have covered us,
\q2
\v 5 and we would all have drowned in the flood that was raging.
\b
\q1
\v 6 But praise Yahweh
\q2 because he has not allowed our enemies to destroy us
\q2 like wild animals  tear apart the creatures that they capture.
\q1
\v 7 We have escaped from our enemies like a bird escapes from the trap that hunters have set;
\q1 it is as though the trap that our enemies set for us was broken
\q2 and we have escaped from it!
\q1
\v 8 Yahweh is the one who helps us ;
\q2 he is the one who made heaven and the earth.
