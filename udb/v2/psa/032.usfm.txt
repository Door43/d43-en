\c 32
\s1 A psalm written by David, which will help people to be wise
\q1
\v 1 Those whom God has forgiven for rebelling against him,
\q2 whose stains of sin have been wiped away,
\q2 are truly blessed by God!
\q1
\v 2 Those whose record of their sins Yahweh has erased,
\q2 those who no longer do deceitful things,
\q2 are truly blessed by God!
\b
\q1
\v 3 When I did not confess my sins,
\q2 my body was very weak and sick,
\q2 and I groaned all day long.
\q1
\v 4 Day and night, Yahweh, you  punished me severely.
\q2 My strength disappeared like water that evaporates on a hot summer day.
\qr (Think about that!)
\q1
\v 5 Then my sins to you;
\q2 I stopped trying to hide them.
\qr (Think about that!)
\q1 I said to myself,
\q2 "I will confess to Yahweh the wrong things that I have done."
\q1 And when I confessed them, you forgave me,
\q2 so now I am no longer guilty for my sins.
\b
\q1
\v 6 Therefore, the people who are godly should pray to you
\q2 when they realize that they have sinned.
\q1 If they do that, difficulties  will not come upon them like a great flood.
\q1
\v 7 You are like a place where I can hide from my enemies ,
\q2 you protect me from troubles,
\q2 and you enable me to shout, praising you for saving me from my enemies.
\qr (Think about that!)
\b
\q1
\v 8 Yahweh says, "I will instruct you about how you should conduct your life.
\q2 I will teach you and watch over you.
\q1
\v 9 Do not be stupid like horses and mules that do not have understanding;
\q2 they need bits
\q2 so they will go in the direction you want them to go."
\q1
\v 10 Wicked people will have many troubles that will make them sad,
\q2 but those who trust in Yahweh will experience him faithfully loving them all the time.
\b
\q1
\v 11 So, all you righteous people, rejoice about what Yahweh has done for you;
\q2 you whose inner beings are pure, be glad and shout joyfully!
