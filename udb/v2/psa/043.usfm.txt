\c 43
\s1 (A continuation of psalm 42)
\q1
\v 1 God, declare that I am innocent.
\q1 Defend me when ungodly people say things against me,
\q2 rescue me from people who deceive and say things about me that are not true.
\q1
\v 2 You are God, the one who protects me;
\q2 why have you abandoned me?
\q1 It does not seem right that  constantly
\q2 because of my enemies acting cruelly toward me.
\q1
\v 3 Show your light to me and speak your truth to me;
\q1 and by your words guide me,
\q2 and take me back to Zion, your sacred hill at Jerusalem,
\q2 and to your temple, where you live.
\q1
\v 4 When you do that, I will go to your altar,
\q2 to worship you, my God, who causes me to be extremely joyful.
\q2 There I will praise you, the God whom I worship, while I play my harp.
\b
\q1
\v 5 So why am I sad and discouraged?
\q1 I confidently expect God to bless me,
\q2 and I will praise him again,
\q2 my God, the one who saves me.
