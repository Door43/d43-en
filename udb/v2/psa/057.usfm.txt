\q1
\v 1 God, act mercifully toward me!
\q1 Act mercifully toward me because I come to you to protect me.
\q2 I request you to protect me like little birds are protected under their mother's wings ,
\q2 until the storm is ended.
\b
\q1
\v 2 God, you who are greater than all other gods,
\q2 I cry out to you, the one who enables me to be all that you desire.
\q1
\v 3 You will answer me from heaven and rescue me,
\q2 but you will cause those who oppress me to be defeated and disgraced!
\qr (Think about that!)
\q2 God will always faithfully love me and will be faithful.
\b
\q1
\v 4 Sometimes I am surrounded by my enemies who are like lions that kill humans;
\q2 like lions chew with their teeth animals that they kill;
\q1 but my enemies have spears and arrows, not teeth;
\q2 and the false things that they say .
\b
\q1
\v 5 God, show in the heavens that you are very great!
\q2 And show your glory to people all over the earth!

\v 6 It is as if  my enemies spread a net to seize me,
\q2 and I became very distressed [IDI].
\q1 It is as if  they dug a deep pit along the path where I walk,
\q2 but they themselves fell into it!
\qr (Think about that!)
\b
\q1
\v 7 God, I am very confident  in you.
\q1 I will sing to you,
\q2 and I will praise you while I sing.

\v 8 I will awaken myself;
\q2 I will arise before the sun rises
\q2 and praise you while I play my big harp or my lyre.
\b
\q1
\v 9 Lord, I will thank you among all the people;
\q1 and I will sing to praise you among many ethnic groups,
\q2
\v 10 because your faithful love for us is as great as the distance from the earth to the sky,
\q2 and because your faithfulness.
\b
\q1
