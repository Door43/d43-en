\c 3
\s1 A psalm written by David when he fled from his son Absalom
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, I have many enemies !
\q2 There are many people who oppose against me.
\q1
\v 2 Many people are saying about me,
\q2 "God will certainly not help him."
\qr (Think about that!)
\b
\q2
\v 3 But Yahweh, you are like a shield that protects me .
\q1 You greatly honor me, and you encourage me  [IDI].
\q1
\v 4 I cry out to you, Yahweh,
\q2 and you answer me from Zion, your sacred hill.
\qr (Think about that!)
\b
\q1
\v 5 At night I lie down and sleep, and I awake in the morning feeling good
\q2 because you, Yahweh, take care of me all during the night.
\q1
\v 6 There may be thousands of enemy soldiers who surround me,
\q2 but I am not afraid.
\b
\q1
\v 7 Yahweh, arise!
\q2 My God, come and rescue me again!
\q1 You insult my enemies by slapping them on their cheeks;
\q2 when you strike them, you break their teeth,
\q2 with the result that they cannot hurt anyone .
\b
\q1
\v 8 Yahweh, you are the one who saves your people from their enemies.
\q2 Yahweh, bless your people!
\qr (Think about that!)
