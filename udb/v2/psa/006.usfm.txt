\c 6
\s1 A psalm written by David for the choir leader, to be accompanied by people playing stringed instruments
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, do not punish me when you are angry with me;
\q2 Do not even rebuke me when you are angry.
\q1
\v 2 Yahweh, act kindly toward me and heal me because I have become weak.
\q2 My body  shakes because I am experiencing much pain.
\q1
\v 3 Yahweh, I am greatly troubled in my inner being.
\q2 How long must I endure this?
\b
\q1
\v 4 Yahweh, please come and rescue me.
\q2 Save me because you faithfully love me.
\q1
\v 5 I will not be able to praise you after I die ;
\q2 No one in the place where the dead are praises you.
\b
\q1
\v 6 I am exhausted because of my pain.
\q2 At night I cry very much, with the result that my bed and my pillow become wet from my tears.
\q1
\v 7 Because I cry very much, I cannot see well.
\q2 My eyes have become weak because my enemies have caused me to cry constantly.
\b
\q1
\v 8 You people who do evil things, get away from me
\q2 because Yahweh heard me when I was crying.
\q1
\v 9 Yahweh heard me when I called out to him to help me,
\q2 and he will answer my prayer.
\q1
\v 10 When that happens, all my enemies will be ashamed,
\q2 and they will also be terrified.
\q1 They will turn away from me and suddenly leave me
\q2 because they will be disgraced.
