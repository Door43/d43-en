\c 62
\s1 A psalm written by David for Jeduthun, the choir leader
\q1
\v 1 God is the only one who can give me peace in my inner being,
\q2 and he is the one who saves me from my enemies.
\q1
\v 2 Only he is like a huge rock under which I can be safe ;
\q2 he will be like a shelter, with the result that I will never be defeated .
\b
\q1
\v 3 When will you, my enemies, stop attacking me ?
\q2 I feel that I am as useless against you as a leaning wall or a broken-down fence .
\q1
\v 4 My enemies plan to remove me from my important position so that people no longer honor me.
\q2 They delight in telling lies.
\q1 They bless people by what they say ,
\q2 but in their inner beings they curse those people.
\qr (Think about that!)
\b
\q1
\v 5 God is the only one who gives me peace in my inner being;
\q2 he is the one whom I confidently expect to help me.
\q1
\v 6 Only he is like a huge rock under which I can be safe ;
\q2 he is like a shelter, and as a result I will never be defeated.
\q1
\v 7 God is the one who saves me and honors me.
\q2 He is like a huge strong rock under which I can find shelter .
\q1
\v 8 You my people, always trust in him.
\q2 Tell him all your troubles,
\q2 because he is our refuge.
\qr (Think about that!)
\b
\q1
\v 9 People who are considered to be unimportant are as unreliable as a breath of air;
\q2 people who are considered to be important also really amount to nothing.
\q1 If you put them all on a scale, it would be as if they weighed less than a puff of air.
\q1
\v 10 Do not trust in money gained by extorting it from others;
\q2 do not try to gain anything by robbing others.
\q1 If you become very wealthy, do not trust in [IDI] your money.
\b
\q1
\v 11 I have heard God say more than once that he is the one who really has power,
\q1
\v 12 and that he is the one who faithfully loves us.
\q2 He rewards every one of us according to the deeds that we do.
