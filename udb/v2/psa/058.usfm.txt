\c 58
\s1 A psalm written by David for the choir director, to be sung using the tune 'Do not destroy'
\q1
\v 1 When you mighty men speak, you never say what is right;
\q2 you never decide things about people justly !
\q1
\v 2 No, in your inner beings you think only about doing what is wrong,
\q2 and you commit violent crimes in this land of Israel.
\q1
\v 3 Wicked people do wrong things and tell lies from the time that they are born .
\q1
\v 4 God, show in the heavens how great you are!
\q2 And show your glory to people all over the earth!
\q1 What wicked people say injures people like the venom of a snake ;
\q2 They refuse to listen to good advice, as though they were cobras that were deaf !
\q
\v 5 As a result, like a snake that does not respond when a charmer plays a flute or when someone sings magic songs,
\q2 they do not pay attention when others rebuke them.
\b
\q1
\v 6 God, as for these enemies who want to attack me like young lions,
\q2 break the teeth in their mouths!
\q1
\v 7 Cause them to disappear like water disappears in dry ground!
\q2 Cause the arrows that they shoot to have no heads!
\q1
\v 8 Cause them to become like snails that disappear in the slime;
\q2 cause them to be like a baby that is born dead!
\b
\q1
\v 9 I hope that you will get rid of them
\q2 as fast as thornbushes are blown away after they are cut .
\q1
\v 10 Righteous people will rejoice when they see wicked people being punished as they deserve;
\q2 they will wash their feet in the blood of wicked people.
\q1
\v 11 Then people will say, "It is true that there is a reward for righteous people;
\q2 and there is indeed a God who judges people justly here on the earth!"
