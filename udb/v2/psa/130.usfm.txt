\c 130
\s1 A psalm written for people going up to the temple to worship
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, I have great troubles, so I call out to you.
\q1
\v 2 Yahweh, hear me,
\q2 while I call out to you  to help me!
\b
\q1
\v 3 Yahweh, if you kept a record of the sins that we have committed,
\q2 not one of us  would escape from being condemned and punished!
\q1
\v 4 But you forgive us,
\q2 with the result that we have an awesome respect for you.
\b
\q1
\v 5 Yahweh has said that he would help me;
\q2 I trust what he said, and I wait eagerly for him to do that.
\q1
\v 6 I wait for Yahweh to help me
\q2 more than watchmen wait for the light to dawn;
\q2 yes, I wait more eagerly than they do!
\b
\q1
\v 7 You my fellow Israelites, confidently expect that Yahweh will bless us.
\q2 He will bless us because he faithfully loves us,
\q2 and he is very willing to save us.
\q1
\v 8 And he will save us Israelite people from being punished for all the sins that we have committed.
