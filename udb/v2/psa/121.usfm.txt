\c 121
\s1 A psalm written for people going up to the temple to worship
\q1
\v 1 When we travel toward Jerusalem,
\q2 I look up toward the hills and I ask myself, "Who will help me?"
\q1
\v 2 And my answer is that Yahweh is the one who helps me;
\q2 he is the one who made heaven and the earth.
\b
\q1
\v 3 He will not allow us to fall;
\q2 God, who protects us, will not fall asleep.
\q1
\v 4 The one who protects us Israelite people
\q2 never gets sleepy or sleeps.
\b
\q1
\v 5 Yahweh watches over us;
\q2 he is like the shade  that protects us from the sun.
\q1
\v 6 He will not allow the sun to harm us during the day,
\q2 and he will not allow the moon to harm us during the night.
\b
\q1
\v 7 Yahweh will protect us from being harmed in any manner;
\q2 he will keep us safe.
\q1
\v 8 He will protect us from the time that we leave our houses in the morning until we return in the evening;
\q2 he will protect us now and he will protect us forever.
