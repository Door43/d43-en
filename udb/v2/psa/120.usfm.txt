\c 120
\s1 A psalm written for people going up to the temple to worship
\q1
\v 1 When I was distressed, I called out to Yahweh
\q2 and he answered me.
\q1
\v 2 I prayed,
\q2 "Yahweh, rescue who lie to me and try to deceive me!"
\b
\q1
\v 3 You people who lie to me, I will tell you  what God will do to you
\q2 and what he will do to punish you.
\q1
\v 4 He will shoot sharp arrows at you like soldiers do,
\q2 and he will burn you with red-hot coals from the wood of a broom tree.
\b
\q1
\v 5 It is terrible for me, living among cruel people
\q2 like those who live in Meshech region and Kedar region.
\q1
\v 6 I have lived for a long time among people who hate to live with others peacefully.
\q1
\v 7 Every time I talk about living together peacefully,
\q2 they talk about starting a war.
