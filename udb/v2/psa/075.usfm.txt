\c 75
\s1 A psalm written by Asaph for the choir director, to be sung using the tune 'Do not destroy'
\q1
\v 1 We give thanks to you;
\q2 our God, we thank you.
\q1 You are close to us,
\q2 and we proclaim to others the wonderful things that you have done for us.
\b
\q1
\v 2 You have said, "I have appointed a time when I will judge people,
\q2 and I will judge everyone fairly.
\q1
\v 3 When the earth shakes
\q2 and all the creatures on the earth tremble,
\q1 I am the one who will keep its foundations steady.
\qr (Think about that!)
\q1
\v 4 I say to people who boast, 'Stop bragging!'
\q1 and I say to wicked people, 'Do not proudly do things to show how great you are [IDI]!
\q
\v 5 Do not be arrogant,
\q2 and do not speak so boastfully!'~"
\b
\q1
\v 6 The one who judges people does not come from the east or from the west,
\q1 and he does not come from the desert.
\q1
\v 7 God is the one who judges people;
\q2 he says that some have sinned and must be punished and that others have not done what is wrong.
\q1
\v 8 It is as though Yahweh holds a cup in his hand;
\q2 it is filled with wine that has spices mixed in it to cause those who drink it to become more drunk;
\q1 and when Yahweh pours it out, he will force all the wicked people to drink it;
\q2 they will drink every drop of it,
\q2 which means that he will give them all the punishment that they deserve.
\b
\q1
\v 9 But as for me, I will never stop saying what the God whom Jacob worshiped has done;
\q1 I will never quit singing to praise him.
\q1
\v 10 He will get rid of the power [IDI] of wicked people,
\q1 but he will increase the power of righteous people.
