\c 60
\s1 A psalm written by David for the choir director, a psalm for teaching, to be sung using the tune 'Lily of the promise.' David wrote it during the wars in northern Syria, and when Joab's army, after returning from the battle, killed 12,000 of the Edom people-group in Salt Valley

\v 1 I prayed, "God, you have rejected us Israelites!
\q1 Because you have been angry with us,
\q2 you have enabled our enemies to break through our ranks.
\q1 Please enable us to be strong again!
\q1
\v 2 When we were defeated, it was as though  there was a big earthquake in our land that caused the ground to split open.
\q1 So now, just as you can cause the cracks in the land to disappear,
\q2 help our army to be strong again,
\q2 because it is as though our country is falling apart.
\q1
\v 3 You have caused us, your people, to suffer very much;
\q2 it is as though you forced us to drink strong wine that caused us to stagger around after we became drunk.
\b
\q1
\v 4 But you have raised a battle flag for those who have a reverential respect for you
\q2 in order that they can gather around it and not be killed by the enemies' arrows.
\qr (Think about that!)
\q1
\v 5 Answer our prayers and enable us by your power  to defeat our enemies
\q2 in order that we, the people whom you love, will be saved."
\b

\v 6 Then God answered my prayer and spoke from his temple, saying,
\q1 "Because I have conquered your enemies, I will divide Shechem city,
\q2 and I will distribute among my people the land in Succoth Valley.
\q1
\v 7 The Gilead region is mine;
\q1 the people of the tribe of Manasseh are mine;
\q1 the tribe of Ephraim is like my helmet ;
\q1 and the tribe of Judah is like the scepter;
\q1
\v 8 the Moab region is like my washbasin ;
\q2 I throw my sandal in the Edom area to show that it belongs to me;
\q2 I shout triumphantly because I have defeated the people of the Philistia area.
\b
\q1
\v 9 Because I want to defeat the people of Edom,
\q1 who will lead my army triumphantly to their capital city that has strong walls around it?
\q1
\v 10 So, God, we desire you have not truly abandoned us,
\q2 and that you will go with us when our armies march out to fight our enemies.
\q1
\v 11 We need you to help us when we fight against our enemies,
\q2 because the help that humans can give us is worthless.
\q
\v 12 But with you helping us, we shall win;
\q2 you will enable us to defeat our enemies.
