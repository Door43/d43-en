\c 39
\s1 A psalm written by David for Jeduthun, the choir director
\q1
\v 1 I said to myself, "I will be careful not to sin by the things that I say .
\q1 I will not say anything to complain to you
\q2 while wicked people are near to me and can hear me."
\q1
\v 2 So I was completely silent , and I did not even talk about things that were good,
\q2 but it was useless because I began to suffer even more.
\q1
\v 3 I became very anxious [IDI] in my inner being.
\q2 As I thought about my troubles, I became more worried.
\q2 Then finally I said ,
\b
\q1
\v 4 "Yahweh, show me how long I will live.
\q2 Tell me when I will die.
\q2 Tell me how many years I will live!
\q1
\v 5 It seems that you have caused me to live only a short time;
\q2 my lifetime seems nothing to you.
\q2 The time that all we humans live is as short as  a puff of wind.
\qr (Think about that!)
\q1
\v 6 Then we disappear like a shadow does.
\q2 It seems that all that we do is for nothing.
\q2 We sometimes get a lot of money, but we do not know who will get it after we die.
\q1
\v 7 So now, Yahweh, if I expect  to receive blessings from other people, I will be disappointed.
\q2 You are the only one from whom I confidently expect to receive blessings.
\q1
\v 8 Save me from being punished for all the sins that I have committed.
\q2 And do not allow foolish people to make fun of me.
\q1
\v 9 I did not say anything when you punished me,
\q2 because I knew that you were the one who caused me to suffer.
\q1
\v 10 But now, please stop punishing me!
\q2 If you do not do that, I am about to die because of the ways that you  me.
\q1
\v 11 When you rebuke someone and punish him for the sin that he has committed,
\q2 you destroy the things that he loves, like moths' larva destroy clothing.
\q2 Our lives disappear like a puff of wind.
\qr (Think about that!)
\b
\q1
\v 12 Yahweh, listen to me while I pray;
\q2 pay attention to me while I cry out to you.
\q2 Help me while I am crying.
\q1 I am here on the earth for only a short time,
\q2 like all my ancestors.
\q1
\v 13 Now please allow me to be alone and do not punish me anymore
\q2 in order that I may smile and be happy for a while before I die. "
