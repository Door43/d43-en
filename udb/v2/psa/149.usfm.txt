\v 6 They  should shout loudly to praise God;
\q2 but they should also hold sharp swords in their hands,
\q1
\v 7 ready to use them to defeat the soldiers of nations that do not worship God,
\q1 and to punish the people of those nations,
\q1
\v 8 and to fasten their kings and other leaders with iron chains,
\q1
\v 9 to judge and punish the people of those nations, like God wrote should be done.
\q2 It is a privilege for God's faithful people to do that!
\b
\q1 Praise Yahweh!
