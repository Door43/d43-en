\c 123
\s1 A psalm written for people going up to the temple to worship
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, I look up toward you,
\q2 up to heaven, from where you rule.
\q1
\v 2 Like servants request [IDI] their masters for what they need
\q1 and like maids request their mistresses for what they need,
\q2 we request you, Yahweh our God, for what we need,
\q2 and we request you to act mercifully toward us.
\b
\q1
\v 3 Yahweh, act very mercifully  toward us
\q2 because our enemies have acted very contemptuously toward us.
\q1
\v 4 Rich people have made fun of us for a long time,
\q2 and proud people who have oppressed us have acted toward us as though we were worthless.
