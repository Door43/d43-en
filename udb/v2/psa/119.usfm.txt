\v 71 It was good for me that you afflicted me,
\q2 because the result was that I learned your statutes.
\q1
\v 72 The laws that you  to us are worth more to me than gold,
\q2 more than thousands of pieces of gold and silver.

\q1
\v 77 Act mercifully to me in order that I may continue to live,
\q2 because I am delighted with your laws.
\q1
\v 78 Cause the proud people who falsely accuse me to be ashamed,

\q1
\v 82 My eyes are tired from waiting a long time for you to do what you promised that you would do,
\q2 and I ask, "When will you help me?"
\q1
\v 83 I have become as useless as  a wineskin that is shriveled from hanging a long time in the smoke inside a house,
\q2 but I have not forgotten your statutes.
\q1
\v 84 How long must I wait?
\q2 When will you punish those who persecute me?
\q1
\v 85 It is as though proud people have dug deep pits for me to fall into,
\q2 people who do not obey your laws.
\q1
\v 86 All your commands are trustworthy;
\q2 but people are persecuting me by telling lies about me, so please help me!

\q2 but I will think about your requirements.
\q1
\v 96 I have learned that there is a limit for everything,
\q2 but your commands.
\b

\v 129 Your requirements are wonderful,
\q2 so I obey them with all my inner being.
\q1
\v 130 When someone explains your words,
\q2 it is as though they are lighting a light;
\q2 what they say causes even people who have not learned your laws to be wise.
\q1
\v 131 I eagerly desire to know your commands,
\q2 like  a dog that pants with its mouth open wanting to be fed.
\q1
\v 132 Listen to me and act kindly to me,
\q2 like you do to all those who love you .

\q1
\v 151 But Yahweh, you are near to me,
\q2 and I know that your commands will never be changed.
\q1

\q2 so you will certainly not save them.
\q1
\v 156 Yahweh, you are very merciful;
\q2 allow me to continue to live because of my obeying your regulations.
\q1
\v 157 Many people are my enemies and many people cause me to suffer,
\q2 but I do not turn aside from.
\q1
\v 158 When I look at those who are not faithful to you, I am disgusted
\q2 because they do not obey your requirements.

\v 174 Yahweh, I eagerly desire for you to rescue me from my enemies;
\q2 I am delighted with your laws.
\q1
\v 175 Allow me to continue to live in order that I can continue to praise you
\q2 and that your regulations that you have given to us will continue to help me.
\q1
\v 176 I have sinned and turned away from you like  a sheep that has become lost;
\q2 search for me, because I have not forgotten your commands.
