\q2 than to depend on people.

\v 10 Armies of  many nations surrounded me,
\q2 but Yahweh enabled me to defeat them by his power .
\q1
\v 11 They completely surrounded me,
\q2 but I defeated them all by the power of Yahweh.
\q1
\v 12 They swarmed around me like angry bees;
\q2 they were like a fire that blazes strongly, but only briefly, in a thornbush,
\q2 but I defeated them by the power  of Yahweh.
\b
\q1
\v 13 My enemies attacked me fiercely and almost defeated me,
\q2 but Yahweh helped me.
\q1
\v 14 Yahweh is the one who makes me strong,
\q1 and he is the one about whom I always sing;
\q2 he has saved me from my enemies.
\b
\q1
\v 15 Listen to the joyful songs of victory being sung in the tents of godly people!
\q2 They sing, "Yahweh has defeated our enemies by his mighty power ;
\q1
\v 16 he has raised his strong right arm to show he is happy over defeating his enemies.
\q2 Yahweh has completely defeated them!"

\v 17 I will not be killed in battle;
\q2 I will live to proclaim the great things that Yahweh has done.

\v 18 Yahweh has punished me severely,
\q2 but he has not allowed me to die.
\b
\q1
\v 19 You gatekeepers, open for me the gates of the temple
\q2 in order that I may enter and thank Yahweh.
\q1
\v 20 Those are the gates through which we enter the temple to worship Yahweh;
\q2 godly people enter those gates.
\q1
\v 21 Yahweh, I thank you that you answered my prayer,
\q2 and you saved me from my enemies.
\b
\q1
\v 22 Yahweh's promised is like the stone which the builders rejected
\q2 when they were building a house,
\q1 but that stone became the cornerstone.
\q1
\v 23 This was done by Yahweh,
\q1 and it is a wonderful thing for us to see.
\q1
\v 24 This is the day in which we remember that Yahweh acted powerfully to defeat our enemies;
\q2 we will rejoice and be glad today.
\q1
\v 25 Yahweh, we plead with you to keep rescuing us from our enemies.
\q2 Yahweh, please help us accomplish what we want to do.
\q1
\v 26 Yahweh, bless the one who will come with your power .
\q2 And from the temple we bless all of you.
\q1
\v 27 Yahweh is God,
\q2 and he has caused his light to come to us.
\q1 Come, carrying palm branches, and join the people who are starting the festival as they go to the altar.
\b
\q1
\v 28 Yahweh, you are the God whom I worship, and I will praise you!
\q2 You are my God, and I will tell everyone that you are great!
\b

\v 29 Thank Yahweh, because he does good things for us!
\q2 He will faithfully love us forever.
