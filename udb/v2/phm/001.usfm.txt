\v 1 I, Paul, am a prisoner who serves Christ Jesus. I am here with Timothy, our fellow believer. I am writing this letter to you, Philemon, our dear friend and fellow worker.
\v 2 I am also writing to your wife, Apphia, and to Archippus, who is like  house.
\v 3 I pray that God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ will continue to act kindly toward you all and will continue to cause you to have inner peace.
\s Philemon 4-7
\sr I thank God and rejoice greatly because you have shown that you love God's people.
\p
\v 4 I always thank my God when I pray for you
\v 5 and that you continue to trust in the Lord Jesus.
\v 6 I pray that as a result of your knowing all the good things that God as you tell others what you believe, in order that they may honor Christ.
\v 7 I have rejoiced greatly and have been greatly encouraged because you, my dear friend, have acted lovingly toward God's people by encouraging them .
\s Philemon 8-11
\sr Because I know that you love God's people, I request, rather than command you, to do what you ought to do for my spiritual son Onesimus.
\p
\v 8 So I have a request to ask of you. I am completely confident that I have authority to command you to do what you ought to do, because I am an apostle of Christ.
\v 9 But because I know that you love God's people, I request this instead ofcommanding you to do it. It is I, Paul, an old man and now also a prisoner because I serve Christ Jesus, who am requesting it.
\v 10 I request that you do something for someone who has become like my own son because I told him about Christ  here. His name is Onesimus.
\v 11 Although his name, as you know, means 'useful', formerly he was useless to you. But now he is useful both to you and to me!
\s Philemon 12-16
\sr I am sending Onesimus back to you. He is as dear to me as my own self, and he will now be even dearer to you than he is to me.
\p
\v 12 Although he is as dear to me as, I am sending him back to you.
\v 13 I would like to have kept him with me, in order that he might serve me on your behalf, while I am a prisoner  because of my preaching the message about Christ.
\v 14 Nevertheless, because I had not yet asked you and you had not yet permitted me to keep him here with me, I decided not to keep him here. I decided that I should not do anything without your permitting it. I decided that you should help me only if you really want to help me.
\v 15 Perhaps the reason that God permitted Onesimus to be separated from  forever!
\v 16 You will no longer have him only as a slave. Instead, you will have him as someone who is more than a slave. You will have him as a fellow believer! He is especially dear to me, but he certainly will be more dear to you than he is to me , because now he not only belongs to you but he also belongs to the Lord.
\s Philemon 17-19
\sr If you consider me to be your partner, receive Onesimus as you would receive me. I guarantee to repay you whatever Onesimus owes you.
\p
\v 17 So, if you consider me to be your partner in God's work, receive him as you would receive me.
\v 18 If he has wronged you in any manner or if he owes you anything, charge that to me.
\v 19 I, Paul, am now writing this in my own handwriting: I will repay you what he owes you, although I might mention to you that you owe me even more than Onesimus may owe you, because it was the result of my telling you about Christ that God saved your soul.
\s Philemon 20
\sr Please encourage me in this matter as you encourage other believers in Christ.
\p
\v 20 Yes by receiving Onesimus kindly, just like you encourage others who believe in Christ.
\s Philemon 21
\sr I have written this letter to you confident of your compliance with my request.
\p
\v 21 I have written this letter to you, confident that you will do what I am requesting you to do. In fact, I know that you will do even more than what I am requesting you to do.
\s Philemon 22
\sr Also, keep a guest room ready for me.
\p
\v 22 Also, keep a guest room ready for me to stay in, because I confidently expect that as a result of your prayers for me, I will be released from prison and will come to you all.
\s Philemon 23-25
\sr My other fellow workers greet you spiritually.
\p
\v 23 Epaphras, who is suffering with me in prison because of his serving Christ Jesus, sends his greetings to you.
\v 24 Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, who are my other fellow workers, also send their greetings to you.
\v 25 I pray that the Lord Jesus Christ will continue to work kindly in all your lives.
