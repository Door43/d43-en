\s1 The man speaks
\q1
\v 1 You who are dearer to me than my sister, my bride,
\q2 I have come to cuddle up to you ;
\q1 it will be as though I will be gathering myrrh with my other spices,
\q2 and eating my honey and honeycomb,
\q2 and drinking my wine and my milk.
\s1 Their friends speak
\q1 You two who love each other, enjoy your lovemaking;
\q2 enjoy all that you want to.
\b
\s1 The woman speaks
\q1
\v 2 I was partially asleep, but my mind was still awake.
\q2 Then I heard the one who loves me knocking at the door.
\q1 He said, "You who are dearer to me than my sister, my darling, my dear friend, my perfect one, my dove ,
\q2 open the door for me!
\q1 My hair is wet from the dew,
\q2 from the mist that has fallen during the night."
\q1
\v 3 But I had already taken off my robe;
\q2 I did not  want to put it on again to open the door.
\q1 I had already washed my feet;
\q2 I did not  want to cause them to become dirty again.
\q1
\v 4 The one who loves me put his hand through the opening in the wall,
\q2 and I was thrilled in my inner being that he was there.
\q1
\v 5 I got up to open the door for the one who loves me,
\q2 but first I put a lot of myrrh on my hands.
\q1 The myrrh was dripping from my fingers
\q2 while I unlatched the bolt.
\q1
\v 6 I opened the door for the man who loves me,
\q2 but he had left.
\q1 He had turned away and was gone!
\q2 I was very disappointed [IDI];
\q1 I searched for him, but I could not find him.
\q2 I called him, but he did not answer.
\q1
\v 7 The city watchmen saw me while they were walking around the city.
\q1 They beat me and wounded me
\q2 because they thought I must be a prostitute;
\q2 those men who were guarding the city walls took my robe.
\q1
\v 8 You young women of Jerusalem,
\q2 I plead with you,
\q1 if you see the man who loves me,
\q2 tell him  that I am very disappointed that we did not make love.
\s1 Their friends speak
\q1
\v 9 You who are the fairest among women,
\q2 why do you think that the one who loves you is better than other men?
\q1 In what way is the man who loves you better than other men
\q2 with the result that you request us to tell him that?
\s1 The woman speaks
\q1
\v 10 The man who loves me is handsome and healthy,
\q2 outstanding among other men.
\q1
\v 11 His head is beautiful, like  purest gold;
\q2 his hair is wavy
\q2 and as black as .
\q1
\v 12 His eyes as gentle as  doves
\q2 along the streams;
\q1 the white parts of his eyes are as white as  milk,
\q2 with what resembles jewels inlaid in them.
\q1
\v 13 His cheeks are like  a garden full of spice trees
\q2 that produce sweet-smelling perfume.
\q1 His lips are like  lilies
\q2 that have myrrh dripping from them.
\q1
\v 14 His arms are like 
\q2 that are decorated with precious stones.
\q1 His body is like  of ivory
\q2 that is decorated with sapphires.
\q1
\v 15 His legs are like  pillars of marble
\q2 that are set in bases made of pure gold.
\q1 He is majestic, like the mountains of  Lebanon,
\q2 as delightful cedar trees.
\q1
\v 16 His kisses  are extremely sweet;
\q2 he is completely attractive.
\q1 You young women of Jerusalem,
\q2 all that tells why the one who loves me and who is my friend is better than other men.
