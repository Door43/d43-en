\s1 The man speaks
\q1
\v 1 My darling, you are beautiful,
\q2 you are very beautiful!
\q2 Underneath your veil, your eyes are as gentle as  doves.
\q1 Your long black hair moves from side to side like  a flock of black goats
\q2 moving down the slopes of Gilead Mountain.
\q1
\v 2 Your teeth are very white
\q2 like 
\q1 and have come up from being washed in a stream.
\q1 You have all of your teeth on both sides;
\q2 none of them is missing.
\q1
\v 3 Your lips are like  a scarlet ribbon,
\q2 and your mouth is lovely.
\q1 Beneath your veil,
\q2 your round, rosy the halves of a pomegranate.
\q1
\v 4 Your long neck is beautiful like  the tower of King David
\q2 that was built using layers of stone.
\q1 The ornaments on the necklaces around your neck are like a thousand  shields that are hanging on the walls of a tower;
\q2 each one belongs to a warrior.
\q1
\v 5 Your breasts are as beautiful 
\q2 that eat grass among lilies.
\q1
\v 6 Until dawn tomorrow morning
\q2 and the nighttime shadows disappear,
\q1 I will lie close to your breasts
\q2 that are like .
\q1

\v 8 My bride, it is as though you are in  Lebanon
\q2 far away, where I cannot reach you;
\q1 come back to me.
\q1 It is as though you are inaccessible 
\q2 on the top of Hermon Mountain or the nearby peaks.
\q1 Come from where the lions have their dens
\q2 and where the leopards live on the mountains.
\q1
\v 9 You who are dearer to me than my sister, my bride , you have captured my affection [IDI]
\q2 by only once quickly looking at me,
\q2 by one strand of jewels in your necklace.
\q1
\v 10 My bride, your love for me is delightful!
\q2 It more delightful than wine!
\q1 And the fragrance of your perfume
\q2 is more pleasing than any spice!
\q1
\v 11 Being kissed by you is as enjoyable as eating  honey;
\q2 your kisses are as sweet as milk mixed with honey.
\q2 The aroma of your clothes
\q2 is like  the aroma of cedar trees in Lebanon.
\q1
\v 12 You who are dearer to me than [MER] my sister, my bride, you are like  a garden that is locked
\q2 in order that other men cannot enter it;
\q1 you are like  a spring or a fountain that is covered
\q2 in order that others may not drink from it.
\q1
\v 13 You are like  an orchard of pomegranate trees
\q2 full of delicious fruit,
\q2 and plenty of plants that produce henna and nard spices,
\q2
\v 14 and saffron and calamus and cinnamon
\q2 and many other kinds of incense,
\q2 and myrrh and aloes
\q2 and many other fine spices.
\q1
\v 15 You are like  a fountain in a garden,
\q2 like  a spring of clear water
\q2 that flows down from the mountains of Lebanon.
\s1 The woman speaks
\b
\q1
\v 16 I want the north wind and the south wind to come,
\q2 and blow on my garden,
\q1 in order that the fragrance of the spices will spread through the air.
\q1 Similarly, I want the one who loves me to come and enjoy cuddling up to me
\q2 like  someone comes into a garden and enjoys eating the fruit that grows there.
