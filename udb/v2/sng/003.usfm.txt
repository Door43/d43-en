\q1
\v 1 During the entire night while I lay on my bed,
\q2 I longed for the one whom I loved.
\q1 I desired for him to come,
\q2 but he did not come.
\q1
\v 2 So I said to myself,
\q1 "I will get up now and walk around the city,
\q2 through the streets and plazas,
\q2 to search for the one whom I love."
\q1 So I got up and searched for him,
\q2 but I could not find him.
\q1
\v 3 The city watchmen saw me
\q2 while they were patrolling around the city.
\q1 I asked them,
\q2 "Have you seen the one whom I love?"
\q1
\v 4 As soon as I walked past them,
\q2 I found the one whom I love.
\q1 I clung to him and would not let him go
\q2 until I had brought him to my mother's house,
\q2 to the room where my mother had conceived me .
\q1
\v 5 You women of Jerusalem,
\q2 solemnly promise me, while the does and gazelles are listening, that you will not
\q1 disturb us while we are making love
\q2 until we are ready to quit.
\b
\s1 One of their friends speaks
\q1
\v 6 Who is it that is coming from the desert,
\q2 who is stirring up dust like a column of smoke
\q1 from burning myrrh and incense
\q2 made from spices imported by merchants?
\q1
\v 7 It is someone
\q2 surrounded by sixty bodyguards
\q2 chosen from the strongest warriors in Israel.
\q1
\v 8 They all have swords
\q2 and they all are trained to use them.
\q1 Each one has his sword strapped to his side
\q2 and is prepared for dangers that occur during the night.
\q1
\v 9 King Solomon commanded his servants to make that palanquin for him;
\q2 it was made with wood from Lebanon.
\q1
\v 10 The canopy that covered it was held up by posts made of silver,
\q2 and the back of the palanquin was embroidered with gold.
\q1 The seat was covered with purple cloth
\q2 lovingly made by the women of Jerusalem.
\q1
\v 11 You women of Jerusalem,
\q2 come and look at King Solomon
\q1 wearing the headdress that his mother put on his head
\q2 on the day when he was married,
\q1 the day when he  was very happy.
