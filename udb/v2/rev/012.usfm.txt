\s Revelation 12:1-6
\sr When the royal woman gave birth to a kingly son, she fled to safety and care in a place in the wilderness that was prepared by God.
\p
\v 1 Then something very unusual appeared in the sky. It was a woman, whose  appearance and clothing were  as bright as the sun. The moon was under her feet. On her head was a crown  that was made of twelve stars. 
\v 2 She was pregnant. Then, because she was about to give birth, she cried out because she was suffering pain. 
\v 3 Something else very unusual appeared in the sky. It was a huge red dragon. It had seven heads and ten horns. On each of its heads was a royal crown. 
\v 4 The dragon's tail dragged a third of the stars from the sky and threw them to the earth. The dragon set himself in front of the woman who was about to give birth, in order that he might eat her child as soon as it was born. 
\v 5 She gave birth to a son, who  is destined to rule all the nations with  complete authority as if he was using . God snatched away her child and took him to  rule from his throne. 
\v 6 The woman fled to a desert. She has a place there that God has prepared for her, in order that  the angels may take care of her for a thousand, two hundred and sixty days.
\s Revelation 12:7-12
\sr There was a battle in heaven in which Michael and his angels fought the dragon. The dragon and his angels were thrown out of heaven to earth. A loud voice from heaven declared the victory and the sovereignty of God and lamented the tragic struggle coming to people on earth.
\p
\v 7 There was a battle in heaven. Michael and the angels that he  commanded fought against the dragon. The dragon and his angels fought back  against Michael and his angels. 
\v 8 But the dragon did not win the battle, so  God did not allow the dragon and his angels to stay in heaven any longer. 
\v 9 The huge dragon was thrown  out  of heaven. The dragon is the ancient serpent, the one who is called the Devil and Satan. He is the one who deceives  people all over the earth. He was thrown to the earth, along with all his angels. 
\v 10 Then I heard  someone in heaven shout loudly, saying,
\q1 Now our God has saved his people by his power, and he rules all people!
\q1 Now his Messiah, who is the supreme ruler whom God appointed, 
\q1 has authority to rule all people, because our God has thrown out of heaven the one who accuses our fellow believers!
\q1 The dragon is the one who accuses them day and night before our God, 
\q1 saying that they have sinned and that God ought punish them.
\q1
\v 11 Our fellow believers overcame him because they never stopped trusting 
\q1  Jesus, 
\q1 and because they trusted in what the one who is like a lamb accomplished 
\q1 when his blood flowed when he died.
\q1 Even though those believers wanted to live, 
\q1 they were willing to let people kill them for speaking truly about him.
\q1
\v 12 So, all you angels living  in heaven, rejoice!
\q1 But terrible things will happen to you ungodly people who  live on the earth and 
\q1 on the ocean, because the devil has come down to you!
\q1 He is very angry because he knows that he has only a short time 
\q1 during which he can harm people.
\s Revelation 12:13-18
\sr When the dragon pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child, he was thwarted, so he prepared to fight against her other offspring.
\p
\v 13 When the dragon realized that he had been thrown  down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to a son. 
\v 14 But the woman was given two wings like the wings of a very large eagle, in order that she might fly to a desolate place. That is a place  that God has prepared for her. There she was taken care of  for three and one half years. The serpent, that is, the dragon, was not able to reach her there. 
\v 15 The serpent poured water like a river from his mouth in the direction of the woman, in order that the water might sweep her away. 
\v 16 But the ground helped the woman  by opening up and swallowing the river that the dragon poured out from his mouth! 
\v 17 Then the dragon was very angry with the woman, so he went away to fight against  the people who are like the rest of her descendants. They are the people who obey God's commandments and who tell other people about Jesus . 
\v 18 The dragon stood on the ocean shore.
