\c 19
\s Revelation 19:1-8
\sr After the destruction of Babylon, John heard a huge crowd praising God for saving his people and announcing the marriage of the one who is like a lamb.
\p
\v 1 After these things I heard what sounded like a huge crowd in heaven. They were shouting things like,
\q1 "Hallelujah!" "He has saved us!"
\q1 "He is glorious and mighty!"
\q1
\v 2 "Praise him because he judges truly and justly!"
\q1 "He has punished the very evil cities that are like a prostitute,
\q1 because their people persuaded the other people of earth  to act immorally and idolatrously like they do."
\q1 "Praise him because he has punished them for murdering his servants !"
\q1
\v 3 The crowd shouted a second time saying:
\q1 Hallelujah! The smoke of the fire that is burning the cities will rise forever!
\q1
\v 4 The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures prostrated themselves"
\v 5 Someone spoke from the throne and said, "All you who are his servants, praise our God! All you who reverence him, whether you are socially significant or insignificant, praise him! Everyone!"
\v 6 I heard something like the noise of a huge crowd of people, like the sound of a huge waterfall , and like the sound of loud thunder. They were shouting:
\q1 Hallelujah! Because the Lord God, the Almighty One, reigns!
\q1
\v 7 We should rejoice, we should be extremely glad, and we should honor him,
\q1 because it is now time for Jesus, the one who is like a lamb, to be united
\q1 permanently with his people, which will be like a man  marrying his bride, and
\q1 because those who belong to him have prepared themselves to be united with him.
\q1
\v 8 God has permitted them to be completely pure, like a bride who  dresses in fine linen that is bright and clean.
\p Fine bright and clean linen represents the righteous acts of God's people.
\s Revelation 19:9-10
\sr God will abundantly bless the people who have been invited to celebrate the marriage of the Lamb. Only God should be worshipped. All his servants are on an equal basis.
\p
\v 9 Then the angel said to me, "Write this: God will abundantly bless the people who are  marrying a wife." He also said to me: "These words that God declares are true!"
\v 10 I immediately prostrated myself!"
\s Revelation 19:11-16
\sr John saw heaven open and saw the one whom he described as King of kings and Lord of lords mounted on a white horse.
\p
\v 11 I saw heaven opened , and I was surprised to see a white horse. Jesus, the one who was riding on the horse, is called 'Trustworthy and Genuine, Or: True.' He judges all people according to what is right, and fights righteously against his enemies.
\v 12 His eyes shone like  a flame of fire. There were many royal crowns on his head. A name had been written on him. Only he knows the meaning of that name.
\v 13 The cloak he was wearing was drenched with blood. His name is also "The one who expresses what God is like."
\v 14 The armies of heaven were following him. They were riding on white horses. They were wearing clothes made of clean white linen.
\v 15 The words that he speaks are like  a person crushes grapes in a winepress. He will do this for God Almighty, who is furiously angry with them because of their sins.
\v 16 On his cloak close to his thigh a name had been written , which is "King who rules over all other kings and Lord who rules over all other lords."
\s Revelation 19:17-21
\sr An angel invited all flesh-eating birds to feast on the flesh of people who would be killed by the Rider on the white horse. When the beast and the false prophet gathered kings with their armies against the Rider and his army, the beast and the false prophet were thrown into the lake of fire. The sword of the Rider killed rebellious people, and the birds gorged themselves on their flesh.
\p
\v 17 I saw an angel who was standing in the light of  the sun. He called loudly to all the flesh-eating birds flying high in the sky, "Come and gather for the great feast that God is providing for you!
\v 18 Come and eat the flesh of all God's enemies who are deadâ€” the flesh of kings, of army commanders, of people who fought powerfully, of horses and of the soldiers who rode them, and the flesh of all other kinds of people, whether they were free or slave, socially insignificant or significant. All kinds!"
\v 19 Then I saw the beast and the kings of earth with their armies gathered together to fight against the rider on the horse, and against his army.
\v 20 The beast and the false prophet were captured  alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.
\v 21 The rider on the horse killed the rest of their armies by his words, which were like  a sword that extended from his mouth. All those birds gorged themselves on the flesh of the people whom he had killed.
