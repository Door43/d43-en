\c 4
\s Revelation 4:1-11
\sr A throne was in heaven with one sitting on it. He was the center of every creature and object in heaven. The elders and the living creatures worshipped him as God, the mighty Creator.
\p
\v 1 After these things I, John, saw  in the vision that there was a door open in heaven. The one whose voice was like  a  loud trumpet, the onewho had spoken to me previously, said  to me, "Come up here! I will show you events that must happen later." 
\v 2 Immediately I experienced that  God's Spirit  was specially controlling me. There was a throne there in heaven, and on the throne someone was sitting  and ruling. 
\v 3 His appearance a  brilliant crystalline jasper  jewel and like a  brilliant red carnelian  jewel. Around the throne was a rainbow that  shone like a brilliant green emerald  jewel. 
\v 4 Around the throne there were twenty-four other thrones. On these thrones twenty-four elders were  sitting. They were wearing  pure white garments and had golden crowns on their heads. 
\v 5 From the throne there came lightning and rumblings and thundering. Seven torches of fire were burning in front of the throne. Those  represent the Spirit of God, who has all kinds of  power . 
\v 6 In front of the throne  there was what looked like an ocean  made of glass. It was  clear, like crystal. On each of the four sides of the throne there was a living  creature. Each one was covered with eyes in front and behind. 
\v 7-8 The first living  creature was like a lion. The second living  creature was like an ox. The third living  creature had a face like a man's face. The fourth living creature was like an eagle that was flying. Each of the four living  creatures had six wings. They were covered with eyes, all around  their bodies and under  their wings. Day and night they continually  sing:
\q1 Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty One.
\q1 He is the one who has always existed, 
\q1 who exists now, and who will always exist.
\p
\v 9-10 The living  creatures praise, honor  before the one who sits on the throne, and they worship him, the one who lives forever. They lay their crowns in front of the throne and sing:
\q1
\v 11 Our Lord and God, 
\q1 you are worthy that all beings praise you,
\q1 you are worthy that all beings honor you, and 
\q1 you are worthy that all beings acknowledge 
\q1 that you are the powerful one,
\q1 because you alone created all things.
\q1 Moreover, because you purposed that they should exist, 
\q1 you created them, and as a result they exist.
