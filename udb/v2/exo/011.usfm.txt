\c 11
\s1 Yahweh declared that all the oldest sons of the Egyptians would die, and then the king's officials would plead for the Israelite people to leave Egypt
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh said to Moses. After that, he will let you leave. In fact, he will expel you all.
\v 2 So now speak to all the Israelite people. Tell them to ask all their Egyptian neighbors, both men and women, to give them some silver and gold jewelry."
\v 3 Yahweh made the Egyptians highly respect the Israelite people. In particular, the Egyptian officials and all the rest of the people considered Moses to be a very great man.
\p
\v 4 Then Moses went to the king and said, "This is what Yahweh says: 'About midnight tonight I will go through Egypt,
\v 5 and I will cause all the firstborn sons to die. That will include your oldest son, the oldest sons of the slave women who grind grain, and the oldest sons of everyone else. I will also kill the oldest males of the Egyptians' livestock.
\v 6 When that happens, people all over Egypt will wail loudly. They have never wailed like that before, and they will never wail like that again.
\v 7 But among the Israelite people it will be so quiet that not even a dog will bark! Then you will know for sure that I, Yahweh, distinguish how I act toward the Egyptians and how I act toward the Israelite people.
\v 8 Then all these officials of yours will come and bow down before me and will say, "Please get out of Egypt, you and all the Israelite people!"~' After that, I will leave Egypt!" After Moses very angrily left the king.
\p
\v 9 Then Yahweh said to Moses, "The king will not pay any attention to what you say. The result will be that I will perform more miracles in the land of Egypt."
\p
\v 10 Aaron and Moses performed all these miracles in front of the king, but Yahweh made the king stubborn, and he did not let the Israelite people leave his land.
