\c 5
\s1 The king refused to let the Israelite people go after Moses and Aaron talked to him
\p
\v 1 Then Aaron and Moses said, "Yahweh God, whom we Israelite people worship, says this to you: 'Let my people go to the desert, in order that they may have a feast to honor me!'~"
\v 2 But the king said, "Who is Yahweh? Why should I pay attention to what he says and let the Israelite people  go? I do not know Yahweh! And furthermore, I will not let the Israelite people go!"
\v 3 They."
\v 4 But the king of Egypt said to them Tell those slaves to return to work!"
\v 5 The king also said, "Listen to me! You people who now live in this land are now more numerous than we Egyptians ?"
\s1 The king increased the amount of work the Israelites were forced to do
\p
\v 6 That same day the king commanded the Egyptian slave bosses and the Israelite men supervising the slaves,
\v 7 "Do not continue to give the Israelite people straw for making bricks, as you have done previously. Make them go into the fields and gather straw for themselves.
\v 8 But require them to make the same number of bricks that they did before. Do not decrease the number at all. They are lazy. That is the reason they are asking me to let them go into the desert to offer sacrifices to their god.
\v 9 Force the men to work harder, so that they will not have time to listen to lies from their leaders!"
\p
\v 10 So the slave bosses and supervisors of the slaves went to where the Israelite people were and said to them, "The king has said that he will no longer give you any straw.
\v 11 So you yourselves must go and get straw wherever you can find it. But you must still keep working to make the same number of bricks as before." 
\v 12 So the Israelite people went all over Egypt to find straw.
\v 13 The slave bosses kept telling them insistently, "Finish the work you are required to do each day, making the same amount of bricks as you did before when we gave you straw!"
\v 14 When they were not able to do that, the slave bosses had the Israelite supervisors beaten with sticks, and they asked them, "Why have all the men you are supervising not been able to make the same number of bricks today?"
\s1 The king refused to pay attention to the complaints of the Israelites
\p
\v 15 Then the Israelite supervisors went to the king and complained, saying "Your Majesty, why are you treating us this way?
\v 16 Now they are not giving us any straw for making bricks, but they keep commanding us to make bricks. And now sometimes they beat us. But it is the fault of your own slave bosses that we cannot make as many bricks as before!"
\v 17 But the king said, "You are lazy and do not want to work! That is why you keep saying, 'Allow us to go to the desert and offer sacrifices to Yahweh.'
\v 18 So go and get back to work! We are not going to give you any straw, but you must keep making the same number of bricks!"
\p
\v 19 The Israelite supervisors realized that they were in a difficult situation, because they had been told, "We are not going to decrease the number of bricks you must make each day."
\v 20 As they left the king's palace, they met Aaron and Moses, who were waiting for them there.
\v 21 They said to Aaron and Moses to kill us!"
\p
\v 22 Moses?
\v 23 Ever since I went to the king and told him what you told me to say  them!"
