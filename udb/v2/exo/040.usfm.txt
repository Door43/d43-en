\v 8 Hang the curtains that will surround the courtyard, and hang the curtain at its entrance.
\v 9 Then take the oil for anointing and anoint the Sacred Tent and everything that is in it, to set it apart to me. Then it will be holy, Or: sacred.
\v 10 Also anoint the altar for offering sacrifices that will be completely burned and all the things that will be used with it, and set it apart. Then it also will be holy.
\v 11 Also anoint the washbasin and its base, to set it apart.
\v 12 Then bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the Sacred Tent, and wash them ritually with water.
\v 13 Then put on Aaron his sacred clothes to set him apart, in order that he can serve me as a priest.
\v 14 Also bring his sons there. Put their sacred tunics on them
\v 15 and anoint them just as you anointed their father, in order that they also may serve me by working as priests. By anointing them and their descendants, you will cause them to be priests throughout all coming generations."

\v 31-32 Every time Moses.
\v 33 Following Moses' finished that work.
\s1 Yahweh's brilliant light filled the Sacred Tent
\p
\v 34 Then the tall bright cloud covered the Sacred Tent, and Yahweh's glory filled the Sacred Tent.
\v 35 Because that light was very bright, Moses was not able to enter the Sacred Tent.
\v 36 From that day, whenever the Israelite people wanted to move to another place, they went only when the bright cloud rose from above the Sacred Tent.
\v 37 If the cloud did not rise, they stayed where they were and did not go on until the cloud rose.
\v 38 Wherever they traveled, the bright cloud that indicated Yahweh's presence was above the Sacred Tent during the day, and a bright fire was inside the cloud at night, with the result that all the Israelite people  could see it at any time.
