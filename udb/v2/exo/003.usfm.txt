\c 3
\s1 God talked to Moses from inside a burning bush, and told him to lead his people out of Egypt
\p
\v 1 Moses.
\v 2 One day Yahweh appeared, looking like an angel. The angel appeared as a flame of fire in the midst of a bush that was burning. Moses, Or: I looked at it, and he was surprised that the bush was burning, but it was not burning up.
\v 3 Moses said, "I will go closer and try to see this strange sight! Why is the bush not burning up?"
\p
\v 4 When Yahweh saw that he replied, "Yes, here I am."
\v 5 Yahweh said, "Do not come closer! Because I am God, the ground on which you are standing is holy. So take off your sandals to show respect to me."
\v 6 He said, "I am God, the one your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob worship." So Moses was afraid that God would kill him if he looked at God.
\p
\v 7 Then Yahweh said, "I have seen how cruelly they are treating my people in Egypt. I have heard them wailing for help because of what the slave-drivers are forcing them to do. I know how my people are suffering.
\v 8 So I have come down from heaven to rescue them from the Egyptians . It is the land where the descendants of Canaan, Heth, Amor, Periz, Hiv, and Jebus live.
\v 9 Truly I have now heard my Israelite people crying . I have seen how the Egyptians oppress them.
\v 10 So go back to Egypt. I am sending you to the king, in order that he may permit you to bring my people, the Israelite people, out of Egypt."
\p
\v 11 But Moses
\v 12 He said, "I will be with you. And when you bring my people out of Egypt, all of you will worship me right here on this mountain. That will prove that I am the one who sent you to them."
\p
\v 13 Moses said to God, "If I go to the Israelite people and say to them, 'God, the one your ancestors worshiped, has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?', what shall I say to them?"
\v 14 God replied to Moses, "I am who I am." And he said, "Tell the Israelite people that the one who is named 'I am' has sent me to you."
\p
\v 15 God also said to Moses me.
\v 16 Go to Egypt and gather together the elders, "I have been watching closely what the Egyptian people have done to you.
\v 17 I promise that I will rescue you from being oppressed in Egypt, and I will take you to the land where the descendants of Canaan, Heth, Amor, Periz, Hiv, and Jebus live. It is a land good for raising livestock and growing crops ."~'
\v 18 My people will do what you say. Then you and the Israelite elders will go to the king of Egypt, and you will say to him, 'Yahweh, who is God, the one we Hebrews worship, has revealed himself to us. So now we ask you, allow us to travel for three days to a place in the desert, in order that there we may offer sacrifices to Yahweh, our God.'
\v 19 But I know that the king of Egypt will allow you to go only if he realizes I am more powerful  than he is.
\v 20 So I will use my power  by performing many miracles there. Then he will allow you to leave.
\v 21 When that happens, I will cause the people of Egypt to respect you. The result will be that when you leave Egypt, you will not go empty-handed.
\v 22 At that time, each Israelite woman will ask her Egyptian neighbor and each Egyptian woman who is living in her  the wealth of the Egyptian people."
