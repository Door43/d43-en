\s1 Yahweh sent a terrible disease to afflict the Egyptians' livestock
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Go to the king and say to him, 'This is what Yahweh, the one we Hebrews worship, says: "Allow my people to go, in order that they may worship me.
\v 2 If you still refuse to let them go ,
\v 3 I warn you that I will punish you with my power  by sending a terrible disease on all your animals—on your horses, donkeys, camels, on your cattle, and on your flocks of sheep and goats.
\v 4 But I, Yahweh, will distinguish between what I do to the animals that belong to the Israelite people and what I do to your animals. The result will be that no animal that belongs to the Israelite people will die."~'
\v 5 Tell him that I have determined that tomorrow is the day that I will do this in this land."
\p
\v 6 The next day Yahweh did just what he said that he would do. A terrible disease afflicted all of the Egyptians' animals, and many of them  died. But none of the Israelite people's animals died.
\v 7 The king sent men to investigate, and they were surprised to see that none of the Israelite people's animals had died. But after they reported that to the king, he continued to be stubborn [IDI], and he did not let the Israelite people go.
\s1 Yahweh caused the Egyptian people to be afflicted with boils
\p
\v 8 Then Yahweh said to Aaron and Moses, and let Moses throw them up into the air, in front of the king.
\v 9 The ashes will cause boils to afflict both the Egyptian people and their animals, all over the land."
\v 10 So they both got some ashes spread all over, causing boils to afflict the Egyptian people and their animals. All the boils became open sores.
\v 11 Even the men who worked magic had boils. The result was that they were not able to come to , because the men who worked magic had boils just like all the rest of the Egyptian people.
\v 12 But Yahweh caused the king to continue to be stubborn [IDI]. He did not pay any attention to what they would happen.
\s1 Yahweh sent hail on all the Egyptian people and their animals
\p
\v 13 Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Get up early tomorrow morning. Go and stand in front of the king and tell him that Yahweh God, the one that the Hebrew people worship, says this: 'Let my people go, in order that they may worship me in the desert.
\v 14 If you do not let them go, this time I will punish with plagues not only your officials and the rest of your people, but I will punish you yourself , in order that you will know there is no god like me anywhere in the world.
\v 15 By this time I could have used my power  to strike you and your people with terrible diseases that would have wiped you all from the earth.
\v 16 But I have let you live. The reason I have let you live is to show you my power, with the result that people all over the earth  am.
\v 17 You are still acting proudly and refusing to let my people go.
\v 18 So listen to this: About this time tomorrow I will cause very heavy hail to fall in Egypt. From the time Egypt first became a country, there has never been a hailstorm as bad as this one will be.
\v 19 So you should send a message to everyone to put their cattle, and everything else that they own that is out in the fields, under shelters. The hail will fall on every person and every animal that is out in the fields and that is not brought under a shelter, and they will all die.'~" So Moses did what Yahweh said.
\p
\v 20 Some of the king's officials who heard what Yahweh had said became very afraid. So they brought all their animals and their slaves under shelters.
\v 21 But those who did not pay any attention to what Yahweh had said left their slaves and their animals in the fields.
\v 22 Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Raise your hand up toward the sky, in order that hail will fall all over the land of Egypt—on the people and on their animals and on all the plants in the fields."
\v 23 So Moses stick up toward the sky. And Yahweh sent down hail, all over the land of Egypt. There was also thunder and lightning.
\v 24 While very heavy hail was falling, there was thunder, and lightning struck the ground. There had never been a hailstorm like that since Egypt first became a country.
\v 25 The hail struck everything that was in the fields all over Egypt—every person and every animal. The hail destroyed the plants in the fields and stripped the leaves off the trees.
\v 26 Only in Goshen region, where the Israelite people were living, was there no hail.
\p
\v 27 Then the king sent someone to summon Aaron and Moses, "This time I admit that I have sinned. What Yahweh has done is right, and what I and my people have done is wrong.
\v 28 Pray to Yahweh! We cannot endure any more of this thunder and hail! I will let your people go; they do not have to stay in Egypt any longer."
\p
\v 29 Moses replied, "As soon as I go out of this city, I will lift up my hands and pray to Yahweh. Then the thunder will cease, and no more hail will fall. This will happen in order that you will know that Yahweh, not your gods, controls everything that happens on the earth.
\v 30 But as for you and your officials, I know that you do not yet fear Yahweh God."
\p
\v 31 When the hail fell, the flax was ruined because the buds were forming, and the barley was ruined because its grain was ripe.
\v 32 But none of the wheat was ruined, because its shoots were still very small.
\p
\v 33 So Moses hands toward Yahweh and prayed. Then the thunder and the hail stopped, and the rain also stopped falling on the land of Egypt.
\v 34 But when the king saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had stopped, he sinned again. He and his officials continued to be stubborn [IDI].
\v 35 So, just as Yahweh had predicted by what he told Moses, he did not allow the Israelite people to leave.
