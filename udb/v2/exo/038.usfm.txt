\s1 They made the altar for burning sacrifices, and they made the washbasin
\p
\v 1 Several men helped Bezalel to make the altar for burning sacrifices. They made it from acacia wood. It was square, 7-1 high.
\v 2 They made a projection that looked like a horn on each of the top corners. The projections were carved from the same block of wood that the altar was made of. They covered the whole altar with gold.
\v 3 They made the pans in which to put the greasy ashes from the animal sacrifices. They also made the shovels for cleaning out the ashes. They made the basins and forks for turning the meat as it cooked, and buckets for carrying hot coals. All of those things were made from bronze.
\v 4 They also made a bronze grating to hold the wood and burning coals. They put the grating under the rim that went around the altar. They made it so that it was inside the altar, halfway down.
\v 5 They made bronze rings in which to put the poles for carrying the altar, and fastened them to each of the corners of the altar.
\v 6 They made the poles from acacia wood and covered them with bronze.
\v 7 They put the poles through the rings on each side of the altar. The poles were for carrying the altar.
\v 8 The altar was like an open box. It was made from boards of acacia wood.
\p They made the washbasin and its base from bronze. The bronze was from the mirrors that belonged to the women who worked at the entrance of the Sacred Tent.
\s1 They made curtains to surround the courtyard
\p
\v 9 Around the Sacred Tent Bezalel and his helpers made a courtyard. To form the courtyard, they made curtains of fine white linen. On the south side, the curtain was 150 ft. long.
\v 10 To support the curtain, they made twenty bronze posts and twenty bronze bases, one for under each post. To fasten the curtains to the posts, they made silver hooks, and they made metal rods covered with silver.
\v 11 They made the same kind of curtains, posts, bases and hooks for the north side of the courtyard.
\v 12 On the west side of the courtyard, they made a curtain 75 ft. long. They also made ten posts to support the curtains, and ten bases, with silver hooks and metal rods covered with silver.
\v 13 On the east side, where the entrance is, the courtyard was 75 ft. wide.
\v 14-15 On each side of the entrance, they made a curtain 22-1 wide. On each side they were supported by three posts, and one base under each post.
\v 16 All the curtains around the courtyard were made from fine white linen.
\v 17 All the posts around the courtyard were made of bronze, but the tops were covered with silver. The posts were connected with metal rods covered with silver. The clasps and hooks were made of silver.
\v 18 For the entrance of the courtyard, they made a curtain from fine white linen, and a skilled weaver embroidered it with blue, purple, and red yarn high, just like the other curtains around the courtyard.
\v 19 All the curtains were made of fine white linen. They were supported by four posts, and under each post was a base made of bronze. All the posts around the courtyard were connected with metal rods covered with silver. The clasps were made of silver, and the tops of the posts were covered with silver.
\v 20 All the tent pegs to support the Sacred Tent and the curtains around the courtyard were made of bronze.
\s1 A list of the materials used
\p
\v 21 Here is a list of the amounts of metal used to make the Sacred Tent. Moses told some men from the tribe of Levi to count all the materials used and write down the amounts. Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest, supervised those men.
\v 22 Bezalel the son of Uri and grandson of Hur made all the things that Yahweh commanded Moses to be made.
\v 23 Bezalel's helper was Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. Ahisamach was a skilled engraver who made artistic things. He made fine white linen, and he embroidered designs using blue, purple, or red yarn. He also made other cloth.
\v 24 All the gold that was used to make the Sacred Tent weighed 2,195 pounds. They used the official standard when they weighed the gold.
\v 25 All the silver that the people contributed when the leaders took the census. They also used the official standard when they weighed the silver.
\v 26 All the men who were at least twenty years old were counted, and they each paid the required amount. That was a total of 603,550 men.
\v 27 They used 75 pounds of silver for making, Or: casting each of the one hundred bases to put under the posts to support the curtains of the Sacred Tent.
\v 28 Bezalel and his helpers used the 50 pounds of silver that was not used for the bases to make the rods and the hooks for the posts, and to cover the tops of the posts.
\v 29 The bronze that the people contributed weighed 5,310 pounds.
\v 30 With the bronze Bezalel and his helpers made the bases for under the posts at the entrance of the Sacred Tent. They also made the altar for burning sacrifices, the grating for it and the tools used with it,
\v 31 the bases for the posts that supported the curtains that surrounded the courtyard and the bases for the entrance to the courtyard, and the pegs for the Sacred Tent and for the curtains around the courtyard.
