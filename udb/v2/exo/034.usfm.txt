\c 34
\s1 Yahweh gave Moses another copy of his commandments
\p
\v 1 Yahweh said to Moses, "Cut two slabs of stone that will be like the first slabs, the ones that you broke. Then I will engrave on them the words that were on the first slabs.
\v 2 Get ready tomorrow morning, and come up to the top of Sinai Mountain again to talk with me there.
\v 3 Do not allow anyone to come up with you. I do not want anyone else to be anywhere on the mountain. Do not allow any sheep or cattle to graze at the base of the mountain."
\v 4 So Moses hands up to the top of Sinai Mountain, as Yahweh had commanded.
\v 5 Then Yahweh descended in the tall cloud and stood with Moses.
\v 6 Then Yahweh passed in front of him and proclaimed, "I am Yahweh God. I always act mercifully and kindly toward people. I do not get angry quickly. I truly love people and I do what I promise to do for them, without changing.
\v 7 I love people for thousands of generations. I forgive people for all kinds of sins ."
\p
\v 8 Moses on the ground and worshiped Yahweh.
\v 9 He, and accept us to be people who belong to you forever."
\p
\v 10 Yahweh replied, "Note this: I am going to make a solemn agreement with the Israelite people. As they are watching, I will perform great miracles. They will be miracles that no one has ever done on the earth in any nation. All the people who are near you will see the great things that I, Yahweh, will do. I will do awesome things for you all.
\v 11-12 Each Israelite person must obey what I am commanding you this day. Do not forget that if you do that, I will expel the Amor, Canaan, Heth, Periz, Hiv, and Jebus people-groups from the land. But be careful that you do not make any peace agreements with any of the people who live in the land into which you are going, because if you do that, you will begin to do the evil things that they do. It will be like falling into a trap.
\v 13 You must tear down their altars, destroy their sacred pillars, and cut down the poles that they use to worship their female goddess Asherah.
\v 14 You must worship only me, and not worship any other god, because I, Yahweh, am jealous.
\v 15 Do not make peace agreements with any group that lives in that land. When they worship their gods and offer sacrifices to their gods, and they invite you to join them, do not join them. If you join them, you will eat the food that they sacrifice to their gods, and you will not be faithful to me. You will be like people who commit adultery, who are not being faithful to their spouses .
\v 16 If you take some of their women to be wives for your sons, and these women worship their own gods, they will persuade your sons also to worship their gods.
\p
\v 17 Do not pour melted metal into molds to make statues for you to worship.
\p
\v 18 Each year, during the month of Abib, celebrate the festival of eating bread made without yeast. During that festival, you must not eat bread made with yeast for seven days, as I commanded you, because it was in that month that you left Egypt.
\p
\v 19 Your firstborn sons and the firstborn male animals of your cattle and sheep and goats belong to me.
\v 20 The firstborn of your male donkeys also belong to me. But you may buy them back by offering to me lambs in their place. If you do not do that, you must kill these animals by breaking their necks. You must also buy back your firstborn sons. You must bring an offering to me  each time you come to worship me.
\p
\v 21 Each week you may work for six days, but on the seventh day you must rest. Even during the times when you plow the ground and harvest your crops, you must rest on the seventh day.
\p
\v 22 Each year celebrate the harvest festival, when you begin to harvest the first crop of wheat, and also celebrate the shelters festival, when you finish harvesting the grain and fruit.
\p
\v 23 Three times each year all the men must come to worship me, Yahweh, the God of the Israelite people.
\v 24 I will expel the people-groups that live in the land where you will be, and I will cause your territory to become very large. As a result, no group will try to conquer your country when you come to worship me each year during those three festivals.
\p
\v 25 When you sacrifice an animal  to me, do not offer with it bread that is made with yeast. And during the Passover festival, when you sacrifice lambs, do not keep any of the meat until the next morning.
\p
\v 26 I am Yahweh God. You must bring to my Sacred Tent the first part of the grain that you harvest each year. When you kill a young animal, do not prepare to eat it by boiling it in its mother's milk."
\p
\v 27 Yahweh also said to Moses, "Write down the words that I have told you. By giving you these commands, I have made a solemn agreement with you and with the other Israelite people."
\p
\v 28 Moses engraved on the stone slabs the words of the Ten Commandments, which were part of Yahweh's solemn agreement.
\s1 Moses' face was shining as he returned to the people
\p
\v 29 When Moses face was shining.
\v 30 When Aaron and the other Israelite people saw Moses.
\v 31 But Moses talked with them.
\v 32 Afterwards, all the other Israelite people came near, and he on Sinai Mountain.
\v 33 When Moses face.
\v 34 But whenever Moses to tell them.
\v 35 The Israelite people would see that Moses' went into the Sacred Tent to talk with Yahweh.
