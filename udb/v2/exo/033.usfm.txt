\v 20 But you cannot see my face, because anyone who sees my face will die.
\v 21 But look! Here is a place close to me where you can stand on a large rock.
\v 22 When my glorious presence comes past you, I will put you in a large crevice in the rock, and I will cover your face with my hand until I have passed by.
\v 23 Then I will take my hand away, and you will see my back, but you will not see my face."
