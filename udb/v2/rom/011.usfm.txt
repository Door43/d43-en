\s Romans 11:1-6
\sr God has certainly not rejected all Jews. I am evidence of that. Just like in the past, there is also at the present time a small group of us Jews who have become believers.
\p
\v 1 Because of that, if anyone should ask, "Has God rejected his people the Jews?" I would declare that he certainly has not rejected all of us! You can realize that by remembering that I also belong to the people of Israel. I am a descendant of Abraham, and I belong to the tribe of Benjamin, but God has not rejected me!
\v 2 No, God has not rejected his people, whom he chose long ago to be people whom he would bless in a special way. Remember  in the Scriptures about Elijah when he mistakenly complained to God about the people of Israel, saying:
\v 3 "Lord, they have killed the rest of your prophets, they have destroyed your altars. I am the only one who believes in you who remains alive, and now they are trying to kill me!"
\v 4 God answered him like this: "You"
\v 5 So, similarly, there is also at this time a small group of us Jews who have become believers. God has chosen us to become believers  only because he acts kindly toward us, in ways that we do not deserve.
\v 6 Since it is because he acts kindly toward those whom he chooses, it is not because they have done good things that he has chosen them. If God chose people because they did good deeds, then it would not be because he was acting toward them in a way that they did not deserve.
\s Romans 11:7-10
\sr The Scriptures confirm that the people of Israel as a whole did not find the way of being declared righteous, although those whom God had chosen did find it.
\p
\v 7 Since God chose only some people of Israel, this is what I conclude: made spiritually insensitive, Or: unresponsive.
\v 8 Our fellow Jews are just like the ones about whom Isaiah wrote,
\q God caused their senses to be dull. They have ears, but they cannot understand spiritually.
\q
\v 9 And they remind me of what King David said, when he asked God to cause his enemies' senses to be dull ,
\q Make them stupid , like animals that are caught in snares!
\q May they feel secure because of the things that they enjoy but which will catch them like a trap , with the result that you will destroy them.
\q
\v 10 May their ability to perceive danger be dulled  when there is danger.
\q May you cause them to carry heavy loads on their backs continually as slaves do .
\s Romans 11:11-12
\sr My reply to a query as to whether the result of the Jews' unbelief is a permanent falling away from God is, "No! God is saving many non-Jews to make the Jews envious and thus seek to be saved."
\p
\v 11 Perhaps someone will ask, "When the Jews sinned by not believing in Christ, did it result in their separating themselves from God permanently?" Then I would reply, No, they have certainly not separated themselves from God permanently! What is happening is that because they sinned, God is saving non-Jews in order to cause the Jews to envy the way he blesses non-Jews and so ask Christ to save them.
\v 12 When the Jews sinned !
\s Romans 11:13-16
\sr I highly esteem the work that God has called me to do as an apostle among you non-Jews. I hope that I will make my fellow Jews jealous, and as a result, some of them will be saved.
\p
\v 13 Now it is to you non-Jews that I am saying what follows. I am the one who is the apostle to non-Jews, and I highly esteem this work that God appointed me to do.
\v 14 But I also hope that by my labors I will make my fellow Jews jealous, with the result that some of them will believe and thus be saved.
\v 15 God has rejected most of my fellow Jews because they refused to believe, with the result that he reconciled many other people in the world  It will be as though God is making them alive again after they have been dead!
\v 16 Just like the whole lump of dough will belong to God if people offer to God , so the descendants of our great Jewish ancestors who belonged to God will also some day belong to God.
\s Romans 11:17-24
\sr You non-Jews who trust in Jesus must not despise the Jews whom God has rejected. You must not become proud, but instead beware. God will not spare you if you fall away from him, and he will certainly act kindly toward the Jews if they trust in Christ.
\p
\v 17 God has rejected many of the Jews .
\v 18 However, you non-Jews must not despise the Jews whom God rejected !
\v 19 If one of you then says, "God rejected the Jews ,"
\v 20 I would reply that this is true. However, it is because the Jews did not believe in Christ that they were rejected . As for you, it is only because you believe in Christ that God has accepted you! So do not any of you become proud, but instead beware of what could happen to you!
\v 21 Since God did not spare the unbelieving Jews  who were like a tree's natural branches, he will not spare any of you if you do notkeep trusting in him!
\p
\v 22 Note then, that God acts kindly, but he also acts severely. He has acted severely toward the Jews who have stopped trusting in if you do not keep trusting in him.
\v 23 And if the Jews believe in Christ  into a tree again, because God is able to do that.
\v 24 Each of you non-Jews who were previously separated from God has benefited from the ways in which God blessed the Jews  back into the olive tree to which they originally belonged!
\s Romans 11:25-33
\sr I want you to know that all the people of Israel will some day be saved, as the Scriptures say will happen. God still loves them because of their ancestors. It is his purpose to act mercifully towards them as well as toward all non-Jews.
\p
\v 25 My non-Jewish fellow believers, I certainly want you to understand . Many people of Israel will continue to be stubborn until all the non-Jews whom God has chosen have believed in Jesus.
\v 26 And then all :
\p The one who sets his people free will originate from the place where God dwells .
\p
\v 27 And as God says,
\p The contract that I will make with them is that I will forgive their sins.
\p
\v 28 With regard to the Jews rejecting the good message about Christ, God treats them as enemies, which has benefited you non-Jews. But in regard to their being the people whom God chose, God still loves them because of what he promised their ancestors.
\v 29 He still loves them, because he never changed his mind about the privileges he gave to them and about his choosing them to be his people.
\v 30 You non-Jews once disobeyed God, but now he has acted mercifully towards you because the Jews disobeyed him.
\v 31 Similarly, now they have disobeyed God. The result is that by the very same way in which he acted mercifully towards you, he will act mercifully towards them again.
\v 32 God has declared and proved that all people, both Jews and non-Jews . He has declared that because he wants to act mercifully towards us all.
\s Romans 11:33-36
\sr I marvel at how great God's wisdom and knowledge are, and his decisions and actions toward us!
\p
\v 33 I marvel how vast and great are the wise things that God has done and what he has always known !
\v 34 I remember the Scriptures that say,
\q No one has known what the Lord thinks.
\q
\v 35 And,
\q No one has given anything to God thathe did not previously receive from God! pay back anything to anyone!
\p
\v 36 God is the one who created all things. He is also the one who sustains all things. The reason that he created them was that everything he created might praise him. Mayall people honor him forever! May it be so!
