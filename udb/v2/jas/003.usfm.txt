\s James 3:1-12
\sr Not many of you should become teachers, because God will judge teachers with greater severity than he will judge others. You should all strive to speak rightly, because what you say has a powerful effect on others, and it is often destructive and hypocritical.
\p
\v 1 My fellow believers, not many of you should desire to become teachersof God's truth, because you know that God will judge us, who teach others, more severely than he will judge other people.
\v 2 It is true that we all in many ways do what is wrong .
\v 3 To illustrate, if we put a small metal bit into the mouth of a horse in order to cause the horse to obey us, we can cause the horse to turn and go where we want it to .
\v 4 Think also about ships. Although a ship may be very large and although it can be moved by strong winds  people can direct the ship wherever they wantit to go.
\v 5 Similarly, although our tongues are very small, if we do not control them, we can harm many people by what we proudly say  to burn.
\p
\v 6 Just like a fire damages a forest  who causes us to speak what is evil.
\v 7 Indeed, although people are able to tame them,
\v 8 no person on his own by what we say.
\v 9 We use our tongue to praise God, who is our Lord and Father, but we also use our same tongue to ask God to do evil to people. That is very wrong, because God made people like himself.
\v 10 We praise God, but with our same mouth we also ask for evil things to happen to others. My fellow believers, this should not be!
\v 11 Surely bitter water and good water do not come out of the same spring!
\v 12 My fellow believers, a fig tree cannot .
\s James 3:13-18
\sr If you are jealous of others and self-seeking, do not boast that you are wise. Instead, demonstrate that you are truly wise by doing good and by acting peaceably and compassionately toward others.
\p
\v 13 If any of you thinks  that you are wise and know much, you should always act in a good way to show people that your good deeds are the result of your being truly wise. Being wisehelps us to act gently toward others.
\v 14 But if in your inner beings is not true.
\v 15 Those who have such attitudes are not wise .
\v 16 Keep in mind that people who have such attitudes are unruly anddo all kinds of evil things.
\v 17 But when people are wise , and they are sincere in all they do.
\v 18 Those who act peaceably toward others cause the others to also act peaceably, with the result that they all live together acting righteously .
