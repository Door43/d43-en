\v 1 I, James, am a servant of God and the Lord Jesus Christ. I am writing this letter to all the Jewish people who trust in Christ  who are scattered throughout the world. I send my greetings to you all.
\s James 1:2-4
\sr When you experience difficulties that test whether or not you will continue to trust God, rejoice greatly and keep on bravely enduring them in order that you may become all that God intends you to be.
\p
\v 2 My fellow believers, rejoice greatly, even when you experience various kinds of difficulties.
\v 3 God sometimes allows you to experience difficulties in order to test whether or not you will continue to trust him. Whenever that happens, you need to realize more and more that if you continue to trust him, you will be able to bravely endure difficulties.
\v 4 Keep on enduring difficulties bravely.
\s James 1:5-8
\sr If you want to have wisdom to know what to do when difficulties come, ask God to help you, and firmly trust him.
\p
\v 5 If anyone of you does not know how to act wisely in order to endure difficulties helps all people who ask and does not scold anyone for asking. Those who ask, God will give them wisdom to know what they should do.
\v 6 But when you ask God, you should firmly trust him. You should not doubt that he wants to help you always, because people who keep doubting God are unstable.
\v 7 Indeed, people who doubt should not think that the Lord God will do anything that they request him to do,
\v 8 because they are people who cannot decide whether they will commit themselves to God, and they are unstable in all that they do.
\s James 1:9-11
\sr Believers who are poor and those who are rich should both value highly what God has done for them, rather than focusing on their material resources that will disappear.
\p
\v 9 Believers who are poor should be happy that God considers them very valuable .
\v 10 And believers who are rich should be happy that they have humbled themselves in order to trust in Jesus Christ .
\v 11 When the sun rises, the scorching hot wind dries plants, and their flowers fall and are no longer beautiful. Similarly, rich people will die  while they are busy working, leaving behind their riches.
\s James 1:12
\sr God blesses those who bravely endure difficulties; he will reward them by causing them to live eternally.
\p
\v 12 God is pleased with the people who bravely that he has promised to give to those who love him.
\s James 1:13-15
\sr If people are tempted to do evil, they should not think that it is God who is tempting them. It is their own evil desires that are tempting them to do evil.
\p
\v 13 If people are tempted to do what is evil, they should not think that it is God who is tempting them, because God is totally good. He never tempts anyone to do what is evil, nor can he ever be tempted to do anything evil.
\v 14 But people strongly desire to do what is evil .
\v 15 Then, because they have desired , if they do not turn away from their sinful behavior, they will be separated from God forever.
\s James 1:16-18
\sr Stop thinking wrongly that God tempts you to do evil, because God does only good for us.
\p
\v 16 My fellow believers whom I love, stop deceiving yourselves, thinking that God does what is evil.
\v 17 The truth is that God, our heavenly Father  for us, in order to help us become all that he intends us to be. He is not like all the things in the sky that he created to give light, because they change; that is, they do not shine the same all the time. But God never changes. He is always good.
\v 18 And because he wanted to help us, he gave us spiritual life as a result of our trusting in his true message. So now we have become the first ones of all the people  him.
\s James 1:19-20
\sr Every one of you should eagerly pay attention to God's message and should not speak hastily or be quick to get angry.
\p
\v 19 My fellow believers whom I love, you know  that every one of you should be eager to pay attention to God's true message. You should not hastily speak your own thoughts, nor be quick to get angry,
\v 20 because when any one of you gets angry, you will not be doing the righteous things that God wants youto do.
\s James 1:21-25
\sr So stop doing all kinds of evil, and do what God commands in his message, instead of just listening to it. God approves of those who do what he wants them to do.
\p
\v 21 So stop doing all kinds of evil  if you accept his message.
\v 22 Do what God commands in his message. Do not only listen to it, because people who only listen to it and do not obey it think wrongly that God will save them.
\v 23 Some people hear God's message but do not do what it says .
\v 24 Although he looks at himself, he goes away from the mirror and immediately forgets what he looks like.
\v 25 But other people look closely at God's message, which is perfect and which sets people free to voluntarily do what God wants them to do. And if they continue to examine God's message and do not just hear it and then forget it, but do what God tells them to do, God will bless them because of what they do.
\s James 1:26-27
\sr Those who show compassion on people in need and who do not think or act immorally are those who truly worship God and receive his approval.
\p
\v 26 Some people think that they worship God rightly, but they habitually speak evil talk .
\v 27 One of the things that God has told us to do is to take care of orphans and widows who suffer hardship. Those who do that and who do not think or act immorally like those who do not obey God  worship God, who is our Father, and God approves of them.
