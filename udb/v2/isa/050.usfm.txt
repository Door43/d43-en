\s1 Yahweh's power
\p
\v 1 This is also what Yahweh says:
\q1 "You Israelite children, do not think 
\q2 like some men send away their wives
\q1 after giving them a paper
\q2 on which they state that they were divorcing them!
\q1 I certainly did not  get rid of you like a man who sells his children to get money to pay what he owes.
\q1 No, the reason that I forced you to be exiled
\q2 was to punish you because of the sins that you have committed .
\q1
\v 2 When I came to you to rescue you,
\q2 why did no one answer when I called out to you ?
\q1 Was there no one there ?
\q2 Or, did you think that I do not have the power ?
\q1 Think about this:
\q2 I can speak to a sea and cause it to become dry!
\q1 I can cause rivers to become deserts
\q2 with the result that the fish in the rivers die from thirst and rot.
\q1
\v 3 I cause the sky to become dark,
\q2 as though  it was wearing black clothes because it was mourning because someone had died."
\b
\q1
\v 4 Yahweh our God has given me his wise message 
\q2 in order that I may encourage those who are weary.
\q1 Each morning he awakens me,
\q2 in order that I  me.
\q1
\v 5 Yahweh our God has spoken to me [IDI],
\q2 and I have not rejected what he told me;
\q2 I have accepted  it.
\q1
\v 6 I allowed people to beat me on my back
\q2 and to pull out the whiskers in my beard because they hated me.
\q1 I did not turn away  from them
\q2 when they made fun of me and spat on me.
\q1
\v 7 But, because the Lord our God helps me,
\q2 I will never be humiliated.
\q1 Therefore, I am strongly determined [IDI] to face difficulties,
\q2 and I know that nothing will cause me to be ashamed.
\q1
\v 8 God, the one who vindicates me, is near to me;
\q2 so if anyone  stands in front of me and accuses me in a court,
\q2 he will not be able to show that I have done anything that is wrong.
\q1
\v 9 The Lord our God defends me in court,
\q2 so no one .
\q1 All those who accuse me will disappear
\q2 like .
\b
\q1
\v 10 If you revere Yahweh
\q2 and do what his servant tells you to do,
\q1 even if you are walking in darkness there is no light,
\q2 trust in Yahweh your God  to help you.
\q1
\v 11 But you people who oppose me,
\q2 who would like to throw me into a blazing fire,
\q1 walk in your own fires
\q2 and burn yourselves with your own torches!
\q1 This is what Yahweh will cause to happen to you:
\q2 you will be enduring great torment when you die !
