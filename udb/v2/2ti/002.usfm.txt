\s 2 Timothy 2:1-2
\sr Let God empower you; and entrust the message to loyal people.
\p
\v 1 You are like a son to me. So I urge also that you let God empower you spiritually as a result of Christ Jesus acting kindly toward you.
\v 2 As you do that, remembering that the message that you heard from me is the same message that other people have affirmed to teach others.
\s 2 Timothy 2:3-13
\sr Endure with me what we suffer for Christ Jesus.
\p
\v 3 Endure as I do what we suffer for Christ Jesus, like a good soldier endures what he suffers.
\v 4 You know that soldiers, in order to please their captain, do not become involved in civilian affairs Christ Jesus!
\v 5 Similarly, you know that athletes who do not obey the rules of the contest will not be given . So, like athletes, do all that Christ Jesus has commanded so that God will reward you!
\v 6 You also know that a hard-working farmer should be the first to receive some of the harvest . So, like farmers, work hard for Christ Jesus and expect that God will reward you!
\v 7 Think about what I have just written, because, if you do, the Lord will enable you to understand everything that you need to understand.
\v 8 Endure everything by remembering how Jesus Christ endured it when he suffered. Remember that he was raised  from the dead and God affirmed, Or: declared him to be king as his ancestor King David was. Those are things that I tell to people when I tell them the message about Christ.
\v 9 I am suffering here in prison because some people oppose the good message that I tell. They have even put me in chains as if I were a criminal. Nevertheless, the message from God is not chained .
\v 10 Therefore I willingly endure all that I am suffering for the sake of those whom God has chosen. I do this in order that Christ Jesus will save them, too, and that they will be forever with him in the glorious place where he is.
\v 11 Endure everything as you remember that these words that we all say are trustworthy,
\q1 Since we have stopped behaving as we did in the past,
\q1 as though we died when he died,
\q1 we shall also live with him.
\q1
\v 12 Since we are also patiently enduring what we suffer,
\q1 we shall also rule with him.
\q1 But if we say that we do not know him,
\q1 he also will say that he does not know us.
\q1
\v 13 If we are unfaithful,
\q1 he will treat us just like he promised to do,
\q1 because he can never be untrue to himself.
\s 2 Timothy 2:14-15
\sr Remind teachers about the things that I have told you and charge them not to quarrel; and be sure that you yourself are the kind of person that God will approve of.
\p
\v 14 Those whom you appointed to teach others God's truth, keep reminding them about these things that I have told you. Tell them strongly that, since God knows what they are doing 
\p
\v 15 Do your best what he does.
\s 2 Timothy 2:16-19
\sr Have nothing to do with godless and foolish talk.
\p
\v 16 Stay away from,
\v 17 and because their message will harm people  does. You know Hymenaeus and Philetus. They are two such people who talk in this manner.
\v 18 Specifically, they teach a wrong message; that is, they say wrongly that God will not raise the dead people because he has already given us spiritual life. They claim that our spiritual life is the only new life that we will receive. By saying that, they cause some people
\v 19 not to continue to believe in Christ. However, the congregations of God are strong  'Lord' must stop doing wicked deeds".
\s 2 Timothy 2:20-22
\sr Avoid the bad things that some young people desire to do. Do good instead.
\p
\v 20 In a wealthy person's house there are not only utensils made of gold and of silver, but also utensils made of wood and of clay. The gold and silver utensils are used at special occasions to do great things for the Lord Jesus, and there are those like the teachers of false doctrines, Or: teachings who are not.
\v 21 Therefore, those who rid themselves of what is evil in their lives will be able towork well for the Lord. They will be like utensils  to do any kind of good work.
\v 22 Because of that, you.
\s 2 Timothy 2:23-26
\sr Do not discuss foolish questions but gently instruct those who oppose the true message.
\p
\v 23 Do not talk with anyone who foolishly wants to argue about matters that are not important. Do not talk with them, because you know that when people talk about foolish things, they begin to quarrel.
\v 24 But those who serve the Lord must not quarrel. Instead, they should be kind to all people, they should be able to teach God's truth well, and they should be patient with people.
\v 25 That is, they should gently instruct the true message.
\v 26 In that way they may get free from what is like  a trap set by the devil. The devil has deceived them in order that they might do what he wants them to do.
