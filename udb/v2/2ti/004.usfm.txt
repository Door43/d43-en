\s 2 Timothy 4:1-8
\sr I solemnly charge you to preach the true message and do everything that you ought to do.
\p
\v 1 Christ Jesus is going to come back and judge those who are living when he comes and those who will have died. He will judge them concerning what rewards they deserve, and he will rule everyone. So, knowing that he and God are watching everything that we do, I solemnly command you
\v 2 that you proclaim the true message to people. Always be ready. Rebuke them when they are doing wrong. Tell them what they ought to do. Be very patient while you teach them.
\v 3 Do these things because there will be a time when people will not listen to good teaching. Instead, they will bring in many teachers for themselves who will tell them just what they want to hear . The reason that they will bring in such teachers is that they want to do the evil things that they desire.
\v 4 That is, they will not listen to  what is true, but will listen instead to strange stories from our ancestors.
\v 5 Furthermore, I command that you always control what you think and do. Be willing to endure hardships. Your work should be telling people the message about Christ Jesus. As you serve the Lord, do everything that God has told you to do.
\p
\v 6 Timothy, I say these things to you because as for me, it is as though .
\v 7 And as to telling people the good message and defending it, I have exerted myself thoroughly.
\v 8 So, like people award a prize  he judges people. And not only will he reward me, but he will also reward all those who very much want him to come back.
\s 2 Timothy 4:9-15
\sr Do your best to come to me soon.
\p
\v 9 Do your best to come to me soon.
\v 10 I say that because Demas has left me. He wanted very much the good things that he might enjoy  in this world right now, and so he went to Thessalonica city. Crescens went to serve the Lord in Galatia province, and Titus went to Dalmatia district.
\v 11 Luke is the only one who is still with me of those who were helping me. And when you come, bring Mark with you, because he is useful to help me in my work.
\v 12 Tychicus cannot help me because I sent him to Ephesus city.
\v 13 And when you come, bring the coat that I left with Carpus in Troas city. Also, bring the books, but most of all on which important things are written.
\p
\v 14 Alexander, the man who makes things from metal, did many evil things to me. The Lord will punish him for what he did.
\v 15 So you, too, must beware of him. He will try to destroy your work if he can, because he very much opposes the message that we proclaim.
\s 2 Timothy 4:16-18
\sr The Lord will rescue me from everything that is evil and bring me safely to heaven.
\p
\v 16 When I first defended myselfin court here, no one came along to help defend me. Instead, they all left me. I pray that it will not be counted against  for leaving me.
\v 17 Nevertheless, the Lord was with me and strengthened me. He enabled me to fully preach the message, and all the non-Jewish people in the court  mouth.
\v 18 Therefore, I am sure that the Lord will rescue me from everything that is truly evil and will bring me safely to heaven, where he rules. Praise him forever! Amen!
\s 2 Timothy 4:19-22
\sr Greet my friends there. Your friends here greet you. May the Lord bless you.
\p
\v 19 Greet for me Priscilla and her husband Aquila and the family of Onesiphorus.
\v 20 Erastus stayed in Corinth city. Trophimus, I left in Miletus city because he was sick.
\v 21 Do your best you.
\v 22 I pray that the Lord will help you in your spirit, Timothy, and thathe will act kindly toward all of you believers who are there.
