\s1 Land for the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh
\p
\v 1 The land that was allotted to the two tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh that were descended from Joseph started at the Jordan River, east of the springs at Jericho.
\v 2 It extended west from Jericho to the hilly area near Bethel, which is also called Luz, to Ataroth, at the border of the land where the Arki people-group lived.
\v 3 From there it extended west to the border of the land where the Japhleti people-group lived, and then it extended west to the area near Lower Beth-Horon. From there it extended west to Gezer city and from there to the Mediterranean Sea.
\m
\v 4 That is the land that the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh were allotted.
\m
\v 5 The border of the land that was allotted to the clans of the tribe of Ephraim started at Ataroth-Addar city in the east. It extended to Upper Beth-Horon
\v 6 and from there to the Mediterranean Sea.
\v 7 From Michmethath on the north it extended east to Taanath and from there on to Janoah. From there it extended south to Ataroth city and to Naarah town. From there it extended to Jericho and from there to the Jordan River.
\v 8 The northern border extended from Tappuah west to Kanah Ravine, and ended at the Mediterranean Sea. That was the land that was allotted to the tribe of Ephraim.
\v 9 Many of those towns were really within the area allotted to the tribe of Manasseh.

\v 10 The people of the tribe of Ephraim could not force the Canaan people-group to leave Gezer, so the Canaan people-group still live among the people of the tribe of Ephraim, but the Israelites forced the people of the Canaan people-group to become their slaves.
