\v 48 All of those towns and surrounding villages were in the land that was allotted to the clans in the tribe of Dan.
\s1 Land for Joshua
\p
\v 49 After the Israelite leaders divided the land among the tribes, they allotted some land to Joshua.
\v 50 They allotted to him Timnath-Serah. Yahweh had said that he could have whatever city he wanted, and that was the city that he chose. It was in the hilly region which was allotted to the tribe of Ephraim. Joshua rebuilt the city and lived there.
\p
\v 51 Those were the areas that were allotted to the various tribes of Israel. Eleazar the supreme priest and Joshua and the leaders of each tribe divided up the land while they were all at Shiloh, by casting lots to decide which area each tribe would receive. They did that while Yahweh was watching, at the entrance of the Sacred Tent. In that way they completed dividing up the land.
