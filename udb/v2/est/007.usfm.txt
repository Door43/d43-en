\s1 Haman was executed
\p
\v 1 So the king and Haman went to eat the second banquet that Queen Esther had prepared.
\v 2 As they were drinking wine, the king asked again, "Esther, what do you want me to do for you? Tell me, and I will do it for you. Even if you ask me for half of my kingdom, I will give it to you."
\v 3 Esther replied, "O king, if you are pleased with me, and if you are willing to do what I ask, save me, and save my people. That is what I want you to do for me.
\v 4 It is as though I and my people are cattle that have been sold to be slaughtered. It is as though we have been sold to people who want to completely destroy us. If we had only been sold to people to become their male and female slaves, I would not say anything, because that would have been a matter too small to bother you, the king."
\v 5 Then King Xerxes asked her, "Who is the one who would want to do such a terrible thing? Where is he?"
\v 6 Esther replied, "The man who is our enemy is this evil man Haman!" Then Haman was terrified as he stood in front of the king and queen.
\v 7 The king became extremely angry. He immediately left his wine and got up and went outside into the palace garden to decide what to do. But Haman stayed, in order to plead with Queen Esther that she would spare his life.
\v 8 He threw himself down on the couch where Esther was reclining. But at that moment the king returned from the garden to the room where they had been eating. He saw Haman, and assumed he was preparing to rape Esther. He exclaimed, "Are you going to rape the queen while she is here with me in my own palace?" As soon as the king said that, some officials covered Haman's head, as they did to people who were about to be hanged.
\v 9 Then Harbona, one of the king's personal officials, said, "Outside, near Haman's house, there is a gallows. It is 75 feet high. Haman made it for Mordecai, the man who spared your life!" The king said, "Hang him on it!"
\v 10 So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for hanging Mordecai! And then the king's anger cooled off.
