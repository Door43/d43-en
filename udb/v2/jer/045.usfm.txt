\c 45
\s1 A message for Baruch
\p
\v 1 After Jehoiakim the son of King Josiah had been ruling Judah for almost four years, I, Baruch wrote down all the messages that the prophet Jeremiah had dictated to me. Then Jeremiah gave me a message. He said,
\v 2 "Baruch, Yahweh, the God whom we Israelites worship, has a message for you.
\v 3 You have said, 'Terrible things are happening to me! I have endured much pain already. And now Yahweh is causing me to be very sad, in addition to my having pain. I am exhausted from my groaning, and I am unable to rest!'
\p
\v 4 But Baruch, this is what Yahweh says: 'I will destroy this nation that I established. This nation is like a tree  that I planted and that I will now pull up with its roots.
\v 5 So, should you  desire that people do things to honor you in a special way? Do not desire that. It is true that I will cause all these people to experience a great disaster, but wherever you go, I will protect you, and you will not be killed.'~"
