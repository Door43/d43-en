\c 29
\s1 The agreement made in Moab
\p
\v 1 These are the things that the Israelites were required to do to obey the agreement that Yahweh was making with them. Moses at Sinai Mountain.
\p
\v 2 Moses for yourselves what Yahweh did to the king of Egypt and to his officials and to his entire country.
\v 3 You  that Yahweh performed.
\v 4 But to this day, Yahweh has not enabled you to understand the meaning of all that you have seen and heard.
\v 5 For forty years Yahweh has led you while you traveled through the desert. During that time, your clothes and your sandals have not worn out.
\v 6 You did not have bread to eat or wine or other fermented drinks to drink, but Yahweh took care of you, in order that you would know that he is your God.
\p
\v 7 And when we came to this place, Sihon, the king who ruled in Heshbon city, and Og, the king who ruled the Bashan region, came out with their armies to attack us, but we defeated them.
\v 8 We took their land and divided it among the tribes of Reuben and Gad, and half of the tribe of Manasseh.
\p
\v 9 So, obey faithfully all of this agreement, in order that you will prosper in everything that you do.
\v 10 Today all of you are standing in the presence of Yahweh our God. The leaders of all your tribes, your elders, your officials, all you Israelite men,
\v 11 your wives, your children, and the foreigners who live among you and cut wood for you and carry water for you,
\v 12 you are all here today to agree to accept this solemn agreement with Yahweh.
\v 13 He is making this agreement with you in order to confirm that you are his people, and that he is your God, which is what he promised you, and which is what he solemnly promised to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
\v 14 This solemn agreement is not only with you.
\v 15 He is making this agreement with us who are here today and also with our descendants who are not yet born.
\p
\v 16 You remember the things that our ancestors suffered in Egypt, and how they traveled through the land that belonged to other nations after they came out of Egypt.
\v 17 In those countries they saw those disgusting idols made of wood and stone and decorated with silver and gold.
\v 18 So be sure that no man or woman or family or tribe that is here today turns away from Yahweh our God, to worship.
\p
\v 19 Be sure that no one here today who hears this solemn agreement reassures.
\v 20 Yahweh will not forgive anyone who is stubborn like that. Instead, he will be extremely angry  with that person, and all the curses that I have told you about will happen to that person, until Yahweh gets rid of that person and his family [IDI].
\v 21 From all the tribes of Israel, Yahweh will separate that individual to suffer all the disasters that I have listed in the agreement that states the things that Yahweh will do to curse those who disobey the laws that I have written in this scroll.
\p
\v 22 In future years, your descendants and people from other countries will see the disasters and the illnesses that Yahweh has caused to happen to you.
\v 23 They will see that all your land has been ruined by burning sulfur and salt. Nothing will have been planted. Not even weeds will be there. Your land will resemble Sodom and Gomorrah cities, and Admah and Zeboiim cities, which Yahweh destroyed when he was very angry  with the people who lived there.
\v 24 And the people from those other nations will ask, 'Why did Yahweh do this to this land? Why was he very angry with the people who lived here?'
\p
\v 25 Then other people will reply, 'It is because they refused to obey the agreement that they had made with Yahweh, the God whom their ancestors worshiped, when he brought them out of Egypt.
\v 26 Instead, they served other gods that they had never worshiped before, gods that Yahweh had not told them to worship.
\v 27 So, Yahweh became very angry with the people of this land, and he caused to happen to them all the disasters that their leader warned them about.
\v 28 Yahweh became extremely angry  out of their land, and threw them into another land, and they are still there.'
\p
\v 29 There are some things that Yahweh our God has kept secret, but he has revealed his laws to us, and he expects us and our descendants to obey them forever."
