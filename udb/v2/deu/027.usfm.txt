\c 27
\s1 The stone tablets set up on Ebal Mountain
\p
\v 1 Moses, along with the other Israelite leaders, said this to the people: "Obey all the commandments that I am giving to you today.
\v 2-4 Soon you will cross the Jordan River and enter the land that Yahweh, the God whom our ancestors worshiped, promised to give to you. There, in that very fertile [IDI] land on the west side of the Jordan River, set up some large stones on Ebal Mountain, and cover them with plaster. Then write on those stones all these laws and teachings.
\v 5 And build a stone altar there to offer sacrifices to Yahweh, but do not do any work on those stones with iron tools.
\v 6 The altar that you make to burn sacrifices to Yahweh our God must be made with uncut stones.
\v 7 And there you must sacrifice offerings to restore fellowship with Yahweh, and you must eat your share of those offerings and rejoice in the presence of Yahweh.
\v 8 And, when you write these laws on those stones, you must write them very clearly."
\p
\v 9 Then Moses, along with the priests, said to all the Israelite people, "You Israelite people, be quiet and listen to what I am saying. Today you have become the people who belong to Yahweh, our God.
\v 10 So, you must do what he tells you, and obey all the rules and regulations that I am giving to you today."
\s1 The curses from disobeying God
\p
\v 11 On that same day Moses said to the Israelite people,
\v 12 "After you have crossed over the Jordan River, the tribes of Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin must stand on Gerizim Mountain and request Yahweh to bless the people.
\v 13 And the tribes of Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali must stand on Ebal Mountain and listen to the things that Yahweh will do when he curses the people.
\p
\v 14 The descendants of Levi must shout these words loudly:
