\c 37
\s1 The vision about the valley of dry bones
\p
\v 1 One day Yahweh gave me another vision. In the vision I felt the power  of God on me, and by his Spirit he took me to the middle of a valley. It was full of bones of people who had been killed.
\v 2 He led me to walk back and forth among those bones. I saw that there were very many bones there, bones that were very dry.
\v 3 He asked me, "You human, do you think that these bones can become living people again?"
\p I replied, "Yahweh my Lord, only you know if that can happen."
\p
\v 4 Then he said to me, "Prophesy to these bones. Say to them, 'You dry bones, listen to what Yahweh says.
\v 5 This is what Yahweh the Lord says to you bones: I will put my breath into each of you, and you will become alive again.
\v 6 I will fasten tendons to your bones, and cause your bones to be covered with flesh. I will cover the flesh with skin. Then I will breathe into you, and you will become alive. When that happens, you will know that I, Yahweh, have the power to do what I say that I will do.'~"
\p
\v 7 So I spoke to the bones what Yahweh commanded me to speak. As I was speaking, there was a noise, a rattling sound, and the bones came together, bones joining to each other.
\v 8 While I was looking, I saw tendons fastening to them and flesh covering them, and then skin covered the flesh, but they did not breathe.
\p
\v 9 Then he said to me, "You human, prophesy to the wind. Say to the wind, 'Wind , Yahweh says to you, blow from all four directions. Breathe into these people who have been killed, in order that they can become alive again!'~"
\v 10 So I said what he commanded me to say, and then breath entered them. They became alive and stood up, like a huge army.
\p
\v 11 Then he said to me, "You human, these bones represent all the Israelli people ; our nation is destroyed, Or: finished.'
\v 12 So prophesy and say to them, 'This is what Yahweh the Lord says: My people, it will be as though I will open your graves and cause your corpses to become alive again. I will bring you back to Israel.
\v 13 Then, what that happens, you my people will know that I, Yahweh the Lord, have the power to do what I say that I will do.
\v 14 I will put my Spirit in you, and it will be as though you will become alive again, and I will enable you to live in your own land again. Then you will know that it is I, Yahweh, who said that it would happen and who has caused it to happen. That is what I, Yahweh, declare.'~"
\s1 A prophecy about being one nation with one king
\p
\v 15 Yahweh gave me another message. He said,
\v 16 "You human, take a piece of wood and write on it, 'This represents Judah and all the tribes of Judah.' Then take another piece of wood and write on it, 'This represents Israel and all the tribes of Israel.'
\v 17 Then join them together to become as though they were one piece of wood in your hand.
\p
\v 18 When your fellow Israelites ask you, 'What does this action mean?',
\v 19 tell them, 'This is what Yahweh the Lord says: One of the pieces of wood in Ezekiel's hand represents Israel and all the tribes of Israel. I am joining it to the piece of wood that represents Judah, to form one piece of wood in his hand.'
\v 20 Then Ezekiel, hold up the pieces of wood that you have written on, in order that the people can see them,
\v 21 and say to the people, 'This is what Yahweh the Lord says: I will take you Israelite people out of the countries to which you have been forced to go. I will gather you from all those nations and bring you back to your own land.
\v 22 And I will cause you to again be one nation in that land, on the mountains of Israel. And there will be one king to rule over all of you. Never again will you be two nations or divided into two kingdoms.
\v 23 No longer will you defile yourselves by worshiping idols and disgusting statues of your gods, because I will enable you to quit your sinful behavior and to stop rejecting me. You will be my people, and I will be your God.'
\p
\v 24 Someone who will be like .
\v 25 They will live in the land that I gave to Jacob, who also served me well; they will live in the land where your ancestors lived. They and their children and their grandchildren will live there forever, and the one who will be like  King David will be their king forever.
\v 26 I will make a peace agreement with them; it will be an agreement that will endure forever. I will give again them that land and cause their population to increase. And I will put my temple among them forever.
\v 27 The place where I will live will be among them; I will be their God and they will be my people.
\v 28 Then, when my temple is among them to be there forever, the people of other nations will know that I, Yahweh, cause the Israelite people to be set apart to belong to me."
