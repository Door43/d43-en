\c 47
\s1 The stream that flowed from the temple
\p
\v 1 Then, in the vision, the man brought me back to the entrance of the temple. There I saw water coming out from under the entrance and flowing toward the east. The water was coming from under the south side of the entrance, south of the altar.
\v 2 Then he brought me out through the north gate and led me around to the outer gate on the east side.
\p
\v 3 As the man continued walking toward the east, he had a measuring line in his hand. He measured off 1,750 ft. and then led me through water that covered my ankles.
\v 4 Then he measured off another 1,750 ft. and led me through water that was up to my waist.
\v 5 Then he measured off another 1,750 ft. and led me through water that was now a river that I could not cross, because the water had risen very high, with the result that it would be necessary to swim across it. It was a river that no one could cross by walking across it.
\v 6 Then he asked me, "You human, think about this carefully ."
\p
\v 7 Then he led me to the bank of the river. There I saw many trees growing on each side of the river.
\v 8 He said to me, "This water flows east and goes down into the Dead Sea. And when it enters the Dead Sea, that water becomes fresh.
\v 9 Swarms of fish will live in the water wherever the river flows. There will be lots of fish in the Dead Sea, because the water that flows into it will cause the salt water to become fresh water. Wherever the river flows, everything alongside it will flourish.
\v 10 Fishermen will stand along the riverbank to catch fish. From En-Gedi on the western side to En-Eglaim there will be places to spread fishing nets. There will be many kinds of fish, like there are in the Mediterranean Sea.
\v 11 But the swamps and marshes along the shore will not become fresh; they will be left to make salt.
\v 12 Many kinds of fruit trees will grow on both sides of the river. Their leaves will not wither, and they will always have fruit. They will bear more fruit every month, because the water that comes from the temple flows continually to the trees. Their fruit will be good to eat and their leaves will be good for healing."
\s1 The division of the land
\p
\v 13 In the vision, Yahweh also said this to me: "Here is a list of the twelve tribes of Israel and the territory that each tribe is to receive. The descendants of Joseph will receive two portions; the tribe of Levi will not receive any.
\v 14 Divide the land equally among all of the tribes. I lifted up my arm and solemnly declared to your ancestors that I would give you this land to own permanently.
\p
\v 15 These will be the boundaries of the land:
\li1 On the north side, it will extend from the Mediterranean Sea east along the road to Hethlon, past Lebo-Hamath to Zedad,
\li1
\v 16 Berothah, and Sibraim, which is on the border between Damascus and Hamath, as far as Hazer-Hatticon, which is on the border of the Hauran region.
\v 17 So the boundary will extend from the Mediterranean Sea to Hazar-Enan on the border between Hamath to the north and Damascus to the south. That will be the northern boundary.
\li1
\v 18 On the east side, the boundary will extent between Hauran and Damascus, south along the Jordan River between the Gilead region and the territory of Israel, along the Dead Sea as far as Tamar-Gedi. That will be the eastern boundary.
\li1
\v 19 On the south side, the boundary will extend from Tamar southwest to the springs near Meribah-Kadesh. Then it will extend west along the dry riverbed of Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea. That will be the southern boundary.
\li1
\v 20 On the west side, the boundary will be the Mediterranean Sea, north to a point near Lebo-Hamath.
\p
\v 21 You must distribute this land among yourselves, among the tribes of Israel.
\v 22 You must allot the land to be a permanent possession for yourselves, and also for any foreigners who are living among you and raising their children. You must consider them to be like native born Israelites, and they must be allotted land among the tribes of Israel.
\v 23 Wherever foreigners are living, you must give them some land to belong to them permanently. That is what I, Yahweh the Lord, declare."
