\s1 Job replied again
\p
\v 1 Then Job replied again, saying this:
\q1
\v 2 "Today I am again complaining bitterly to God;
\q2 I continue groaning, but he .
\q1
\v 3 I wish that I knew where I could meet, Or: talk with him,
\q2 so that I could go to the place where he lives.
\q1
\v 4 If I could do that, I would tell him why I know that I am innocent;
\q2 I would tell .
\q1
\v 5 Then I would find out and understand what he would reply to me .
\q1
\v 6 Would he use his great power to argue with me?
\q2 No, he would listen to me carefully.
\q1
\v 7 I am an honest man; so I would be able to discuss things with him fairly,
\q2 and then he would declare that I am innocent, and that decision would endure forever.
\b
\q1
\v 8 But, I have gone to the east, and he is not there;
\q2 I have gone to the west, but I have not found him there.
\q1
\v 9 I have gone north and I have gone south,
\q2 but I have not seen him anywhere.
\q1
\v 10 But he knows how I have conducted my life;
\q2 and when he has finished testing me, he will see that I am as pure as  gold whose impurities have all been burned out.
\q1
\v 11 I  have faithfully walked on the road that he showed me;
\q2 I have not turned away from obeying him.
\q1
\v 12 I have always obeyed what he  commanded;
\q2 I have hidden away in my inner being the words that he has spoken.
\b
\q1
\v 13 He never changes. There is no one who can  stop him from doing what he desires.
\q2 Whatever he wants to do, he does.
\q1
\v 14 And he will finish doing the things that he has planned for me;
\q2 and I am sure that he has thought about doing many things for me.
\q1
\v 15 So I am terrified in his presence;
\q2 when I think about what he can do, I am very afraid .
\q1
\v 16 Almighty God has caused me .
\q1
\v 17 It is as though there is only thick darkness in front of me,
\q2 but it is God that I am afraid of, not the darkness."
