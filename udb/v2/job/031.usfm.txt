\c 31
\s1 Job stated his innocence
\q1
\v 1 "I made to myself a solemn promise
\q2 that I would not look at a young woman with a desire to have sex with her.
\q1
\v 2 If I did not do what I promised,
\q2 what would God who is in heaven ?
\q2 Almighty God would certainly not  give me any reward!
\q1
\v 3 Previously I thought that surely  it was unrighteous people who would experience calamities,
\q2 and that it was those who do what is wrong who would experience disasters.
\q1
\v 4 God certainly sees  everything that I do,
\q2 so why is he causing me to suffer?
\q2 It is as though he counts every step that I take.
\b
\q1
\v 5 I solemnly declare that I have never acted wickedly
\q2 and have never tried to deceive people.
\q1
\v 6 I request only that God judge me fairly ,
\q2 and if he does that, he will know that I am innocent.
\q1
\v 7 If it were true that I have turned away from walking on the right paths,
\q2 or that I ,
\q2 or that my hands have been stained because of my committing sins,
\q1
\v 8 then I hope that when I plant seeds, someone else will harvest the crops and eat them
\q2 and that others will uproot the fruit trees that I planted.
\b
\q1
\v 9 If it were true that I  have been attracted by some other man's wife,
\q2 or that I have hidden myself and waited outside the door to her house,
\q1
\v 10 I hope of another man
\q2 and have sex  with him.
\q1
\v 11 For me to do that would be a terrible sin,
\q2 and the judges would decide that I should be punished.
\q1
\v 12 My committing adultery would produce in me a fire like  the fire that burns people in hell,
\q2 and it would burn up everything that I own.
\b
\q1
\v 13 And, if it were true that I have ever refused to listen to one of my male or female servants
\q2 when they complained to me about something,
\q1
\v 14 God would arise and declare that he would punish me;
\q2 and when he would do that, what would I do?
\q2 If he would ask me about what I have done, what would I answer?
\q1
\v 15 God, who created me, certainly also created my servants ;
\q2 surely he is the one who formed them and me in our mothers' wombs ;
\q2 so we all should behave toward each other equally.
\b
\q1
\v 16-18 I have guided orphans from the time that they were born;
\q2 I have taken care of them since they were young.
\q1 So, if it were true that I ate all my food myself and did not share some of it with orphans,
\q2 or that I refused to give poor people the things that they wanted,
\q2 or that I caused widows to live in despair,
\q1
\v 19 or that I had seen people die from cold because they had no clothes,
\q2 or that I had seen poor people who did not have clothes to keep them warm,
\q1
\v 20 and they were not able to become warm from clothes made from the wool of my sheep
\q2 with the result that they thanked me for it,
\q1
\v 21 or if it were true that I threatened to strike any orphan
\q2 because I knew that the elders at the city gates would enable me to win;
\q1
\v 22 if those things were true about me, I hope that my shoulder blade would be torn out
\q2 and my arm be torn from my shoulder.
\q1
\v 23 I always feared that God would cause me to experience a great disaster if I did any of those evil things,
\q2 and I would not have been able to endure the powerful things that he would do to punish me.
\b
\q1
\v 24 If it were true that I trusted in my gold,
\q1
\v 25 or that I rejoiced because I had acquired many things
\q2 and had become very rich,
\q1
\v 26 or that I looked at the sun when it was shining
\q2 or looked at the beautiful moon
\q1
\v 27 and I  had been tempted to worship them
\q2 by kissing my hand to revere them,
\q1
\v 28 those things also would be sins for which the judges would say that I must be punished,
\q2 because I would have been rejecting God by doing those things.
\b
\q1
\v 29-30 It is not true that I  sinned by requesting God to curse people who hated me
\q2 and to cause them to die;
\q1 or that I was glad when they were ruined
\q2 and rejoiced when they experienced disasters ;
\q1
\v 31-32 or that I never welcomed travelers to stay in my tent
\q2 and did not open my doors to them, but forced them to sleep in the streets.
\q2 All the men who work for me certainly know that !
\q1
\v 33 Some people try to hide their sins,
\q2 but I have never done that;
\q1
\v 34 and I never remained silent and refused to go outside
\q2 because I was very afraid of what people would say about me,
\q2 and that they would hate me.
\b
\q1
\v 35 I wish that there was someone who would hear what I am saying!
\q2 I solemnly declare that all that I have said is true.
\q1 I wish that those who oppose me would write down on a scroll the evil things that they say that I did.
\q1
\v 36 If they did that, I would wear that scroll on my shoulder, or wear it on top of my head, in order that everyone could see it.
\q1
\v 37 I would tell God everything that I have done,
\q2 and I would approach him like a ruler would, without being afraid.
\b
\q1
\v 38 If it were true that I have stolen land,
\q2 with the result that it was as though its furrows cried out to accuse me;
\q1
\v 39 or that I have eaten the crops that grew in someone else's fields
\q2 without paying for those crops,
\q2 with the result that those farmers who grew those crops died from hunger;
\q1
\v 40 then I wish that thorns would grow in my fields instead of wheat,
\q2 and that bad weeds would grow instead of barley!"
\b
\q1 That is the end of what Job said to his three friends.
