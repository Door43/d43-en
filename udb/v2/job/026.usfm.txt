\s1 Job replied to Bildad again

\v 1 Job replied to Bildad, saying this sarcastically:
\q1
\v 2 "I am a very weak and helpless man;
\q2 and you certainly have helped me 
\q1
\v 3 You certainly have counseled me wellâ€”me, who am not wise at all.
\q1 You surely have given a lot of very good advice to me.
\q1
\v 4 Who helped you to say all those great things?
\q2 Who inspired you to speak like you did?"
\s1 Bildad replied
\q1
\v 5 "Because the spirits of dead people are afraid,
\q2 they tremble in the waters that are deep under the earth.
\q1
\v 6 God knows all about those who are in the place of the dead;
\q2 there is nothing down there that prevents God from seeing what is there.
\q1
\v 7 God stretched out the earth over the huge empty space
\q2 and caused the earth to have nothing to support it.
\q1
\v 8 He fills the thick clouds with water
\q2 and prevents that water from bursting the clouds.
\q1
\v 9 He causes clouds to obscure the moon.
\q1
\v 10 He separated the light from the darkness
\q2 and put the horizon to mark the place where the night ends and the daytime begins.
\q1
\v 11 When he is angry, it is as though he rebukes the pillars that hold up the sky.
\q2 They are shocked, and they tremble.
\q1
\v 12 By his power he calmed the sea;
\q2 by his skill he destroyed Rahab, the huge sea monster.
\q1
\v 13 By his breath he caused the sky to be bright;
\q2 by his hand he killed the great dragon in the sea.
\q1
\v 14 But those events show only a small amount of his power;
\q2 it is as though we are hearing only whispers of his powerful voice.
\q2 When we hear thunder, we say, 'Who can really understand how great his power is?'~"
