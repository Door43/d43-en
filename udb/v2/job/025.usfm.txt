\v 1 Then Bildad also replied, saying this:
\q1
\v 2 "God is very powerful; everyone should have an awesome respect for him;
\q2 he causes everything to be peaceful high up in heaven.
\q1
\v 3 Can anyone count the angels who are in his army in heaven?
\q2 Is there any place where his light does not shine?
\q1
\v 4 So, how can God consider any person to be righteous?
\q2 How can any human being be truly pure?
\q1
\v 5 Consider this: God does not even consider the full moon to be bright,
\q2 and he does not consider the stars to be spotless.
\q1
\v 6 So, what about humans?
\q2 They are as insignificant as  maggots.
\q2 God does not think more highly of people than he thinks of worms."
