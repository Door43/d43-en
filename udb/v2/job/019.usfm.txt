\s1 Job replied again
\p
\v 1 Then Job replied saying this:
\q1
\v 2 "How long will you three torment me
\q2 and crush my spirit by saying to me that I am wicked?
\q1
\v 3 You have already insulted me many  times;
\q2 are you not ashamed for saying these things to me?
\q1
\v 4 Even if it were true that I have done things that are wrong,
\q2 I have not injured you!
\q1
\v 5 If you truly think that you are better than I am,
\q2 and you think that my being miserable now proves that I am guilty,
\q1
\v 6 you need to realize that it is God who has caused me to suffer.
\q2 It is as though he has trapped me with his net.
\b
\q1
\v 7 I cry out, 'People are murdering me!',
\q2 but no one answers me.
\q1 I call out loudly, but there is no one, not even God, who acts fairly toward me.
\q1
\v 8 It is as though  God has blocked my road,
\q2 with the result that I cannot go through;
\q2 it is as though he has forced me to try to find the road in the darkness.
\q1
\v 9 He has taken away my good reputation;
\q2 it is as though he removed  a crown from my head.
\q1
\v 10 He batters me from every side, and I will soon die.
\q2 He has caused me to no longer confidently expect him to do good things for me.
\q1
\v 11 He attacks me because he is extremely angry with me ,
\q2 and he considers that I am his enemy.
\q1
\v 12 It is as though he sends his army to attack me;
\q2 they surround my tent,
\q2 preparing to attack me.
\b
\q1
\v 13 God has caused my brothers to abandon me,
\q2 and all those who know me act like strangers to me.
\q1
\v 14 All my relatives and good friends have left me.
\q1
\v 15 The people who were guests in my house have forgotten me,
\q2 and my female servants consider that I am a stranger or that I am a foreigner.
\q1
\v 16 When I summon my servants, they do not answer;
\q2 I plead with them to come to help me, but they do not come.
\q1
\v 17 My wife does not want to come close to me because my breath smells very bad,
\q2 and even my brothers detest me.
\q1
\v 18 Even young children despise me;
\q2 when I stand up to talk to them, they laugh at me.
\q1
\v 19 My dearest friends detest me,
\q2 and those whom I love very much have turned against me.
\q1
\v 20 My body is only skin and bones;
\q2 I am barely alive [IDI].
\b
\q1
\v 21 I plead with you, my three friends, pity me,
\q2 because God has struck .
\q1
\v 22 Why do you cause me to suffer like God does?
\q2 Why do you continue to slander  me?
\b
\q1
\v 23 I wish that someone would take these words of mine
\q2 and write them permanently in a book in order that people can read them.
\q1
\v 24 Or else, I wish that he would carve them on a rock with a chisel
\q2 in order that they would last forever.
\q1
\v 25 But I know that the one who vindicates me in court is alive,
\q2 and that some day he will stand here on the earth and make the final decision about whether I deserve to be punished.
\q1
\v 26 And even after diseases have eaten away my skin,
\q2 while I still have my body, I will see God.
\q1
\v 27 I will see him myself;
\q2 I will see him with my own eyes!
\q2 My emotions are overwhelmed as I think about that!
\b
\q1
\v 28 If you three men say, 'What more can we do cause him to suffer?'
\q2 and if you say, 'He is the one who has caused his own troubles,'
\q1
\v 29 you should be afraid that God will punish  you;
\q1 he punishes those like you with whom he is angry;
\q2 and when that happens, you will know that there is someone who judges people."
