\c 13
\s1 Job continued his reply
\q1
\v 1 "Hey, I  have seen everything that you have seen,
\q2 and I have heard and understood all that you have said.
\q1
\v 2 What you know, I also know;
\q2 I do not know less than you.
\q1
\v 3 But I would like to speak to Almighty God, not to you;
\q2 I would like to argue with him and prove that I am innocent.
\q1
\v 4 As for you, you tell lies and do not allow people to know what is the truth,
\q2 like someone covers up a bad surface of a wall with whitewash .
\q1 You are all like doctors  that give people useless medicines.
\q1
\v 5 I wish that you would be silent;
\q2 that would be the wisest thing that you could do.
\q1
\v 6 Listen to what I will say to you now;
\q2 listen while I am saying what is true about myself.
\q1
\v 7 Are you telling lies to help God,
\q2 and saying what is deceitful in order to benefit him?
\q1
\v 8 Are you trying to defend him?
\q2 Are you trying to prove in a court that he is innocent?
\q1
\v 9 If he looks closely, will he find that everything that you have done is good?
\q2 Or can you deceive him, like you deceive other people?
\q1
\v 10 If you secretly say things to cause God to act favorably toward you,
\q2 he will surely rebuke you.
\q1
\v 11 He will certainly ,
\q2 you will become extremely afraid.
\q1
\v 12 The things that you say that you think are wise are as useless as  as ashes;
\q2 what you say to defend yourselves is no better than  clay that quickly crumbles.
\b
\q1
\v 13 So, be quiet and allow me to speak,
\q2 and then it will not matter what happens to me.
\q1
\v 14 I am ready to endure anything;
\q2 I am even willing to risk being executed [IDI, DOU] for what I will say.
\q1
\v 15 If God kills me, then I will not have anyone else whom I can confidently expect to help me,
\q2 but I am going to defend my behavior in his presence anyway.
\q1
\v 16 No wicked person would dare to stand in the presence of God,
\q1 but because I say that I have not done things that are wrong,
\q2 perhaps, if I can prove that to God, he will save me."
\s1 Job asks God to tell him what his charges are
\q1
\v 17 "God, listen very carefully to what I say .
\q1
\v 18 I am ready to prove that I am innocent,
\q2 and I know that you also will declare that I am not guilty.
\q1
\v 19 I certainly do not think  that you or anyone else will say that what I say is not true;
\q2 if anyone did that, I would be silent and die.
\b
\q1
\v 20 I am requesting you to do two things for me;
\q2 if you do them, I will not hide from you.
\q1
\v 21 The first thing that I request is that you stop punishing [IDI] me;
\q2 and the second thing that I request is that you stop causing me to be very terrified.
\q1
\v 22 You speak first, and then I will reply;
\q2 or allow me to speak first, and then you reply.
\q1
\v 23 What have I done that is wrong? What sins have I committed?
\q2 Show me how I have disobeyed you.
\q1
\v 24 Why do you refuse to be friendly with me [IDI]?
\q2 Why do you act toward me as though I am your enemy?
\q1
\v 25 I am as insignificant as  a leaf that the wind blows;
\q2 why are you trying to cause me to be afraid ?
\q1 Why are you pursuing me?
\q2 Am I useless, nothing more than a bit of dry chaff ?
\q1
\v 26 It seems that you are writing things to accuse me of doing things that are wrong,
\q2 even recalling bad things that I did when I was young.
\q1
\v 27 It is as though you have put my feet in stocks,
\q2 and you watch me wherever I walk;
\q2 It is as though you even look closely at my footprints to see where I have gone.
\q1
\v 28 As a result, my body is decaying like  rotten wood,
\q2 like a piece of cloth that is eaten by larvae of moths."
