\c 7
\s1 Job complains to God
\q1
\v 1 "People need to work hard on this earth, like soldiers do;
\q1 all during the time that we are alive, we work hard  do.
\q1
\v 2 We are like  slaves who keep wanting to be in the cool shade,
\q2 and we are like  workers who are waiting to be paid.
\q1
\v 3 God has given me many months in which I think that it is useless to remain alive;
\q1 he has allotted to me many nights during which I feel miserable.
\q1
\v 4 When I lie down at night I say, 'How long will it be until I get up?'
\q2 But the nights are long, and I toss on my bed until the dawn.
\q1
\v 5 My body is covered with maggots and scabs;
\q2 pus oozes out of my open sores.
\b
\q1
\v 6 My days pass as quickly as a weaver's shuttle,
\q2 and they end without my confidently expecting that things will be better the next day.
\q1
\v 7 God, do not forget that my life is as empty as a breath ;
\q2 I think that I  will never again experience being happy.
\q1
\v 8 God, you  see me now,
\q2 but some day you will not see me anymore.
\q2 You will search for me, but I will be gone because I will be dead.
\q1
\v 9 Like  and then disappear,
\q2 people die and descend to the place where dead people are, and they do not return;
\q1
\v 10 they never return to their houses,
\q2 and people among whom they lived do not remember them anymore.
\b
\q1
\v 11 So, I will not be silent;
\q2 while I am suffering I will speak;
\q1 I will complain to God about what has happened to me
\q2 because I  am very angry.
\q1
\v 12 God, why do you watch closely what I am doing?
\q2 Do you think that I am a dangerous sea monster?
\q1
\v 13 When I lie down at night, I say to myself, 'I will be comforted here on my bed;
\q2 my pain will be less while I am sleeping.'
\q1
\v 14 But then you give me dreams that cause me to be afraid;
\q2 you give me visions that terrify me,
\q1
\v 15 with the result that I would prefer to die because of being strangled
\q2 than to continue to be alive being only a bunch of bones.
\q1
\v 16 I detest continuing to be alive; I do not want to live for many years .
\q2 Allow me to be alone, because I will be alive for only a very short time .
\b
\q1
\v 17 We human beings are not very important;
\q2 so, why do you pay a lot of attention to us ?
\q1
\v 18 You look at us every morning to see what we are doing,
\q2 and examine us every moment to see if we are doing what is right.
\q1
\v 19 When will you stop looking at me and leave me alone for a little time, long enough to swallow my spit?
\q1
\v 20 Why do you watch me constantly?
\q2 If I sin, that certainly does not harm you!
\q1 Why have you set me up like a target to shoot at?
\q2 Do you consider me to be a heavy load that you are forced to carry?
\q1
\v 21 If I have sinned, are you not able to forgive me for my sins
\q2 and the things that I have done that are wrong?
\q1 Soon I will lie in my grave;
\q2 you will search for me, but you will not find me because I will be dead and gone."
