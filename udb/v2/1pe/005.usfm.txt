\s 1 Peter 5:1-7
\sr You elders must care for your congregations with enthusiasm, not being greedy for money or acting like bosses. Instead, be examples to them.
\p
\v 1  Now I will say this to those among you who are elders in the congregations: I also am an elder. I am one  of those who saw Christ when he suffered, and I am also one who will share some of the glory that Christ has in heaven. 
\v 2  I appeal to you elders to take care of the people who are in your  congregations . 
\v 3 Do not act like domineering  bosses over the people  to you, but instead be examples to them by the way in which you conduct your lives. 
\v 4  If you do that, when Jesus, who is  like our chief shepherd . That reward will be like the wreaths  that are given to victorious athletes, but your reward will never wither  like wreaths do.
\p
\v 5  Now I will say this to you young men  and women. Just like married men and women are to be subject humbly toward each other, because this proverb is true,
\q God opposes people who are proud, 
but he acts kindly toward those who are humble.
\p
\v 6 Therefore, realizing that God has great power  to punish proud people, humble yourselves in order that he may honor you at the time that  he has determined. 
\v 7 Because he takes care of you, let him take care of all the things that you are worried about.
\s 1 Peter 5:8-11
\sr Resist the devil by always being alert and trusting in Christ's message, remembering that believers everywhere are also suffering as you are.
\p
\v 8 Always be alert with your full attention, because the devil, who is your enemy, is going a lion who roars as it prowls around, seeking someone to  kill and devour. 
\v 9 You must resist him by continuing to firmly trust in  Christ and his message, remembering that your fellow believers all over the world are experiencing similar sufferings  that the devil is bringing to them. 
\v 10 God is the one who kindly helps us in every  situation, and  he is the one who chose us to share his eternal glory, and he will support you  emotionally. 
\v 11  I pray
\s 1 Peter 5:12-14
