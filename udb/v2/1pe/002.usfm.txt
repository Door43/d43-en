\s 1 Peter 2:1-10
\sr Do not act maliciously or be hypocrites. God is joining you together into a holy group indwelt by his Spirit, to do deeds that are pleasing to him.
\p
\v 1 Therefore, do not act maliciously in any way or deceive others. Do not be a hypocrite others. Do not ever slander anyone.
\v 2 Just like newborn babies long for their mothers' pure milk , you should long for God's spiritual truth, so that by learning it you may become spiritually mature. You need to do this until the day when God will free you completely from all the evil in this world.
\v 3 Also, you need to do this because you have experienced that the Lord acts in a good way toward you.
\p
\v 4 You have come to the Lord Jesus. He is like an important stone , but God chose him and considers him to be very precious.
\v 5 And like men build houses with stones , God is causing you to be joined together into a group in which God's Spirit lives, in order that you, because of what Jesus Christ did for us, might, like priests who offer sacrifices, do deeds that are pleasing to God.
\v 6 What Isaiah wrote in the Scriptures shows us that this is true. He wrote these words that God said,
\q Note this well: I am placing in Jerusalem , and those who believe in him will never be disappointed.
\p
\v 7 Therefore, God will honor you who believe in Jesus. But those who refuse to believe in him are like the builders that this Scripture talks about,
\q The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.
\p
\v 8 And it is also written  in the Scriptures:
\q He will be like a stone that causes people to stumble,
\q and like a rock that people trip over.
\p Just as people are injured when they stumble over a rock,
\q people who disobey the message about Jesus are injured spiritually,
\q and that is what God determined would happen to them.
\p
\v 9 But you are people whom God has chosen to belong to him. You are a group that represents God like priests do, and you rule with God . That is, he has called you out of spiritual darkness into spiritual light.
\v 10 What the prophet Hosea wrote is true of you,
\q Formerly, you were not a people who had a relationship with God,
\q But now you are God's people.
\q At one time God had not acted mercifully toward you,
\q But now he has acted mercifully toward you.
\s 1 Peter 2:11-12
\sr Avoid obeying your self-directed natures. Conduct your lives in a good way among unbelievers.
\p
\v 11 You people whom I love, I urge you to consider that you are like foreigners  your souls.
\v 12 Keep conducting your lives in a good way among those who do not know God. If you do that, although they may accuse you, saying that you are people who do what is evil, they will see your good behavior, and at the time when God comes to judge people, they will give honor to him.
\s 1 Peter 2:13-17
\sr Submit yourselves to human authorities, and act as servants of God should.
\p
\v 13 For the sake of the Lord Jesus, submit yourselves to every human authority. That includes submitting yourselves to the king, who is the most important authority,
\v 14 and to governors, who are sent by the king  to punish those who do what is wrong and to commend, Or: honor those who do what is right.
\v 15 What God wants is that by your doing only what is good you will cause that foolish people who do not know God will be unable to say things to condemn you.
\v 16 Conduct your lives as though you were free from having to obey authorities, but do not think 'Because I am free from having to obey authorities, I can do what is evil.' Instead, act as servants of God should.
\v 17 Act respectfully toward everyone. Love all your fellow believers. Revere God, and honor the king.
\s 1 Peter 2:18-25
\sr You slaves must submit yourselves to your masters, even if they mistreat you. Imitate Christ in the way in which he suffered unjustly.
\p
\v 18 You slaves who are believers, submit yourselves to your masters and completely respect them. Submit yourselves not only to those who act in a good and kind  way towards you, but also submit yourselves to those who act in a harsh way towards you.
\v 19 You should do that because God is pleased with those who, knowing that he is aware of what is happening to them, endure the pain that they suffer because of being treated unjustly by their masters .
\v 20 God will certainly not  you.
\v 21 One of the reasons why God chose you is that you would suffer. When Christ suffered for you he became an example for you, in order that you would imitate what he did.
\v 22 Remember how Christ conducted himself,
\q He never sinned,
\q And he never said  anything to deceive people.
\q1
\v 23 When people insulted him, he did not insult them in return.
\q1 When people caused him to suffer, he did not threaten to get revenge.
\q1 Instead, he decided to let God, who always judges justly, prove that he was innocent.
\q1
\v 24 He himself endured the punishment for our sins in his body when he died on the cross,
\q1 in order that we would stop sinning  and start living righteous lives.
\p It is because he was wounded  from being sinful, as people's bodies are healed from being sick.
\v 25 Truly you were like sheep that had gone astray .
