\s 1 Timothy 6:1-21
\sr Live according to the Christian doctrine and complete what I have commanded.
\p
\v 1 As for slaves  that which  we apostles teach, because they will see that the slaves are being respectful of their masters.
\p
\v 2  Slaves who have masters who believe  in Christ must not be disrespectful to their masters just because their masters are fellow believers. Instead, they should serve  their masters even better because  their masters are fellow believers whom  God loves and who benefit when  the slaves serve them well.
\p
As you teach these things  to your congregation, exhort  people that they do them.
\p
\v 3 Some people teach things that are different. What they teach does not agree with. 
\v 4 Such people are very proud and do not understand anything . 
\v 5 Their whole way of thinking has become completely wrong  because they have rejected the true  doctrine they will gain a lot of  money.
\p
\v 6  Well, we truly do gain great  benefit when we conduct our lives in a  godly manner and we are content  with what we have. 
\v 7 We brought nothing into the world  when we were born, and we cannot take anything out  of it when we die, 
\v 8 so if we have food and clothing, we should be satisfied with these. 
\v 9 But some people strongly desire to be rich. As a result, they  do wrong things to get money, and this will cause them to be caught as animals get caught in traps. They foolishly desire many things, and those desires cause them to get hurt. And God will completely reject  them! 
\v 10 All kinds of bad things will happen to people who .
\p
\v 11 But as for you, who are a man who  serves God, keep completely away from such love of money. Decide that you will trust  God, and that you will love  others. Endure  difficult circumstances. Always be gentle  with people. 
\v 12 Try earnestly and with all your energy.
\p
\v 13 God, who gives life to all things, knows everything that you do. Christ Jesus also knows everything that you do. He strongly declared what was true when  he was on trial before Pontius Pilate. 
\v 14 I command you that as you keep all that in mind, in every way you hold fast, until he comes again. 
\v 15  Remember that God will cause Jesus to come again at the proper time. He is awesome! He is the only Ruler! He rules over all other people who rule! 
\v 16 He is the only one who will never die, and he lives in heaven in light  that is so bright that no one can approach it! He is the one whom no person has ever seen and whom no person is able to see! My desire is that all people will honor him and that he  will rule powerfully 
\p
\v 17 Tell  the believers who are rich here in this present world that they should not be proud, and that they should not trust in their many  possessions, because they cannot be certain  how long they will have them. Teach them that they should nottrust in their wealth. Instead, they should trust in God. He is the one who abundantly gives us everything we have in order that we may enjoy it. 
\v 18 Also, tell them that their good deeds must be as plentiful  as their money. Specifically, they should share very generously with others  what they have. 
\v 19 If they do that, Jesus will give them a great reward. It will be as though they are storing up  in heaven much treasure for themselves that will be a good  basis on which they may rely for. By doing this they will have the life that is the real life.
\p
\v 20 Timothy, faithfully proclaim that they have 'true knowledge' but who say things that oppose, Or: contradict  our true teaching. 
\v 21 Keep completely away from such teaching. Remember that some people who claim  to have this 'knowledge' have stopped believing what  all of us believe.
\p
I desire that God continue to act kindly toward you all.
