\c 5
\s 1 Timothy 5:1-25
\sr I instruct you how to act toward various groups in the church.
\p
\v 1 Do not rebuke your brothers.
\v 2 Exhort your sisters; but you must act in a completely proper way as you do that.
\p
\v 3 Make sure that the congregation respects widows who have no one to care for them. They should respect them by taking care of them.
\v 4 If a widow has children or grandchildren, these children or grandchildren should learn that they are to respect their own family first. By doing that they can repay their parents and grandparents for all that they did for them when they were young, because doing that pleases God.
\v 5 The widows who are really alone and have no one to help them confidently expect that God will help them. So night and day they pray, earnestly asking  God that he will help them and others.
\v 6 But widows who just want to have a lot of pleasure are spiritually  dead, although they are physically alive.
\v 7 And tell the congregation that the children or grandchildren should do these things in order that no one can criticize the believers.
\v 8 If anyone does not take care of those who live in his own house, and especially if he does not take care of his own family, he has denied what we believe and we should consider that he is worse than a person who does not believe in Christ.
\p
\v 9 You have a list of widows who will do work for the congregation and receive money. Put women's names on the list only if they are more than sixty years old, and if they were faithful to their husbands.
\v 10 Put women's names on that list only if it is known that they have zealously other believers.
\v 11 As for younger widows, do not put their names on that list, because they promise to do work for the congregation, but instead of doing that, they usually want to marry again  when they have strong desires.
\v 12 If that happens, they may become guilty of not having done what they had promised to do for the congregation 
\v 13 In addition, they generally become lazy. Specifically, as they just go about from house to house they also begin to gossip and to meddle in other people's affairs, saying what they should not say.
\v 14 So I advise that instead of putting the names of younger widows on the list, they marry again, that they bear children, that they manage their homes well, and that they do nothing about which an enemy can say bad things about them.
\v 15 I say this because some younger widows have stopped obeying Christ in order to obey Satan.
\p
\v 16 If any woman who believes in Christ has widows in her household to take care of their needs. The congregation should take care of the widows who truly have no one to care for them.
\p
\v 17 Each congregation should pay well the elders who lead well. They should greatly honor them, especially those who preach and those who teach.
\v 18 Long ago Moses wrote in the Scriptures, "While an ox is threshinggrain, you must not tie its mouth so that it cannot eat the grain," and Jesus said, "People should pay those who work for their benefit." So we know that congregations should support their elders.
\p
\v 19 When some person accuses an elder about doing wrong, accept what he says only if there are at least two or three persons who testify they saw him do that wrong.
\p
\v 20 But as for any elder who repeatedly sins, rebuke him before the whole congregation, in order that the rest of the elders will be afraid to sin.
\p
\v 21 I solemnly tell you that as you keep in mind that God and Christ Jesus and the holy angels know everything that you do, obey these commands about elders! As you consider what others say about an elder doing wrong, do not easily decide that what they say is true. And treat them all equally.
\p
\v 22 Do not be in a hurry to put your hands on a man to set him apart as an elder. Wait until you have examined him to see how he conducts his life, because God will consider that you are responsible if you approve a person who sins, saying that he should become an elder. Keep your life pure in every way.
\v 23 And Timothy, no longer drink only water, but instead, drink a little wine also, because that may help to cure your stomach's frequent illnesses.
\v 24 I tell you not to set apart. But some people sin openly, so that people know what they have done before anyone examines them.
\v 25 Similarly, although some people do good deeds openly, with the result that people know what they have done, some people do good deeds secretly, yet the good deeds that they have done cannot remain secret either.
