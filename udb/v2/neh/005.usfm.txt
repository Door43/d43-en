\c 5
\s1 Nehemiah helped the oppressed people
\p
\v 1 Later, many of the men and their wives complained about what some of the other Jews were doing.
\v 2 Some of them said, "We have many children. So we need a lot of grain to be able to eat and continue to live."
\p
\v 3 Others said, "The fields and vineyards and houses that we own, it has been necessary for us to mortgage them."
\p
\v 4 Others said, "We have needed to borrow money to pay the taxes that the king commanded us to pay on our fields and our vineyards.
\v 5 We are Jews just like [IDI] the other Jews. Our children are just as good as their children. But we have needed to sell some of our children to become slaves in order to pay what we owe. We have already sold some of our daughters to become slaves. Our fields and vineyards have been taken away from us, so now we do not have the money to pay what we owe, and we are forced to sell our children to get money to pay those debts."
\p
\v 6 I was very angry when I heard these things that they were complaining about.
\v 7 So I thought about what I could do about it. I told the leaders and officials, "You are charging interest to your own relatives when they borrow money from you!" Then I called together a large group of people,
\v 8 and I said to them, "Some of our Jewish relatives have been forced to sell themselves to become slaves of people who have come from other countries. As much as we have been able to, we have been buying them back. But now you are forcing your own relatives to sell themselves to you, their fellow Jews!" When I said that to them, they were silent. There was nothing that they could say because they knew that what I said was true.
\p
\v 9 Then I said to them, "What you are doing is terrible  obey God and do what is right! If you did that, our enemies who do not have an awesome respect for Yahweh would see that we are doing what is right and would not ridicule us.
\v 10 I and my fellow Jews and my servants have lent money and grain to people. But we all should stop charging interest on these loans.
\v 11 Also, you must give back to them their fields, their vineyards, their olive tree orchards, and their houses that you have taken from them. You must also give back to them the interest that you charged them when they borrowed money, grain, wine, and olive oil from you, and you must do it today!"
\p
\v 12 The leaders replied, "We will do what you have said. We will return to them everything that we forced them to give to us, and we will not require that they give us anything more."
\p Then I summoned the priests, and I forced the leaders to solemnly promise in front of them that they would do what they had promised to do.
\v 13 I shook out the folds of my robe and said to them, "If you do not do what you have just now promised to do, I hope that God will shake you like I am shaking my robe. He will separate you from your homes and from everything that you own."
\p They all replied, "Amen it be so!" And they praised Yahweh. Then they did what they had promised to do.
\p
\v 14 I was appointed to be the governor of Judea in the twentieth year that Artaxerxes was the king of Persia. From that time until the thirty-second year, during those twelve years neither I nor my officials accepted the money that we were allowed to receive to buy food because of my being the governor.
\v 15 The men who were governors before I became the governor had burdened the people by requiring them to pay a lot of taxes. They had forced each person to pay to them 40 silver coins every day, in addition to giving food and wine to them. Even their servants oppressed the people. But I did not do that, because I had an awesome respect for God.
\p
\v 16 I also continued to work on the wall, and I did not take land from people who were unable to pay back the money that they had borrowed from me. All those who worked for me joined me to work on the wall.
\v 17 Also, every day I was responsible to feed 150 Jewish officials, and also official visitors who came from nearby countries.
\v 18 Each day I told my servants to serve us the meat from one ox, six very good sheep, and chickens. And every ten days I gave them a large new supply of wine. But I knew that the people were burdened by paying lots of taxes, so I did not accept the money that I was entitled to receive to buy all this food because of my being the governor.
\p
\v 19 My God, do not forget me, and reward me because of all that I have done for these people.
