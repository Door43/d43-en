\v 1 After the wall had been finished and we had put the gates in their places, we assigned to the temple guards and to the members of the sacred choir and the other descendants of Levi the work that they were to do.
\v 2 I appointed two men to help me to govern Jerusalem, my brother Hanani and Hananiah who was the commander of the fortress in Jerusalem. Hananiah always did his work reliably, and he had more awesome respect for God than most other people have.
\v 3 I said to them, "Do not open the gates of Jerusalem until late each morning. And close the gates and put the bars across the doors late in each afternoon while the gatekeepers are still guarding the gates." I also told them to appoint some people who lived in Jerusalem to be guards, and to assign some of them to be guards at certain places and to assign others to guard the area close to their own houses.
\s1 A list of those who returned to Jerusalem
\p
\v 4 The city of Jerusalem covered a large area, but at that time not many people lived in the city, and they had not built many new houses yet .
\v 5 To defend the city, we needed more people there. Then God gave me the idea to summon the leaders and officials and other people, and to look in the books in which were written the names of all the people and their clans. So I found the records of the people who had first returned from Babylonia. This is what I found written in those records:
\pi
\v 6 This is a list of the people who returned to Jerusalem and to other places in Judea. They had been living in Babylonia since King Nebuchadnezzar's army had captured their relatives, Or: ancestors and took them to Babylonia. But they had returned to Judea and were living in the towns where their ancestors had lived
\v 7 Their leaders were Zerubbabel, Joshua, me, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and Baanah.

\pi
\v 60 Altogether, there were 392 temple workers and descendants of Solomon's servants who returned.
\b
\pi
\v 61-62 Another group of 642 people from the clans of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda returned from the towns of Tel-Melah, Tel-Harsha, Kerub, Addan (who is also known as Addon), and Immer in Babylonia. But they could not prove that they were descendants of Israelites.
\b
\pi
\v 63 Priests from the clans of Hobaiah, Hakkoz, and Barzillai also returned. Barzillai had married a woman who is a descendant of a man named Barzillai from the Gilead region, and he had taken his wife's family name.
\v 64 They searched in the records that contained the names of people's ancestors, but they could not find the names of those clans, so they were not allowed to have the rights and duties that priests have right away.
\v 65 The governor told them that first, a priest should use the marked stones to find out what God said about their being priests.
\b
\pi
\v 66 Altogether, there were 42,360 people who returned to Judea.
\v 67 There were also 7,337 of their servants, and 245 singers, which included men and women.
\v 68 The Israelites also brought back from Babylonia 736 horses, 245 mules,
\v 69 435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys.
\b
\pi
\v 70 Some of the leaders of the clans gave gifts for the work of rebuilding the temple. I, the governor, gave 17 pounds of gold, 50 bowls to be used in the temple, and 530 robes for the priests.
\v 71 Some of the leaders of the clans gave a total of 337 pounds of silver.
\v 72 The rest of the people gave a total of 337 pounds of silver, and 67 robes for the priests.
\pi
\v 73 So the priests, the descendants of Levi who helped the priests, the temple guards, the musicians, the temple workers, and many ordinary people, who were all Israelites, started to live in the towns and cities of Judea where their ancestors had lived.
