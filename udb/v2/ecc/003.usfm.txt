\s1 There is a right time for everything
\q1

\v 9 What do people gain from all the work that they do?
\v 10 I have seen the work that God has given people to do.
\v 11 God has appointed a time that is right for everything to happen. He has also caused people to realize that there are things that will endure forever. But in spite of that, no one can completely understand everything that God has done, from the time that he starts doing things until he finishes them.
\v 12 I know that the best  thing for us people to do is to rejoice and to do good things all during the time that we are alive.
\v 13 And I also know that everyone should eat and drink, and enjoy the work that they do. Those are things that God gives to us.
\v 14 I also know that what God does endures forever. No one can add to what God does, and no one can take away from the things that God does. God does those things in order that people would revere him.
\q1
\v 15 Things that exist now have already existed previously,
\q2 and things that will happen in the future have already happened previously;
\q2 God causes the same things to happen many times.
\s1 Injustices in the world
\p
\v 16 Furthermore, I saw that on this earth ,
\q1 even in the courts where we expect judges to make right decisions about what people had done,
\q2 they did many wicked  things.
\p
\v 17 So I said to myself , "God will judge both righteous people and wicked people;
\q1 there is a time for him to do that,
\q1 because there is a time for him to do everything."
\p
\v 18 And regarding humans, I also said to myself, "God is testing us, to show us that in one way people are no different than animals,
\v 19 because what happens to people happens to animals. Animals die, and people die. We all must breathe to remain alive. People have no advantage over animals in that, so I have a difficult time in understanding that.
\v 20 People and animals all die and are buried. We are all made of soil, and when we die, our corpses become soil again.
\v 21 No one knows  of animals go down to the place where the dead are."
\p
\v 22 So I conclude that the best thing for us people to do is to be happy about the work that we do, because that is what God has given to us. I say that because no one of us  knows what happens to us after we die.
