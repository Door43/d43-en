\p
\v 9 There was another descendant of Judah whose name was Jabez. He was more respected than his brothers were. His mother named him Jabez which means 'pain' because she said, "I was enduring much pain when I gave birth to him."
\v 10 One day he prayed to God whom his fellow Israelites worshiped, saying, "Please greatly bless me and increase my land. Remain [IDI] with me, and do not allow anyone to harm me. If you do that for me, I will not have any pain." And God did what Jabez requested him to do.

\v 25 Shaul's son was Shallum. Shallum's son was Mibsam. Mibsam's son was Mishma.
\li2
\v 26 Mishma's son was Hammuel. Hammuel's son was Zaccur. Zaccur's son was Shimei.
\p
\v 27 Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters, but none of his brothers had many children. So the descendants of Simeon never were as many as the descendants of his younger brother Judah.
\v 28 The descendants of Simeon lived in these cities and towns: Beersheba, Moladah, Hazar-Shual,
\v 29 Bilhah, Ezem, Tolad,
\v 30 Bethuel, Hormah, Ziklag,
\v 31 Beth-Marcaboth, Hazar-Susim, Beth-Biri, and Shaaraim. They lived in those places until David became king.
\v 32 They also lived in villages near those towns: Etam, Ain, Rimmon, Token, and Ashan.
\v 33 There were other villages where they lived, as far southwest as Baalath town. Those were the places where they lived, and they wrote the names of the members of their families.
\p
\v 34-38 The men in the following list were the leaders of their clans: Meshobab, Jamlech, Joshah the son of Amaziah, Joel, and Jehu the son of Joshibiah. Joshibiah was the son of Seraiah and the grandson of Asiel. Other clan leaders were Elioenai, Jaakobah, Jeshohaiah, Asaiah, Adiel, Jesimiel, Benaiah, and Ziza. Ziza was the son of Shiphi and the grandson of Allon, who was the son of Jedaiah, who was the son of Shimri, who was the son of Shemaiah.
\p The members of those families became very large.
\v 39 They went outside of Gedor town on the east side of the valley to look for pastureland for their flocks of sheep.
\v 40 They found good pastureland with plenty of grass. The place was peaceful and quiet.
\p Previously the descendants of Noah's son Ham had lived there.
\v 41 But while Hezekiah was the king of Judah, those leaders of the tribe of Simeon came to Gedor and fought against the descendants of Ham and destroyed their tents. They also fought against the descendants of Meun who were living there and they killed all of them. So now there are no descendants of Meun living there. The descendants of Simeon started to live there, because there was good pastureland there for their sheep.
\p
\v 42 Ishi's four sons Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah and Uzziel led five hundred other descendants of Simeon and attacked the people who were living in the hilly area of the Edom region.
\v 43 They killed the few descendants of Amalek who were still alive. From that time until now, the descendants of Simeon have lived in the Edom region.
