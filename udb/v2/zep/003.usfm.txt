\c 3
\s1 Yahweh will some day restore Jerusalem, whose people have rebelled against him
\q1
\v 1 Terrible things will happen to Jerusalem,
\q2 that city whose people have rebelled against Yahweh
\q1 and who have become unacceptable to him because of the sins that they have committed.
\q2 They act violently toward others and they oppress other people.
\q1
\v 2 The people there do not pay attention to people who tell them the wrong things that they are doing
\q2 and try to correct them.
\q1 The people in Jerusalem do not trust in Yahweh
\q2 or draw near to their God.
\q1
\v 3 Their leaders are like  roaring lions;
\q2 they are like  wolves that attack other animals during the evening,
\q2 and eat everything that they kill,
\q2 with the result that the next morning there is nothing left of those animals to eat.
\q1
\v 4 The prophets in Jerusalem are proud,
\q2 and they give messages that are not to be trusted.
\q1 Their priests cause the temple to be unholy
\q2 by doing things that are opposed to the laws of Moses.
\q1
\v 5 But Yahweh is also in the city;
\q2 and he never does what is wrong.
\q1 He treats people justly;
\q2 he does that every day,
\q2 but wicked people are never ashamed about their doing what is wrong.
\p
\v 6 Yahweh says this:
\q1 "I have destroyed many nations;
\q2 I have destroyed their strong city walls and towers.
\q1 Now I have caused the streets in those cities to be completely deserted ;
\q2 the cities are ruined.
\q1 There are no people still alive in the cities;
\q2 they are all dead .
\q1
\v 7 So I said to myself,
\q2 'Because of what I have done to those other nations,
\q2 surely the people of Jerusalem will revere me now,
\q2 and they will accept my correcting them.
\q1 If they do that, I will not destroy their houses;
\q2 I will not punish them like I said that I would do.'
\q1 But in spite of knowing how I punished those other nations,
\q2 they were still eager to get up early each morning
\q2 and continue to perform evil deeds.
\q1
\v 8 Therefore I, Yahweh, say,
\q2 'Wait for the day in which I will testify in court about your evil deeds.'
\q1 I have decided to gather the people of the kingdoms of the earth 
\q2 and cause them to know that I am very angry with them.
\q1 All over the earth I will punish and destroy people;
\q2 my being angry with them because I am jealous fire.
\b
\q1
\v 9 When that happens, I will cause all people  to be changed
\q2 and enable them to speak only what is pure,
\q2 in order that everyone can worship me 
\q2 and unitedly.
\q1
\v 10 Then my people who were forced to go to other countries , those who live along the upper part of the Nile River in Ethiopia
\q2 will come to me and bring offerings to me.
\q1
\v 11 At that time, you people in Jerusalem will no longer be ashamed about what has happened to you,
\q2 because you no longer will be rebelling against me.
\q1 I will get rid of all the people among you who are very proud .
\q2 No one on Zion, my holy hill, will strut around proudly.
\q1
\v 12 Those who are still alive in Israel will be poor and humble;
\q2 they will be people who trust in me .
\q1
\v 13 Those people who are still alive there in Israel will not do things that are wrong;
\q2 they will not tell lies or deceive  people.
\q1 They will eat and sleep safely,
\q2 because no one will cause them to be afraid."
\b
\q1
\v 14 You people who live in Jerusalem  and other places in Israel,
\q2 sing and shout loudly!
\q1 Be glad, and rejoice  with all your inner beings,
\q1
\v 15 because Yahweh will stop punishing  you,
\q2 and he will send away from you the armies of your enemies!
\q1 And Yahweh himself, the king of us Israelite people, will live among us,
\q2 and never again will we be afraid that others will harm us.
\q1
\v 16 At that time, other people will say to us people of Jerusalem,
\q2 "You people of  Jerusalem, do not be afraid;
\q2 do not become weak or discouraged,
\q1
\v 17 because Yahweh your God is living among you.
\q2 He is mighty, and he will rescue you.
\q1 He will be very happy about you;
\q2 because he loves you, he will cause you to not be afraid;
\q2 he will sing loudly to rejoice about you."
\b
\q1
\v 18 Yahweh says, "You people were sad and ashamed
\q2 because you were unable to attend your religious festivals;
\q2 but I will cause you to no longer be disgraced.
\q1
\v 19 Truly, I will severely punish all those who oppressed you.
\q2 I will rescue those who are helpless
\q1 and those who were forced to go to other countries.
\q2 I will enable them to be praised and honored in every country to which they were exiled,
\q2 places where they were disgraced.
\q1
\v 20 At that time, I will gather you together
\q2 and bring you back home to Israel.
\q1 I will cause you to have a good reputation and be greatly praised
\q2 among all the nations of the earth.
\q1 You  will see my causing you to prosper again.
\q2 That will surely happen because I, Yahweh, have said it."
