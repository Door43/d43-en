\c 6
\p
\v 1  Therefore, because I am working together with God  himself, I say this to you very strongly: God has  already kindly  forgiven you because Christ died for you, so do not now  say "It does not matter  if I live just to please myself." 
\v 2 For God said  long ago in the Scriptures:
\p When it is the right time  for me to help you, you will ask me to help you, and I will hear you. Then I will  send a Savior to help you.
\p
So listen to what I am telling you: God  has sent his Savior, so now is the time when  God is ready to save  people from the guilt of their sins.
\s 2 Corinthians 6:3-10
\sr In spite of much suffering, we have lived as servants of God should live.
\p
\v 3 Neither I nor the men  working with me do anything that would hinder people from trusting in Christ, and so we cannot be accused  of not serving  God properly. 
\v 4 Instead, in everything  that we say and do, we show  people that we serve God faithfully. We patiently endure  all the things that happen to us. People cause us many troubles and, as a result, we are anxious  and often do not know what to do. 
\v 5 Sometimes we have been beaten  and bound  with chains in prison. Angry mobs have attacked us, wanting to kill us. We have continued working  for God until we had no more strength to work. We have had many sleepless nights, and we have  often been without food. 
\v 6  All that we think about and all that we do is pure  in God's sight. Knowing  how God wants us to conduct our lives, we do what pleases him. We are patient  with those who oppose us. We are kind  to all people. We depend on the Holy Spirit  to help us. We love people sincerely  as God wants us to love them. 
\v 7 We faithfully teach  the true message  about Christ, and God  gives us his power  as we teach it. Like soldiers using weapons  in a battle, we, by  living righteously, defend God's message and refute those who attack it. 
\v 8  We serve God faithfully whether  people praise us or  whether they say good things  about us. We keep teaching the truth, even though some people say that we are deceiving  people. 
\v 9  Some people know  well that we are true servants of God, and yet others, who know us, refuse to  believe that. People have often tried to kill us. 
\v 10 Although we, but  because we belong to God's family, all  that God has belongs to us.
\s 2 Corinthians 6:11-13
\sr I ask you to accept us and love us as we love you.
\p
\v 11 You  fellow believers in Corinth, I have been completely honest with you. I have told you exactly how we. 
\v 12 We are not  treating you as though we do not love you, but you are  treating us as though you do not love us. 
\v 13 In return  for our loving you, will you not love  us  just as  much as we love you? I am writing  to you as if you were my own children.
\s 2 Corinthians 6:14-7:1
\sr Do not get involved with people who do not honor God.
\p
\v 14 Do not team up. 
\v 15 There is no  common interests with unbelievers. 
\v 16  Just as no one would  dare to bring idols into the Temple  in Jerusalem, believers should never  the Holy Spirit lives in us, and so we are  like the Temple of the all-powerful God. It is as God himself said  in the Scriptures:
\q I will live in  my people.
\q I will always be with them. 
\q  They will say to me, "You are our God," and 
\q  I will say to them, "You are my people."
\p
\v 17  In another place in the Scriptures we read that the Lord said:
\q Get away from those who do evil;
\q keep yourselves separated from them.
\q Do  nothing sinful that would make you unacceptable to me.
\q Then I will welcome you  as members of my family.
\p
\v 18  The Lord also said:
\q I will  care for you as  a loving father  cares for his children, 
\q and  it will be as though you are my own sons and daughters. 
\q I, the all-powerful Lord, am saying this  to you.
