\s1 David found out about Saul's death
\p
\v 1 After Saul died, David and the men who were with him returned to Ziklag town after defeating the descendants of Amalek. They stayed in Ziklag for two days.
\v 2 On the third day, unexpectedly a man arrived there who had come from where Saul's army was camped. He had torn his clothes and put dust on his head to show that he was grieving. He came to David, and prostrated himself on the ground in front of David to show respect for him.
\p
\v 3 David asked him, "Where have you come from?" The man replied, "I escaped from where the Israelite army is camped."
\p
\v 4 David asked him, "What happened? Tell me about the battle!" The man replied, "The Israelite soldiers ran away from the battle. Many of them were killed. And Saul and his son Jonathan are dead."
\p
\v 5 David said to the young man, "How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?"
\p
\v 6 The young man replied, "It happened that I was on Gilboa Mountain where the battle occurred, and I saw Saul, leaning on his spear. The enemy chariots and their drivers had come very close to Saul.
\v 7 Saul turned around and saw me, and he called out to me. I answered him and said, 'What do you want me to do?'
\p
\v 8 He replied, 'Who are you?' I replied, 'I am a descendant of Amalek.'
\p
\v 9 Then he said to me, 'Come over here and kill me. I am still alive, but I am suffering very much pain.'
\p
\v 10 So I went to him and killed him, because I knew that he was wounded very badly and would not continue to live. I took the crown that was on his head and the band, Or: bracelet that was on his arm, and I have brought them to you."
\p
\v 11 Then David and all the men who were with him tore their clothes to show that they were very sad.
\v 12 They mourned for Saul and his son Jonathan, and they cried and fasted.
\p
\v 13 Then David asked the young man who had told him about the battle, "Where are you from?" He replied, "My father is a descendant of Amalek, but we live in Israel."
\p
\v 14 David asked him, "Why were you not afraid that you would be punished if you killed Saul, whom Yahweh had appointed 
\v 15-16 You yourself said, 'I killed the man whom Yahweh appointed to be the king.' So you have caused yourself to be guilty  of causing your own death!" Then David summoned one of his soldiers and said to him, "Kill him!" So the soldier killed him by striking him with a sword.
\s1 David's song about Saul and Jonathan
\p
\v 17 Then David composed this sad song about Saul and Jonathan,
\v 18 and he commanded that it be taught to the people of Judah. The song is called 'The Bow and arrow' and it has been written in the Book of Jashar:
\q1
\v 19 You Israelite people, your glorious  leaders have been killed on the mountains!
\q2 It is very sad that these mighty men have died!
\b
\q1
\v 20 Do not tell it to our enemies in the Philistia area;
\q1 do not tell to the people who live in Gath city what happened;
\q2 do not proclaim it in the streets of Ashkelon city, because if you tell them, even the women in that area will be happy;
\q2 do not allow those pagan women to rejoice.
\q1
\v 21 I hope,
\q1 and that no grain will grow in the fields there,
\q2 because there the shield of Saul, the mighty king, fell on the ground.
\q1 No one rubbed olive oil on Saul's shield;
\q1
\v 22 instead, it was stained with the blood of those whom he had killed,
\q2 and the fat of mighty enemy soldiers was smeared on it.
\q1 Jonathan  did not retreat carrying his bow and arrows,
\q2 and Saul always defeated his enemies when he fought them with his sword. 
\b
\q1
\v 23 Saul and Jonathan were loved and they pleased many people.
\q2 They were together  while they lived and when they died.
\q1 In battles they were swifter than eagles and they were stronger than lions.
\b
\q1
\v 24 You Israelite women, cry about Saul;
\q1 He provided beautiful scarlet clothes for you
\q2 and he gave you gold ornaments to fasten on those clothes.
\b
\q1
\v 25 It is very sad that this mighty soldier has died!
\q2 Jonathan has been killed on the mountains.
\q1
\v 26 Jonathan, my dear friend, I grieve for you;
\q2 you were very dear to me.
\q1 You loved me in a wonderful manner;
\q2 it was better than the way that a woman loves her husband and her children.
\b
\q1
\v 27 It is very sad that these mighty men have died,
\q2 and their weapons are now abandoned!
