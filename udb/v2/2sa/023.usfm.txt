\s1 David's final message
\p
\v 1 David, the son of Jesse, was a man whom God caused to become great.
\q1 He was appointed to become king by the God whom Jacob worshiped.
\q1 He wrote beautiful songs for the people of Israel.
\q1 This is the last song that he wrote:
\b
\q1
\v 2 The Spirit of Yahweh tells me what to say;
\q1 the message that I speak  comes from him.
\q1
\v 3 God, the one whom we Israelite people worship, has spoken;
\q2 the one who protects us people of Israel said to me,
\q1 "Kings who rule people justly
\q1 have an awesome respect for God.
\q1
\v 4 They are like the sun that shines at dawn
\q2 and causes the grass to sprout after the rain ends."
\b
\q1
\v 5 And truly, that is how God will surely bless my family 
\q2 because he made an agreement with me that will endure forever,
\q2 an agreement in which he promises that no part of it will ever be changed.
\q1 He will surely cause me to prosper ,
\q2 and he will always help me,
\q1 and that is all that I desire.
\q1
\v 6 But he will get rid of godless people throw away thorns
\q2 that injure people if they try to pick them up with their hands.
\q1
\v 7 Someone who wants to get rid of thornbushes does not grab them;
\q2 he uses an iron shovel or a spear to dig them out
\q2 and then he burns them completely.
\s1 David's three greatest warriors
\p
\v 8 These are the names of David's three greatest warriors.
\p The first was Esh-Baal, whose other name was Jashobeam, from the Hachmon clan . He was the leader of the three men. One time he fought against eight hundred enemies and killed them all with his spear.
\p
\v 9 The second the soldiers of Philistia who had gathered there for the battle. The other Israelite soldiers retreated,
\v 10 but Eleazar stood there and fought the soldiers of Philistia until his arm became very tired, with the result that his hand cramped and he could not stop gripping his sword. Yahweh won a great victory on that day. And afterwards the other Israelite soldiers returned to where Eleazar was, and stripped off the armor from the men whom he had killed.
\p
\v 11 The third one of the greatest warriors was Shammah, the son of Agee from the clan that they wanted to steal. The other Israelite soldiers ran away from the Philistia troops,
\v 12 but Shammah stood there in the field and did not let the Philistia soldiers steal the peas, and killed them. Yahweh won a great victory on that day.
\s1 The thirty great warriors
\p
\v 13 Altogether there were thirty special warriors among David's soldiers. One time, when it was almost time to harvest the crops, three of those thirty men went down to Adullam Cave, where David was staying. A group of men from the Philistia army had set up their tents in the Rephaim Valley near Jerusalem.
\v 14 David and his soldiers were in the cave because it was safe there, and another group of Philistia soldiers was occupying Bethlehem.
\v 15 One day David very much wanted some water to drink, and said "I wish that someone would bring me some water from the well near the gate at Bethlehem!"
\v 16 So his three greatest warriors forced through the camp of Philistia soldiers and drew some water from the well, and brought it to David. But he would not drink it. Instead, he poured it out on the ground to be an offering to Yahweh.
\v 17 He said, "Yahweh, it would certainly not be right for me to drink this water! That would be like  to die for me!" So he refused to drink it.
\p That was one of the things that those three great warriors did.
\s1 The list of the great warriors
\p
\v 18 Abishai, Joab's younger brother, was the leader of the thirty greatest warriors. One day he fought against three hundred men and killed them all with his spear. As a result, he also became famous.
\v 19 He was the most famous of the thirty greatest warriors, and he became their leader, but he was not one of the three greatest warriors.
\p
\v 20 Jehoiada's son Benaiah, from Kabzeel town, also did great deeds. He killed two of the best warriors from the Moab people-group. Also, he went down into a pit on a day when snow was falling on the ground, and killed a lion there.
\v 21 He also killed a huge soldier from Egypt who carried a spear. Benaiah had only his club, but he attacked the giant with it. Then he snatched the spear from the man's hand and killed him with his own spear.
\v 22 Those are some of the things that Benaiah did. As a result, he became famous, like the three greatest warriors were.
\v 23 He was more honored than the other members of the group of thirty great warriors, but not as famous as the three greatest warriors. David appointed him to be the commander of his bodyguards.
