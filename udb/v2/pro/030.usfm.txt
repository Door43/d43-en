\s1 Wise sayings from Agur
\p
\v 1 These are sayings that God gave to Agur, the son of Jakeh.
\q1 Agur wrote them for Ithiel and Ucal.
\b
\q1
\v 2 It seems that I am very stupid;
\q2 I do not deserve to be considered to be a human;
\q1 I do not have the good sense that humans should have.
\q1
\v 3 I have not learned how to become wise
\q2 and I do not know much about God.
\q1
\v 4 But let me say this:
\q1 No one  has ascended to heaven to find out what God is like and returned to tell us.
\q1 No one  the wind in his hand.
\q1 No one  has wrapped the water in the ocean in a piece of cloth
\q2 and no one  has established the boundaries of the earth.
\q1 If you know those things, tell me .
\q1 But you do not know those things, so you cannot speak with authority about what God is like.
\b
\q1
\v 5 Everything that God has said is true;
\q2 he is like a shield  for all those who request him to protect them.
\q1
\v 6 Do not add to  what God has said;
\q2 if you do that, he will rebuke you and show that you are lying.
\b
\q1
\v 7 God, I ask you to do two things for me;
\q2 please do them before I die:
\q1
\v 8 Prevent me from lying or deceiving people
\q2 and do not cause me to become poor or to become rich.
\q2 Just give me the food that I need;
\q1
\v 9 because if I become rich,
\q2 I might say that I do not  know you and that I do not need you;
\q1 and if I become poor,
\q2 I might dishonor you by stealing things.
