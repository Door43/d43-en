\s1 More warnings about adultery
\q1
\v 1 My son, heed my advice,
\q2 and guard my instructions as you would  guard a treasure.
\q1
\v 2 Obey my commands,
\q2 and as a result you will live a good life.
\q1 Consider the things that I teach you to be very precious to you;
\q2 guard them, just like you protect your eyes.
\q1
\v 3 Tie my commands around your fingers in order that they will remind you to obey them.
\q2 Keep them in your inner being .
\q1
\v 4 Love wisdom like you love your sister.
\q2 Understand what is wise,
\q2 and let that be as dear to you as members of your family.
\q1
\v 5 If you are wise and if you understand what is wise , you will not sleep with an immoral woman;
\q2 you will not listen to a woman who tries to entice you to sleep with her by what she says.
\b
\q1
\v 6 One day, I was standing at the window inside my house,
\q2 and I looked outside.
\q1
\v 7 I saw some young men who did not have good sense.
\q2 Among them was a man who was very foolish.
\q1
\v 8 He crossed the street near the house of an immoral woman.
\q2 He was walking along the path toward her house
\q1
\v 9 at twilight, when it was getting dark .
\b
\q1
\v 10 Suddenly the woman came out to see him.
\q2 She was dressed seductively, intending to persuade him to sleep with her.
\q1
\v 11 She was a loud talker, one who was rebellious;
\q2 she  never stayed at home.
\q1
\v 12 She often went into the city streets and plazas,
\q2 waiting to trap some man.
\q1
\v 13 When she saw that young man, she put her arms around him and kissed him.
\q2 Then without being a bit ashamed, she said,
\q1
\v 14 "I have some meat that is left over from a sacrifice that I made today to restore fellowship with Yahweh;
\q2 I have fulfilled what I promised him that I would do.
\q1
\v 15 And now I have come out to meet you.
\q2 I was searching for you and now I have found you!
\q1
\v 16 I have put on my bed sheets from Egypt.
\q1
\v 17 I have sprinkled sweet-smelling perfumes on my bedâ€”
\q2 myrrh and aloes and cinnamon.
\q1
\v 18 Come with me; let us enjoy having sex until tomorrow morning.
\q2 Let's enjoy making love.
\q1
\v 19 My husband is not at home;
\q2 he has gone away on a long journey.
\q1
\v 20 He is carrying a wallet filled with money,
\q2 and he will not return until the middle of this month."
\b
\q1
\v 21 So she persuaded him by her enticing words.
\q2 She allured him by her smooth talk.
\q1
\v 22 And he went with her immediately,
\q2 like an ox that was going to where it would be slaughtered,
\q2 or like a deer ,
\q2
\v 23 where it will remain until someone shoots an arrow into its liver and kills it.
\q1 He was like a bird that flew into a trap.
\q2 He did not know that it would cost him his life.
\b
\q1
\v 24 My son, listen to what I say;
\q2 pay careful attention to my words.
\q1
\v 25 Do not allow your inner being to arouse you to go with an immoral woman like that.
\q2 Do not go where she goes.
\q1
\v 26 She has caused many men to be ruined;
\q2 truly, no one can count the men she has killed.
\q1
\v 27 The road to her house is the road to the grave.
\q2 Those who enter her bedroom  will die as a result.
