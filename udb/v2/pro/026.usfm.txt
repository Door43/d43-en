\q1
\v 16 Lazy people think that they are wiser than seven people
\q2 who can answer others' questions with good sense.

\q2 is as foolish as  someone who tries to grab a passing dog by its ears.
\b
\q1
\v 18 Crazy people who shoot burning arrows to kill people

\v 19 are as foolish as those who deceive someone else
\q2 and then say, "I was only joking."

\q2 similarly, people who like to quarrel cause people to keep arguing.
\b
\q1
\v 22 People enjoy listening to what gossips say about others just like  they enjoy tasty food;

\q2 are like a nice glaze on a cheap clay pot.

\q1
\v 24 Those who hate someone and are saying  something very different from what they are thinking are hypocrites;
\q2 in their inner beings they are planning to harm that person.
\q1
\v 25 When they say nice things, do not believe them,
\q2 because in their inner beings are many things that Yahweh hates.
\q1
\v 26 They try to deceive people to cause them to think that they do not hate that person,
\q2 but in a public meeting, the people will find out the evil things that they have done.
\b

\q2 and those who deceive others ruin them.
