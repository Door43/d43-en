\c 10
\s1 Tola ruled the Israelites
\p
\v 1 After Abimelech died, Tola the son of Puah and grandson of Dodo became the leader to rescue the Israelite people from their enemies. He belonged to the tribe of Issachar, but he lived in Shamir city in the hilly area where the descendants of Ephraim live.
\v 2 He ruled the Israelite people for 23 years. Then he died and was buried in Shamir.
\s1 Jair ruled the Israelites
\p
\v 3 After Tola died, Jair, from the Gilead region, became the Israelites' leader, and he ruled them for 22 years.
\v 4 He had thirty sons, and each of them had his own donkey to ride on. They each controlled a different town in the Gilead region. That region is still named 'The Towns of Jair.'
\v 5 When Jair died, he was buried in Kamon city.
\s1 The Ammon people-group oppressed the Israelites
\p
\v 6 Again the Israelites did things that Yahweh said were wrong. They worshiped the idols of their god Baal and their goddess Astarte. They also worshiped the gods of the Aram, Sidon, Moab, and Ammon people-groups, and the gods of the Philistia people-group. They turned away from Yahweh and stopped worshiping him.
\v 7 So Yahweh was very angry with them, and he allowed the Philistia and Ammon people-groups to defeat [IDI] the Israelites.
\v 8 In that same year, those people started to oppress the Israelites who lived in the Gilead region on the east side of the Jordan River. That was where the Amor people-group also lived. The Israelites who lived in that region were caused to suffer for eighteen years.
\v 9 Then the people of the Ammon people-group crossed the Jordan River to fight against the people of the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim. They caused the Israelites' lives to be very miserable.
\v 10 So they cried out to Yahweh, saying "We have sinned against you. We have abandoned you, and we have been worshiping the idols of their god Baal."
\p
\v 11 Yahweh answered them, saying, "When the people of Egypt, and the Amor and Ammon and Philistia people-groups
\v 12 and the Sidon and Amalek and Maon people-groups acted in a cruel manner toward you, you cried out to me, and then I rescued you.
\v 13 But now you have abandoned me again, and you have been worshiping other gods. So I will not rescue you again.
\v 14 You have chosen those gods to be the ones that you worship. So call to them to help you. Allow them to rescue you when you have big troubles!"
\p
\v 15 But the Israelite people said to Yahweh, "Truly we have sinned. Punish us in whatever way you wish to, but please rescue us now!"
\v 16 Then the Israelites threw away the idols of the gods that belonged to other people-groups, and they worshiped Yahweh again. He saw that were suffering very much, and he felt sorry [IDI] for them.
\p
\v 17 The Ammon people-group gathered to fight against the Israelites, and they set up their tents in the Gilead region. The Israelite men also gathered and set up their tents at Mizpah, which was a city in Gilead.
\v 18 The Israelite leaders said, "Who will lead our soldiers to attack the Ammon people-group? The one who will lead us will become the leader of all us who live in this Gilead region."
