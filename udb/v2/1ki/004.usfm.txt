\s1 Solomon's kingdom
\p
\v 20 There were as many people in Judah and Israel as there are grains of sand  on the seashore. They had plenty to eat and drink and they were happy.
\v 21 Solomon's kingdom extended from the Euphrates River in the northeast to the Philistia area in the west and to the border of Egypt in the south. The conquered people in those areas paid taxes and were under Solomon's control all during his life.
\p
\v 22 The people whom Solomon ruled were required to bring to Solomon every day 150 bushels of fine flour and 300 bushels of wheat,
\v 23 ten cattle that were kept in stalls, and poultry.
\v 24 Solomon ruled over all the area west of the Euphrates River, from Tiphsah city in the northeast to Gaza city in the southwest. He ruled over all the kings in that area. And there was peace between his government and the governments of nearby countries.
\v 25 All during the years that Solomon ruled, the people of Judah and Israel lived safely. Each family had its own grapevines and fig trees.
\p
\v 26 Solomon had 4,000 stalls for the horses that pulled his chariots and 12,000 men who rode on horses .
\p
\v 27 His twelve governors supplied the food that King Solomon needed for himself and for all those who ate in the palace. Each governor supplied food for one month each year. They provided everything  that Solomon required.
\v 28 They also brought stalks of barley and wheat for the fast horses that pulled the chariots and for the other work horses. They brought it to the places where the horses were kept.
\s1 Solomon's wisdom
\p
\v 29 God enabled Solomon to be extremely wise and to have great insight a huge number of things.
\v 30 He was wiser than all the wise men in Arabia and Mesopotamia and all the wise men in Egypt.
\v 31 Ethan from Ezrah and Heman and Calcol and Darda and the sons of Mahol were considered to be very wise, but Solomon was wiser than all of them. People in all the nearby countries heard about Solomon.
\v 32 He composed and more than 1,000 songs.
\v 33 He talked about various kinds of plants, from the huge cedar trees in Lebanon to the tiny hyssop plants that grow in cracks in walls. He also talked about wild animals and birds and reptiles and fish.
\v 34 People came from all over the world to hear the wise things that Solomon said. Many kings sent men to listen to him and then return and tell them what Solomon said.
