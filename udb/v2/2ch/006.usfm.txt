\p
\v 1 Then Solomon said, "Yahweh, you said that you would live in a dark cloud.
\v 2 But now I have built a glorious temple for you to live in forever!"
\p
\v 3 Then while all the people stood there, Solomon turned toward the people and he asked God to bless them.
\v 4 He said to them,
\p "Praise Yahweh, the God to whom we Israelites belong, who has caused to happen what he promised to my father David. What he said to David was this:
\pi
\v 5 From the time that I brought my people out of Egypt, I have never chosen a city in Israel in which a temple should be built for people to worship me there. Nor did I choose anyone to be the leader of my Israelite people.
\v 6 But now I have chosen Jerusalem to be the place for people to worship me , and I have chosen you to rule my Israelite people."
\pi
\v 7 Then Solomon said, "My father David wanted [IDI] to build a temple for Yahweh , the God to whom we Israelites belong.
\v 8 But Yahweh said to him, 'You have wanted to build a temple for me , and what you wanted to do was good.
\v 9 However, you are not the one who I want to build the temple, It is one of your own sons who I want to build a temple for me.'
\pi
\v 10 And Yahweh has done what he promised to do. I have become the king of Israel to succeed my father, and I am ruling the people, like Yahweh promised, and I have arranged for this temple to be built for us to worship Yahweh, the God to whom we Israelites belong.
\v 11 I have put the Sacred Chest in the temple, in which are the stone tablets on which are engraved the Ten Commandments of the agreement that Yahweh made with us Israelite people."
\s1 Solomon's prayer to dedicate the temple
\p
\v 12 Then Solomon stood in front of the altar which was in front of the people of Israel who had gathered there.
\v 13 His workers had built a bronze platform there for him to stand on, which was 7-1 high. They put it in the outer courtyard. Solomon stood on that platform and then knelt down in front of all the people of Israel who had gathered there, and he spread out his arms toward heaven,
\v 14 and he prayed,
\p "Yahweh, the God to whom we Israelite people belong, there is no God like you in heaven or on the earth. You solemnly promised that you would faithfully love us, and that is what you have done for us who earnestly [IDI] do what you want us to do.
\pi
\v 15 You have done the things that you promised my father David, who served you very well, that you would do. Truly, you promised to do those things for him, and today we see that by your power  you have caused it all to happen.
\pi
\v 16 So now, Yahweh, the God we Israelites worship Israel, if they faithfully conduct their lives as he did.
\v 17 So now, God of us Israelite people, cause what you promised David, who served you well, to become true.
\pi
\v 18 But, my God, will you really live on earth among people  enough space for you to live in this temple that my workers have built.
\v 19 But Yahweh, my God, please listen to my prayer, while I am pleading with this day and do what I am requesting.
\v 20 Please be protecting .' Please listen to my prayer about this place.
\v 21 Listen to me when I pray, and listen to your Israelite people when they pray. Listen from heaven, where you live; and when you hear us pray, forgive us.
\pi
\v 22 If people accuse someone  of doing something wrong to another person, and they bring him in front of your altar outside this holy temple and if he says, 'I did not do that; may God punish me if I am not telling the truth,'
\v 23 then you listen from heaven, and you decide who is telling the truth. Then punish the person whom is guilty as he deserves to be punished, and declare that the other person is innocent.
\pi
\v 24 And when your Israelite people are defeated by their enemies because they sinned against you, and forced to go to some distant country, if they turn away from their sinful behavior and turn toward this temple and acknowledge have justly punished them, and plead that you will forgive them,
\v 25 listen to them from heaven and forgive your Israelite people for the sins that they have committed, and bring them back to this land that you gave to our ancestors.
\pi
\v 26 When you do not allow any rain to fall , and turn away from their sinful behavior and humbly pray to you,
\v 27 hear from heaven and forgive the sins of your Israelite people. Teach them the right way to conduct their lives. Then send rain on the land that you gave to your people to belong to them permanently.
\pi
\v 28 And when the people of this land experience famines or if there is a plague or by mildew or by locusts or grasshoppers, or when their enemies surround any of their cities in order to attack them, if any of those bad things happen to them,
\v 29 when your Israelite people earnestly plead , if they stretch out their hands toward this temple and pray,
\v 30 hear from your home in heaven, and forgive them. You alone know what each person is thinking [IDI, DOU], so reward each person according to everything that he does,
\v 31 in order that they will revere you and conduct their lives as you want them to, all the time that they live in this land that you gave to our ancestors.
\pi
\v 32 There will be some foreigners who do not belong to your Israelite people who have come here from countries far away because they have heard that you are very great and that you . It they turn toward this temple and pray,
\v 33 from your home in heaven listen to his prayer, and do for them what they request you to do. Do that in order that all the people-groups in the world will know about you .
\pi
\v 34 When if you send your people to go to places to attack their enemies, if they pray to you, wherever they are, if they turn toward this city that you have chosen and toward this temple that I have caused to be built to honor you ,
\v 35 listen in heaven to their prayers; listen to what they plead for you to do, and assist them.
\pi
\v 36 It is true that everyone  sins. So, when your people sin against you, and you become angry with them, you may allow their enemies to capture them and take them to their countries, even to countries that are far away.
\v 37 When that happens, while they are in the countries , if they say 'We have sinned; we have done things that are wrong and have done things that are very wicked,'
\v 38 if they repent very sincerely  and pray,
\v 39 then your home in heaven hear their prayer, and listen to them while they plead for your help, and do what they ask you to do, and forgive your people who have sinned against you.
\pi
\v 40 Now, my God, look  to us as we pray to you in this place.
\q1
\v 41 Yahweh our God, come and stay in this place with the Sacred Chest,
\q2 the chest that shows that you are powerful.
\q1 Yahweh God, cause your priests to know clearly that  them.
\q2 Cause us your people to rejoice because of all the good things that you do for us.
\q1
\v 42 Yahweh God, do not reject me the king whom you have appointed  to be the king of Israel;
\q2 do not forget that you greatly loved David, who served you very well."
