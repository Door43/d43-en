\s1 Aaron and his sons were appointed to be priests
\p
\v 1 Yahweh also said to Moses,
\v 2 "Bring Aaron and his sons, and bring their special clothes, the oil for anointing them, the bull to be offered to cause them to become acceptable to God, the two rams to be slaughtered, and the basket containing bread made without yeast.
\v 3 Then gather all the people at the entrance to the Sacred Tent."
\v 4 Moses to do, and all the people gathered there.
\p
\v 5 Then Moses said to the people, "This is what Yahweh has commanded us to do."
\v 6 Then he brought Aaron and his sons forward and washed them.
\v 7 He around him, using the skillfully woven waistband.
\v 8 He put the sacred pouch on his chest and put into it the two stones for him to use to determine what God wants.
\v 9 Then he.
\p
\v 10 Then Moses took the olive oil and anointed the sacred tent and everything in it, and dedicated them to Yahweh.
\v 11 He anointed the altar and all the things used with it, and its huge washbasin and its stand, to dedicate them to Yahweh.
\v 12 He poured some of the oil on Aaron's head and anointed him to dedicate him to Yahweh.
\v 13 Then he.
\p
\v 14 Then he brought the bull for the offering to cause people to become acceptable to God. Then Aaron and his sons put their hands on the bull's head.
\v 15 Then Moses caused it to be a suitable place for burning sacrifices for sin.
\v 16 Moses took all the fat that covers the inner parts of the animal, including the liver and kidneys, and burned them on the altar.
\v 17 He.
\p
\v 18 Then he brought the ram for the offering that would be completely burned on the altar, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.
\v 19 Then Moses slaughtered the ram and sprinkled its blood on all sides of the altar.
\v 20-21 He.
\p
\v 22 Then he brought the other ram, the one for consecrating the priests, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.
\v 23-24 Moses slaughtered that ram, caught some of its blood in a bowl, and put some of that blood on the lobes of the right ears, the thumbs of the right hands, and the big toes of the right feet of Aaron and his sons to indicate that what they listened to and what they did and where they went should be directed by Yahweh.
\v 25 He picked up all the fat of the ram, its fat tail, the fat that covered the inner parts, including the fat that covered the liver and kidneys, and the right thigh of the ram .
\v 26-27 Then from the basket containing the bread that was made without yeast, the bread which had been dedicated to Yahweh, he put those on top of the portions of fat, and put them into the hands of Aaron and his sons. Then they lifted them up in the presence of Yahweh to indicate that it was an offering that belonged to him.
\v 28 Then Moses took those things from their hands and burned them on the altar. That was the offering that was burned to appoint Aaron and his sons as priests. And the aroma while it burned was pleasing to Yahweh.
\v 29 Moses share of the ram that was sacrificed to dedicate the priests.
\p
\v 30 Then Moses consecrated Aaron and his sons and their clothes.
\p
\v 31 Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons, "Boil the meat of the second ram at the entrance of the Sacred Tent, and eat it there with the bread that is in the basket, like I told you to do.
\v 32 Burn up any of the meat and bread that remains.
\v 33 The time for you to be set apart as priests will be seven days, so do not leave the entrance of the Sacred Tent for seven days.
\v 34 What we have done today is what Yahweh commanded to cause that you will be forgiven for your sins.
\v 35 You must stay at the entrance of the Sacred Tent for seven days and seven nights and do what Yahweh requires, in order that you will not die because of disobeying him. â—„I am telling you that because that is what Yahweh has commanded me to tell you."
\p
\v 36 So Aaron and his sons did everything that Yahweh told Moses to tell them.
