\c 5
\s1 Yahweh's accusation against the Israelite people
\q1
\v 1 "Listen, you priests!
\q2 And you other Israelite people, you also pay attention!
\q1 And you who are members of the king's family, you also need to listen,
\q2 because I am going to judge you!
\q1 Your worshiping idols has been like  a trap for the people at Mizpah town;
\q2 it has been like  a net spread out to catch people at Tabor Mountain.
\q1
\v 2 You have done many evil things,
\q2 so I will punish all of you.
\q1
\v 3 I know everything about the people of Israel;
\q2 nothing that they have done is hidden from me.
\q1 Because the people of Israel have given themselves to worshiping idols
\q2 like  prostitutes give themselves to the men they sleep with,
\q1 they have become unacceptable to me.
\b
\q1
\v 4 Because they like to do evil deeds,
\q2 they will not return to me, their God.
\q1 Like prostitutes who have abandoned their husbands  me;
\q2 they do not even know me, Yahweh.
\q1
\v 5 It is as though their being proud testifies  against them.
\q2 The sins that the people of Israel have committed are like a heavy load that causes them to stumble,
\q2 and the people of Judah stumble with them.
\q1
\v 6 They will come to worship me, Yahweh,
\q2 bringing their herds of sheep and cattle,
\q1 but they will not be able to find me
\q2 because I have abandoned them.
\q1
\v 7 They have abandoned me;
\q2 and their children do not belong to me .
\q1 So they will not be able to celebrate their festivals at the new moons
\q2 because I will destroy them and the crops in their fields.
\b
\q1
\v 8 Blow the rams' horns in Gibeah town
\q2 and blow the trumpets in Ramah town!
\q1 Warn the people at Beth-Aven town;
\q2 you warriors of the tribe of Benjamin, lead the troops into the battle.
\q1
\v 9 Israel will be ruined on the day that I destroy them.
\q2 What I am telling to the tribes of Israel will certainly happen.
\q1
\v 10 Because the leaders of Judah seized some land that belonged to Israel,
\q2 they are like  those who move boundary markers to get more land for themselves;
\q1 so I will punish them severely .
\q1
\v 11 And the people of Israel will suffer greatly when I punish them
\q2 because they are very determined to worship idols.
\q1
\v 12 I will destroy the people of Israel like  destroy wool,
\q2 and I will cause the people of Judah to be like  rotten wood.
\b
\q1
\v 13 When the leaders of Israel and Judah saw that the people were suffering
\q2 because of what their enemies were doing to them ,
\q1 they sent messages to the great king of Assyria
\q2 requesting his help.
\q1 But he cannot help you;
\q2 he cannot cause you to stop suffering,
\q2 because I am the one who is punishing Israel and Judah.
\q1
\v 14 I will become like  to both nations;
\q2 I will attack them and tear them to pieces.
\q1 I will drag them away,
\q2 and no one will be able to rescue them.
\q1
\v 15 After that, I will return to my place in heaven
\q2 until they admit that they have sinned  and return to me;
\q1 when they will experience many troubles,
\q2 they will request me to help them."
