\c 10
\s1 Yahweh's promises for Judah and Israel
\q1
\v 1 Ask Yahweh to cause rain to fall in the springtime,
\q2 because he is the one who makes the clouds from which the rain falls.
\q1 He causes showers to fall on us,
\q2 and he causes crops to grow well in the fields.
\q1
\v 2 What people think that the idols in their houses suggest is only nonsense,
\q2 and people who say that they can interpret dreams tell only lies.
\q1 When they tell people things to comfort them, what they say is useless,
\q2 so the people who consult them are like lost sheep;
\q1 they are attacked because they have no one to protect them 
\q2 like  a shepherd protects his sheep.
\q1
\v 3 Yahweh says, "I am angry with the leaders  of my people,
\q2 and I will punish them.
\q1 I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, take care of my people, the people of Judah,
\q2 like a shepherd takes care of his  flock,
\q2 and I will cause them to be like  war horses.
\q1
\v 4 From Judah will come rulers who will be very important,
\q2 like  a cornerstone is the most important stone for a house,
\q2 like  a tent peg is very important for a tent,
\q2 like .
\q1
\v 5 They will all be like  mighty warriors
\q2 trampling their enemies in the mud during a battle.
\q1 I, Yahweh, will be with them,
\q2 so they will fight and defeat their enemies who ride on horses.
\b
\q1
\v 6 I will cause the people  of Judah to become strong,
\q2 and I will rescue the people  of Israel.
\q1 I will bring them back from the countries to which they were exiled;
\q2 I will do that because I pity them.
\q1 Then they will be as though I had not abandoned them
\q2 because I am Yahweh, their God,
\q1 and I will answer them when they pray for help.
\q1
\v 7 The people of Israel will be like  strong soldiers;
\q2 they will be as happy as people who have drunk a lot of wine.
\q1 Their children will see their fathers being very happy,
\q2 and they also will be happy because of what Yahweh has done for them.
\q1
\v 8 I will signal for my people to return from being exiled,
\q2 and I will gather them together in their own country.
\q1 I will rescue them,
\q2 and they will become very numerous like they were previously.
\q1
\v 9 I have caused them to be scattered among many people-groups,
\q2 but in those distant countries they will think about me again.
\q1 They and their children will remain alive and return to Judah.
\q1
\v 10 I will bring them back from Egypt and from Assyria;
\q1 I will bring them back from the Gilead and Lebanon regions,
\q2 and there will hardly be enough  space for them all to live in Judah.
\q1
\v 11 They will endure many difficulties
\q2 as though  they were walking through a sea,
\q2 but I will calm the waves of the sea;
\q1 the Nile River which is usually deep will dry up.
\q1 I will defeat the proud soldiers of Assyria,
\q2 and I will cause Egypt to no longer be powerful .
\q1
\v 12 I will enable my people to be strong,
\q2 and they will honor me and obey [IDI] me.
\q1 That will surely happen because I, Yahweh, have said it."
