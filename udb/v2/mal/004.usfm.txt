\c 4
\s1 The coming day of punishment
\p
\v 1 This is also what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says: "There will be a time that I will judge and punish people. When that happens, it will be like  stubble burns. They will be burned up completelyâ€”like roots and branches and everything else on a tree burns completely in a very hot fire.
\v 2 But for you who revere me  calves that go out from the barn into the pasture leaping joyfully.
\v 3 On the day when I judge people, you will tread on wicked people as though  they were the dirt under your feet. That is what I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, promise.
\p
\v 4 Be sure to obey the laws that I gave to Moses, who served me well. Obey all the commandments and regulations that I gave him on Sinai Mountain, for all you people of Israel to obey. 
\p
\v 5 Listen to this: Some day I will send to you the prophet Elijah. He will arrive before the great and dreadful day when I, Yahweh, will judge and punish people.
\v 6 Because of what he preaches, parents and their children will be united in loving each other again [IDI]. If that does not happen, I will come and destroy your country."
