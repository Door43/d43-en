\c 1
\p
\v 1 This is the message that Yahweh gave to the prophet Malachi to give to the people of Israel.
\s1 Yahweh's love for the people of Israel
\p
\v 2 Yahweh says, "I have always loved you Israelite people."
\p
\v 3 But you reply, "In what way have you loved us?"
\p Yahweh replies, "This is how I loved you: It is true that your ancestor Jacob was . I caused the land which he possessed to become a desert where jackals, Or: wolves live."
\p
\v 4 The descendants of Esau who live in Edom may say, "Yes, we have been crushed, but we will rebuild houses in the ruins."
\p But the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels replies, "They may build houses again, but I will demolish them again. Their country will be called 'The land where wicked people live' and their people will be called 'The people with whom Yahweh is angry forever.'~"
\p
\v 5 When you Israelite people yourselves see what I will do to them, you will say, "It is evident far beyond the borders of Israel that Yahweh is very great!"
\s1 Unacceptable sacrifices
\p
\v 6 But the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says to the priests, "Boys honor their fathers, and servants respect their masters. So, if I am like your father and your master, why !"
\p But you ask, "How have we despised you?"
\p
\v 7 Yahweh replies, "Instead of honoring me, you have despised me by offering sacrifices on my altar that are unacceptable to me."
\p Then you ask, "What sacrifices have we given that have been unacceptable to you?"
\p Yahweh replies, "You think that it does not matter if you do not respect my altar.
\v 8 You offer for sacrifices animals that are blind. Is that not wrong? accept such gifts? That is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says!"
\p
\v 9 And he also says, "You plead with me to act mercifully toward you. But you bring to me sacrifices that are not acceptable to me, so why should I act kindly toward you?"
\p
\v 10 The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels also says, "I wish that one of you would shut the gates of the temple courtyard, in order that no one could offer those worthless sacrifices. I am not pleased with you, and I will not accept the offerings that you bring to me.
\v 11 People of other nations honor me  am very great.
\p
\v 12 But you priests despise me by what you do. You say, 'It is all right if people pollute the altar by bringing sacrifices that are unacceptable.'
\v 13 You say 'We are tired of burning all these sacrifices on the altar.' You turn up your noses at I should accept them?
\p
\v 14 I will curse anyone who tries to cheat me by solemnly promising to bring to me a perfect ram from his flock of sheep and then brings to me one that has defects. If anyone does that, I will punish him, because I am a great king; I am the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels and people of the other nations revere me , but you do not!"
