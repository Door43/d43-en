\s Hebrews 3:1-6
\sr Our high priest, Jesus, deserves more honor than Moses does.
\p
\v 1 My fellow believers, God has set you apart and has chosen you, just like he chose me. So consider Jesus. He is God's messenger to us. He is also the high priest whom we say we believe in.
\v 2 He faithfully served God, who appointed him, just like Moses faithfully served God's people .
\v 3-4 Just like every house is made by someone , Jesus made everything, and he is God, Or: Divine. So God has considered that Jesus is worthy that people honor him more than they honor Moses, just like the one who builds a house deserves that people honor him more than they should honor the house he built.
\v 5 Moses very faithfully served God as he helped God's people, just like a servant faithfully serves his master. The result was that Moses testified about what Jesus would say later.
\v 6 But Christfaithfully serves God as he helps if we continue to confidently believe in Christ and if we continue to proudly wait for what God will do for us.
\s Hebrews 3:7-11
\sr Do not stubbornly rebel against God as their Jewish ancestors did.
\p
\v 7 The Holy Spirit caused the Psalmist to write these words in the Scriptures to the Israelites:
\q Now, when you,
\v 8 do not stubbornly disobey, as the your ancestors stubbornly disobeyed him when they rebelled against him in the desert.
\p At that time, God said to them, "They tried to determine how many things that displeased me they could do in the desert without me punishing them.
\v 9 Your ancestors repeatedly tested whether I would be patient with them, even though for forty years they saw all the amazing things I did.
\p
\v 10 So, I became disgusted with the people who saw those things, and I said about them, 'They are constantly disloyal to me, and they do not understand how I wanted them to conduct their lives.'
\p
\v 11 As a result, because I was angry with them, I solemnly declared, 'They will not enter the land of Canaan where I would let them rest !'
\s Hebrews 3:12-15
\sr Beware that you do not stop trusting in Christ.
\p
\v 12 In accordance with that, my fellow believers, beware that none of you wickedly stops trusting in Christ. That would cause you to reject the all-powerful God.
\v 13 Instead, each of you must encourage each other every day, while you still have the opportunity .
\v 14 We must do that, because we.
\v 15 We can do this by paying attention to what the Psalmist wrote in that Scripture passage in which God said,
\q Now, when you hear me speakingto you, do not stubbornly disobey me as your ancestors stubbornly disobeyed me when they rebelled against me.
\s Hebrews 3:16-19
\sr It was their ancestors for whom God did great things who rebelled against God.
\p
\v 16 You must keep trusting in God because you must remember who it was who rebelled against God although they heard him speaking to them.
\v 17 And you must remember who it was that God was disgusted with for forty years.
\v 18 And you must remember about whom God solemnly declared, "They will not enter the land where I would let them rest." It was those Israelites who disobeyed God.
\v 19 So, from that example we perceive that it was because they did not keep trusting in God that they were unable to enter the land where they would rest.
