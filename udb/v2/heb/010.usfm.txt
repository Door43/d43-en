\s Hebrews 10:1-4
\sr The blood of animals can never take away the guilt for sins.
\p
\v 1 Just like a shadow vaguely represents the thing that it is a shadow of, the laws that God gave Moses only poorly represent .
\v 2 If God had removed the guilt for having sinned of those who brought the sacrifices, they would not feel that they were still guilty. So they would certainly have stopped offering those sacrifices!
\v 3 But rather, the fact that they offer those sacrifices each year reminds them that they are still guilty for their sins.
\v 4 The principle is that blood of animals such as bulls or goats can never remove the guilt of those who have sinned.
\s Hebrews 10:5-10
\sr Christ set us apart for God by offering his own body once as a sacrifice.
\p
\v 5 So, as Christ was coming into the world, he said to his Father about offering himself as a sacrifice for people's sin, in words that the Psalmist wrote,
\q It is not sacrifices and offerings that you have wanted,
\q but you have prepared for me a body to serve you.
\q
\v 6 Animals that are completely burned up as sacrifices have not pleased you,
\q and other sacrifices that atone for those who have sinned have not pleased you.
\q
\v 7 Then because of this, I said, "My God, listen!
\q I have come here in order to do what you want me to do,
\q just like has been written  about me in the Scriptures."
\p
\v 8 First he said, "It is not sacrifices and offerings and animals that the priests have completely burned up and other offerings to atone for those who have sinned that you have really wanted. They have not pleased you." He said that even though those things were offered  according to the laws God gave Moses!
\v 9 Then, concerning his offering himself as a sacrifice to atone for people's sin, he said, "Listen! I have come here to do what you want me to do!" Thus Christ got rid of the first way of atoning for sin, in order to establish the second way of atoning for sin.
\v 10 Because of Jesus Christ doing what God wanted him to do, we have been set apart  for God by his offering his own body only once as a sacrifice, a sacrifice that will not need to be repeated.
\s Hebrews 10:11-18
\sr Scripture supports the claim that Christ made one sacrifice that will be adequate forever.
\p
\v 11 As every Jewish priest stands dailyin front of the altar, he performs rituals and offers the same kind of sacrifices that could never remove the guilt from anyone who sinned .
\v 12 But Christ offered a sacrifice that will be adequate forever, and he offered it only one time! Then he sat down to rule with God at the place of highest honor .
\v 13 From now on, he is waiting for God to completely subdue all his enemies .
\v 14 By offering himself once, he has provided that those whom God has set apart will be eternally made perfect.
\v 15 The Holy Spirit also confirms to us that that is true. First the Lord says:
\q
\v 16 When the time  of the first covenant with my people has finished,
\q I will make a new covenant with them .
\q I will do like this for them:
\q I will cause them to understand my laws
\q and I will cause them to obey them .
\p
\v 17 Then he said:
\q I will forgive them for their  sins,
\q and I will consider that they are no longer guilty for having sinned.
\p
\v 18 When God has forgiven someone's sins, that person does not need to make any more offerings to atone for his sin!
\s Hebrews 10:19-25
\sr Let us come to God and let him make us pure and help us to hold fast to his truth and do things that please him.
\p
\v 19 So, my fellow believers, because we trust in what Jesus accomplished when his own blood flowed for us, we can confidently go into God's very presence that was symbolized by the very holy place in the tent .
\v 20 He enabled us to go into God's presence by making a new and effective way. Specifically, he offered his body as a sacrifice for us in order that nothing would stop us from entering God's presence, just like  the curtain of the very holy place prevented people from entering God's presence.
\v 21 Christ is a great priest who rules over us, who are God's people .
\v 22 Just like the priests were sprinkled  must approach God sincerely by confidently trusting in him.
\v 23 We must unwaveringly keep professing what we believe. Since God faithfully does all he promised to do, we must confidently expect him to keep doing that.
\v 24 Since God faithfully does all that he promised to do, let us consider how each of us can stimulate the others, in order that each one will love the others, and in order that each one will do good deeds.
\v 25 We must not cease assembling ourselves to worship the Lord, as some people have done. Instead, each one of us must encourage is near.
\s Hebrews 10:26-31
\sr If we have known and then rejected the message about Christ, God will surely punish us.
\p
\v 26 We must do those things, because if we deliberately and habitually sin after we have known the true message about Christ, no other sacrifice will remove our guilt for having sinned in this way.
\v 27 Instead, we must fearfully expect that God will judge us, and then he will angrily punish his enemies in a furious fire .
\v 28 Everyone who rejected the laws that God gave Moses was mercilessly killed when at least two or three people testified that they had done that.
\v 29 That was severe punishment. But Christ is God's Son!
\v 30 We can be sure of that (OR, need to think about that carefully) since we know that God said, "I myself will get revenge on those who sinned, and I will give them the punishment that they deserve ." And Moses wrote, "The Lord will judge his people."
\v 31 It will be a terrible thing if the all-powerful God !
\s Hebrews 10:32-39
\sr Remember how you accepted persecution because of your faith in Christ, and do not be discouraged if you are persecuted now.
\p
\v 32 Recall the former times when you first understood  the message about Christ. You endured a hard struggle, and you continued to trust him when you suffered because you believed in Christ.
\v 33 At times you were publicly insulted . At other times you showed great concern for those who were treated like that.
\v 34 You not only were kind to those who were in prison because they believed in Christ, but you also accepted it joyfully when unbelievers took away your possessions. You accepted it because you yourselves knew very well that you have eternal possessions in heaven that are much better than those that they took from you!
\v 35 So, do not become discouraged when they cause you to suffer , because if you continue to trust in God, he will greatly reward you.
\v 36 You must patiently continue to trust in him in order that, because of your doing what God wants you to do, he will give you what he has promised.
\v 37 You must do that since a prophet wrote in the Scriptures that God said about the Messiah,
\q In just a short time the one I promised would come will surely come;
\q he will not delay coming.
\q
\v 38 But those whom I have summoned, who act righteously, must continually live trusting in me,
\q because if they, in a cowardly manner, cease to trust in me, I
\q will not be pleased with them.
\p
\v 39 But we are not ones who in a cowardly manner cease to trust in God, with the result that God will severely punish us. Instead, we are ones who trust in him, with the result that God will save us  eternally.
