\s Hebrews 2:1-4
\sr We will not escape God's punishment if we ignore such a great message of salvation.
\p
\v 1 So, since that is true, we must pay very great attention to what we have heard about God's Son, in order that we do not drift away from it, as a boat drifts off its course when people do not guide it .
\v 2 God's laws that were spoken by angels were valid, and God justly punished all who transgressed them and all who disobeyed  them.
\v 3 So, we will certainly not escape God punishing us if we ignore such a great message about how God .
\v 4 God also confirmed to us that this message was true by enabling believers to do many things that showed God's power, to do other miraculous things , and to do other things by the gifts that the Holy Spirit distributed to them according to what God desired.
\s Hebrews 2:5-9a
\sr God has determined that Christ, not angels or people, will rule everything.
\p
\v 5 God has not determined that the angels will rule over everything. Instead, he has determined that Christ will rule in the new world that God will create. That is the new world about which I am writing.
\v 6 Someone spoke toGod about this somewhere in the Scriptures, saying,
\q No one is worthy enough for you to think about him!
\q No human is worthy enough for you to care for him!
\q
\v 7 So it is surprising that you have caused people to be for a little while inferior in rank to angels.
\q You have greatly honored , as kings are honored with a crown.
\q
\v 8 You have put everything under their control .
\p God has determined that people will rule over everything . That means that nothing will be omitted from their control. But now, at this present time, we perceive that people do not yet have authority over everything.
\v 9 But we do know about Jesus, who truly has authority over everything!
\s Hebrews 2:9b-13
\sr Jesus, the creator of everything, is the one who died for us, makes us holy, and proclaims us to be his brothers and sisters.
\p Jesus, for a little, while became inferior in rank to angels in order to die on behalf of  by being crowned as kings are.
\v 10 It was fitting that God makeJesus perfect to share his glory. God is the one who created all things, and he is the one for whom all thingsexist. He perfected Jesus by causing him to suffer and die. Jesus is the one who enables God to save people.
\v 11 Jesus, the one who makes people holy proclaims them to be like his own brothersand sisters.
\v 12 The Psalmist wrote what Christ said to God about us becoming his brothers, in these words,
\q I will proclaim to my brothers how awesome you are .
\q I will sing praise to you in the midst of the congregation!
\p
\v 13 And a prophet wrote in another Scripture passage what Christ said about God,
\q I will trust him.
\p And in another Scripture passage, Christ said about those who are like his children,
\q I and the ones that God has given me are here.
\s Hebrews 2:14-18
\sr It is Jesus, not angels, who became a human to help us as our high priest.
\p
\v 14 So, since those whom God calls his children are all human beings , Jesus also became a human being just like them. The devil has the power to cause people to be afraid to die, but Christ became human in order that by his dying he might make the devil powerless.
\v 15 Jesus did that to free all of us who are like slaves  all the time we live, because we are forced to be afraid to die.
\v 16 Because Jesus became a human being, it is not angels that he wants to help. No, it is we who trust God as Abraham did whom he wants to help.
\v 17 So, since he came to help humans, not angels, he had to be made exactly like us whom he calls his own brothers and sisters. He wants to be a high priest who acts mercifully to all people and who acts faithfully in God's matters, so that people who had sinned would no longer be guilty.
\v 18 Specifically, he is able to help those who are temptedto sin. He can do that because he suffered, and he was also tempted to sin like we are tempted to sin.
