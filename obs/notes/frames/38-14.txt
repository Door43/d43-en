===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **came to** - Some languages may prefer to say, "went to."
  * **Greetings** - This can also be translated as, "Hello" or, "Peace" or, "Good evening."
  * **the sign** - That is, "the signal."
  * **do you betray me with a kiss?** - That is, "are you really going to betray me with a kiss?" Jesus is not looking for an answer to this question. So some languages would translate it as a statement, such as, "you are betraying me by kissing me!" or, "you make your betrayal even worse by kissing me!"
