====== holy ======


===== Definition: =====

The term "holy" has a wide range of meanings which all pertain to God and his sinless, morally perfect character. "Holy" and "holiness" also refer to being "set apart" for God.

  * Only God is absolutely holy, but he makes people and things holy.
  * A person who is holy belongs to God and has been set apart for the purpose of serving God and bringing him glory.
  * An object that God has declared to be holy is one that he has set apart for his glory and use, such as an altar that is for the purpose of presenting offerings to him.
  * Since God is holy, people cannot approach him unless he allows them to, because they are mere human beings, sinful and imperfect.
  * In the Old Testament, God set apart the priests for special service to him. They had to be ceremonially cleansed from sin in order to approach God.
  * God also set apart as holy certain places and things that belonged to him or in which he revealed himself, such as "holy ground" (Exodus 3:5) or his temple.
  * To "make holy" is often translated as "sanctify" in English. It could also be translated using the concept of "set apart something or someone for God's glory".
  * Where the //shekinah// glory shone, sandals were not allowed.
  * Ways to translate "holy" might include, "set apart for God" or "belonging to God" or "completely pure" or "perfectly sinless."
