====== Law of Moses, Law of the Lord, God's Law, Law ======

===== Definition: =====

The term, "Law of Moses" refers generally to the commandments and instructions that God gave Moses for the people of Israel to obey. Sometimes this is called the "Law of the LORD" or "God's Law" or just "the Law."

  * God gave Moses this law at Mount Sinai in the desert, and Moses gave it to the people.
  * Depending on the context, "The Law of Moses" can also be translated as "the law that Moses wrote" or "the books that Moses wrote."
