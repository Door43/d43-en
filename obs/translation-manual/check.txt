===== How to Check Open Bible Stories =====

When all 50 Open Bible Stories are translated, we encourage each translation to be checked the stories through all three levels of checking as outlined below. 

==== Definition of a Checking Level ====

A Checking Level of Open Bible Stories refers to a three-level iterative checking scale that helps show the extent to which the accuracy of a translation has been corroborated. The checking levels that are used on Door43 have been developed by the [[https://unfoldingword.org|unfoldingWord network]], the same group that manages Door43 with the help of many volunteers.

There are three checking levels: [[#Checking Level 1 - Internal Check|Checking Level 1]], [[#Checking Level 2 - External Check|Checking Level 2]], and [[#Checking Level 3 - Authenticated Check|Checking Level 3]]. Any translation that has not yet been checked to Level 1 is considered to have not been checked and is assigned no checking status.

''Note: Only translations that have reached Checking Level 1 (Checking Level 2 for Bible translations) or higher will be made available on the [[https://unfoldingword.org/stories|unfoldingWord website]] and the unfoldingWord mobile app.''

''Also note: Only translations that have reached Checking Level 3 will be approved as source texts for other translations.''

''Also note: Only Open Bible Stories translations that have been made off of version 3.0 or higher are eligible to be checked to Level 1 (or higher). Translations made off of versions before 3.0 [[:en:obs:translation-manual:update|must be updated]] before proceeding with Checking Levels.''

The purpose of the Checking Levels is to make translated materials quickly available to the church, allowing the content to be iteratively checked and corroborated in the open while clearly indicating the degree to which its accuracy has been corroborated. We believe this will result in a faster checking process, broad church participation and ownership, and better translations.

==== The Checking Levels ====

The strategy for quality assurance of unfoldingWord content, including Open Bible Stories, is described briefly here and in detail in the document [[http://distantshores.org/resources/whitepapers/quality-assurance|“Quality Assurance of Open-License Biblical Content”]].

The three-level checking scale we use is dependent on the unfoldingWord [[:en:statement-of-faith|Statement of Faith]] and [[:en:translation-guidelines|Translation Guidelines]]. All translated content is compared against the theology of the Statement of Faith and against the procedures and methodologies of the Translation Guidelines. With these documents forming the foundation, these are the three levels of checking used in the unfoldingWord project:

=== Checking Level 1 – Internal Check ===

  * The translator (or team) asserts that the Statement of Faith is an accurate reflection of their own beliefs and that the translated content is also in harmony with it.
  * The translator (or team) asserts that the translated content has been done in accordance with the Translation Guidelines and that they have made full use of available exegetical and translation checking resources in the translation process.
  * The translator (or team) is in personal contact with at least one element of the unfoldingWord network.
  * For the purposes of the unfoldingWord project, translations of Bible texts are only published once they achieve Level 2. Other biblical content is made available at Level 1.
  * //This enables the broadest reach of the content as an active project, with an open invitation (implied or direct) to help improve the translation. //

=== Checking Level 2 – External Check ===

  * The content has been comprehensively reviewed by at least three church leaders who are native speakers of the target language, and at least one of which understands well one of the languages in which the source text is available. The reviewers should not be related to, or otherwise closely connected with the translator (or translation team). Usually the reviewers will be pastors of church congregations.
  * The reviewers should be affiliated with Church networks that are in agreement with the Statement of Faith and Translation Guidelines. It is preferable for the reviewers to be from a representative sample of the denominations in the language.
  * As in Level 1, the translated content is compared to the Statement of Faith and Translation Guidelines and the checkers assert that the translated content conforms to both.
  * //This implements the concept of a “testimony of two or three witnesses” in the checking process. //

=== Checking Level 3 – Authenticated Check ===

There are two tracks by which content can achieve level 3.

Track 1 (Three Church Networks):

  * The first track is completed when the content has been thoroughly checked by at least three separate Church networks.
  * Those checking the translation must be first-language speakers of the language, and those signing off on the check must be leaders of the Church networks.
  * A leader of a Church network who is also a first-language speaker of the language of the translation may both check the translation and sign off on its quality.
  * Level 3 in this track is thus achieved by the mutual agreement of multiple elements of the Church internal.

Track 2 (Trained Translation Checker + One Church Network):

  * The second track is completed when the content has been thoroughly checked by an accountable entity in the unfoldingWord network that has training and experience in checking translated biblical content, as well as by a Church network with first-language speakers of the language (as described in the first track).
  * Level 3 in this track is thus achieved by the mutual agreement of the Church internal and the Church global, as represented by the accountable entity.
  * //Note: Entities such as translation organizations and church denominations can be part of the unfoldingWord network, given that they agree with the Statement of Faith and Translation Guidelines and that they are publicly accountable in some way to constituents who are part of the Church (including donors, members, etc.). Based on the strength of the trust relationship between entities, the unfoldingWord network can grow rapidly and it becomes self-reinforcing as multiple nodes connect to each other.//

In either track, the checking entities must have a track record that does not contradict their assertion that they adhere to the Statement of Faith and Translation Guidelines.

  * //This implements a “by their fruit you will know them” component. //

==== Checking the checkers ====

The process and checking framework described in this document depends on an ongoing process of checking and revising content, as determined by the Church that uses the content. Feedback loops are encouraged (and modeled in translation software, where feasible) with a view to maximizing input from the greatest number of users of the content. The translations of the content are made available on the [[http://door43.org|Door43]] translation platform, which is designed to make it easy for users to collaboratively create content that increases in quality over time.
