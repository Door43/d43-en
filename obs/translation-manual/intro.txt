===== What is Open Bible Stories? =====

==== Overview ====

Open Bible Stories ([[http://openbiblestories.com]]) is 50 key stories of the Bible, from Creation to Revelation, for evangelism & discipleship, in text, audio, & video, on any mobile phone, in any language, for free. This free & open visual mini-Bible is made of 600 images plus corresponding text making it easily accessible to both children and adults. 

From its inception, Open Bible Stories was designed with wide-spread translation and distribution in mind. Our goal is that Biblical content be translated into every language of the world. To make this a reality, we strive to ensure that anyone, anywhere be able to start translating Open Bible Stories, today. To help facilitate this, wordings have been carefully selected that are easily translated, but also completely accurate to the Bible. We have also created a complete set of **translation notes** which help the translator understand the exegetical, linguistic, and cultural setting of the text to help ensure a scripturally-accurate, easily-understandable translation. Several **translation tools** that help facilitate the translation and distribution process have also been created. A series of translation checks for Open Bible Stories helps to ensure the highest quality translation as well as accuracy to the Biblical text. Finally, all of the text, images, and tools are released under an open license which enables wide-spread collaboration and redistribution. 

==== Translation Notes ====

In order to help translators of Open Bible Stories to do the best translation work possible, translation notes were developed for each frame (picture + corresponding text) of each story. There are **exegetical notes** which help to explain the theological significance behind certain words and passages. There are **linguistic notes** which help to bring fuller understanding of the source language and how that language interacts with the original Biblical languages. There are **cultural notes** which help explain the Biblical culture. In addition to all of this, there is a complete set of **important terms** found in Open Bible Stories with short articles explaining more fully who or what that term is and why it is significant. The important terms also come with **cross references** to other places in Open Bible Stories where that important term is used. 

==== Translation Tools ====

Several tools have been developed to facilitate the translation, checking, and distribution of Open Bible Stories: 

  * [[https://door43.org|Door43]] – an online translation platform where anyone can collaborate in the translation and checking of Open Bible Stories. This website can be extended to hosts translation projects for every language of the world.

==== Audio & Video ====

Open Bible Stories is now able to handle audio recordings of Open Bible Stories! Though recording and play-back is not fully functional in the mobile apps, it is in active development.

Once an audio recording of Open Bible Stories is completed, the audio can be used to automatically generate a custom video. This video generator proof of concept is functional and can be run manually, but development for fully automated video rendering is still in production. No date for delivery has been set.
