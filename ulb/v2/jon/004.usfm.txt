\v 1 But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry.
\v 2 And he prayed to Jehovah, and said, I pray thee, O Jehovah, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country?
Therefore I hasted to flee to Tarshish; for I knew that you are a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in
lovingkindness, and repent you of the evil.
\v 3 Therefore now, O Jehovah, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.
\v 4 And Jehovah said, Doest you well to be angry?
\v 5 Then Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the
shade, till he might see what would become of the city.
\p
\v 6 And Jehovah God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to deliver
him from his evil case. So Jonah was exceeding glad because of the gourd.
\v 7 But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it struck the gourd, that it withered.
\v 8 And it came to pass, when the sun arose, that God prepared a sultry east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah,
that he fainted, and requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.
\v 9 And God said to Jonah, Doest you well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even to death.
\v 10 And Jehovah said, You have had regard for the gourd, for which you have not labored, neither made it grow; which came
up in a night, and perished in a night:
\v 11 and should not I have regard for Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot
discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?
