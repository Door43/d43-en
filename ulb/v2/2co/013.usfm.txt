\c 13
\p
\v 1 This is the third time I am coming to you. At the mouth of two witnesses or three shall every word be established.
\v 2 I have said beforehand, and I do say beforehand, as when I was present the second time, so now, being absent, to them that
have sinned heretofore, and to all the rest, that, if I come again, I will not spare;
\v 3 seeing that you seek a proof of Christ that speaks in me; who to you-ward is not weak, but is powerful in you:
\v 4 for he was crucified through weakness, yet he lives through the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall
live with him through the power of God toward you.
\v 5 Try your own selves, whether you are in the faith; prove your own selves. Or know you not as to your own selves, that Jesus
Christ is in you? unless indeed you be reprobate.
\v 6 But I hope that you shall know that we are not reprobate.
\v 7 Now we pray to God that you do no evil; not that we may appear approved, but that you may do that which is honorable, though
we be as reprobate.
\v 8 For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
\v 9 For we rejoice, when we are weak, and you are strong: this we also pray for, even your perfecting.
\v 10 For this cause I write these things while absent, that I may not when present deal sharply, according to the authority
which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for casting down.
\p
\v 11 Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfected; be comforted; be of the same mind; live in peace: and the God of love and
peace shall be with you.
\v 12 Salute one another with a holy kiss.
\p
\v 13 All the saints salute you.
\p
\v 14 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.
