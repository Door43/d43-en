\c 20
\p
\v 1 In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him, and he fought against Ashdod and took
it;
\v 2 at that time Jehovah spoke by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go, and loose the sackcloth from off your loins, and put your
shoe from off your foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.
\v 3 And Jehovah said, Like as my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and a wonder concerning
Egypt and concerning Ethiopia;
\v 4 so shall the king of Assyria lead away the captives of Egypt, and the exiles of Ethiopia, young and old, naked and
barefoot, and with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.
\v 5 And they shall be dismayed and confounded, because of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their glory.
\v 6 And the inhabitant of this coast-land shall say in that day, Behold, such is our expectation, whither we fled for help to
be delivered from the king of Assyria: and we, how shall we escape?
