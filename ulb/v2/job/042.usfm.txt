\v 1 Then Job answered Jehovah, and said,
\q
\v 2 I know that you can do all things,
\q And that no purpose of your can be restrained.
\q
\v 3 Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?
\q Therefore have I uttered that which I understood not,
\q Things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.
\q
\v 4 Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak;
\q I will demand of thee, and declare you to me.
\q
\v 5 I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear;
\q But now mine eye sees thee:
\q
\v 6 Wherefore I abhor myself,
\q And repent in dust and ashes.
\p
\v 7 And it was so, that, after Jehovah had spoken these words to Job, Jehovah said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is
kindled against thee, and against your two friends; for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job
hath.
\v 8 Now therefore, take to you seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a
burnt-offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you; for him will I accept, that I deal not with you after your folly; for you
have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.
\v 9 So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as Jehovah commanded
them: and Jehovah accepted Job.
\p
\v 10 And Jehovah turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: and Jehovah gave Job twice as much as he had
before.
\v 11 Then came there to him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before,
and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him concerning all the evil that Jehovah had
brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one a ring of gold.
\v 12 So Jehovah blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: and he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand
camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses.
\v 13 He had also seven sons and three daughters.
\v 14 And he called the name of the first, Jemimah; and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third,
Keren-happuch.
\v 15 And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among
their brethren.
\v 16 And after this Job lived a hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons,
even four generations.
\v 17 So Job died, being old and full of days.
