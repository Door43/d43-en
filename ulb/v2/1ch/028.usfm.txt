\c 28
\p
\v 1 And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the companies that served
the king by course, and the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, and the rulers over all the substance and
possessions of the king and of his sons, with the officers, and the mighty men, even all the mighty men of valor, to
Jerusalem.
\v 2 Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: as for me, it was in my heart
to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and for the footstool of our God; and I had made ready for the
building.
\v 3 But God said to me, You shall not build a house for my name, because you are a man of war, and have shed blood.
\v 4 Howbeit Jehovah, the God of Israel, chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he
has chosen Judah to be prince; and in the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he took
pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel;
\v 5 And of all my sons (for Jehovah has given me many sons), he has chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the
kingdom of Jehovah over Israel.
\v 6 And he said to me, Solomon your son, he shall build my house and my courts; for I have chosen him to be my son, and I
will be his father.
\v 7 And I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my commandments and mine ordinances, as at this day.
\v 8 Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of Jehovah, and in the audience of our God, observe and seek out
all the commandments of Jehovah your God; that you may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children
after you for ever.
\p
\v 9 And you, Solomon my son, know you the God of your father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind; for
Jehovah searcheth all hearts, and understands all the imaginations of the youghts: if you seek him, he will be found of
you; but if you forsake him, he will cast you off for ever.
\v 10 Take heed now; for Jehovah has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.
\p
\v 11 Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch
of the temple, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper rooms thereof, and of the
inner chambers thereof, and of the place of the mercy-seat;
\v 12 and the pattern of all that he had by the Spirit, for the courts of the house of Jehovah, and for all the chambers round
about, for the treasuries of the house of God, and for the treasuries of the dedicated things;
\v 13 also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of Jehovah, and for
all the vessels of service in the house of Jehovah;
\v 14 of gold by weight for the vessels of gold, for all vessels of every kind of service;
of silver for all the vessels of silver by weight, for all vessels of every kind of service;
\v 15 by weight also for the candlesticks of gold, and for the lamps thereof, of gold, by weight for every candlestick and for
the lamps thereof; and for the candlesticks of silver, silver by weight for
every candlestick and for the lamps thereof, according to the use of every candlestick;
\v 16 and the gold by weight for the tables of showbread, for every table; and silver for the tables of silver;
\v 17 and the flesh-hooks, and the basins, and the cups, of pure gold; and for the golden bowls by weight for every bowl; and
for the silver bowls by weight for every bowl;
\v 18 and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot,
even the cherubim, that spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of Jehovah.
\v 19 All this, said David, have I been made to understand in writing from the hand of Jehovah, even all the works of
this pattern.
\p
\v 20 And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed; for Jehovah God,
even my God, is with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until all the work for the service of the house of Jehovah
be finished.
\v 21 And, behold, there are the courses of the priests and the Levites, for all the service of the house of God: and there
shall be with you in all manner of work every willing man that has skill, for any manner of service: also the captains and
all the people will be wholly at your commandment.
