Every day as they walked there, a **[[:en:obs:notes:key-terms:servant|slave girl]]** **[[:en:obs:notes:key-terms:demon-possessed|possessed by a demon]]** followed them. By means of this **[[:en:obs:notes:key-terms:demon|demon]]** she predicted the future for people, so she made a lot of money for **her [[:en:obs:notes:key-terms:lord|masters]]** **as a fortuneteller**.
