====== Who Touched Me? [32-15] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-32-15.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Immediately, **[[:en:obs:notes:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** realized that **[[:en:obs:notes:key-terms:power|power]] had gone out from him**. So he turned around and asked, “Who touched me?” The **[[:en:obs:notes:key-terms:disciple|disciples]]** replied, “There are many people crowding around you and bumping into you. **Why did you ask, ‘Who touched me?’**”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **power had gone out from him** - This may be translated as, “healing power had flowed from him into someone else” or, “his power had healed someone.” Jesus did not lose any power because of this. 
  * **Why did you ask, ‘Who touched me?’** - In some languages it may be better to use an indirect quote here such as, “Why did you ask who was touching you?” or, “Why you are wondering who touched you?”
