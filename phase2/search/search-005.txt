====== Search 005: AT's with final periods in p2check and p2pass ======

~~NOCACHE~~

The script on this page searches for periods followed by closing double quotes and a TA link. Some of these may be legitimate constructions, rather than AT's. However, most are AT statements that should not have final periods.
