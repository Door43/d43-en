\c 4
\s1 The coming day of punishment
\p
\v 1 This is also what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says: “There will be a time that I will judge \add and punish\add* people. When that happens, it will be like [SIM] a very hot furnace. On that day, all the proud and wicked people will be burned up like [MET] stubble burns. They will be burned up completely—like roots and branches \add and everything else on a tree burns completely in a very hot fire\add*.
\v 2 But for you who revere me [MTY], the one who will save you will \add come to you\add* like [MET] \add the sun shines in the morning, and enable you to\add* become righteous (OR, \add do what is\add* righteous); he will restore you \add and protect you like a bird protects its chicks\add* [MET] under its wings. \add When he comes\add*, you will \add be very joyful, like\add* [SIM] calves that go out from the barn into the pasture leaping joyfully.
\v 3 On the day when I judge people, you will tread on wicked people as though [SIM] they were the dirt under your feet. That is what I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, promise.
\p
\v 4 Be sure to obey the laws that I gave to Moses, who served me \add well\add*. Obey all the commandments and regulations that I gave him on Sinai \add Mountain\add*, for all \add you people of\add* Israel \add to obey. \add*
\p
\v 5 Listen \add to this: Some day\add* I will send to you the prophet Elijah. \add He will arrive\add* before the great and dreadful/terrible day when I, Yahweh, \add will judge and punish people\add*.
\v 6 Because of what he \add preaches\add*, parents and their children will be united \add in loving\add* each other again [IDI]. If that does not happen, I will come and destroy your country.”
