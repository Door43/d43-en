\c 1
\p
\v 1 This is the message that Yahweh gave to \add the prophet\add* Malachi to \add give to the people of\add* Israel.
\s1 Yahweh's love for the people of Israel
\p
\v 2 Yahweh says, “I have always loved you \add Israeli people\add*.”
\p
\v 3 But you reply, “In what way have you loved us?”
\p Yahweh replies, “\add This is how I loved you\add*: \add It is true that your ancestor\add* Jacob was [RHQ] Esau's \add younger\add* brother, and I loved Jacob, but I rejected Esau. I caused his hilly region to become ◄desolate/a place where crops did not grow►. I caused the land which he possessed to become a desert where jackals/wolves live.”
\p
\v 4 The descendants of Esau who live in Edom may say, “Yes, we have been crushed/ruined, but we will rebuild houses in the ruins.”
\p But the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels replies, “They may build \add houses again\add*, but I will demolish them again. Their country will be called 'The land where wicked people \add live\add*' and their people will be called 'The people with whom Yahweh is angry forever.'~”
\p
\v 5 When you \add Israeli\add* people yourselves see \add what I will do to them\add*, you will say, “It is evident far beyond the borders of Israel that Yahweh is very great!”
\s1 Unacceptable sacrifices
\p
\v 6 But the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says to the priests, “Boys honor their fathers, and servants respect their masters. So, if I am like your father and your master, why [RHQ] do you not honor and respect me? You have despised me [MTY]!”
\p But you ask, “◄How/In what way► have we despised you?”
\p
\v 7 \add Yahweh replies\add*, “\add Instead of honoring me, you have despised me\add* by offering sacrifices on my altar that are unacceptable to me.”
\p Then you ask, “What sacrifices have we given that have been unacceptable to you?”
\p \add Yahweh replies\add*, “You think that ◄it does not matter/it is okay► if you do not respect my altar.
\v 8 You offer for sacrifices animals that are blind. ◄Is that not wrong?/That is disgusting!► [RHQ] And you offer for sacrifices animals that are crippled or that have diseases. ◄Is that also not wrong?/That also is disgusting!► [RHQ] If you tried to give presents like that to your governor, do you think [RHQ] that he would be pleased? Would he [RHQ] accept such gifts? \add That is what\add* the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says!”
\p
\v 9 \add And he also says\add*, “You plead with me to act mercifully toward you. But you bring to me sacrifices that are not acceptable to me, so why should I act kindly toward you?”
\p
\v 10 The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels also says, “I wish/desire that one of you would shut the gates \add of the temple courtyard\add*, in order that no one could offer those worthless sacrifices. I am not pleased with you, and I will not accept the offerings that you bring to me.
\v 11 People of other nations honor me [MTY] \add every day\add*, from sunrise/morning until sunset/evening. All over the world people offer incense and other pure/acceptable offerings to me [MTY]. They do that because people among all the nations know that I [MTY] am very great.
\p
\v 12 But you \add priests\add* despise me \add by what you do\add*. You say, ‘\add It is all right if\add* people pollute the altar by bringing sacrifices that are unacceptable.’
\v 13 You say ‘We are tired of \add burning all these sacrifices on the altar\add*.’ You ◄turn up your noses at/act very disrespectfully toward► me. When you bring to me animals that have been stolen or ones that are crippled or that have diseases, to offer them for sacrifices, \add do you think that\add* [RHQ] I should accept them?
\p
\v 14 I will curse anyone who \add tries to\add* cheat me by solemnly promising to bring to me a perfect ram from his flock \add of sheep\add* and then brings to me one that has defects. \add If anyone does that, I will punish him\add*, because I am a great king; I am the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels and people of the other nations revere me [MTY], \add but you do not\add*!”
