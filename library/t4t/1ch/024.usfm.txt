\s1 The duties of the priests
\p
\v 1 These are the groups of the descendants of Aaron \add the first Supreme Priest\add*: Aaron's four sons were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
\p
\v 2 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father died, and they had no children. So their \add younger\add* brothers Eleazar and Ithamar became the priests.
\v 3 Zadok, who was a descendant of Eleazar, and Ahimelech, who was a descendant of Ithamar, helped David to separate the family groups into two groups. Each group had certain duties.
\v 4 There were more leaders among the descendants of Eleazar than there were among the descendants of Ithamar. So they appointed sixteen leaders from Eleazar's descendants and eight leaders from Ithamar's descendants.
\v 5 There were temple officials and priests who were there, including descendants of both Eleazar and Ithamar, to make sure that the work was divided fairly. So they decided what work each group would do by ◄casting lots/throwing marked stones►.
\p
\v 6 Shemaiah, the son of Nethanel, who was a descendant of Levi, wrote down the names \add of the leaders of each group\add* while David and his officials were watching. Zadok, the \add Supreme\add* Priest, and Ahimelech \add his assistant\add*, and the leaders of the families of the priests and of the families of the other descendants of Levi also watched.
