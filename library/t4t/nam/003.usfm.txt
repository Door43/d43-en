\c 3
\s1 Nineveh will be punished
\q1
\v 1 Terrible things will happen to Nineveh,
\q2 that city \add that is full of people who\add* murder [MTY] and lie.
\q1 The city is full of things that were seized \add by their soldiers from other countries\add*;
\q2 \add their armies\add* continually [LIT] have acted brutally towards people whom they conquered.
\q1
\v 2 But \add now listen to the enemy soldiers coming to attack Nineveh\add*;
\q1 listen to them cracking their whips,
\q2 and listen to the rattle of their chariot wheels!
\q1 \add Listen to\add* their galloping horses
\q2 and their chariots as they bounce along!
\q1
\v 3 Look at their flashing swords and glittering spears
\q2 as the horsemen race forward!
\q1 Many \add people of Nineveh\add* will be killed;
\q1 there will be piles of corpses,
\q2 with the result that people will stumble over them.
\q1
\v 4 All \add that will happen\add* because Nineveh is like [MET] a beautiful prostitute
\q2 \add who lures men to where they will be ruined\add*;
\q1 Nineveh is a beautiful city
\q2 which has attracted/enticed \add people of\add* other nations \add to come there\add*.
\q1 \add The people of Nineveh\add* taught those people of other nations \add rituals of\add* magic,
\q2 and caused them to become their slaves.
\q1
\v 5 So the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says to \add the people of Nineveh\add*:
\q2 “I am your enemy,
\q1 and I will \add cause the people in\add* other nations to see you \add completely\add* humiliated
\q2 like [MET] \add women who have committed adultery are humiliated by\add* having their skirts lifted high,
\q2 \add with the result that\add* people can see their naked \add bodies\add*.
\q1
\v 6 I will cause rubbish/garbage to be thrown at you;
\q2 I will show others that I despise you very much,
\q2 and I will cause you to be publicly ridiculed.
\q1
\v 7 All those who see you will turn their backs to you and say,
\q1 ‘Nineveh is ruined,
\q2 but absolutely no one [RHQ] will mourn for it.’
\q2 No one will regret Nineveh being destroyed!”
\s1 The people of Nineveh will not be able to defend themselves
\q1
\v 8 Your city is certainly [RHQ] no safer than Thebes \add city\add* was.
\q2 Thebes was an important city beside the Nile \add River\add*;
\q2 the river was like [SIM] a wall that protected the city [DOU].
\q1
\v 9 \add The rulers of\add* Ethiopia and Egypt helped Thebes;
\q2 there was no limit to their power.
\q1 \add The governments of the nearby countries of\add* Put and Libya were also allies of Thebes.
\q1
\v 10 But Thebes was captured,
\q2 and its people were ◄exiled/forced to go to other countries►.
\q1 Their babies were dashed to pieces in the streets of the city.
\q1 \add Enemy soldiers\add* ◄cast lots/threw small marked stones► to decide who would get each official in Thebes \add to become his slave\add*.
\q2 All the leaders of Thebes were fastened/tied by chains.
\q1
\v 11 You \add people of Nineveh\add* will similarly become dazed and drunk,
\q2 and you will search for places to hide
\q2 to escape from your enemies.
\b
\q1
\v 12 \add Your enemies will cause\add* the walls around your city to fall down
\q2 like [SIM] the first figs that fall from fig trees \add each year\add*.
\q1 \add Your city will be captured easily, like\add* [MET] figs that fall into the mouths [HYP] of those who shake the fig trees.
\q1
\v 13 Look at your soldiers!
\q2 They will be \add as weak/helpless as\add* [MET] women!
\q1 The gates of your city will be opened wide
\q2 \add to allow\add* your enemies \add to enter them\add*,
\q2 and then the bars of those gates will be burned.
\b
\q1
\v 14 Store up water \add now to use when\add* your enemies surround the city!
\q2 Repair the forts!
\q1 Dig up clay and trample it \add to make it soft\add*,
\q2 and put it into molds to make bricks \add to repair the walls\add*!
\q1
\v 15 Nevertheless, \add your enemies\add* will burn your \add city\add*;
\q2 they will kill you with their swords;
\q2 they will kill you like [SIM] locusts destroy crops.
\q1
\v 16 In your city there are now very many merchants;
\q2 \add it seems that\add* there are more of them than there are stars.
\q1 But \add when your city is being destroyed, those merchants will take the valuable things and disappear\add*
\q2 like [SIM] locusts that strip the leaves from plants and then fly away.
\q1
\v 17 Your leaders are also like a swarm of [SIM] locusts [DOU]
\q2 that crowd together on the fences/walls on a cold day,
\q1 and then fly away when the sun comes up,
\q2 and no one knows where they have gone.
\b
\q1
\v 18 King of Assyria, your officials will all be dead [EUP];
\q2 your important people will lie down and rest \add forever\add*.
\q1 Your people will be scattered over the mountains,
\q2 and there will no one to gather them together.
\q1
\v 19 You are like someone who has a wound that cannot be healed;
\q2 it will be a wound that causes him to die.
\q1 And all those who hear about what has happened to you will clap their hands \add joyfully\add*.
\q2 \add They will say\add*, “Everyone has [RHQ] suffered because he continually acted very cruelly toward us.”
