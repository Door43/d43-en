\v 1 \add I am\add* Nahum, from Elkosh \add village\add*. This is a message about Nineveh \add city, the capital of Assyria\add*, that was given to me in a vision \add by Yahweh\add*.
\s1 Yahweh is angry with the people of Nineveh
\q1
\v 2 Yahweh our God ◄is jealous/does not want people to worship any other god►.
\q2 He is very angry \add with those who worship other gods\add*,
\q1 and he gets revenge [DOU] \add on all those who oppose him\add* [DOU].
\q1
\v 3 Yahweh does not quickly become angry;
\q2 but he is very powerful,
\q1 and he will certainly punish [LIT] those who have done evil things [MTY].
\q1 He shows his power by sending whirlwinds and storms,
\q2 and clouds are like [MET] the dust \add stirred up by\add* his feet.
\q1
\v 4 When he commands oceans and rivers to become dry,
\q2 they dry up.
\q1 He causes \add the grass in the fields in\add* the Bashan \add region\add* and \add on the slopes of\add* Carmel \add Mountain\add* to wither,
\q2 and causes the flowers in Lebanon to fade.
\q1
\v 5 When he appears, \add it is as though\add* the mountains shake and the hills melt;
\q2 the earth quakes and the people on the earth tremble.
\q1
\v 6 There is no one [RHQ] who can resist him when he becomes extremely angry;
\q2 there is no one [RHQ] who can survive when his anger is very hot.
\q1 When he is very angry, \add it is as though\add* his anger is like [SIM] a blazing fire,
\q2 and \add it is as though\add* mountains are shattered into pieces.
\b
\q1
\v 7 But he is good;
\q2 he protects us his people when we experience troubles.
\q1 He takes care of those who trust in him.
\q1
\v 8 But he will get rid of his enemies;
\q2 he will be to them like [MET] a flood that destroys everything.
\q1 He will chase his enemies
\q2 into the darkness \add of the place where the dead are\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 9 So, it is useless [RHQ] for you \add people of Nineveh\add* to plot against Yahweh.
\q2 He will not need to strike you two times to destroy you;
\q2 he will destroy you \add by striking you only once\add*.
\q1
\v 10 \add It will be as though his enemies\add* are tangled in thorns
\q2 and they will stagger like people who have drunk a lot of wine.
\q2 They will be burned up like [SIM] a fire completely burns up stubble/straw.
\b
\q1
\v 11 In Nineveh \add city\add* there was a man who advised people to do very wicked things against Yahweh.
\p
\v 12 But this is what Yahweh says about \add you Israeli people\add*:
\q1 “Although the people of Assyria have very many people and their army is very powerful,
\q2 they will be destroyed and will disappear.
\q1 \add I say to my people in Judah\add*,
\q2 I have already punished you,
\q2 but I will not punish you again.
\q1
\v 13 Now I will cause the \add people of Assyria\add* to no longer control/oppress you [MET];
\q2 \add it will be as though\add* I will tear off the shackles/chains on your \add hands and feet\add*.”
\b
\q1
\v 14 And this is what Yahweh also declares about you people of Nineveh:
\q2 “You will not have any descendants who will continue to have your family names.
\q1 And I will destroy all the statues of your gods
\q2 that were carved or formed in molds.
\q1 I will \add cause you to be killed and\add* sent to your graves,
\q2 because you are vile/despicable!”
\b
\q1
\v 15 \add You people of Judah\add*. Look! A messenger will be coming across the mountains,
\q2 and he [SYN] will be bringing good news you.
\q2 He will be declaring \add that you will now have\add* peace \add because Assyria will have been conquered\add*.
\q1 So, celebrate your festivals,
\q2 and do what you solemnly promised to do \add when your enemies were threatening to attack you\add*,
\q1 because your wicked \add enemies\add* will not invade your country again,
\q2 because they will be completely destroyed.
