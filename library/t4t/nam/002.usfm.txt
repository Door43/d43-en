\s1 Nineveh will be destroyed
\q1
\v 1 \add You people of\add* [APO] Nineveh,
\q2 your enemies are coming to attack you.
\q2 So place guards on the tops of the walls around the city!
\q2 Guard the roads \add into the city\add*!
\q2 Get ready to fight!
\q2 Gather your troops/soldiers [MTY] together!
\b
\q1
\v 2 Even though your soldiers have destroyed the descendants of [MTY] Jacob,
\q2 Yahweh will cause them to be honored again.
\q1 Invaders \add from your country\add* have ruined the grapevines in Israel,
\q2 but they will grow and produce grapes again.
\b
\q1
\v 3 The shields of \add the enemy soldiers who are coming to attack you\add* will shine red \add as the sun shines on them\add*,
\q2 and they will wear bright red uniforms.
\q1 The metal of their chariot \add wheels\add* will flash when they line up \add before the battle\add*,
\q2 and their soldiers will lift up their cypress/pine spear and wave them.
\q1
\v 4 Their chariots will dash through the streets \add of Nineveh\add*
\q2 and rush furiously through the plazas.
\q1 Going as quick as lightning,
\q2 they will resemble flaming torches.
\b
\q1
\v 5 \add Meanwhile\add*, your king will summon his officers
\q2 who will stumble as they try to come quickly.
\q1 They will dash to the \add city\add* wall,
\q2 holding their shields to protect themselves.
\q1
\v 6 But, the gates \add of the dams\add* on the rivers will be thrown open \add by enemy soldiers\add*,
\q2 and the flood will cause the palace to collapse.
\q1
\v 7 The queen will have her clothes stripped off her \add by enemy soldiers\add*,
\q2 and her slave girls will moan like doves
\q2 and beat their breasts \add to show that they are very sad\add*.
\q1
\v 8 \add The people will rush from\add* Nineveh
\q2 like [SIM] water rushes from a broken dam.
\q1 \add The officials\add* will shout, “Stop! Stop!”
\q2 but the people will not even look back \add as they run away\add*.
\q1
\v 9 \add The enemy attackers say to each other\add*, “Seize the silver!
\q2 Grab the gold!
\q1 There is a huge amount of very valuable things in the city,
\q2 more valuable things than anyone can count!”
\q1
\v 10 Soon \add everything valuable in\add* the city will be seized or ruined.
\q2 People will be trembling, with the result that they will not be able to fight.
\q2 Their faces will all become pale.
\b
\q1
\v 11 \add After that happens, people will say\add*,
\q1 “What happened to [RHQ] that \add great city of Nineveh\add*?
\q2 \add It was like\add* [MER] a den full of young lions,
\q1 where the male and female lions lived and fed the young ones.
\q1
\v 12 \add The soldiers in Nineveh were like\add* [MET] lions that killed or strangled \add other animals \add*
\q2 \add and brought the meat\add* to their dens.”
\b
\q1
\v 13 The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says \add to the people of Nineveh\add*,
\q1 “I am opposed to you;
\q2 I will cause your chariots to \add be burned in fires and\add* go up in smoke.
\q1 Your young men will be killed with swords.
\q2 \add Your soldiers\add* will never again conquer \add other nations\add*
\q2 and seize their valuable possessions.
\q1 Your messengers will never again take messages \add to other nations, demanding that their armies surrender to them\add*.”
