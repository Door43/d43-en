\v 1 This is \add King\add* Solomon's most beautiful song.
\b
\s1 The young woman speaks to her lover
\q1
\v 2 Kiss me \add on my lips\add*,
\q2 because your love \add for me\add* is more delightful than wine.
\q1
\v 3 The fragrance of the perfume on your \add skin\add* is very sweet/pleasing [CHI].
\q2 And your reputation is very good and spreads,
\q2 like [SIM] the fragrance of the special oil spread on your skin.
\q1 That is why the other young women are attracted to you.
\q1
\v 4 Take me quickly;
\q2 take me to your home.
\q1 \add It is as though\add* you are my king;
\q2 take me into your room.
\s1 Their friends speak to the man
\q1 We are very happy [DOU] about you;
\q2 we say that your love \add for each other\add* is better than wine.
\q2 It is not surprising that the other young women adore you.

\q1
\v 5 You women of Jerusalem,
\q2 I am dark but beautiful;
\q1 my dark skin is like [SIM] the tents in Kedar,
\q2 or like the beautiful curtains in Solomon's palace.
\q1
\v 6 But do not stare at me because of the sun having caused my skin to become dark;
\q1 my brothers were angry with me,
\q1 so they forced me to work \add out in the sunshine\add* in the vineyards,
\q2 so I was not able to take good care of my body/skin [CHI, MET].
\b
\q1
\v 7 You whom I [SYN] love, where will you take your flock of sheep today?
\q2 Where will you allow them to rest at noontime?
\q1 I want to know because it is not right [RHQ] for me to wander around like a prostitute
\q2 looking for you among the flocks that belong to your friends.
\s1 The man speaks
\q1
\v 8 You who are the most beautiful of all the women,
\q2 if you \add search for me and\add* do not know \add where I will take my sheep\add*,
\q1 follow the tracks/footprints of the sheep.
\q2 Then allow your young goats to ◄graze/eat grass► near the shepherds' tents.
\b
\q1
\v 9 You \add are beautiful\add*, my darling, like the young female horse
\q2 that pulls the chariot of the king of Egypt.
\q1
\v 10 Your cheeks are decorated with jewelry,
\q2 and there are strings of beads/pearls around your neck.
\q1
\v 11 We will make for you some gold earrings
\q2 that are decorated/inlaid with silver.
\s1 The woman speaks
\q1
\v 12 While the king was on his couch,
\q2 the smell of my perfume spread \add around the room\add*.
\q1
\v 13 The man who loves me stays between my breasts \add during the night\add* like [SIM] a ◄sachet/small cloth bag►.

\q1
\v 17 \add Branches of\add* cedar trees will shade us;
