\v 1 \add You who are dearer to me than\add* my sister, my bride,
\q2 I have come \add to cuddle up to you\add* [MET, EUP];

\q1 \add He said\add*, “\add You who are dearer to me than\add* my sister, my darling, my dear friend, my perfect one, my dove [MET],
\q2 open the door for me!

\q2 while I unlatched the bolt.

\q2 \add because they thought I must be a prostitute\add*;
\q2 those men who were guarding the city walls took my robe.
