\s1 The woman speaks
\q1
\v 1 I am like [MET] a flower/rose from the Sharon \add Plain\add*,
\q2 and like [MET] a lily \add that grows\add* in a valley.
\s1 The man speaks
\q1
\v 2 Among the other young women,
\q2 the one whom I love is like [MET] a lily \add growing\add* among thorns!
\s1 The woman speaks
\q1
\v 3 And among the other men, you, the man who loves me, are like [MET] an apple/fruit tree \add that grows\add* in the forest.
\q2 \add You are like a tree whose\add* shadow \add protects me from the sun\add*,
\q1 and your \add being close to me\add* [EUP] is like [MET] eating sweet fruit.
\q1
\v 4 You led me to the ◄banquet room/room where we could make love►,
\q2 and it is evident that you love me very much.
\q1
\v 5 Refresh me and strengthen me \add with your lovemaking\add*
\q2 \add like I am refreshed by eating\add* [MET, EUP] raisins and other fruit,
\q2 because I very much desire that you love me even more.
\q1
\v 6 Put your left arm under my head
\q2 and with your right arm hold me close.
\b
\q1
\v 7 You young women of Jerusalem,
\q2 solemnly promise me, while the does and gazelles \add are listening\add*, that you will not
\q1 disturb us while we are making love
\q2 until we are ready to quit.
\b
\q1
\v 8 I hear the voice of the man who loves me.
\q2 \add It is as though\add* [MET] he is leaping over the mountains
\q1 and skipping over the hills
\q1
\v 9 like [SIM] a deer or a gazelle.
\q2 Now he is standing outside the wall of our house,
\q1 looking in the window,
\q2 and peering through the ◄lattice/wooden strips inside the window frame►.
\q1
\v 10 He spoke to me and said,
\q2 “You whom I love, get up;
\q2 my beautiful one, come with me [CHI]!
\q1
\v 11 Look, the ◄winter/cold season► is ended;
\q2 the rain has stopped;
\q1
\v 12 flowers are blooming throughout the country/land.
\q2 It is now time to sing;
\q1 we hear the doves cooing.
\q1
\v 13 There are young/new figs on the fig trees,
\q2 and there are blossoms on the grapevines
\q1 and their fragrance fills the air.
\q2 You whom I love, get up;
\q2 my beautiful one, come with me!
\b
\q1
\v 14 You are like [MET] a dove that is hiding \add far from me\add* in an opening/crack in the rocky cliff.
\q1 Show me your face,
\q2 and allow me to hear your voice,
\q2 because your voice is sweet-sounding
\q1 and your face is lovely [CHI].”
\s1 The woman continues to speak
\q1
\v 15 \add There are other men who are like\add* [MET] little jackals/foxes that ruin vineyards;
\q2 do not allow \add those men to attack me\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 16 You who love me, I belong to you and you belong to me,
\q2 and you \add have pleasure when you kiss\add* my lips
\q2 like [MET] a shepherd enjoys taking care of his sheep.
\q1
\v 17 You who love me, come and be like [SIM] a gazelle or like a young deer on the hills of Bether,
\q2 and then flee like a deer at dawn \add tomorrow morning\add*,
\q1 when the darkness disappears.
