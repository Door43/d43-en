\c 8
\s1 The woman speaks
\q1
\v 1 I wish that you were my brother
\q2 who ◄nursed at/drank milk from► my mother's breasts \add when you were a baby\add*,
\q1 because, if you were my brother, if I saw you when you were outside the house,
\q2 I could kiss you,
\q2 and no one would say that my doing that was wrong.
\q1
\v 2 \add No one would object if\add* I led you to my mother's house,
\q2 to where my mother, who taught me \add many things\add*, lives.
\q1 I would like to take you to my mother's house because I would \add like to make love to you\add* [EUP],
\q1 \add and that would be as delightful as\add* [MET] juice \add squeezed\add* from pomegranates.
\q1
\v 3 You would put your left arm under my head
\q2 and with your right arm hold me close.
\b
\q1
\v 4 \add I would say to\add* you women of Jerusalem,
\q2 “Solemnly promise me
\q1 that you will not disturb us while we are making love
\q2 until we are ready to quit.”
\b
\s1 Their friends speak
\q1
\v 5 Who is that \add woman\add* who is coming up from the desert,
\q2 ◄leaning on/clinging close to► the man who loves her?
\s1 The woman speaks
\q1 I woke you up \add when you were\add* under the apple tree
\q2 at the place where your mother conceived you,
\q2 which is the same place where she gave birth to you.
\q1
\v 6 \add Keep me close to you\add*,
\q2 like [SIM] a seal on your heart,
\q1 or like [SIM] a bracelet on your arm.
\q1 Our love \add for each other\add* is as powerful as death,
\q2 it is as strong as the grave.
\q1 \add It is as though\add* our love \add for each other\add* bursts into flames
\q2 and burns like a hot fire.
\q1
\v 7 Nothing can extinguish our love \add for each other\add*,
\q2 not even a flood.
\q1 If a man tried to cause a woman to love him by saying he would give her everything that is in his house,
\q2 she would refuse.
\s1 Their friends speak
\q1
\v 8 We have a younger sister,
\q2 and her breasts are not large yet.
\q1 So this is [RHQ] what we should do for her on the day that we promise \add some young man\add* that he can marry her:
\q1
\v 9 If \add her chest is flat like\add* [MET] a wall,
\q2 we will \add decorate it by\add* putting silver \add jewels that are like\add* [MET] towers on it.
\q1 Or, if she is \add flat like\add* [MET] a door,
\q2 we will decorate her with bits/pieces of cedar wood.
\s1 The woman speaks
\q1
\v 10 My \add chest was previously flat like\add* [MET] a wall,
\q2 but now my breasts are \add big\add* like [SIM] towers.
\q1 So the one who loves me is delighted with me.
\b
\q1
\v 11 \add King\add* Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-Hamon,
\q1 and he rented it to people for them to take care of it.
\q2 He required each one to pay him 1,000 pieces of silver \add each year\add* for the grapes \add that they harvested\add*.
\q1
\v 12 But \add my body is like\add* [MET] my own vineyard,
\q2 and Solomon, I am giving it to you.
\q1 \add You do not need to pay me\add* a thousand pieces of silver \add to enjoy my body\add*,
\q2 but I will give 200 pieces of silver to those who take care of me [MET].
\s1 The man speaks to the woman
\q1
\v 13 You are staying in the gardens
\q2 and my friends are listening to your voice;
\q2 so allow me to hear it, too!
\s1 The woman speaks
\q1
\v 14 You who love me, come to me quickly;
\q2 run to me [MET, EUP] as fast as [SIM] a gazelle or young deer;
\q1 I am \add as delightful as\add* [MET] hills of spices.
