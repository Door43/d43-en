\q1
\v 1 During the entire night \add while I lay\add* on my bed,
\q2 I longed for the one whom I loved.
\q1 I desired for him \add to come\add*,
\q2 but he did not come.
\q1
\v 2 \add So I said to myself\add*,
\q1 “I will get up now and walk around the city,
\q2 through the streets and plazas,
\q2 to search for the one whom I love.”
\q1 So I \add got up and\add* searched for him,
\q2 but I could not find him.
\q1
\v 3 The city watchmen saw me
\q2 while they were patrolling/walking around the city.
\q1 \add I asked them\add*,
\q2 “Have you seen the one whom I love?”
\q1
\v 4 As soon as I walked past them,
\q2 I found the one whom I love.
\q1 I clung to him and would not let him go
\q2 until I had brought him to my mother's house,
\q2 to the room where my mother had conceived me (OR, where I was born).
\q1
\v 5 You women of Jerusalem,
\q2 solemnly promise me, while the does and gazelles \add are listening\add*, that you will not
\q1 disturb us while we are making love
\q2 until we are ready to quit.
\b
\s1 One of their friends speaks
\q1
\v 6 Who is it that is coming from the desert,
\q2 who is \add stirring up dust\add* like a column of smoke
\q1 from burning myrrh and incense
\q2 \add made from\add* spices \add imported by\add* merchants?
\q1
\v 7 It is \add ◄someone/Solomon's bride►\add*, \add sitting in\add* Solomon's ◄palanquin/portable chair►
\q2 surrounded by sixty bodyguards
\q2 chosen from the strongest/greatest warriors in Israel.
\q1
\v 8 They all have swords
\q2 and they all ◄are trained to/know well how to► use them.
\q1 Each one has his sword \add strapped to\add* his side
\q2 and is prepared ◄for dangers that occur/to \add defend Solomon\add* against anyone who would attack him► during the night.
\q1
\v 9 King Solomon \add commanded his servants\add* to make that ◄palanquin/portable chair► for him;
\q2 \add it was made\add* with wood from Lebanon.
\q1
\v 10 The \add canopy that covered it\add* was ◄held up/supported► by posts made of silver,
\q2 and the back of the palanquin was \add embroidered\add* with gold.
\q1 The seat/cushion was covered with purple cloth
\q2 lovingly made/woven by the women of Jerusalem.
\q1
\v 11 You women of Jerusalem,
\q2 come and look at King Solomon
\q1 wearing the headdress that his mother put on his head
\q2 on the day when he was married,
\q1 the day when he [SYN] was very happy.
