\v 1 \add I am\add* Zephaniah, the son of Cushi, the grandson of Gedaliah, and the great-grandson of Amariah, whose father was \add King\add* Hezekiah. Yahweh gave this message to me during the time when \add King\add* Amon's son Josiah was the king of Judah.
\s1 The future destruction
\q1
\v 2 Yahweh says,
\q2 “I will ◄sweep away/destroy► everything [HYP] that is on the earth.
\q1
\v 3 I will sweep away people and animals.
\q2 I will sweep away birds and fish.
\q1 I will get rid of wicked people;
\q2 there will be no more \add wicked\add* [HYP] people on the earth.”
\b
\s1 Yahweh will punish Judah
\q1
\v 4 “\add These are some of the things that I will do\add*:
\q2 I will punish the people who live in Jerusalem and \add other places in\add* Judah.
\q2 I will destroy everything that has been used in the worship of Baal.
\q1 I will cause people to no longer remember the names of the pagan priests
\q2 or the other priests \add who have turned away from me.\add*
\q1
\v 5 \add I will get rid of\add* those who go up on the roofs \add of their houses\add* and worship the sun and moon and stars,
\q2 those who claim that they worship me but also worship \add their god\add* Molech.
\q1
\v 6 I will get rid of all those who previously worshiped me but no longer do,
\q2 those who no longer seek my help or request me to tell them what they should do.”
\b
\q1
\v 7 Be silent in front of Yahweh the Lord,
\q2 because it will soon be the time/day when Yahweh will judge \add and punish\add* people.
\q1 Yahweh has prepared to get rid of \add the people of Judah\add*;
\q2 they will be like [MET] animals that are slaughtered for sacrifices,
\q2 and he has chosen \add their enemies\add* to be the ones who will get rid of them.
\q1
\v 8 Yahweh says, “On that day when I will get rid of \add the people of Judah\add*,
\q2 I will punish their officials and the king's sons,
\q2 and I will punish all those who worship foreign gods [MTY].
\q1
\v 9 I will punish those who \add show that they revere their god Dagan\add* by avoiding stepping on the threshold \add of his temple of\add*,
\q2 and those who do violent things and tell lies in the temples of their gods.”
\b
\q1
\v 10 Yahweh \add also\add* says,
\q2 “On that day, people will cry out at the Fish Gate \add of Jerusalem\add*.
\q1 People will wail in the newer part of the city,
\q2 and \add people will hear\add* a loud crash \add of buildings collapsing\add* in the hills.
\q1
\v 11 So, all you people who live in the market area \add of Jerusalem\add* should wail,
\q2 because all those who sell goods and weigh out silver will be slaughtered.
\q1
\v 12 \add It will be as though\add* I will light lanterns to search in \add dark places in\add* Jerusalem
\q2 for those who have become very satisfied with their behavior and complacent \add about their sins\add*.
\q1 They think that I, Yahweh, will do nothing to them,
\q2 neither good things nor bad things.
\q1
\v 13 \add But I say that\add* their valuable possessions will be plundered/stolen \add by their enemies\add*,
\q2 and their houses will be destroyed.
\q1 They will build new homes,
\q2 but they will not live in them;
\q1 they will plant vineyards,
\q2 but they will never drink any wine \add made from grapes that grow\add*.”
\s1 The day of punishment
\q1
\v 14 It will soon be the day/time when Yahweh \add will punish people\add*.
\q2 It will be here quickly.
\q1 It will be a time \add when people cry\add* bitterly,
\q2 a time when \add even\add* brave soldiers will cry loudly.
\q1
\v 15 It will be a time when \add God shows that he is\add* very angry,
\q2 a time when people experience much distress/suffering and trouble.
\q1 It will be a time \add when many things are\add* ruined and destroyed [DOU].
\q2 It will be a time when it is very gloomy and dark [DOU],
\q2 when the clouds are very black.
\q1
\v 16 It will be a time when \add soldiers\add* will blow trumpets \add to call other soldiers to battle\add*.
\q2 \add Your enemies\add* will tear down the walls around your cities
\q2 and the high towers \add at the corners of those walls\add*.
\q1
\v 17 Because you sinned against Yahweh,
\q2 he will cause you to experience great distress;
\q2 you will walk around groping like [SIM] blind people do.
\q1 Your blood will flow \add from your bodies\add* like [SIM] water,
\q2 and your corpses will lie on the ground and rot [SIM].
\q1
\v 18 At the time that \add Yahweh shows that\add* he is very angry with you,
\q2 you will not be able to save yourselves
\q2 by \add giving\add* silver or gold \add to your enemies\add*.
\q1 Because Yahweh ◄is very jealous/does not want people to worship any other god►,
\q2 he will send a fire to burn up the entire world,
\q1 and he will suddenly get rid of all the \add wicked\add* people who live on the earth.
