\s1 A call to repentance
\q1
\v 1 You people \add of Judah who ought to be\add* ashamed,
\q2 gather together [DOU].
\q1
\v 2 Yahweh is extremely angry with you,
\q2 \add so gather together now\add*,
\q1 before it is time for him to punish [MTY] you
\q2 and sweep you away like [SIM] \add the wind blows away\add* the chaff.
\q1
\v 3 All you people in Judah who are humble,
\q2 worship Yahweh, and obey what he has commanded.
\q1 Try to do what is right
\q2 and to be humble.
\q1 If you do that, perhaps Yahweh will protect/spare you
\q2 on the day when he punishes [MTY] people.
\s1 Yahweh will punish Philistia
\q1
\v 4 \add When Yahweh punishes Philistia\add*,
\q2 Gaza and Ashkelon \add cities\add* will be deserted/abandoned.
\q1 Ashdod \add city\add* will be attacked and the people expelled at noon \add when people are resting\add*;
\q2 the people of Ekron \add city\add* will also be driven out.
\q1
\v 5 And terrible things will happen to you people of Philistia who live near the sea,
\q2 because Yahweh has decided [MTY] that he will punish [MTY] you, also.
\q1 He will get rid of all of you;
\q2 not one person will ◄survive/remain alive►.
\q1
\v 6 The land of Philistia near the sea will become a pasture,
\q2 a place for shepherds and their sheep pens.
\q1
\v 7 The people of Judah who ◄survive/are still alive► will possess that land.

\p
\v 8 The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, the God of us Israeli people, says this:
\q1 “I have heard the people of Moab and Ammon
\q1 when they insulted [DOU] my people
\q2 and when they said that they would conquer my people's country.
\q1
\v 9 So now, as surely as I live, \add I will destroy\add* Moab and Ammon
\q2 like [SIM] \add I destroyed\add* Gomorrah \add city\add*.
\q1 Their land will be a place were there are nettles and salt pits;
\q2 it will be ruined forever.
\q1 My people who survive will take away all their valuable possessions
\q2 and also occupy their land.”
\b
\q1
\v 10 The people of Moab and Ammon will get what the deserve for being proud,
\q2 because they made fun of the people who belong to the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels.
\q1
\v 11 Yahweh will cause them to be terrified

\q1 He will cause its capital Nineveh to become ruined and deserted,
\q2 a place that will be as dry as the desert.
\q1
\v 14 Flocks \add of sheep\add* and herds \add of cattle\add* and many kinds of wild animals will lie down there.
\q2 Owls and crows will sit on the columns/pillars \add of the destroyed buildings\add*,
\q1 and they will ◄hoot/cry out► through the windows.
\q1 There will be rubble in the doorways,
\q2 and the \add valuable\add* cedar boards will be taken \add from the ruined houses\add*.
\q1
\v 15 The people of Nineveh were previously happy and proud,
\q2 thinking that they were very safe.
\q1 They were \add always\add* saying,
\q1 “Our city is the greatest city;
\q2 there is no city as great as ours!”
\q1 But now it will become a ruins,
\q2 a place where wild animals make their dens.
\q1 And everyone who passes by there will hiss and scorn/ridicule that city,
\q2 and shake their fists \add to show that they detest that city very much\add*.
