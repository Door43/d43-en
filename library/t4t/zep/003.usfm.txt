\c 3
\s1 Yahweh will some day restore Jerusalem, whose people have rebelled against him
\q1
\v 1 Terrible things will happen \add to Jerusalem\add*,
\q2 that city whose people have rebelled \add against Yahweh\add*
\q1 and who have become unacceptable to him \add because of the sins that they have committed\add*.
\q2 They act violently \add toward others\add* and they ◄oppress/treat cruelly► other people.
\q1
\v 2 \add The people there\add* do not pay attention to people who tell them \add the wrong things that they are doing\add*
\q2 and try to ◄correct them/cause them to quit doing those things►.
\q1 The \add people in Jerusalem\add* do not trust in Yahweh
\q2 or ◄draw near to/ask help from► their God.
\q1
\v 3 Their leaders are like [MET] roaring lions;
\q2 they are like [MET] wolves that \add attack other animals\add* during the evening,
\q2 and \add eat everything that they kill\add*,
\q2 with the result that the next morning there is nothing left \add of those animals to eat\add*.
\q1
\v 4 The prophets in Jerusalem are proud,
\q2 and they give messages that are not to be trusted.
\q1 Their priests cause the temple to be unholy
\q2 by doing things that are opposed to the laws \add of Moses\add*.
\q1
\v 5 But Yahweh is also in the city;
\q2 and he never does what is wrong.
\q1 He treats people justly/fairly;
\q2 he does that every day,
\q2 but wicked people are never ashamed \add about their doing what is wrong\add*.
\p
\v 6 \add Yahweh says this\add*:
\q1 “I have destroyed many nations;
\q2 I have destroyed their strong/high city walls and towers.
\q1 Now I have caused the streets in those cities to be completely deserted [DOU];
\q2 the cities are ruined.
\q1 There are no people \add still alive\add* in the cities;
\q2 they are all dead [LIT].
\q1
\v 7 So I said \add to myself\add*,
\q2 ‘\add Because of what I have done to those other nations\add*,
\q2 surely the people \add of Jerusalem\add* will revere me now,
\q2 and they will accept ◄my correcting them/my telling them to quit doing what is wrong►.
\q1 If they do that, I will not destroy their houses;
\q2 I will not punish them like I said that I would do.’
\q1 But \add in spite of knowing how I punished those other nations\add*,
\q2 they were still eager to get up early each morning
\q2 and continue to perform evil deeds.
\q1
\v 8 Therefore I, Yahweh, say,
\q2 ‘Wait for the day in which I will testify \add in court about your evil deeds\add*.’
\q1 I have decided to gather the people of the kingdoms \add of the earth\add* [DOU]
\q2 and cause them to know that I am very angry with them.
\q1 All over the earth I will punish and destroy people;
\q2 my being angry with them because I ◄am jealous/want people to worship no other god► is like [MET] a ◄raging/very hot► fire.
\b
\q1
\v 9 When that happens, I will cause all people [MTY] to be changed
\q2 and enable them to speak \add only\add* what is ◄pure/pleasing to me►,
\q2 in order that everyone can worship me [MTY]
\q2 and unitedly/together serve me [MTY].
\q1
\v 10 Then my people who \add were forced to go to other countries \add*, those who live along the upper part of the \add Nile River in\add* Ethiopia
\q2 will come to me and bring offerings to me.
\q1
\v 11 At that time, you \add people in Jerusalem\add* will no longer be ashamed \add about what has happened to you\add*,
\q2 because you no longer will be rebelling against me.
\q1 I will get rid of all the people among you who are very proud [DOU].
\q2 No one on \add Zion\add*, my holy hill, will strut around proudly.
\q1
\v 12 Those who are still alive in Israel will be poor and humble;
\q2 they will be people who trust in me [MTY].
\q1
\v 13 Those people who are still alive there in Israel will not do things that are wrong;
\q2 they will not tell lies or deceive [MTY] people.
\q1 They will eat and sleep safely/well,
\q2 because no one will cause them to be afraid.”
\b
\q1
\v 14 You people who live in Jerusalem [DOU] and \add other places in\add* Israel,
\q2 sing and shout loudly!
\q1 Be glad, and rejoice [DOU] with all your inner beings,
\q1
\v 15 because Yahweh will stop punishing [MTY] you,
\q2 and he will send away from you \add the armies of\add* your enemies!
\q1 And Yahweh himself, the king of us Israeli people, will live among us,
\q2 and never again will we be afraid that others will harm us.
\q1
\v 16 At that time, other people will say to us people of Jerusalem,
\q2 “You \add people of\add* [APO] Jerusalem, do not be afraid;
\q2 do not become weak/afraid or discouraged,
\q1
\v 17 because Yahweh your God is living among you.
\q2 He is mighty, and he will rescue/save you.
\q1 He will be very happy about you;
\q2 because he loves you, he will cause you to not be afraid;
\q2 he will sing loudly to rejoice about you.”
\b
\q1
\v 18 \add Yahweh says\add*, “You people were sad and ashamed
\q2 because \add you were unable to attend\add* your religious festivals;
\q2 but I will cause you to no longer be disgraced.
\q1
\v 19 Truly, I will severely \add punish\add* all those who ◄oppressed you/caused you to suffer►.
\q2 I will rescue those who are helpless
\q1 and those who were forced to go to other countries.
\q2 I will enable them to be praised and honored in every country to which they were ◄exiled/forced to go►,
\q2 places where they were disgraced.
\q1
\v 20 At that time, I will gather you together
\q2 and bring you back home \add to Israel\add*.
\q1 I will cause you to ◄have a good reputation/be honored► and be greatly praised
\q2 among all the nations of the earth.
\q1 You [MTY] will see my causing you to prosper again.
\q2 \add That will surely happen because I\add*, Yahweh, have said it.”
