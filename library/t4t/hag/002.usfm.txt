\s1 The new temple
\p
\v 1 On October 17 \add of that year\add*, Yahweh gave the prophet Haggai \add another\add* message.
\v 2 The message was that he should say this to Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and to the other people who were still alive \add in Jerusalem\add*:
\v 3 “Do any of you remember how glorious our former temple was? \add If you do\add*, what does it look like to you now? It must seem like nothing at all.
\v 4 But now the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says to \add all of you\add*, to Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of you people who live in this nation, ‘\add Do not be discouraged\add*; be strong [DOU], and work \add to build this new temple\add*, because I will ◄be with/help► you.
\v 5 My Spirit remains among you, like I promised your \add ancestors\add* when they left Egypt. So do not be afraid!’~”
\p
\v 6 This is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says: “Soon I will shake again the sky and the earth, the oceans and the earth.
\v 7 I will shake again the people of all the nations, and as a result they will bring their treasures to this temple. I will fill this temple with my glory.
\v 8 The silver and the gold \add that they own\add* is really mine, \add so they will bring it to me\add*.
\v 9 Then this temple will be more glorious than the former/previous temple was. And I will cause things to go well for you all. \add That will surely happen because\add* I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, have said it.”
\s1 What they do now will be acceptable to Yahweh
\p
\v 10 On December 18 of that year, Yahweh gave \add another\add* message to the prophet Haggai.
\v 11 This is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels said to him: “Ask the priests \add this question\add* about what is written in the laws \add of Moses about sacrifices\add*:
\v 12 ‘If one of you \add priests takes from the altar\add* some meat that was sacrificed and is carrying it in his robes, if his robe touches some bread or stew or wine or \add olive\add* oil or some other food, does that food also become ◄holy/acceptable for a sacrifice►?’~”
\p \add When he said that to\add* the priests, they replied, “No.”
\p
\v 13 Then Haggai asked them, “If someone becomes unacceptable to God by touching a corpse, and then he touches any of those foods, will the food also become unacceptable to God?”
\p The priests replied, “Yes.”
\p
\v 14 Then Haggai replied, “Yahweh says this: ‘It is the same with you people and with this nation. Everything that you do and \add all the sacrifices\add* that you all offer are unacceptable to me \add because of the sins that you have committed\add*.
\p
\v 15 Think about what has been happening to you before you began to lay the foundation of my temple.
\v 16 When you expected \add to harvest\add* twenty bushels of grain, \add you harvested\add* only ten bushels. When someone went to a big wine vat to get fifty gallons of wine, there were only twenty gallons in the vat.
\v 17 I sent ◄blight/hot winds► and mildew and hail to destroy all your crops. But still you did not return to me.
\p
\v 18 Starting from this day, December 18, the day when you have laid the foundation of my new temple, continue to think carefully about your situation.
\v 19 Is there now [RHQ] any grain seed left in your barns? No, \add because you have eaten the small amount that you harvested\add*. And there is no fruit on your grapevines and fig trees and pomegranate trees and olive trees.
\p But, from now on, I will bless you!’~”
\s1 Yahweh's promise to Zerubbabel
\p
\v 20 On that same day, Yahweh gave another message to Haggai.
\v 21 He said, “Tell Zerubbabel the governor of Judah that I am going to shake the sky and the earth.
\v 22 I will end the power of the kings of many nations [DOU]. I will cause their chariots and their drivers, their horses and \add the soldiers\add* who are riding on them to be destroyed. \add What will happen is that I will cause the soldiers\add* to kill each other with their swords.
\p
\v 23 Zerubbabel, you serve \add me well\add*. So I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, declare that \add like kings wear\add* signet rings \add to show that they have authority to rule people\add*, I will appoint you and cause you \add to have authority to rule\add*. I will do that because I have chosen you. \add That will surely happen because\add* I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, have said it.”
