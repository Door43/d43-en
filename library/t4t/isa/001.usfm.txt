\v 1 I am Isaiah, the son of Amoz. \add Yahweh showed me\add* visions about Jerusalem and \add all the other places in\add* Judah. He showed me these visions during the years that Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah were kings of Judah.
\s1 A message about the rebellious nation of Judah
\p
\v 2 This is what Yahweh says:
\q1 “All you \add angels in\add* [APO] heaven and \add all you people on\add* [APO] earth, listen to me!
\q2 The people that I caused to exist and took care of [DOU]
\q2 have rebelled against me.
\q1
\v 3 Oxen know their owners,
\q2 and donkeys know who provides food for them,
\q1 but my Israeli people do not know \add me\add*;
\q2 they do not realize \add that I am the one who takes care of them\add*.”
\b
\q1
\v 4 Terrible things will happen to that sinful nation,
\q2 to those people who are guilty of much sin.
\q1 They are a group of very evil people,
\q2 who act very unjustly.
\q1 They have abandoned Yahweh,
\q2 the holy one of Israel;
\q2 they have ◄abandoned/turned away from► him.
\b
\q1
\v 5 Why do you [RHQ] continue to \add do things for which\add* you should be punished?
\q2 Why do you continue to rebel against Yahweh?
\q1 \add You are like\add* [MET] someone whose head is badly injured
\q2 and whose mind is sick/corrupt.
\q1
\v 6 \add It is as though\add* [MET] from the soles/bottoms of your feet to the \add top of your\add* head
\q2 nothing is healthy;
\q1 there are only open wounds and cuts and sores
\q2 that have not been cleaned or bandaged,
\q1 and no \add olive\add* oil has been put on them \add to lessen the pain\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 7 \add It is as though\add* your country is ruined/desolate;
\q2 our towns have been burned.
\q1 Foreigners plunder/steal the crops in your fields while you watch;
\q2 they destroy everything \add that they see\add*.
\q1
\v 8 The city of Jerusalem has already been abandoned,
\q2 it is like [SIM] a shelter in a vineyard that has been abandoned by the watchmen;
\q1 it is like [SIM] a watchman's hut in a field of melons that has been deserted.
\q2 It is a city surrounded by its enemies who are waiting to attack it.
\q1
\v 9 If the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels had not allowed a few of us his people to ◄survive/remain alive►,
\q2 we would have all been \add destroyed\add*,
\q2 like \add the cities of\add* Sodom and Gomorrah \add were destroyed\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 10 You \add leaders of Judah are as wicked as\add* the rulers of Sodom were,
\q2 and you \add other people in Jerusalem areas are as wicked as\add* the people in Gomorrah were.
\q1 Listen to this message from Yahweh, \add all of you\add*!
\q1
\v 11 He says, “You continue to bring many sacrifices to me,
\q2 but I do not [RHQ] want them \add because you do not worship me sincerely\add*!
\q1 You bring me many offerings to be completely burned \add on the altar\add*,
\q1 but I ◄am tired/do not want anymore► of your burning all those offerings,
\q2 burning rams and the fat from fat cattle.
\q1 I am not pleased with the blood of bulls and lambs and goats
\q2 that \add the priest\add* pours \add against the altar\add*.
\q1
\v 12 When you come to my temple to worship me,
\q2 no one [RHQ] told you to trample on my courtyard while you perform all those rituals.
\q1
\v 13 Stop bringing to me those offerings, because they are useless \add to me\add*;
\q2 I am disgusted with the incense that \add the priests burn\add*!
\q1 And \add your feasts to celebrate\add* the new moon \add each month\add* and your ◄Sabbath days/days of rest► and your other festivals—
\q2 I detest them because of the wicked things \add that you do\add*!
\q1
\v 14 I [SYN] hate all your celebrations of the new moon and the other festivals that you celebrate each year.
\q2 They are like [MET] a heavy burden that I am tired of carrying.
\q1
\v 15 So, when you lift up your hands when you pray to me,
\q2 I will not even look at you.
\q1 Even if you pray to me very frequently,
\q1 I will not listen to you,
\q2 because \add it is as though\add* your hands are covered with the blood \add of people whom you have killed\add*.
\q2
\v 16 Wash your inner beings, and become \add spiritually\add* clean!
\q1 Get rid of your evil behavior!
\q2 Stop doing things that are wrong!
\q1
\v 17 Learn to do \add deeds that are\add* good.
\q2 Try to cause people to do what is just.
\q1 Help people who are ◄oppressed/treated cruelly►.
\q2 Defend orphans and widows \add when people take them to court\add*.”
\b
\q1
\v 18 Yahweh says, “You need to think about the results of what you do.
\q2 Even though \add the guilt of\add* your sins be \add as evident and as difficult to get rid of\add* as [SIM] red stains \add on a white garment\add* [DOU],
\q1 \add I will get rid of them completely\add*
\q2 \add like someone who can make that stained garment\add* become as white as snow or wool [DOU].
\q1
\v 19 If you are willing to obey me,
\q2 \add I will enable you\add* to have plenty to eat.
\q1
\v 20 But, if you turn away from me and rebel against me,
\q2 you will be killed by your enemies' swords.
\q1 \add That will surely happen, because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it.”
\s1 Yahweh condemned Jerusalem
\q1
\v 21 \add You people of Jerusalem previously\add* faithfully \add worshiped only\add* me,
\q2 but now you have become like [MET] prostitutes \add who are not faithful to any husband\add*.
\q1 Previously, people there always acted justly/fairly and righteously,
\q2 but now your city \add is full of\add* murderers.
\q1
\v 22 Previously, you were like [MET] pure silver,
\q2 but now you have become like [MET] the scum that is left \add when the silver is purified\add*.
\q1 Previously you were like pure wine,
\q2 but you have become like [MET] wine that has a lot of water mixed with it.
\q1
\v 23 Your leaders are rebels;
\q2 they spend time with thieves.
\q1 They all want to get bribes
\q2 and force others to give them gifts \add in order that they do good things for them\add*.
\q1 They do not defend orphans \add in court\add*,
\q2 and they do not do all they can to enable widows to get what they should receive.
\q1
\v 24 Therefore I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, the mighty God of Israel, say to my enemies,
\q1 “I will get revenge on you;
\q2 you will not cause me any more trouble.
\q2 And I will pay you back for the evil things that you did.
\q1
\v 25 I will raise my fist to strike you.
\q2 I will \add punish you severely\add* [MET],
\q2 as though [MET] you were silver \add and I needed to heat you very greatly to\add* melt you and get rid of the impurities.
\q1
\v 26 \add After that happens\add*, I will give you good judges like you had previously;
\q2 you will have \add wise\add* counselors like you had long ago.
\q1 Then people will call your city ‘a city where people \add act\add* righteously,’
\q2 a city where people are loyal to me.”
\b
\q1
\v 27 Because the people of Jerusalem will do what is fair/just,
\q2 their city will be restored;
\q1 those who repent \add will be saved\add*
\q2 \add because of their acting\add* righteously.
\q1
\v 28 But rebels and sinners will be crushed by Yahweh,
\q2 and those who forsake him will disappear.
\b
\q1
\v 29 You will be ashamed because \add you worshiped\add* idols under the oak trees \add that you considered to be\add* sacred;
\q2 you will be disgraced because \add you worshiped idols\add* in the gardens where you chose \add to worship them\add*.
\q1
\v 30 You will be like [SIM] a very large tree which has withered leaves,
\q2 like [SIM] a garden that \add is dried up because\add* it has no water.
\q1
\v 31 Those among you who are very strong will become like [MET] dry wood,
\q2 and the work they do will be like [MET] a spark;
\q1 both they and the evil things that they do will burn up completely,
\q2 and no one will be able to put out the fire.
