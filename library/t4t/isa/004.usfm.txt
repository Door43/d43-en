\q1
\v 1 When that happens, \add there will be very few unmarried men\add*.
\q2 \add As a result\add*, seven \add unmarried\add* women will grab one man, and say,
\q1 “Allow us all to marry you [IDI]!
\q2 We will provide our own food and clothing.
\q1 All that we want is to no longer be disgraced \add because of not being married\add*.”
\s1 A promise that some day Jerusalem will be restored
\q1
\v 2 But some day, Israel [MTY] will be very beautiful and great/glorious.
\q2 The people of Israel who will still be there will be very proud of the wonderful fruit that grows in their land.
\q1
\v 3 All the people who will remain in Jerusalem, who were not killed when Jerusalem was destroyed,
\q2 whose names are listed among those who live there, will be \add called\add* holy.
\q1
\v 4 \add That will happen when\add* Yahweh washes away the guilt of the women of Jerusalem,
\q2 and when he stops the violence [MET] \add on the streets of Jerusalem\add* by punishing \add the people of Jerusalem\add*.
\q2 When he does that, it will be like a fire to burn up all the impure things.
\q1
\v 5 Then Yahweh will send a cloud of smoke during the days and a flaming fire during the nights
\q2 to cover Jerusalem and all those who gather there;
\q2 it will be like a glorious canopy over the city
\q1
\v 6 that will shelter the people from the sun during the daytime
\q2 and protect them when there are windstorms and rain.
