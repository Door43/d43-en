\c 50
\s1 Yahweh's power
\p
\v 1 This is also what Yahweh says:
\q1 “You \add Israeli children\add*, do not think [RHQ] that I \add forced your parents to be exiled/taken to Babylonia\add* [MET]
\q2 like some men send away their wives
\q1 after giving them a paper
\q2 on which they state that they were divorcing them!
\q1 I certainly did not [RHQ] get rid of you like a man who sells his children to get money to pay what he owes.
\q1 No, the reason that I forced you to be exiled
\q2 \add was to punish you\add* because of the sins that you have committed [DOU].
\q1
\v 2 When I came to you \add to rescue you\add*,
\q2 why did no one answer when I called out to you [RHQ]?
\q1 Was there no one there [RHQ]?
\q2 Or, did you think that I do not have the power [MTY] to rescue you [DOU]?
\q1 Think about this:
\q2 I can speak to a sea and cause it to become dry!
\q1 I can cause rivers to become deserts
\q2 with the result that the fish in the rivers die from thirst and rot.
\q1
\v 3 I cause the sky to become dark,
\q2 as though [MET] it was wearing black clothes because it was mourning \add because someone had died\add*.”
\b
\q1
\v 4 Yahweh our God has given me his wise message [MTY]
\q2 in order that I may encourage those who are weary.
\q1 Each morning he awakens me,
\q2 in order that I [SYN] may listen to what he teaches [SIM] me.
\q1
\v 5 Yahweh our God has spoken to me [IDI],
\q2 and I have not rejected what he told me;
\q2 I have accepted [LIT] it.
\q1
\v 6 I allowed people to beat me on my back
\q2 and to pull out the whiskers in my beard \add because they hated me\add*.
\q1 I did not turn away [MTY] from them
\q2 when they made fun of me and spat on me.
\q1
\v 7 But, because the Lord our God helps me,
\q2 I will never be humiliated.
\q1 Therefore, I am strongly determined [IDI] to face/endure difficulties,
\q2 and I know that nothing will cause me to be ashamed.
\q1
\v 8 God, the one who vindicates me, is near to me;
\q2 so if anyone [RHQ] stands in front of me and accuses me in a court,
\q2 he will not be able \add to show that I have done anything that is wrong\add*.
\q1
\v 9 The Lord our God defends me \add in court\add*,
\q2 so no one [RHQ] will be able to ◄condemn me/declare that I am guilty►.
\q1 All those who accuse me will disappear
\q2 like [SIM] old clothes that have been eaten by ◄\add larvae of\add* moths/cockroaches►.
\b
\q1
\v 10 If you revere Yahweh
\q2 and do what his servant tells you to do,
\q1 even if you are ◄walking in darkness/enduring suffering►, and it seems that [MET] there is no light,
\q2 trust in Yahweh your God [DOU] \add to help you\add*.
\q1
\v 11 But you people who \add oppose me\add*,
\q2 \add who would like to throw\add* me into a blazing fire,
\q1 walk in your own fires
\q2 and burn yourselves with your own torches!
\q1 This is what Yahweh will cause to happen to you:
\q2 you will be enduring great torment when you die [EUP]!
