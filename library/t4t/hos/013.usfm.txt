\c 13
\s1 Israel is doomed to be destroyed
\q1
\v 1 Previously, when the leaders of Israel spoke,
\q2 the people trembled;
\q2 those leaders were highly respected by the Israeli people.
\q1 But the people sinned greatly by \add worshiping\add* Baal,
\q2 so now they will be killed \add by their enemies\add*.
\q1
\v 2 Now they sin more and more;
\q2 they make idols for themselves
\q2 and \add cover them\add* with their silver.
\q1 Those idols are statues that are very cleverly made,
\q2 but those statues are made by \add mere\add* humans.
\q1 But \add the people are told\add*, “Kiss those idols \add that resemble a\add* calf,
\q2 and offer sacrifices to them!”
\q1
\v 3 Therefore, those people will \add disappear quickly\add* like [SIM] the morning mist or the dew that lies \add on the ground\add* early \add in the morning\add*;
\q2 \add they will disappear\add* like [SIM] chaff that is blown away from where \add the wheat\add* is threshed,
\q2 like [SIM] smoke that goes out of a window.
\b
\q1
\v 4 But \add Yahweh says to his people\add*, “I am Yahweh, your God,
\q2 the one who brought your \add ancestors\add* out of Egypt.
\q1 You must believe that only I am God
\q2 and that there is no other God,
\q2 and that there is no other one who can save you!
\q1
\v 5 I took care of your \add ancestors\add* when they were in the desert,
\q2 where it was extremely \add hot and\add* dry.
\q1
\v 6 When I provided food for them,
\q2 their stomachs were full, and they were satisfied.
\q1 But then they became proud
\q2 and they forgot about me,
\q2 \add and you are like your ancestors\add*!
\q1
\v 7 So I will attack you like [SIM] a lion \add attacks other animals\add*;
\q2 I will be like [SIM] a leopard that waits beside the road \add to attack another animal\add*.
\q1
\v 8 Like [SIM] a female bear attacks anyone that steals her cubs,
\q2 I will attack you Israelis and rip you open.
\q1 I will completely get rid of you
\q2 like [SIM] lions or other wild animals tear apart the animals that they catch and devour them.
\b
\q1
\v 9 \add You people of\add* Israel, you will be destroyed
\q2 because you oppose me, the only one who ◄can help/helps► you.
\q1
\v 10 You have a king;
\q2 ◄why is he \add unable to save you\add*?/but he is \add unable to save you\add*.► [RHQ]
\q1 You have [RHQ] rulers in all your towns,
\q2 \add but they are not helping you, either\add*.
\q1 Your ancestors said, ‘Appoint for us a king and other leaders \add to rule over us\add*
\q2 \add like the other nations have\add*!’
\q1
\v 11 I was angry with them \add for requesting that\add*,
\q2 but I appointed a king \add to rule over\add* them.
\q1 But \add later\add* I became very angry with you again,
\q2 so I took your king away.
\q1
\v 12 \add I have written on a scroll\add* a record of the sins that have been committed by you people of Israel,
\q2 and I have stored away that record.
\b
\q1
\v 13 You people are not wise;
\q2 and now \add you are helpless\add*:
\q1 you are like [MET] a woman who is having birth pains
\q2 but who is unable to give birth to the baby.
\q1
\v 14 I certainly will not [RHQ] save you from being killed
\q2 and from going to the place where the dead people are.
\q1 I will [RHQ] cause you to be afflicted by plagues
\q2 and to die and be buried in graves.
\q1 I will not act mercifully toward you.
\b
\q1
\v 15 Even if you people of Israel prosper more than the nearby nations do,
\q2 \add the army of Assyria\add* will come like [MET] an east wind that blows from the desert;
\q1 the springs and wells in Israel will become dry;
\q2 and your enemies will take away all your valuable possessions.
\q1
\v 16 You people of Samaria must be punished
\q2 because you have rebelled against me, your God.
\q1 You will be killed by \add your enemies'\add* swords;
\q2 your little children will be \add killed by being\add* dashed/thrown to the ground;
\q2 the bellies of pregnant women \add among you\add* will be ripped open.”
