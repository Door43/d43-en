\c 7
\q1
\v 1 “and when I wanted to heal them again,
\q2 \add I did not do it\add*
\q1 because I saw the wicked things that \add the people of\add* Samaria \add city\add* and \add other places in\add* Israel [DOU] have done.
\q1 They constantly deceive others;
\q2 bandits rob people in the streets.
\q1
\v 2 But they do not realize that I do not forget all the evil deeds that they do.
\q2 \add It is as though\add* they are surrounded by all the sins that they commit;
\q2 and \add it is though\add* those sins are always right in front of me [MTY].
\b
\q1
\v 3 Their king is delighted with the wicked things that they do;
\q2 his officials are happy about the people's lies.
\q1
\v 4 \add The king and his officials\add* are all treacherous.
\q2 They are \add always eager to do wicked things\add*;
\q1 they are like [SIM] an oven that is very hot:
\q2 a baker mixes the dough and waits for it to expand,
\q2 and he does not need to cause the oven to become hotter.
\q1
\v 5 The king and his officials get very drunk during their festivals,
\q2 carousing with others who also do foolish things.
\q1
\v 6 The officials angrily plan to murder the king;
\q2 it is like [SIM] they have an oven in their inner beings.
\q1 All during the night their \add eagerness/wanting to murder the king\add* is like a fire that is smouldering,
\q2 but in the morning it becomes like [MET] a roaring fire.
\q1
\v 7 All those officials are like [MET] hot flames
\q2 that completely burn up their rulers,
\q1 so all their kings are killed,
\q2 and no one pleads with me \add to help them\add*.”
\s1 Other nations will not help them
\q1
\v 8 “\add The leaders of\add* Israel join with leaders of \add godless\add* nations;
\q2 so \add the leaders of\add* Israel are \add as worthless as\add* a pancake that is cooked on only one side.
\q1
\v 9 Joining with the rulers of foreign nations has caused Israel to be a weak \add nation\add*,
\q2 but the Israelis do not realize that.
\q1 Israel has become like [MET] a gray-haired old man,
\q2 but the people of Israel do not realize it.
\b
\q1
\v 10 Their being proud [PRS] testifies against them,
\q2 but in spite of that, they do not return to me, Yahweh, their God,
\q1 or \add even\add* try to know me.
\b
\q1
\v 11 The people of Israel have become foolish and stupid like [SIM] doves.
\q2 First they called out to Egypt \add to help them\add*,
\q1 and then they sought help from Assyria.
\q1
\v 12 But wherever they go \add to get help\add*,
\q2 \add I will not allow them to succeed\add*;
\q1 \add it will be as though\add* [MET] I will throw a net over them
\q2 like [SIM] \add a hunter captures\add* birds;
\q1 I will punish them for the evil things that they do.
\q1
\v 13 Terrible things will happen to them
\q2 because they abandoned/deserted me!
\q1 They will be destroyed
\q2 because they rebelled against me.
\q1 I wanted to rescue them,
\q2 but they tell lies about me.
\q1
\v 14 They do not cry out to me sincerely [IDI];
\q2 they \add only\add* lie on their beds and wail.
\q1 They gather together and request \add me to give them\add* grain and wine,
\q2 but they turn away from me.
\q1
\v 15 I trained/taught them and enabled them to become strong,
\q2 but now they plan \add to do\add* evil things to me.
\q1
\v 16 They have rejected me, their Great God, and turned to their god Baal;
\q2 they are \add as useless\add* as [SIM] a crooked bow.
\q1 Their leaders boast \add that they are very strong\add*,
\q2 but they will be killed by \add their enemies'\add* swords.
\q1 As a result, \add the people of\add* Egypt will laugh at them.”
