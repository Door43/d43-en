\c 10
\q1
\v 1 “Israel was like [MET] a large healthy/luxuriant vine
\q2 that produced \add a lot of\add* grapes.
\q1 But as the people became richer,
\q2 they made more altars \add at which to worship idols\add*.
\q1 As the people prospered,
\q2 they built and decorated sacred pillars \add that they worshiped\add*.
\q1
\v 2 They are deceitful in their inner beings;
\q2 so now they are guilty and must be punished.
\q1 I, Yahweh, will tear down their altars
\q2 and smash those pillars.
\q1
\v 3 Then they will say, ‘It is because we did not revere Yahweh
\q2 that we no longer have a king.
\q1 But \add even if we had\add* a king,
\q2 he certainly could not [RHQ] do anything to help us.’
\q1
\v 4 They falsely promise \add that they will do many things\add*;
\q2 they solemnly promise and make agreements
\q2 but they do not do what they promise.
\q1 So people accuse and sue each other in the courts;
\q2 they are like [SIM] poisonous weeds that grow in a plowed field.
\q1
\v 5 The people who live in Samaria \add city\add* are worried about \add what may happen to\add* the idol that resembles a calf \add that they set up\add* at Beth-Aven \add town\add*.
\q2 The people in Samaria will mourn,
\q1 and the priests there will cry about it
\q2 \add if it is damaged or destroyed\add*.
\q1 \add Previously\add* they shouted joyfully
\q2 about its being very great;
\q1 but now it will not be great anymore.
\q1
\v 6 It will be taken to Assyria
\q2 to be a gift for the great king \add of Assyria\add*.
\q1 So the people of Israel will be disgraced,
\q2 and they will be ashamed
\q2 because \add they trusted in\add* that idol.
\q1
\v 7 The king of Samaria \add and the other people in Samaria\add* will be gone;
\q2 they will be like [SIM] a twig \add that floats away\add* on the surface of the water \add and disappears\add*.
\q1
\v 8 The altars on the tops of hills \add where the people worshiped idols\add* will be destroyed;
\q2 those have been the places where the people of Israel sinned greatly.
\q1 Thorns and weeds will grow and cover those altars.
\q2 Then the people will plead to the mountains and hills,
\q1 ‘\add Fall down and\add* cover us
\q2 \add to protect us from God punishing us\add*!’
\b
\q1
\v 9 You people of Israel, \add ever since your ancestors did evil things\add* at Gibeah,
\q2 you have continued to sin.
\q1 \add When the people at\add* [PRS] Gibeah \add did evil things\add*,
\q2 the result was a war \add in which thousands of people died\add*.
\q1
\v 10 So now, when I want to, I will punish the Israeli people:
\q2 because of the many sins that they have committed,
\q1 \add the armies of\add* other nations will gather to attack them,
\q2 and they will cause the Israeli people to become their slaves.
\q1
\v 11 Israel is like [MET] a well-trained ◄heifer/young cow►
\q2 that likes to thresh grain.
\q1 So \add now you will become slaves\add*.
\q2 \add It will be as though\add* I will put a yoke on your neck;
\q1 and you will be forced to work hard for your enemies in their fields.
\q2 \add You people of\add* Israel and Judah \add will be forced to go to Assyria\add*;
\q2 there you [DOU] will pull plows to break up the ground \add for planting seeds\add*.
\q1
\v 12 \add You plow your fields and plant your seeds\add* and harvest \add your crops\add* [MET],
\q2 \add but what you need to do is\add* to act righteously and to faithfully love me;
\q1 you need to repent [MET],
\q2 because it is time to try to know me, Yahweh;
\q1 and if you do that, I will pour out [MET] many blessings on you.
\q1
\v 13 You plant \add seeds\add* and harvest \add the crops and eat them\add*;
\q2 but \add what I consider that you have really done is\add* to plant wicked deeds and harvested evil deeds
\q2 and eaten [MET] the results [IDI] of the lies that you have told.
\q1 \add Instead of trusting in me\add*, you have ◄depended on/trusted in► your own power
\q2 and your many soldiers.
\q1
\v 14 As a result, you will soon hear the roar of battle,
\q2 and all your cities that have walls around them will be destroyed,
\q1 like [SIM] Shalman's \add army\add* destroyed Beth-Arbel \add city\add* in a battle,
\q2 and the women \add in that city\add* and their children were bashed to death.
\q1
\v 15 \add You people of\add* [APO] Bethel \add city\add*, that is what will happen to you,
\q2 because you are very wicked.
\q1 And when the sun rises on that day,
\q2 the king of Israel will be killed \add in the battle\add*.”
