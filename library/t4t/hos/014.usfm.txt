\c 14
\s1 Those who repent will be blessed
\q1
\v 1 \add You people of\add* Israel, return to Yahweh our God.
\q2 You are being punished because of the sins which you have committed.
\q1
\v 2 So now return to Yahweh
\q2 and say [MTY] this to him:
\q1 “Forgive us for all the sins that we have committed,
\q2 and kindly accept ◄us/our sacrifices►
\q1 in order that we may thank/praise you [IDI].
\q1
\v 3 \add We admit that\add* Assyria will not save us,
\q2 and our war horses will not save us, either.
\q1 We will never again say, ‘You are our gods’
\q2 to \add the idols that\add* we [SYN] have made.
\q2 You are the one who acts mercifully to orphans.”
\q1
\v 4 \add Yahweh says, “If they say that to me\add*, I will forgive them for having ◄turned away from/abandoned► me,
\q2 and I will love them with all my inner being,
\q2 because I [PRS] will have stopped being angry with them.
\q1
\v 5 I will be to the people of Israel
\q2 like dew \add that refreshes the soil\add*.
\q1 When I do that, they will \add become as delightful as\add* [MET] lilies are when they are blooming.
\q2 \add No one will be able to conquer them\add*;
\q2 they will be \add as unmovable as\add* [SIM] the roots \add of cedar trees\add*.
\q2
\v 6 \add Their good influence will spread\add* like [MET] the branches of a tree.
\q1 They will be like [SIM] beautiful olive trees,
\q2 and \add they will be as delightful as\add* [SIM] the aroma of cedar \add trees in\add* Lebanon.
\q1
\v 7 People will \add come to them to be protected\add*
\q2 \add like people are protected from the hot sun by being\add* [MET] in the shade \add of a tree\add*.
\q1 They \add will ◄flourish/be strong► like\add* [SIM] grain that grows well.
\q2 They will \add be successful like\add* a vineyard \add in which grapes grow abundantly\add*.
\q1 They will become as famous/well-known as [SIM] wine from Lebanon.
\q1
\v 8 \add You people of\add* Israel, do not [RHQ] have anything more to do with idols;
\q2 if you \add get rid of your idols\add*, I will answer your \add prayers\add* and take care of you.
\q1 I am like [MET] a strong/green pine tree,
\q2 and your blessings come from me.”
\b
\q1
\v 9 Those who are wise will understand the things \add about which I have written; \add*
\q2 Those who think well will pay careful attention to them.
\q1 The things that Yahweh wants us to do [MET] are right;
\q2 righteous people will conduct their lives adhering to them.
\q2 But those who rebel against Yahweh will be ruined.
