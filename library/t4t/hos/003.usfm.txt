\c 3
\s1 Hosea bought his wife again
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh said to me, “Go and show to your wife that you still love her, even though she has been committing adultery with another man who loves her. \add That will show that\add* I still love the people of Israel, even though they worship other gods/idols and eat raisin cakes \add in feasts that honor those gods\add*.”
\p
\v 2 \add My wife had become a slave\add*, but I bought her for ◄6 ounces/179 grams► of silver and ten bushels of barley.
\v 3 Then I said to her, “You must wait for many days \add before we sleep together\add* [EUP]. During that time, you must not be a prostitute, and you must not have sex with any other man; but I will live with you.”
\p
\v 4 \add Our doing that will show that\add* in the same way, the people of Israel will not have a king and other leaders for many years. They will not offer sacrifices or \add have sacred stone\add* pillars, no sacred vest \add for the Supreme Priest\add*, and no idols!
\v 5 But later, the people of Israel will return to Yahweh their God and \add be guided by him and\add* a king who is a descendant of \add King\add* David. In the last/future days they will come to Yahweh, revering him and trembling in his presence, and he will bless them.
