\c 12
\q1
\v 1 \add The leaders of\add* Israel are constantly wavering \add about seeking help from other countries\add*.
\q2 Seeking their help is \add as useless as\add* [MET] chasing the wind.
\q2 They pile up their lies and violent acts.
\q1 \add First\add*, they make a treaty with Assyria,
\q2 and then they send olive oil to Egypt \add to seek their help\add*.
\q1
\v 2 Yahweh says that he will accuse \add the leaders of\add* Judah,
\q2 and that he will punish \add the descendants of\add* Jacob for what they have done.
\q1
\v 3 \add When Jacob\add* was in his mother's womb, he grabbed his brother \add Esau's\add* heel \add because he wanted to be born first\add*.
\q2 When Jacob grew up, he wrestled with God.
\q1
\v 4 He struggled with \add Yahweh, who had appeared to him in the form of\add* an angel, and Jacob defeated him,
\q2 but then he cried and asked the angel to bless him.
\q1 Later, God came to Jacob at Bethel
\q2 and talked with him there.
\q1
\v 5 \add That was\add* the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels
\q2 whose name is Yahweh \add who talked with him\add*!
\q1
\v 6 But you \add people of Israel\add* must return to your God!
\q2 You must faithfully love him, and you must do what is fair/just
\q2 and always depend on him.
\b
\q1
\v 7 The merchants \add among you\add* use scales that do not weigh correctly;
\q2 they love/like to cheat people.
\q1
\v 8 The people of Israel boast, saying
\q2 “We are very rich [DOU];
\q1 and we got all that money by our own efforts,
\q2 and without committing any sin.”
\b
\q1
\v 9 “I am Yahweh your God,
\q2 the one who brought your \add ancestors\add* out of Egypt.
\q1 \add And some day\add* I will force you to live in tents again \add like your ancestors did\add*
\q2 when \add they celebrated\add* the Festival \add of Living in Temporary Shelters\add*.
\q1
\v 10 \add Many times\add* I spoke to the prophets,
\q2 and I gave them many visions,
\q2 and I gave them parables to tell \add to the people\add*.”
\b
\q1
\v 11 The people of Gilead \add city\add* are [RHQ] extremely wicked;
\q2 they are worthless.
\q1 The people sacrifice bulls in Gilgal \add city\add*,
\q2 but their altars will \add soon\add* become like [SIM] piles of stone \add at the edge of\add* a plowed field.
\q1
\v 12 \add Your ancestor\add* Jacob fled \add from his brother Esau\add*
\q2 and went to northwest Mesopotamia.
\q2 He worked for \add his uncle Laban for many years\add* to get a wife;
\q2 he took care of \add his uncle's\add* sheep to pay for her.
\q1
\v 13 \add Many years later\add*, Yahweh enabled a prophet to bring the \add ancestors of you\add* people of Israel here from Egypt;
\q2 that prophet, \add Moses\add*, took care of them.
\q1
\v 14 \add But now the people of\add* Israel have caused Yahweh to become very angry;
\q2 Yahweh says that they deserve to die because they caused \add many others\add* to die [MTY];
\q2 he will pay them back for the sins that they have committed against him and for insulting him.
