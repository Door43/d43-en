\q1 Later, God came to Jacob at Bethel
\q2 and talked with him there.
\q1
\v 5 \add That was\add* the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels
\q2 whose name is Yahweh \add who talked with him\add*!
\q1
\v 6 But you \add people of Israel\add* must return to your God!
\q2 You must faithfully love him, and you must do what is fair/just
\q2 and always depend on him.
\b

\b
\q1
\v 9 “I am Yahweh your God,
\q2 the one who brought your \add ancestors\add* out of Egypt.
\q1 \add And some day\add* I will force you to live in tents again \add like your ancestors did\add*
\q2 when \add they celebrated\add* the Festival \add of Living in Temporary Shelters\add*.
\q1
\v 10 \add Many times\add* I spoke to the prophets,

\q1
\v 12 \add Your ancestor\add* Jacob fled \add from his brother Esau\add*
\q2 and went to northwest Mesopotamia.
\q2 He worked for \add his uncle Laban for many years\add* to get a wife;
\q2 he took care of \add his uncle's\add* sheep to pay for her.
\q1
\v 13 \add Many years later\add*, Yahweh enabled a prophet to bring the \add ancestors of you\add* people of Israel here from Egypt;
\q2 that prophet, \add Moses\add*, took care of them.
\q1
\v 14 \add But now the people of\add* Israel have caused Yahweh to become very angry;
\q2 Yahweh says that they deserve to die because they caused \add many others\add* to die [MTY];
\q2 he will pay them back for the sins that they have committed against him and for insulting him.
