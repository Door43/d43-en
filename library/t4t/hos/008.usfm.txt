\c 8
\s1 The Israelis will be punished because of their wrong decisions
\q1
\v 1 \add Yahweh said to me\add*, “Blow [MTY] your trumpet
\q2 \add to warn the people\add*!
\q1 My people have rejected the agreement that I made with them,
\q2 and they have rebelled against \add obeying\add* my laws.
\q1 Therefore, \add their enemies\add* are swooping down on my people's country like [SIM] an eagle.
\q1
\v 2 My Israeli people cry out to me,
\q2 ‘Our God, we know that you are our God!’
\q1
\v 3 But because the Israeli people have rejected what is good,
\q2 their enemies will pursue them.
\q1
\v 4 The Israel people appointed \add their last three\add* kings,
\q2 but they did not ask me if I agreed to \add what they were doing\add*.
\q1 They chose their own leaders
\q2 without asking if I would approve of them.
\q1 They used their own silver and gold to make for themselves idols
\q2 and doing that led them to be destroyed.
\q1
\v 5 You people of Samaria, throw away your \add idol that resembles a\add* calf!
\q2 I am extremely angry with you people!
\q1 How long [RHQ] will you \add do things that cause\add* you to be unacceptable to me?
\q2
\v 6 \add Someone in\add* Israel made that idol for you;
\q1 \add but I am\add* God and it is not.
\q2 So that idol of a calf in Samaria must be smashed to pieces.
\b
\q1
\v 7 \add The foolish thing that the people of Israel have done is like\add* [MET] trying to plant wind;
\q2 but what they harvest will be like [MET] a whirlwind.
\q1 So the grain that they planted will have no heads \add on the stalks\add*
\q2 and as a result \add there will be no grain\add* from which to make flour.
\q1 And if it did produce good grain,
\q2 foreigners would \add come and\add* steal it.
\q1
\v 8 \add The people of\add* Israel will be defeated [MET] \add by their enemies\add*;
\q2 they will be \add scattered\add* among other nations and become worthless.
\q1
\v 9 Like [MET] donkeys that are looking for mates,
\q2 they have requested \add help\add* from Assyria;
\q1 they paid money to \add the leaders of Assyria\add*
\q2 in order to \add persuade those leaders to\add* protect them.
\q1
\v 10 But although they have agreed to pay money each year to \add the leaders of\add* those countries,
\q2 I will soon gather them together \add to punish them\add*.
\q2 The great king \add of Assyria\add* will cause them to suffer greatly.
\b
\q1
\v 11 Although \add the people of\add* Israel built many altars to present offerings \add to their idols\add* to take away \add their guilt for\add* sinning,
\q2 those altars have become places where they commit \add more\add* sins.
\q1
\v 12 I wrote many laws for them,
\q2 but they disregarded them, saying that \add they did not have to obey them because\add* they were different from laws that they had known previously.
\q1
\v 13 They offer sacrifices to me,
\q2 and they eat \add some of\add* the meat of those sacrifices, \add which is what I permitted them to do\add*.
\q2 But I, Yahweh, am not pleased with those sacrifices.
\q1 I remember the evil things that they have done,
\q2 and I will punish them for the sins that they have committed:
\q1 I will force them to \add go to other countries\add*
\q2 \add and become slaves like they were\add* [MET] in Egypt.
\q1
\v 14 \add The people of\add* Israel have abandoned/forgotten me, the one who created their \add nation\add*;
\q2 they have built palaces,
\q2 and \add the people of\add* Judah have built walls around many towns.
\q1 But I will send a fire
\q2 that will destroy all their cities and their fortresses.”
