\c 9
\s1 Israel will be punished
\q1
\v 1 You people of Israel, do not shout joyfully \add during your festivals\add* like \add people of other\add* nations do!
\q2 \add I say that\add* because you have ◄not been faithful to/abandoned► me, your God.
\q1 At every place where the people thresh grain
\q2 you have \add presented gifts to your idols like men\add* pay money to prostitutes.
\q1
\v 2 \add But soon\add* there will not be enough grain [MTY, PRS] and wine [MTY, PRS] for you.
\q1
\v 3 And you people will not remain in the land that I, Yahweh, \add gave to your ancestors\add*.
\q2 You will be \add captured and taken to\add* Assyria,
\q2 \add where you will become slaves like your ancestors were\add* in Egypt;
\q1 and in Assyria you will be forced to eat food that I have forbidden you to eat.
\q1
\v 4 You Israelis will not \add be able to\add* give wine offerings to me,
\q2 or bring sacrifices to me.
\q1 None of your other sacrifices will please me;
\q2 they will be unacceptable to me, like [SIM] food that is touched by people at funerals,
\q1 and everyone who eats that food will become unacceptable to me.
\q1 They will be permitted to eat that food themselves,
\q2 but they will not be permitted to bring it into my temple.
\q1
\v 5 At that time you will not [RHQ] be able to celebrate my feasts and sacred festivals.
\q1
\v 6 And even if you escape and are not killed \add by the Assyrians\add*,
\q2 you will be captured by \add the army of\add* Egypt
\q2 and you will \add die and\add* be buried in Memphis, \add the capital of Egypt\add*.
\q1 Briers will \add grow up and\add* cover your treasures of silver,
\q2 and thorns will grow in your ruined tents/houses.
\q1
\v 7 It is now the time for me to punish you,
\q2 to pay you back for all the sins that you have committed.
\q2 You people will \add soon\add* know that.
\q1 You have \add committed\add* very many sins,
\q2 and you very much hate me.
\q1 You consider that the prophets are foolish,
\q2 and you think that those who proclaim messages from me are crazy.
\q1
\v 8 My God appointed \add me and the other\add* prophets
\q2 to be like [MET] watchmen \add to warn\add* you people of Israel,
\q1 but everywhere that we go, \add it is as though\add* people set traps for us
\q2 and people are hostile to us, \add even\add* in the temple of our God.
\q1
\v 9 The sins that the Israeli people have committed are as awful as \add what the men of\add* Gibeah did long ago;
\q1 so I will not forget the wicked things that they have done;
\q2 I will punish them for all those sins.
\b
\q1
\v 10 When I first started \add to do things to help\add* Israel,
\q2 it seemed to me as though [SIM] I had found grapes in the desert.
\q1 Your ancestors were \add delightful\add*,
\q2 like [SIM] the first figs that grow on fig trees \add each year\add*.
\q1 But when they came to Peor \add Mountain\add*,
\q2 they worshiped that disgusting idol Baal,
\q2 and they became as disgusting as the idol that they loved.
\q1
\v 11 The things that cause Israel to be great will disappear
\q2 like [SIM] a bird that flies away;
\q1 \add most of their women will\add* not become pregnant [DOU] or give birth to children.
\q1
\v 12 Even if their children are born and grow up,
\q2 I will cause all of them to die.
\q1 Terrible things will happen to them
\q2 when I abandon them!
\q1
\v 13 I have seen Israel become beautiful and prosperous like Tyre \add city\add* was \add before it was destroyed\add*,
\q2 but now the people of Israel will \add be forced to\add* bring out their children to be slaughtered \add by their enemies\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 14 Yahweh, \add I do not know\add* [RHQ] what I should request for my people.
\q2 So I request that you do this one thing:
\q1 cause the women who are pregnant to have miscarriages
\q2 and have breasts that have no milk in them \add to nurse their babies\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 15 \add Yahweh says\add*, “Because of all the wicked things that my people did at Gilgal,
\q2 that is where I started to hate them.
\q1 And now, because of all the sinful deeds that they have done,
\q2 I will expel them from my country.
\q1 I will not love them any longer;
\q2 all their leaders rebel against me.
\q1
\v 16 Israel is like [MET] a grapevine that is dried up;
\q2 \add like a vine\add* [MET] whose roots are withered
\q2 and that produces no fruit.
\q1 Even if the \add women of Israel\add* give birth to more children,
\q2 I will cause those children whom they love to die.
\b
\q1
\v 17 The people of Israel have not obeyed me, their God,
\q2 so I will reject them.
\q2 As a result, they will wander among the other nations, \add searching for a place to live\add*.”
