\c 4
\s1 Yahweh's accusation against Israel
\q1
\v 1 You Israeli people, listen to this message from Yahweh!
\q2 He is accusing you people who live in this country,
\q2 saying “The people are not faithfully \add doing what pleases me\add*,
\q1 they do not act kindly \add toward others\add*,
\q2 and they do not \add even\add* know me!
\q1
\v 2 Everywhere in this land they curse others, they murder others, they steal, and they commit adultery.
\q1 They act violently toward others
\q2 and commit one murder after another.
\q1
\v 3 It is because of their doing those things that there is no rain [MTY], the land has become dry,
\q2 the people are mourning,
\q1 and the people are dying \add from hunger\add*.
\q2 Even the wild animals and the birds and the fish in the sea are dying.
\b
\q1
\v 4 But no one should accuse someone else
\q2 and say it is his fault.
\q1 It is you priests whom I am accusing.
\q1
\v 5 So I will punish [MTY] you priests, night and day,
\q2 and I will punish the prophets with you.
\q1 I am going to destroy \add Israel, the nation that is like\add* [MET] a mother to you.
\q2
\v 6 It is because my people do not know \add about me\add* that they will be destroyed.
\q1 And their not knowing about me is because you have refused \add to teach them about me\add*;
\q2 so I will no longer allow you to be my priests.
\q1 You have forgotten the things that I taught you,
\q2 so I will forget \add to bless\add* your children.
\q1
\v 7 As there are more and more priests,
\q2 they have sinned against me more and more.
\q1 So I will no longer allow them to be honored;
\q2 instead, I will cause them to be disgraced.
\q1
\v 8 The priests get food from the \add offerings that the\add* people \add bring in order to be forgiven for having sinned\add*,
\q1 so the priests want the people to sin more and more
\q2 \add in order that the people will bring them more and more offerings\add*.
\q1
\v 9 The priests \add are as sinful\add* as the other people,
\q2 and I will punish all of them for what they have done;
\q2 I will pay them back for the \add evil\add* deeds that they have committed.
\b
\q1
\v 10 \add The priests\add* will eat, but they will still be hungry;
\q2 they will have sex with prostitutes, but they will not have any children,
\q1 because they have abandoned me, Yahweh,
\q1
\v 11 and they are devoting themselves to sleeping with prostitutes,
\q2 and to \add drinking\add* old wine and new wine,
\q2 which results in their not being able to think clearly.”
\s1 The people are condemned for idolatry
\q1
\v 12 “You my people request wooden idols
\q2 \add to tell them what they should do\add*!
\q1 Like prostitutes who have left/abandoned their husbands,
\q2
\v 13 you have abandoned \add me\add* their God, and you are chasing after \add other gods\add* on the tops of hills and mountains;
\q1 you burn incense under oak trees, poplar trees, and other trees
\q2 where there is nice/pleasing shade.
\q1 So your daughters have become prostitutes,
\q2 and your daughters-in-law have committed adultery.
\b
\q1
\v 14 But it is not \add only\add* your daughters
\q2 \add whom I will punish\add* for having become prostitutes,
\q1 and it is not \add only\add* your daughters-in-law
\q2 whom I will punish for committing adultery,
\q1 because the men also are having sex with prostitutes,
\q2 and they offer sacrifices
\q2 with the prostitutes \add who search for men at the\add* shrines \add of the idols\add*.
\q1 \add They are all\add* foolish people, and they will all be ruined.
\b
\q1
\v 15 You Israeli people have abandoned me
\q2 like [MET] those who commit adultery have abandoned their spouses.
\q1 But do not cause \add the people of\add* Judah to sin also.
\q2 Do not go to Gilgal or go up to Beth-Aven \add towns\add*
\q2 \add to worship idols there\add*.
\q1 Do not make solemn promises there, saying ‘Just \add as surely\add* as Yahweh lives, \add I will do what I am promising\add*.’
\q1
\v 16 The people of Israel are as stubborn as [SIM] a young cow.
\q2 So there is no way [RHQ] that I, Yahweh, will \add provide food for them\add*
\q1 \add like a shepherd provides food\add* for his lambs
\q2 \add by leading them\add* to a nice meadow.
\q1
\v 17 The people of Israel have chosen to worship idols [MET],
\q2 so allow them \add to do what they want to do\add*.
\q1
\v 18 When their rulers finish drinking \add their wine\add*,
\q2 they go to find prostitutes;
\q2 they love their disgraceful behavior.
\q1
\v 19 But they will disappear
\q2 \add as though\add* [MET] they were blown away by a whirlwind.
\q1 They will become very ashamed because of their offering sacrifices \add to idols\add*.”
