\c 6
\s1 The Israeli people were insincere about repenting
\q1
\v 1 \add The Israeli people say\add*, “Come, let's return to Yahweh.
\q1 He has caused us to be injured,
\q2 but he will heal us.
\q1 He has caused us to be wounded,
\q2 but \add it is as though\add* he will put bandages on our wounds [MET].
\q1
\v 2 After a very short time he will revive us;
\q2 in less than three days he will restore us
\q2 in order that we may live in his presence.
\q1
\v 3 We must try to know Yahweh;
\q2 \add if we do that\add*, he will come \add and help\add* us,
\q1 as surely as the sun rises \add every morning\add*,
\q2 as surely as rain falls every winter/cold season
\q1 and as surely as the rain falls again ◄in the springtime/at the end of the cold season►.”
\q1
\v 4 But Yahweh \add knows they are insincere\add*;
\q1 \add so he says to them\add*, “You \add people of\add* Israel, and you \add people of\add* Judah,
\q2 \add I do not know\add* [RHQ] what I should do to you.
\q1 Your being faithful to me \add will disappear as quickly\add* as [SIM] the morning mist \add disappears\add*,
\q2 like [SIM] the dew \add on the ground\add* that disappears quickly \add when the sun shines\add*.
\q1
\v 5 I warned [HYP] you by \add the messages that I gave to\add* the prophets,
\q2 \add but you did not pay attention to my messages\add*.
\q1 Therefore I will completely destroy you;
\q2 the punishment that I give you will strike you like lightning.
\q1
\v 6 I want \add my people\add* to faithfully love me
\q2 more than \add I want them to offer\add* sacrifices to me;
\q1 \add I want them\add* to know me
\q2 more than \add I want them to\add* completely burn sacrifices \add on the altar\add*.
\q1
\v 7 But they have refused to obey my agreement like Adam did;
\q2 they have not been faithful to me.
\q1
\v 8 Gilead is a city \add full\add* of people who do wicked things;
\q2 \add in the streets\add* are the bloody footprints \add of those who have murdered others\add*.
\q1
\v 9 The priests are like [SIM] bandits who wait ◄in ambushes/along the road► to attack people;
\q2 they murder \add people who are walking\add* on the road to Shechem,
\q1 and they commit other disgraceful crimes.
\q1
\v 10 I have seen horrible things being done in Israel [MTY].
\q2 The people have abandoned me \add like prostitutes who have abandoned their husbands\add* [MET];
\q1 \add so the people of\add* Israel have become unacceptable to me.
\b
\q1
\v 11 And you \add people of\add* Judah,
\q2 I have appointed a time when I will punish [MET] you, too.
\b
\q1 Whenever I wanted to enable my people to prosper again,”
