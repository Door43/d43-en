\c 5
\s1 Yahweh's accusation against the Israeli people
\q1
\v 1 “Listen, you priests!
\q2 And you other Israeli people, you also pay attention!
\q1 And you who are members of the king's family, \add you also need to\add* listen,
\q2 because \add I am going to\add* judge you!
\q1 Your \add worshiping idols\add* has been like [MET] a trap for the people at Mizpah \add town\add*;
\q2 it has been like [MET] a net spread out \add to catch people\add* at Tabor \add Mountain\add*.
\q1
\v 2 You have done many evil things,
\q2 so I will punish all of you.
\q1
\v 3 I know \add everything about the people of\add* Israel;
\q2 nothing that they have done is hidden from me.
\q1 Because \add the people of\add* Israel have given themselves \add to worshiping idols\add*
\q2 like [MET] prostitutes \add give themselves to the men they sleep with\add*,
\q1 they have become unacceptable to me.
\b
\q1
\v 4 Because they \add like to do evil\add* deeds,
\q2 they will not return to me, their God.
\q1 Like prostitutes \add who have abandoned their husbands\add* [MET], they have [IDI] abandoned [MET] me;
\q2 they do not even know me, Yahweh.
\q1
\v 5 \add It is as though\add* their being proud testifies [PRS] against them.
\q2 The sins that \add the people of\add* Israel have committed \add are like a heavy load that causes them\add* to stumble,
\q2 and \add the people of\add* Judah stumble with them.
\q1
\v 6 They will come to worship me, Yahweh,
\q2 bringing their herds of sheep and cattle,
\q1 but they will not \add be able to\add* find me
\q2 because I have abandoned them.
\q1
\v 7 They have abandoned me;
\q2 and their children do not belong to me [MET].
\q1 So \add they will not be able to celebrate\add* their festivals at the new moons
\q2 because I will destroy them and \add the crops in\add* their fields.
\b
\q1
\v 8 Blow the rams' horns in Gibeah \add town\add*
\q2 \add and blow\add* the trumpets in Ramah \add town\add*!
\q1 Warn the people at Beth-Aven \add town\add*;
\q2 you warriors of the tribe of Benjamin, lead the troops \add into the battle\add*.
\q1
\v 9 Israel will be ruined on the day that I destroy them.
\q2 What I am telling to the tribes of Israel will certainly \add happen\add*.
\q1
\v 10 \add Because the leaders of Judah seized some land that belonged to Israel\add*,
\q2 they are like [SIM] those who move boundary markers \add to get more land for themselves\add*;
\q1 so I will punish them severely [MET].
\q1
\v 11 And \add the people of\add* Israel will suffer greatly when I punish them
\q2 because they are very determined to worship idols.
\q1
\v 12 I will destroy \add the people of\add* Israel like [SIM] ◄\add larvae of\add* moths/cockroaches► destroy wool,
\q2 and I will cause \add the people of\add* Judah to be like [SIM] rotten wood.
\b
\q1
\v 13 When \add the leaders of\add* Israel and Judah saw that the people were suffering
\q2 because of what \add their enemies were doing to them\add* [MET],
\q1 they sent \add messages\add* to the great king of Assyria
\q2 requesting \add his help\add*.
\q1 But he cannot help you;
\q2 he cannot cause you to stop suffering,
\q2 \add because I am the one who is punishing\add* Israel and Judah.
\q1
\v 14 I will become like [SIM] a lion [DOU] to both nations;
\q2 I will \add attack them and\add* tear them to pieces.
\q1 I will drag them away,
\q2 and no one will be able to rescue them.
\q1
\v 15 After that, I will return to my place \add in heaven\add*
\q2 until they admit that they have sinned [MTY] and return to me;
\q1 when they will experience \add many\add* troubles,
\q2 they will request me to help them.”
