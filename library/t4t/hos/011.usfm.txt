\c 11
\s1 God's love for Israel
\q1
\v 1 “Before the Israeli people became a nation [MET],
\q2 I loved them \add like a man loves\add* his son,
\q2 I called them out of Egypt.
\q1
\v 2 But while I continued to call them,
\q2 they continued to turn away from me more and more.
\q1 They offered sacrifices to their statues of Baal,
\q2 and they burned incense to honor them.
\q1
\v 3 The people of Israeli were \add like a little boy\add* [MET],
\q2 and \add it was as though\add* it was I who taught them to walk,
\q2 holding them by their hands.
\q1 But they did not realize that it was I who was taking care of them.
\q1
\v 4 \add It was as though I fastened\add* ropes \add around them\add* to lead them,
\q2 while I loved them and acted kindly toward them.
\q1 \add It was as though they were young oxen and\add* [MET]
\q2 and I lifted the yoke from their necks and bent down to feed them.
\b
\q1
\v 5 But the people of Israel will become slaves again,
\q2 like they were in Egypt,
\q1 and \add the people of\add* Assyria will [RHQ] rule over them,
\q2 because the people of Israel refused to repent.
\q1
\v 6 \add Their enemies\add* will use their swords \add to attack\add* the cities of Israel
\q2 and will destroy the bars in the gates \add of the city walls\add*.
\q2 As a result, the people of Israeli will not be able to accomplish the things that they planned to do.
\q1
\v 7 My people are determined to ◄turn away from/abandon► me.
\q2 They say that I am the great all-powerful God,
\q2 but they do not honor me at all.
\b
\q1
\v 8 You people of Israel, I certainly do not want to [RHQ] abandon you
\q2 and allow \add your enemies\add* to capture you.
\q1 I do not [RHQ] want to act toward you like I acted toward Admah and Zeboiim,
\q2 \add cities that I completely destroyed when I destroyed Sodom\add*.
\q1 I [SYN] have changed my mind about \add punishing you\add*;
\q2 my desire to pity you has been aroused.
\q1
\v 9 Although I am extremely angry,
\q2 I do not want to punish you severely;
\q1 I do not want to ◄devastate/completely ruin► Israel.
\q2 \add Humans would easily decide to do that\add*,
\q2 but I am God, not a human.
\q1 I am the Holy One among you;
\q2 Although I am very angry with you, I will not \add destroy you\add*.
\q1
\v 10 You will follow me when I roar like [SIM] a lion;
\q2 when I roar, \add some of you\add* my children will tremble as you return \add to Israel\add* from \add the islands and seacoasts toward\add* the west.
\q1
\v 11 \add Some of you\add* will come swiftly from Egypt
\q2 like a flock of birds;
\q2 \add others\add* will return from Assyria, like doves.
\q1 I will enable you to live in your homes \add in Israel\add* again.
\q2 \add That will surely happen, because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it.”
\s1 Israel and Judah are condemned now
\q1
\v 12 \add Yahweh says, “The people of\add* Israel have ◄surrounded me with lies/constantly told lies to me►.
\q2 And the people of Judah have also turned/rebelled against me, their God,
\q2 the Holy One who always does what I promise to do.”
