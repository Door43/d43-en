\s1 Visions that Yahweh gave to Joel
\p
\v 1 Yahweh our God showed me \add in a vision\add* that he was going to send locusts \add to destroy our crops\add*. It was going to happen right after the king's share of the hay had been harvested/cut and before the rest of the hay was ready to be harvested.
\v 2 \add And in the vision I saw\add* those locusts come, and they ate everything that was green. Then I cried out, “Yahweh our Lord, please forgive us! We Israeli people are very helpless; how will we be able to survive [RHQ]?”
\p
\v 3 So Yahweh changed his mind and said, “That will not happen.”
\p
\v 4 Then this is what Yahweh our Lord showed me \add in another vision\add*: He was calling to a fire to \add come and\add* punish \add his people\add*. \add In the vision I saw that\add* the fire dried up the ocean and also burned \add everything on\add* the land.
\v 5 Then I cried out again, “Yahweh our Lord, I plead with you, please stop this! We Israeli people are very helpless; how will we be able to survive [RHQ]?”
\p
\v 6 So Yahweh changed his mind again, and said, “That also will not happen.”
\b
\p
\v 7 Then Yahweh showed me \add another vision\add*. I saw him standing beside a wall. \add It was very straight because\add* it had been built using a ◄plumb line/cord with a weight on one end to determine if walls are vertically straight►. Yahweh had the plumb line in his hand.
\v 8 Yahweh asked me, “Amos, what do you see?”
\p I replied, “A plumb line.”
\p Then Yahweh said, “Look, I am going to use a plumb line among my Israeli people, \add to show that they are like a wall that is not straight\add*. I will not change my mind again about punishing them.
\q1
\v 9 The places on hills where \add the descendants of\add* [MTY] Isaac worship \add idols\add* will be destroyed.
\q2 And the other important shrines in Israel will also be destroyed.
\q1 And I will enable \add your enemies\add* to attack your people with swords
\q2 and they will get rid of \add King\add* Jeroboam and all his descendants.”
\s1 Amaziah criticized Amos
\p
\v 10 Then Amaziah, the priest at Bethel, sent \add a message\add* to Jeroboam, the king of Israel. In the message he said, “Amos is plotting against you among the Israeli people [MTY]. \add I am worried that\add* the people of this country will not be able to refute his words.
\v 11 This is what he is saying:
\q1 ‘Jeroboam will soon be killed by \add someone using\add* a sword,
\q2 and the people of Israel will be ◄exiled/forced to leave their land and go to another country►.’~”
\b
\p
\v 12 Then Amaziah \add came to me and\add* said, “You prophet, get out of here! Go back to the country of Judah! Earn money to \add buy food to be able\add* to live there, and do your prophesying there!
\v 13 Do not prophesy anymore here at Bethel, because this is where the national temple, the king's temple, is!”
\p
\v 14 I replied to Amaziah, “I was \add previously\add* not a prophet and my father was not a prophet; I was a shepherd. I also took care of sycamore-fig trees.
\v 15 But Yahweh took me away from taking care of my sheep, and he said to me, ‘Go to Israel and prophesy to my people there!’
\q1
\v 16 You said to me, ‘Do not prophecy saying terrible things will happen to \add the people of\add* Israel;
\q2 stop saying those things!’
\p
\v 17 Therefore listen to what Yahweh says about you:
\q1 ‘Your wife will become a prostitute in this city,
\q2 and your sons and daughters will be killed by \add your enemies'\add* swords.
\q1 Others will measure your land
\q2 and divide it up \add among themselves\add*;
\q1 and you yourself will die in a foreign country.
\q1 And the people of Israel will certainly be forced to leave their country and go ◄into exile/to live in another country►.’~”
