\c 4
\s1 The Israelis have not returned to God
\q1
\v 1 You \add wealthy women\add* of Samaria \add who have grown fat\add* like [MET] the fat cows of the Bashan \add region\add*.
\q2 You oppress poor people
\q2 and you cause needy people to suffer.
\q1 And you say to your husbands,
\q2 “Bring us \add more wine\add* to drink!”
\q1
\v 2 But Yahweh our God has said this:
\q2 “Because I am holy, I solemnly promise this:
\q1 It will \add soon\add* be the time when you all will be taken \add to another country\add*;
\q2 \add your enemies will take you away as though they are using\add* sharp hooks [DOU] \add to grab you\add*.
\q1
\v 3 \add Your enemies\add* will drag you out through breaks/holes \add in your city walls\add*,
\q2 and they will throw you outside the city.
\q1 \add That will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it!
\b
\q1
\v 4 Go to Bethel and Gilgal \add towns where many people worship me\add*
\q2 and sin more and more [SAR]!
\q1 \add I say that not because I want you to do it\add*,
\q2 \add but because it is what you have always been doing\add*!
\q1 Offer sacrifices on the morning \add after you arrive\add*,
\q2 and bring me ◄a tithe/one tenth► of your crops the next day.
\q1
\v 5 Bring offerings of bread to thank me,
\q2 and other offerings that are not required/commanded,
\q1 and boast about these offerings that you bring,
\q2 because that is what you like to do,
\q1 \add but you do it to impress others, not to please me\add*.
\q1 \add That is certainly true, because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it.
\b
\q1
\v 6 I am the one who caused there to be no food in any of your cities and towns [DOU],
\q2 but you rejected me in spite of that.
\b
\q1
\v 7 When it was still three months before \add the time of\add* harvesting crops,
\q2 \add at the time when your crops needed rain the most\add*,
\q2 I prevented rain from falling.
\q1 \add Sometimes\add* I allowed rain to fall on some towns
\q2 and prevented it from falling on other towns.
\q1 Rain fell on some fields,
\q2 but it did not fall on other fields,
\q2 with the result that the soil in those fields \add where it did not rain\add* dried up.
\q1
\v 8 People would stagger from one town to another town to find water,
\q2 but they could not even get enough water to drink,
\q2 but in spite of that, you have not returned to me.
\q1 \add That is certainly true because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it!
\b
\q1
\v 9 I caused your grain fields to dry up;
\q2 I caused your gardens and vineyards to be struck/destroyed by ◄blight/hot winds► and mildew.
\q1 I sent locusts to eat \add the leaves on\add* your fig trees and olive trees,
\q2 but in spite of that, you rejected me.
\q1 \add That is certainly true because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it!
\b
\q1
\v 10 I caused you to experience ◄plagues/severe sicknesses►
\q2 like the plagues that I sent to \add the people of\add* Egypt.
\q1 I caused many of your young men to die in battles.
\q2 I allowed \add your enemies\add* to capture your horses.
\q1 \add Many of your soldiers were killed\add*,
\q2 and I caused your camps to be filled with the smell/stink of their corpses.
\q2 But in spite of that, you rejected me.
\q1 \add That is certainly true, because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it!
\b
\q1
\v 11 I got rid of many of you,
\q2 like I got rid of the people in Sodom and Gomorrah.
\q1 Those of you who \add did not die\add* were like [SIM] a burning stick that was snatched from a fire \add so that it would not burn completely\add*.
\q2 But in spite of that, you rejected me.
\q1 \add That is certainly true, because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it!
\b
\q1
\v 12 So now, you people of Israel, I am going to punish you.
\q2 Prepare to stand in front of me, your God, \add when I judge you\add*!
\b
\q1
\v 13 I created the mountains,
\q2 and I created the winds.
\q1 I reveal to humans what I am thinking.
\q2 I \add sometimes\add* cause the daylight to become dark like the night.
\q1 I \add rule over everything\add*;
\q2 I even walk on the highest mountains on the earth!
\q2 I am the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels!”
