\c 6
\s1 Israel will be punished
\q1
\v 1 Terrible things will happen to you people in Jerusalem who are not worried about anything,
\q2 but also to you leaders who live on Samaria hill who think that you are safe.
\q1 \add You think that\add* [IRO] you are the most important people \add in the world\add*,
\q2 people to whom Israeli people [MTY] go \add to get help\add*.
\q1
\v 2 But go to Calneh \add city\add* and see \add what happened there\add*.
\q2 Then go to \add see\add* the great \add city\add* Hamath \add and see what happened there\add*.
\q2 Then go down to Gath \add city\add* in Philistia \add and see what happened to their city walls\add*.
\q1 Your land/country is certainly not [RHQ] larger or more powerful than their countries were,
\q2 \add but they were all destroyed\add*.
\q1
\v 3 You are trying to not think about a day when you will experience disasters,
\q2 when \add your enemies will come and\add* violently attack you.
\q1
\v 4 You lie on beds \add decorated with expensive\add* ivory
\q2 and on \add soft\add* couches.
\q1 You eat \add the tender meat of\add* lambs
\q2 and fat calves.
\q1
\v 5 You create/compose new songs
\q2 and play them on your harps like \add King\add* David did.
\q1
\v 6 You drink entire bowlfuls of wine
\q2 and you put expensive oils/perfumes on your bodies,
\q2 but you do not grieve about \add our country of\add* Israel [MTY], which is about to be destroyed.
\q1
\v 7 Your feasting and lounging \add on soft couches\add* will soon end,
\q2 and you will be among the first ones to be forced \add by your enemies\add* to go ◄into exile/to another country►.
\s1 Yahweh detests the Israelis for being very proud
\p
\v 8 Yahweh the Lord has solemnly declared this:
\q1 “I hate the people of Israel because they are very proud;
\q2 I detest their fortresses.
\q1 I will enable \add their enemies\add* to capture their \add capital\add* city
\q2 and everything in it.”
\p
\v 9 \add When that happens\add*, if there are ten people in one house, they will all die.
\v 10 If a relative who ◄has the task of/is responsible for► burning their corpses comes to the house and inquires of anyone who is still hiding there, “Is there anyone here with you?”, and that person replies “No,” \add the one who inquired\add* will say, “Be quiet! We must not mention the name of Yahweh, \add lest he cause us also to be killed\add*!”
\b
\q1
\v 11 \add Terrible things like that will happen\add* because Yahweh has commanded that large houses \add in Israel\add* must be smashed into pieces,
\q2 and small houses must be smashed into tiny bits.
\b
\q1
\v 12 Horses certainly do not [RHQ] run on big rocks,
\q2 and certainly people do not [RHQ] plow the sea with oxen.
\q1 But you have \add done things that no one should do\add*:
\q1 You have distorted what is fair/right and caused it to be considered like poison [MET];
\q2 you have changed what is right and consider it to be like things that are bitter.
\q1
\v 13 You are proud because you have captured Lo-Debar \add town\add*,
\q2 and you have said, “We captured Karnaim by our own power!”
\b
\q1
\v 14 But the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels declares,
\q2 “I will cause another nation to attack you people [MTY] of Israel;
\q1 they will ◄oppress you/cause you to suffer► all the way from Hamath Pass \add in the northwest\add*
\q2 to the Dead Sea \add in the southeast\add*.”
