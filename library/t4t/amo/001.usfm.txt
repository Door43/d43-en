\v 1 This is the message that \add Yahweh\add* gave to me, Amos. I am a ◄shepherd/man who takes care of sheep► near Tekoa \add town south of Jerusalem\add*. I received this message about Israel in a vision two years before the \add big\add* earthquake. It was when Uzziah was the king of Judah and Jeroboam, the son of \add King\add* Jehoash, was the king of Israel.
\p
\v 2 This is what Yahweh said:
\q1 “I will roar \add like a lion\add* [MET];
\q2 when I speak from Zion \add Hill in\add* Jerusalem [DOU], my voice will \add resemble the sound of\add* thunder.
\q1 \add When that happens\add*, the pastures where you shepherds \add take care of\add* your sheep will dry up
\q2 and \add the grass\add* on top of Carmel \add Mountain\add* will ◄wither/become brown►
\q2 \add because I will cause that no rain will fall\add*.”
\s1 Yahweh will punish Syria
\p
\v 3 This is also what Yahweh said to me:
\q1 “\add I will punish the people of\add* Damascus, \add the capital of Syria\add*, because of the many sins that they have committed;
\q2 I will not \add change my mind about punishing them\add* [MTY],
\q1 because \add the cruel things that they did to the people of the\add* Gilead \add region\add*
\q2 \add were like\add* [MET] people threshing grain using sledges \add that have ◄iron teeth/sharp iron nails► in them\add*.
\q1
\v 4 I will cause a fire to burn the palace \add that King\add* Hazael \add built and lived in\add*,
\q2 the fortress where \add his son King\add* Ben-Hadad also lived.
\q1
\v 5 I will cause the gates of Damascus to be broken down;
\q2 I will get rid of the king who rules in Aven Valley
\q1 and the one who rules in Beth Eden.
\q2 And the people of Syria will be captured and taken to the Kir \add region where they originally lived\add*.”
\s1 Yahweh will punish Philistia
\p
\v 6 Yahweh also said this to me:
\q1 “\add I will punish the people of the cities of Philistia:\add*
\q2 \add I will punish the people of\add* Gaza \add city\add* because of the many sins that they have committed;
\q2 I will not change my mind about punishing them,
\q1 because they captured large groups of people and took them to Edom
\q2 and sold them to become the slaves of \add the people of\add* Edom.
\q1
\v 7 I will cause a fire to completely burn the walls of Gaza
\q2 and also destroy its fortresses.
\q1
\v 8 I will get rid of the king of Ashdod \add city\add*
\q2 and the king who rules [MTY] in Ashkelon \add city\add*.
\q1 I will also strike/punish \add the people of\add* Ekron \add city\add*,
\q2 and all the people of Philistia who are still alive will be killed.”
\s1 Yahweh will punish Tyre
\p
\v 9 Yahweh also said this to me:
\q1 “\add I will punish the people of\add* Tyre \add city\add* because of the many sins that their people have committed;
\q2 I will not change my mind about punishing them
\q1 because they also captured large groups of our people and took them to Edom,
\q2 disregarding the treaty of friendship that they had made \add with your rulers\add*.
\q1
\v 10 So I will cause a fire to completely burn the walls of Tyre
\q2 and also destroy its fortresses.”
\s1 Yahweh will punish Edom
\p
\v 11 Yahweh also said this to me:
\q1 “\add I will punish the people of\add* Edom because of the many sins that \add their people\add* have committed;
\q2 I will not change my mind about punishing them,
\q1 because they pursued the people of Israel, who descended from Esau's \add brother Jacob, and killed them\add* with swords;
\q2 they did not act mercifully toward them at all.
\q1 They were extremely angry \add with the people of Israel\add*,
\q2 and they continued to be angry with them.
\q1
\v 12 I will cause a fire to burn Teman \add district in Edom\add*
\q2 and completely burn the fortresses of Bozrah, \add the biggest city in Edom\add*.”
\s1 Yahweh will punish Ammon
\p
\v 13 Yahweh also said this to me:
\q1 “\add I will punish the people of\add* Ammon because of the many sins that \add they\add* have committed;
\q2 I will not change my mind about punishing them,
\q1 because \add their soldiers\add* even ripped open \add the bellies of\add* pregnant women
\q2 \add when their army attacked\add* Gilead \add region\add* to gain more territory.
\q1
\v 14 I will cause a fire to completely burn the walls of Rabbah \add city\add*
\q2 and completely burn its fortresses.
\q1 During that battle, \add their enemies\add* will shout loudly
\q2 and the fighting will be like [MET] a fierce/raging wind/storm.
\q1
\v 15 \add After the battle\add*, the king \add of Ammon\add* and his officials will be ◄exiled/forced to go to another country►.”
