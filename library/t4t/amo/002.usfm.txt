\c 2
\s1 Yahweh will punish Moab
\p
\v 1 Yahweh also said this:
\q1 “\add I will punish the people of\add* Moab because of the many sins \add that they have committed\add*;
\q2 I will not change my mind about punishing them,
\q1 because they \add dug up\add* the bones of the king of Edom and burned them completely,
\q2 with the result that \add the ashes became as white\add* as lime.
\q1
\v 2 So I will cause a fire to completely burn the fortresses of Kerioth \add city in Moab\add*.
\q2 People will hear soldiers shouting and blowing trumpets loudly
\q2 while I am causing Moab to be destroyed
\q1
\v 3 and while I am getting rid of its king and all its leaders.
\q2 \add That will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it!”
\b
\s1 Yahweh will punish Judah
\p
\v 4 Yahweh also said this:
\q1 “\add I will punish the people of\add* Judah because of the many sins \add that they have committed\add*;
\q2 I will not change my mind about punishing them,
\q1 because they have rejected what I taught them
\q2 and they have not obeyed my commands.
\q1 They have been deceived \add and persuaded to worship\add* false gods,
\q2 the same gods that their ancestors \add worshiped\add*.
\q1
\v 5 So I will cause a fire to completely burn \add everything in\add* Judah, including the fortresses in Jerusalem.”
\s1 Yahweh will punish Israel
\p
\v 6 Yahweh also said this:
\q1 “\add I will punish the people of\add* Israel because of the many sins \add that they have committed\add*;
\q2 I will not change my mind about punishing them,
\q1 because they sell righteous people to get \add a small amount of\add* silver;
\q2 they sell poor people, \add causing them to become slaves\add*,
\q2 getting for each of them \add only the amount of money with which they could buy\add* a pair of sandals.
\q1
\v 7 \add It is as though\add* they trample the poor people into the dirt
\q2 and do not allow those who are helpless to be treated fairly.
\q2 Men and their fathers dishonor me [MTY] by both having sex [EUP] with the same slave girl.
\q1
\v 8 \add When poor people borrow money,\add*
\q2 \add the lenders force those people to give to them a piece of clothing\add* for them to keep until he can pay back the money.
\q1 \add But at the end of each day, instead of returning that garment as Yahweh had commanded them to\add*,
\q2 they lie down on that garment at the places where they worship \add their gods\add*!
\q1 They fine people,
\q2 and with that money \add they buy\add* wine and drink it in the temples of their gods.
\b
\q1
\v 9 \add Long ago\add*, to assist your ancestors, I got rid of the Amor people-group.
\q2 They \add seemed to be\add* as tall as cedar trees
\q2 and as strong as oak trees,
\q1 but I got rid of them completely,
\q2 \add as easily as someone cuts off\add* [MET] the branches of a tree and then digs out all the roots.
\b
\q1
\v 10 I brought your \add ancestors\add* out of Egypt,
\q2 and then I led them through the desert for forty years.
\q2 And then I enabled them to conquer/possess the Amor area.
\q1
\v 11 I chose some of you Israelis to be prophets,
\q2 and I chose others to be Nazir-men \add who were completely dedicated to me\add*.
\q1 You people of Israel certainly [RHQ] know that what I have said is true!
\b
\q1
\v 12 But you commanded the prophets to not speak the messages that \add I gave to\add* them,
\q1 and you persuaded the Nazir-men to drink wine,
\q2 \add which I told them never to do\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 13 So I will crush you
\q2 like [SIM] \add the wheels of\add* a wagon that is loaded with grain crushes whatever it rolls over.
\q1
\v 14 Even if you run fast,
\q2 you will not escape;
\q1 even if you are strong, \add it will be as though\add* you are weak,
\q2 and warriors will be unable to save themselves.
\q1
\v 15 Even if you are able to shoot arrows well,
\q2 you will be forced to retreat [LIT];
\q1 even if you run fast or if you ride away on a horse,
\q2 you will not be able to save yourself.
\q1
\v 16 Even warriors who are very brave will drop their weapons
\q2 when they try to flee on the day \add that I get rid of them\add*.
\q1 \add That will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it.”
