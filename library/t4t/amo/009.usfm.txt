\c 9
\s1 Israel will be punished
\p
\v 1 Yahweh \add showed me another vision. In the vision\add*, I saw him standing next to the altar. He said,
\q1 “Strike/Shake the tops of the pillars \add of the temple\add*,
\q2 until they become loose and fall down,
\q2 so that even the foundation will shake.
\q1 Then cause the \add pieces of the temple\add* to fall down on the people \add who are inside\add*.
\q1 I will kill with a sword anyone who \add tries to\add* flee;
\q2 no one will escape.
\q1
\v 2 If they dig deep pits in the ground,
\q2 or if they try to climb up to the sky
\q1 \add in order to escape\add*,
\q2 I will reach out and grab them.
\q1
\v 3 If they go to the top of Carmel Mountain \add to escape\add*,
\q2 I will search for them and seize them.
\q1 If they \add try to\add* hide from me at the bottom of the sea,
\q2 I will command the huge sea monster to bite them.
\q1
\v 4 If their enemies \add capture them and\add* force them to go to other countries,
\q2 I will command that they be killed there with swords.
\q1 I am determined [IDI] to get rid of them, not to help them.”
\b
\q1
\v 5 When the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels touches the earth, it melts,
\q2 and all over the earth \add many people die, and the others\add* mourn for them.
\q1 \add It is as though\add* Yahweh causes the earth repeatedly to rise and fall
\q2 like [SIM] the Nile \add River\add* rises and falls.
\q1
\v 6 He builds his \add beautiful\add* palace in heaven,
\q2 and sets/causes the sky to be like a dome over the earth.
\q1 He scoops up the water from the ocean and \add puts it into clouds\add*,
\q2 and then empties \add the clouds\add* onto the earth.
\q2 His name is Yahweh.
\b
\q1
\v 7 And Yahweh says, “You people of Israel,
\q2 you are certainly [RHQ] \add now no more important to me\add* than the people of Ethiopia.
\q1 I brought your \add ancestors\add* here from Egypt,
\q2 but I also brought the people of Philistia from Crete \add Island\add*,
\q2 and I brought the people of Syria from the Kir \add region\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 8 I [SYN], Yahweh the Lord, have seen that you people in the kingdom \add of Israel\add* are very sinful,
\q2 so I will ◄destroy you/wipe you off the earth►.
\q1 But I will not get rid of all you descendants [MTY] of Jacob.
\q2 \add That is what will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it.
\b
\q1
\v 9 When I command it, \add it will be as though\add* I will shake you Israeli people \add who are living\add* in various nations,
\q2 like [MET] \add a farmer\add* shakes a sieve \add to separate\add* the stone pebbles \add from the grain\add*,
\q2 in order that they do not fall on the ground \add with the grain\add*.
\q1
\v 10 From among my people,
\q2 all you sinful people who say, ‘We will not experience disasters; nothing evil will happen to us,’
\q1 will be killed by \add their enemies'\add* swords.”
\s1 Yahweh promised to restore Israel
\q1
\v 11 “The kingdom \add over which King\add* David \add ruled has been destroyed, like\add* [MET] a house that collapsed and then became ruins.
\q2 But some day I will cause it to be a kingdom again.
\q1 I will cause it to prosper again
\q2 just like it did previously.
\q1
\v 12 When that happens, your \add armies\add* will seize/capture the remaining part of Edom \add region\add* again,
\q2 and they will also seize the other nations that previously belonged to me [MTY].
\q1 I, Yahweh, have said \add that I will do these things\add*,
\q2 and I will certainly cause them to happen.
\b
\p
\v 13 There will be a time \add when your crops will grow very well\add*:
\q1 very soon after the crops are harvested,
\q2 farmers will plow the ground \add to plant more crops in it again\add*,
\q1 and soon after the vineyards are planted,
\q2 \add farmers will harvest\add* grapes and tread on them \add to make wine\add*.
\q1 \add And because there will be very much\add* wine,
\q2 \add it will seem as though\add* wine is flowing down from the hills [DOU].
\q1
\v 14 I will cause you, my Israeli people, to prosper again.
\q2 You will rebuild your towns and live in them.
\q1 You will plant vineyards and then drink the wine \add made from the grapes that grows in them\add*.
\q1
\v 15 I will enable you to live [MET] in your land again,
\q2 the land that I gave to \add your ancestors\add*,
\q1 and never again will you be forced to leave it.
\q2 \add That is what will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it.”
