\c 3
\s1 Yahweh warned the Israeli people
\p
\v 1 “You people of Israel, I brought all your ancestors out of Egypt;
\q2 so listen to what I am saying about you.
\q1
\v 2 From all the people-groups on the earth,
\q2 I \add chose and\add* took care of only you.
\q1 That is the reason that I will punish you
\q2 for the sins that you have committed.”
\s1 The prophets' task
\q1
\v 3 Two people certainly cannot [RHQ] walk together
\q2 if they have not already agreed \add what place they will start walking from\add*.
\q1
\v 4 A lion certainly does not [RHQ] roar in the bushes/forest
\q2 if it has not killed another animal.
\q1 It does not [RHQ] growl in its den
\q2 if it is not eating \add the flesh of an animal that it has caught\add*.
\q1
\v 5 No one can [RHQ] catch a bird
\q2 if he does not set a trap for it.
\q1 A trap does not spring shut
\q2 when some animal has not sprung the trap.
\q1
\v 6 \add Similarly\add*, all the people in a city certainly [RHQ] become afraid
\q2 when \add they hear someone\add* blowing a trumpet
\q2 to signal \add that enemies are\add* attacking.
\q1 And when a city experiences disaster,
\q2 Yahweh is the one who has caused it [RHQ].
\b
\q1
\v 7 And whatever Yahweh plans to do,
\q2 he tells his prophets about it.
\b
\q1
\v 8 Everyone certainly becomes terrified [RHQ] when they hear a lion roar,
\q2 and if Yahweh the Lord has given messages \add to prophets like me\add*,
\q1 we certainly must [RHQ] proclaim those messages,
\q2 \add even if they cause people to become terrified\add*.
\s1 Yahweh will punish Samaria
\q1
\v 9 \add I said this to the leaders of Samaria\add* (OR, \add Yahweh said this to me\add*):
\q2 Send this message to the leaders [MET] in Ashdod \add city\add* and Egypt:
\q1 “Come to the hills of Samaria
\q2 and see the way \add that their ◄leaders/wealthy people►\add* are causing people in that city to be terrified,
\q2 and the way that they are causing the people to suffer!”
\b
\q1
\v 10 Yahweh says that the people there do not know how to do things that are right.
\q2 Their homes are filled with valuable things that they have stolen or taken violently from others.
\p
\v 11 So Yahweh our God says that \add soon\add* their enemies will come
\q2 and tear down their ◄defenses/high city walls►
\q2 and take away those valuable things.
\p
\v 12 Yahweh has declared this:
\q1 “When a lion attacks a sheep,
\q2 sometimes a shepherd will be able to snatch from the lion's mouth
\q2 only two legs or an ear of the sheep.
\q1 Similarly, only a few people from Samaria will escape,
\q2 and \add they will be able to rescue\add* only a part of a couch and a part of a bed.”
\b
\p
\v 13 The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels said this:
\q2 “Proclaim this message about the descendants [MTY] of Jacob:
\q1
\v 14 When I, Yahweh, punish \add the people of\add* Israel
\q2 because of the sins that they have committed,
\q1 I will cause the altars at Bethel \add town\add* to be destroyed;
\q2 even the projections at the corners of the altars will be cut off and fall to the ground.
\q1
\v 15 I will cause the houses \add that they live in during\add* the ◄winter/rainy season► and those \add in which they live during\add* the ◄summer/dry season► to be torn down.
\q2 Beautiful big houses and houses that are decorated with ivory and will be destroyed.
\q1 \add That will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it!”
