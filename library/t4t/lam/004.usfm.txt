\c 4
\s1 What happened when Jerusalem was destroyed
\q1
\v 1 \add Previously our people were like\add* [MET] pure gold,
\q2 but now they are worthless.
\q1 Like [MET] the sacred stones in the temple have been scattered,
\q2 \add our young men have been scattered\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 2 The young men of Jerusalem were as valuable as [MET] large amounts of gold,
\q2 but now people consider that they are as worthless as \add ordinary\add* clay pots.
\b
\q1
\v 3 Even the \add female\add* jackals/wolves feed their pups,
\q2 but my people act cruelly \add toward their children\add*;
\q1 they are like [SIM] ostriches in the desert \add that abandon their eggs\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 4 My people's infants' tongues cling to the roofs/tops of their mouths
\q2 \add because they are extremely thirsty\add*;
\q1 the children plead for some food,
\q2 but no one gives them any.
\b
\q1
\v 5 People who \add previously\add* ate fine food
\q2 are now starving in the streets;
\q1 those who previously lived luxuriously [MTY]
\q2 now paw/dig through rubbish heaps \add to find some food\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 6 \add The people of\add* Sodom were struck with a disaster very suddenly,
\q2 and there was no one to rescue them;
\q1 but my people have been punished
\q2 more severely than \add the people of\add* Sodom were punished.
\b
\q1
\v 7 Our leaders' \add behavior\add* was previously very pure,
\q2 whiter \add and brighter\add* than snow and milk;
\q1 their bodies were redder than red coral/stones;
\q2 they were very strong and healthy [MET].
\b
\q1
\v 8 But now their faces are blacker than soot,
\q2 and no one recognizes them in the streets.
\q1 Their skin has shriveled on their bones,
\q2 and it has become as dry as [SIM] a wooden stick.
\b
\q1
\v 9 It is better to die in a battle [MTY]
\q2 than to die of hunger.
\q1 There was no food to harvest in the fields,
\q2 so the people slowly starved until they died.
\b
\q1
\v 10 Women who \add usually/previously\add* acted very kindly
\q2 have \add killed and\add* cooked their own children;
\q1 they ate them \add when there was no other food\add*,
\q2 when Jerusalem was surrounded/destroyed \add by enemy soldiers\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 11 Yahweh has shown that he was extremely angry;
\q1 \add it is as though\add* he started/ignited a fire in Jerusalem
\q2 that burned everything to ashes.
\b
\q1
\v 12 None of the kings on the earth or anyone else
\q2 believed that any of our enemies could enter the gates of Jerusalem.
\q1
\v 13 But \add that is what happened\add*;
\q2 it happened because the prophets sinned;
\q1 and the priests also sinned
\q2 by causing innocent people to be executed [MTY].
\b
\q1
\v 14 The prophets and priests wandered through the streets
\q2 \add as though they were\add* blind.
\q1 No one would touch them
\q2 because their clothes were stained with the blood \add of people who had been killed\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 15 The people \add who were alive\add* shouted, “Stay away from us [DOU]! You are defiled/untouchable!
\q2 Do not touch us!”
\q1 So the prophets and priests fled \add from Israel\add*,
\q2 and they wandered around from one country to another,
\q2 because people \add in each country\add* kept saying to them, “You cannot stay here!”
\b
\q1
\v 16 It is Yahweh himself who has scattered them;
\q2 he no longer is concerned about them.
\q1 People do not respect our priests or leaders.
\b
\q1
\v 17 We [SYN] continued to look for someone to help us,
\q2 but it was useless.
\q1 We continued to watch to see if one of our allies would save us,
\q2 but none of the nations that we were waiting for could help us.
\b
\q1
\v 18 Our enemies were pursuing/tracking us,
\q2 so we could not even walk in our streets \add lest they seize us\add*.
\q1 We were about to be captured;
\q2 it was the time for us to be killed.
\b
\q1
\v 19 Those who pursued us were faster than eagles \add flying\add* in the sky.
\q1 Even if we fled to the mountains
\q2 or hid in the desert,
\q2 they \add went there ahead of us and\add* waited \add to attack\add* us.
\b
\q1
\v 20 \add Our king\add*, whom Yahweh appointed,
\q2 was the one who enabled us to remain alive [MTY];
\q1 he was the one whom we trusted that he would protect us [IDI]
\q2 from \add the armies of\add* other nations.
\q1 But he was \add captured\add*
\q2 \add like animals are\add* [MET] caught in a pit.
\b
\q1
\v 21 You people of [IDI] Edom and Uz,
\q2 you may be happy \add about what is happening to us now\add*,
\q1 but Yahweh will be punishing [MTY] you also.
\q2 You will become drunk and will be ashamed
\q2 because \add your enemies\add* will have stripped off your clothes.
\b
\q1
\v 22 You \add people of\add* [APO] Jerusalem,
\q2 the time of your being punished will end;
\q1 Yahweh will not allow you to continue to live in ◄exile/foreign countries►.
\q2 But \add you people of\add* [APO] Edom, Yahweh will punish you;
\q2 he will reveal the wicked things that you have done.
