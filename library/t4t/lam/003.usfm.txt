\c 3
\s1 Hope in the midst of distress
\q1
\v 1 I, \add the one who am writing this\add*, am a man who has been afflicted/punished [MTY] by Yahweh
\q2 because he was angry.
\q1
\v 2 \add It was as though\add* he caused me to walk in a very dark place
\q2 without any light at all.
\q1
\v 3 He has punished [IDI] me many times,
\q2 all during each day.
\b
\q1
\v 4 He has caused my skin and my flesh to become old.
\q2 He has broken my bones.
\q1
\v 5 He has surrounded me [DOU]
\q2 with bitterness and suffering.
\q1
\v 6 \add It is as though\add* he has buried me in a dark place
\q2 like [SIM] those who have been dead for a long time.
\b
\q1
\v 7 \add It is as though\add* [MET] he has built a wall around me,
\q2 and fastened/tied me with heavy chains,
\q2 and I cannot escape.
\q1
\v 8 Although I call out and cry out for him to help me,
\q2 he does not pay attention to my prayers.
\q1
\v 9 \add It is as though\add* he has blocked my path with a high stone wall
\q2 and has caused my path to become crooked.
\b
\q1
\v 10 He has waited to attack me
\q2 like [SIM] a bear or a lion hides and waits \add to attack other animals\add*.
\q1
\v 11 \add It is as though\add* he has dragged me off the path and ◄mauled me/torn me into pieces►,
\q2 and left me without help.
\q1
\v 12 \add It is as though\add* [MET] he bent his bow and caused me to become the target
\q2 \add at which he shot\add* his arrows.
\b
\q1
\v 13 \add It is as though\add* he shot his arrows deep into my body.
\q1
\v 14 All my relatives laugh at me;
\q2 all during each day they sing songs that make fun of me.
\q1
\v 15 He has filled me with ◄bitterness/great suffering►,
\q2 like [MET] someone who drinks a very bitter liquid suffers.
\b
\q1
\v 16 \add It is as though\add* he has caused me to chew gravel that broke my teeth,
\q2 and he has trampled me in the dirt.
\q1
\v 17 Things no longer go well for me;
\q2 I no longer remember being prosperous.
\q1
\v 18 I continued to say to myself, “I no longer expect to live much longer;
\q2 I no longer confidently expect \add to receive good things\add* from Yahweh!”
\b
\q1
\v 19 When I think about my suffering and my wandering \add away from home\add*,
\q2 it is like \add drinking\add* a very bitter [DOU] liquid.
\q1
\v 20 I will never forget this time
\q2 when I feel very depressed/discouraged [IDI].
\q1
\v 21 However, I confidently expect \add Yahweh to do good things for me again\add*
\q2 when I think about this:
\q1
\v 22 Yahweh never stops faithfully loving us,
\q2 and he never stops acting kindly toward us.
\q1
\v 23 \add He is the one whom we can\add* always trust/lean on.
\q2 Every morning he acts mercifully toward us again.
\q1
\v 24 So I say to myself, “Yahweh is all that I need;
\q2 so I will confidently wait \add for him to do good things for me\add*.”
\b
\q1
\v 25 Yahweh is good to all those who depend on him,
\q2 to those who seek his \add help\add*.
\q1
\v 26 So it is good for us to wait quietly
\q2 for Yahweh to save/rescue us.
\q1
\v 27 And it is good for us to patiently endure \add suffering\add*
\q2 while we are young.
\b
\q1
\v 28 Those \add who seek his help\add* should sit by themselves, silently,
\q2 knowing that it is Yahweh who has allowed/caused them to suffer.
\q1
\v 29 They should lie in the dirt, with their faces on the ground,
\q2 because they can still hope \add that Yahweh will help them\add*.
\q1
\v 30 If someone strikes us on one cheek,
\q2 we should turn the other cheek toward that person \add in order that he may strike it, too\add*,
\q2 and accept/endure it when we are insulted.
\b
\q1
\v 31 Yahweh does not abandon us his people forever.
\q1
\v 32 Sometimes he causes us to suffer,
\q2 but sometimes he acts kindly \add toward us\add*
\q1 because he continually and faithfully loves us.
\q1
\v 33 And he is not happy about causing human beings to suffer
\q2 or be sad.
\b
\q1
\v 34 If people ◄mistreat all the prisoners/crush all the prisoners under their feet►
\q1
\v 35 or if they rebel against God
\q2 by refusing to give to people the things that it is right for them to receive,
\q1
\v 36 or if they cause judges to decide matters unjustly,
\q2 ◄does Yahweh not see all those things?/Yahweh certainly sees all those things!► [RHQ]
\b
\q1
\v 37 No one can [RHQ] command something to happen \add and then cause it to happen\add*
\q2 if Yahweh has not already decided that it should happen.
\q1
\v 38 God in heaven [MTY] is [RHQ] the one who causes disasters to happen,
\q2 and he also causes good things to happen.
\q1
\v 39 So it is certainly not [RHQ] right for us, who are only humans, to complain
\q2 when he punishes us for the sins that we have committed.
\b
\q1
\v 40 Instead, we should ◄examine/think carefully about► our behavior;
\q2 we should turn back to Yahweh.
\q1
\v 41 We should pray with [IDI] all our inner beings and lift up our arms
\q2 toward God in heaven, and say,
\q1
\v 42 “We have sinned and rebelled against you,
\q2 and you have not forgiven us.
\q1
\v 43 You have surrounded us with your anger and pursued us;
\q2 you have slaughtered us without pitying us.
\q1
\v 44 You have hidden yourself in a cloud,
\q2 with the result that you do not hear us when we pray.
\q1
\v 45 You have caused \add the people of other\add* nations to consider us
\q2 to be only garbage [DOU].
\b
\q1
\v 46 All our enemies have spoken things to insult us.
\q1
\v 47 We are constantly afraid [DOU],
\q2 because we have experienced disasters and ruin [DOU].”
\q1
\v 48 Many tears flow from my eyes
\q2 because my people have been destroyed.
\q1
\v 49 My tears continually flow;
\q2 they will not stop
\q1
\v 50 until Yahweh looks down from heaven and sees us.
\q1
\v 51 I am very grieved
\q2 because of \add what has happened to\add* the women of my city.
\b
\q1
\v 52 Those who are my enemies hunted for me
\q2 like [SIM] \add people hunt for\add* a bird \add to kill it\add*
\q1 even though there was no reason \add for them to do that\add*.
\q1
\v 53 They threw me into a pit to kill me,
\q2 and they threw stones on top of me.
\q1
\v 54 The water \add in the pit\add* rose above my head,
\q2 and I said to myself, “I am about to die/drown!”
\b
\q1
\v 55 But from the bottom of the pit I cried out to you [MTY],
\q2 “Yahweh, \add help me\add*!”
\q1
\v 56 I pleaded with you,
\q2 “Do not refuse to heed [MTY] me while I cry out to you!”
\q1
\v 57 Then you answered me
\q2 and said, “Do not be afraid!”
\b
\q1
\v 58 Yahweh, you defended me;
\q2 you did not allow me to die.
\q1
\v 59 Now, Yahweh, you have seen the evil things that my enemies have done to me,
\q2 so decide my case and show that I am right!
\q1
\v 60 You know the evil things
\q2 that they have planned to do to me.
\q1
\v 61 Yahweh, you have heard them insult me
\q2 and what they have planned to do to me.
\q1
\v 62 Every day they whisper and mutter things about me,
\q2 all during the day.
\q1
\v 63 Look at them! Whether they are standing or sitting
\q2 they make fun of me by the songs that they sing.
\b
\q1
\v 64 Yahweh, cause them to suffer
\q2 in return for their causing me to suffer!
\q1
\v 65 Curse them [IDI]
\q2 for their being very stubborn [IDI].
\q1
\v 66 Because you are angry with them, pursue them and get rid of them,
\q2 \add until none of them remain\add* on the earth.
