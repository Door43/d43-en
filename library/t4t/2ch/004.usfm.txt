\s1 The furnishings for the temple
\p
\v 1 Solomon's workers made a square bronze altar that was ◄30 ft./9 meters► on each side, and it was ◄15 ft./4.5 meters► high.
\v 2 They also made a very large round tank/basin that was made of metal and cast \add in a clay mold\add*. It was ◄30 ft./9 meters► wide/across, and ◄15 ft./4.5 meters► high. It was ◄45 ft./13.5► meters around it.
\v 3 Below the outer rim there were two rows of \add small figures of\add* bulls that were part of the metal of the basin. Each row had 300 figures of bulls.
\p
\v 4 The basin was set on twelve \add statues of\add* bulls. There were three statues that faced north, three that faced west, three that faced south, and three that faced east.
\v 5 The sides of the tank were ◄3 in./8 cm.► thick, and its rim was shaped like a cup that curved outward like [SIM] the petals of flowers. The basin held about ◄16,500 gallons/63,000 liters► \add of water\add*.
\p
\v 6 They also made ten basins for washing \add the animals\add* that were to be sacrificed. The priests used the very large tank for washing themselves.
\p
\v 7 They also made ten gold lampstands according to what Solomon had instructed them. They put them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north side.
\p
\v 8 They made ten tables and put them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north side. They also made a hundred gold bowls.
\p
\v 9 They also constructed one courtyard for the priests, and a larger courtyard \add for the other people\add*. They made doors for the courtyards and covered them with \add thin sheets of\add* bronze.
\v 10 They placed the very large tank \add on the south side of the temple\add*, at the southeast corner.
\p
\v 11 They also made pots and shovels \add for the ashes of the altar\add*, and other small bowls.
\b
\p So Huram \add and his workers\add* finished the work that King Solomon had given him to do at the temple of God.
\v 12 \add These were the things that they made\add*:
\li1 the two large pillars
\li1 the two bowl-shaped tops/heads on top of the pillars
\li the two sets of carvings that resembled chains to decorate the tops of the two pillars
\li1
\v 13 the four hundred carvings that resembled pomegranates that were placed in two rows, that decorated the bowl-shaped tops of the two pillars
\li1
\v 14 the stands, and the basins that were placed on them
\li1
\v 15 the very large tank, and the \add statues of\add* twelve bulls underneath it
\li1
\v 16 the pots, shovels; meat forks, and all the other things \add needed for the work at the altar\add*.
\p All those things that Huram \add and his workers\add* made for King Solomon were made of polished bronze.
\v 17 They made them by pouring melted bronze into the clay molds that Huram had set up near the Jordan \add river\add* between Succoth and Zarethan \add cities\add*.
\v 18 All of those things that Solomon \add told them to\add* make used a very large amount of bronze; no one tried to weigh it all.
\p
\v 19 Solomon's workers also made all these things that were put at the temple:
\li1 the golden altar
\li1 the tables on which the priests put the sacred bread that
\li1
\v 20 the pure gold lampstands and the pure gold lamps, \add in which the priests put oil\add* to burn in front of the Most Holy Place as God had told \add Moses that the priests should do\add*
\li1
\v 21 the pure gold decorations that resembled flowers, and the lamps and tongs
\li1
\v 22 the pure gold wick trimmers and bowls for sprinkling, and dishes and lamp snuffers
\li the gold doors of the temple
\li the doors to the main hall.
