\c 11
\p
\v 1 When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he gathered 180,000 of the best soldiers from the tribes [MTY] of Judah and Benjamin. He wanted them to fight against \add the northern tribes of\add* Israel \add and defeat them\add*, in order that he could \add rule all the tribes of\add* his kingdom again.
\p
\v 2 But Yahweh spoke to the prophet Shemaiah and said this to him:
\v 3 “Go and tell this to \add Solomon's son\add* Rehoboam, the king of Judah, and to all the Israeli people of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin:
\v 4 ‘Yahweh says that you must not go to fight against \add the people of Israel; it is as though they are\add* your own relatives. All of you must go home. What has happened is what Yahweh wanted to happen.’~” \add So Shemaiah went and told that to them\add*, and they all heeded what Yahweh had commanded them to do, and they did not attack Jeroboam \add and his soldiers\add*.
\s1 Rehoboam fortified cities in Judah
\p
\v 5 Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and his workers built walls around several of the cities and towns in Judah to protect them \add against enemy attacks\add*.
\v 6 In \add the area that belonged to\add* the tribes of Judah and Benjamin they built walls around Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,
\v 7 Beth-Zur, Soco, Adullam,
\v 8 Gath, Mareshah,
\v 9 Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,
\v 10 Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron.
\v 11 He also appointed an army commander in each of those cities and towns, and gave them supplies of food, olive oil, and wine.
\v 12 He put shields and spears in all the cities and made them well-protected. So he continued to control/rule the tribes of Judah and Benjamin.
\p
\v 13 The priests and other descendants of Levi throughout Israel ◄supported Rehoboam/were happy that Rehoboam was their king►.
\v 14 The descendants of Levi abandoned their property and their pastureland, and they came to Jerusalem and \add to other places in\add* Judah, because Jeroboam and his sons would not allow them to do the work of priests of Yahweh.
\v 15 Instead, Jeroboam appointed the priests that he wanted to work \add at the altars he commanded to be built\add* on the hilltops, \add to offer sacrifices to\add* the idols that he commanded to be made \add that resembled\add* goats and calves.
\v 16 And people from every tribe in Israel who wanted to worship Yahweh, the God to whom the Israelis belonged, went with the descendants of Levi to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices to Yahweh, the God whom their ancestors \add worshiped\add*.
\v 17 They caused the kingdom of Judah to be strong, and for three years they were happy that Solomon's son Rehoboam was the king. During that time they conducted their lives \add righteously\add* as David and Solomon had done previously.
\s1 Rehoboam's family
\p
\v 18 Rehoboam married Mahalath. She was the daughter of David's son Jerimoth, and her mother was Abihail, the daughter of Eliab and granddaughter of Jesse.
\v 19 Rehoboam and Mahalath had three sons: Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham.
\v 20 Later Rehoboam married Maacah, the daughter of Absalom, and they had four sons: Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith.
\v 21 Rehoboam loved Maacah more than he loved any other of his wives and slave wives. Altogether he had 18 wives and 60 slave wives, and 28 sons and 60 daughters.
\p
\v 22 Rehoboam appointed his son Abijah to be the leader of his \add older and younger\add* brothers, because he wanted to appoint Abijah to be the next king.
\v 23 He very wisely sent some of his other sons to other cities in the areas of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, and to other cities that had walls around them. He gave them plenty of supplies and many wives.
