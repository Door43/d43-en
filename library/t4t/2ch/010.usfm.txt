\c 10
\s1 The people of Israel rebelled against Rehoboam
\p
\v 1 All [HYP] the people of \add northern\add* Israel went to Shechem \add city\add* in order to appoint Rehoboam to be their king. So Rehoboam also went there.
\v 2 Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, had fled to Egypt \add to escape\add* from King Solomon. But when he heard about \add the people wanting to appoint Rehoboam to be their king\add*, he returned from Egypt \add to Israel\add*.
\v 3 So the \add leaders of the northern tribes\add* summoned him, and he went with them \add to talk\add* to Rehoboam. They said to him,
\v 4 “Your father \add Solomon\add* forced us to work very hard [MET] for him. If you ◄lighten these loads/do not force us to work that hard►, and if you charge us less taxes than we were paying to him, we will serve you \add faithfully\add*.”
\p
\v 5 He replied, “Come back three days from now \add and I will give you my answer\add*.” So those leaders \add and Jeroboam\add* left.
\p
\v 6 Then King Rehoboam consulted his older men who had advised his father Solomon while he was still alive. He asked them, “What shall I say to answer these men?”
\p
\v 7 They replied, “If you will be kind to these people and do things that will please them, and if you say kind things to them when you answer them, they will always serve you.”
\p
\v 8 But he ignored what the older men advised him to do. Instead, he consulted the younger men who had grown up with him, who were now ◄his advisors/the ones who told him what would be good to do►.
\v 9 He said to them, “What do you say that I should answer the men who are asking me to reduce the \add work and taxes\add* that my father required from them?”
\p
\v 10 The young men who had grown up with him replied, “\add Those men\add* have said that your father forced them to work very hard for him [MET], so they want you to reduce the \add work and taxes\add* that your father required from them. But this is what you should tell them: ‘My little finger is thicker than my father's waist.
\v 11 What I mean is that my father required you to \add work hard and pay high taxes\add*. But I will make those loads heavier. \add It was as though\add* my father whipped you, but I will whip you with whips that have pieces of metal in them.’~”
\p
\v 12 Three days later, Jeroboam and all the leaders came to King Rehoboam again, which is what he had told them to do.
\v 13 The king ignored the advice of the older men and spoke harshly to the Israeli leaders.
\v 14 \add He told them what the younger men had advised\add*. He said, “My father put heavy burdens \add of work and taxes\add* on you, but I will put heavier burdens on you. \add It was as though\add* he beat you with whips, but I will beat you with whips that have pieces of metal in them!”
\v 15 So the king did not pay any attention to the Israeli leaders. But this happened in order that what Yahweh wanted would occur, what he had told the prophet Ahijah about Jeroboam \add becoming king of the ten tribes\add*.
\p
\v 16 When the Israeli leaders realized that the king did not pay any attention to what they said, they shouted,
\q1 “We do not [RHQ] want anything to do with this descendant of King David!
\q2 We will not pay attention to what this grandson of Jesse says!
\q1 You people of Israel, let's go home!
\q2 As for this descendant [MTY] of David, he can rule his own kingdom [MTY]!”
\m So the Israeli leaders returned to their homes.
\p
\v 17 And \add after that, the only Israeli\add* people whom Rehoboam ruled over were those who lived in the territory of \add the tribe of\add* Judah.
\p
\v 18 Then King Rehoboam went with Adoniram \add to talk to the Israeli people\add*. Adoniram was the man who supervised \add all the men who were\add* forced to work \add for Rehoboam\add*. But the Israeli people killed him by throwing stones at him. When that happened, King Rehoboam quickly got in his chariot and escaped to Jerusalem.
\v 19 Ever since that time, \add the people of the northern tribes of\add* Israel have been rebelling against the descendants [MTY] of \add King\add* David.
