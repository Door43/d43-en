\s1 The reforms that Asa introduced
\p
\v 1 The Spirit of God came upon Azariah, the son of Obed.
\v 2 Azariah went to talk with Asa, and said to him, “Asa and all \add you men of the tribes of\add* Judah and Benjamin, listen to me. Yahweh is with you whenever you are ◄with/trusting in► him. If you request him \add to help you\add*, he will help you, but if you abandon him, he will abandon you.
\v 3 For many years the Israeli people did not have/know the true God, and they did not have priests or God's laws.
\v 4 But when they experienced trouble, they turned to Yahweh our God, and requested him to help them. And he helped them.
\v 5 At that time, people were not safe when they traveled, because all the people who lived in those countries were experiencing many difficulties.
\v 6 The people of various nations were crushed by \add armies of\add* other nations, and people in some cities were crushed by \add armies from\add* other cities, because God was allowing them to experience many difficulties.
\v 7 But you people, you must be strong and do not become discouraged, because \add God\add* will reward you for what you do \add to please\add* him.”
\p
\v 8 When Asa heard what the prophet Azariah prophesied/said, he was encouraged. He \add commanded his workers\add* to remove all the detestable idols from everywhere in the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, and from the towns that \add his soldiers\add* had captured in the hills of the tribe of Ephraim. Asa's workers repaired the altar where \add people offered sacrifices to\add* Yahweh that was front of the entrance to the temple \add in Jerusalem\add*.
\v 9 Then he gathered all \add the people of the tribes of\add* Judah and Benjamin and many people from the tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon who were living among them. He \add was able to do that\add* because many people from \add those tribes in\add* Israel had come to Judah/Jerusalem when they realized that Yahweh, the God that Asa \add worshiped\add*, was with/helping him.
\p
\v 10 After Asa had been ruling for almost fifteen years, in ◄the third month/May► of that year, those people gathered in Jerusalem.
\v 11 At that time they sacrificed to Yahweh 700 bulls and 7,000 sheep and goats, from the animals that they had captured \add when they defeated the army of Ethiopia/Sudan\add*.
\v 12 They solemnly made an agreement to very sincerely [IDI] worship Yahweh, the God whom our ancestors \add worshiped\add*.
\v 13 They promised to execute/kill all those who would not worship Yahweh, including those who were important and who were not important, both men and women.
\v 14 They shouted and blew trumpets and other horns while they solemnly promised to do that.
\v 15 All the people who were living in Judah were happy to promise to do that because they had solemnly promised to do it very sincerely [IDI]. They eagerly sought/requested help from Yahweh, and he helped them. So he enabled them to have peace throughout their country.
\p
\v 16 King Asa's grandmother Maacah had made a disgusting pole for \add worshiping the goddess\add* Asherah. So Asa \add commanded his workers to\add* cut down that pole and chop it into pieces and burn it in the Kidron Valley. He then did not allow Maacah to continue to \add influence the people because of her being\add* the mother of the previous king.
\v 17 Although Asa's workers did not get rid of the shrines on the hilltops in Israel, he [SYN] was very determined to do \add what pleased\add* Yahweh all during the years that he was alive.
\v 18 He \add ordered his workers to\add* bring into God's temple all the silver and gold and other valuable items that he and his father had dedicated \add to God\add*.
\p
\v 19 There were no more wars \add in Judah\add* until Asa had been ruling Judah almost 35 years.
