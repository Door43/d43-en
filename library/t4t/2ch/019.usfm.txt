\c 19
\p
\v 1 When King Jehoshaphat returned safely to his palace in Jerusalem,
\v 2 the prophet Jehu, the son of \add the prophet\add* Hanani, went out of the city to meet the king, and said to him, “It was not right [RHQ] for you to help a wicked man and to love those who hate Yahweh. Because of what you have done, Yahweh is angry with you.
\v 3 But you have done some good things; you got rid of the poles in this country \add for worshiping the goddess\add* Asherah, and you have ◄strongly determined/wanted very much► [IDI] to do what pleases God.”
\s1 Jehoshaphat appointed men to settle disputes
\p
\v 4 Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem. But \add one time\add*, like he had done once previously, he went out among all the people in the country, from Beersheba \add city in the far south\add* to the hilly area of \add the tribe of\add* Ephraim \add in the far north\add*, and he convinced them to return to \add worshiping\add* Yahweh, the God whom their ancestors \add worshiped\add*.
\v 5 He appointed judges throughout Judah, in each of the cities that had walls around them.
\v 6 He told them, “Make your decisions carefully, because you are judging cases not \add in order to please\add* people but to \add please\add* Yahweh. And he will be watching you whenever you make a decision.
\v 7 So now revere Yahweh, and judge cases carefully, and \add do not forget that\add* Yahweh our God never acts unjustly, and he never does what people want because of their offering him money, and he never accepts bribes.”
\p
\v 8 In Jerusalem also, Jehoshaphat appointed some priests and other descendants of Levi and some leaders of Israeli families \add to be judges\add*. He told them to do what Yahweh's laws said was right when they settled disputes. Those men lived in Jerusalem.
\v 9 He told them this: “You must always do your work faithfully, revering Yahweh.
\v 10 In every dispute that your fellow Israelis who live in the cities want you to settle, you must warn them to not sin against Yahweh \add by telling lies during the trial\add*. If you do not warn them, God will punish [MTY] both you and their fellow Israelis. If you warn them, you will not be sinning. You must warn them whether \add someone has accused them of\add* murdering someone [MTY], or of disobeying some other law or command or decree \add of Yahweh\add*.
\p
\v 11 Amariah the Supreme priest will supervise you in any matter that Yahweh is concerned about, and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the leader of the tribe of Judah, will supervise you in any matter that I am concerned about. And the descendants of Levi will assist you. Act courageously, and I pray that Yahweh will help those who do their work well.”
