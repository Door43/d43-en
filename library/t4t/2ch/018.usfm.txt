\s1 The prophet Micaiah warned King Ahab of Israel
\p
\v 1 Jehoshaphat became very wealthy and was greatly honored. But then he arranged for one of his family to marry someone from the family of King Ahab \add of Israel\add*.
\v 2 Several years later, he went down \add from Jerusalem\add* to Samaria to visit Ahab. Ahab \add welcomed\add* him and the people who had come with him by slaughtering many sheep and cattle \add for a feast\add*.
\v 3 Then he asked Jehoshaphat, “Will you \add and your army\add* go with my army to attack Ramoth \add city\add* in the Gilead \add region\add*?” Jehoshaphat replied, “My soldiers and I will go to the battle when you tell us to go.”
\v 4 Then he added, “But we should ask Yahweh first, to find out what he wants us to do.”
\p
\v 5 So the king of Israel gathered all his 400 prophets, and asked them, “Should we go to fight/attack the people of Ramoth \add city\add*, or should we not do that?”
\p They replied, “Yes, go \add and attack them\add* because God will enable your army to defeat [IDI] them.”
\p
\v 6 But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there no prophet of Yahweh here whom we can ask?”
\p
\v 7 The king of Israel replied, “There is still one man here, whom we can ask to find out what Yahweh wants, His name is Micaiah, the son of Imlah. But I hate him because he never says that anything good about me. He always predicts that bad \add things will happen to me\add*.”
\p Jehoshaphat replied, “King Ahab, you should not say that!”
\p
\v 8 So the king of Israel told one of his officials to summon Micaiah immediately.
\p
\v 9 The king of Israel and the king of Judah were sitting there on their thrones, wearing their ◄royal robes/robes that showed that they were kings► They were at the place where people threshed grain, near the gate of Samaria \add city\add*. All of \add Ahab's\add* prophets were standing in front of them, ◄prophesying/predicting that was going to happen►.
\p
\v 10 \add One of them whose name was\add* Zedekiah, the son of Kenaanah, had made from iron something that resembled the horns of a bull. He proclaimed to Ahab, “This is what Yahweh says: ‘With horns \add like these\add*, your \add army\add* will keep attacking the army of Syria like \add a bull attacks another animal\add* [MET], until you completely destroy them.’~”
\v 11 All the other prophets \add of Ahab\add* agreed. They said, “Yes! If you attack Ramoth \add city\add* in the Gilead \add region\add*, you will be successful, because Yahweh will enable you to defeat them [IDI].”
\p
\v 12 The messenger who went to summon Micaiah said to him, “Listen to me! All the other prophets are unitedly predicting/prophesying that the king will be successful \add in the battle\add*. So be sure to agree with them, and say ◄what is favorable/that the king's army will be successful►!”
\p
\v 13 But Micaiah said, “As surely as Yahweh lives, I will tell him only what he tells me to say.”
\p
\v 14 When Micaiah arrived, the king \add of Israel\add* asked him, “Should we go to attack Ramoth, or not?”
\p Micaiah replied, “Sure, go! Yahweh will enable your army to defeat them [IDI]!”
\p
\v 15 But King Ahab \add realized that Micaiah was ◄lying/being sarcastic►\add*, so he said to Micaiah, “I have told you [RHQ] many times that you must always tell only the truth when you say what Yahweh \add has revealed to you\add*!”
\p
\v 16 Then Micaiah replied, \add “The truth is that in a vision\add* I saw all the troops of Israel scattered on the mountains. They seemed to be like sheep that did not have a shepherd. And Yahweh said, ‘Their master has been killed [EUP]. So tell them all to go home peacefully.’~”
\p
\v 17 Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “I told you [RHQ] that he never predicts/prophesies that anything good will happen to me! He \add always\add* predicts that bad things will happen to me.”
\p
\v 18 But Micaiah continued, saying, “Listen to what Yahweh showed to me! \add In a vision\add* I saw Yahweh sitting on his throne, with all the armies of heaven \add standing around him\add*, on his right side and on his left side.
\v 19 And Yahweh said, ‘Who can persuade Ahab, the king of Israel, to go to fight against the people of Ramoth, in order that he may be killed there?’
\p Some suggested one thing, and others suggested something else.
\p
\v 20 Finally one spirit, \add having received a message from Satan\add*, came to Yahweh and said, ‘I can do it!’
\p Yahweh asked him, ‘How will you do it?’
\p
\v 21 The spirit replied, ‘I will go and inspire all of Ahab's prophets to tell lies.’ Yahweh said, ‘You will be successful; go and do it!’
\p
\v 22 So now \add I tell you that\add* Yahweh has caused your prophets to lie to you. Yahweh has decided that something terrible will happen to you~”.
\p
\v 23 Then Zedekiah walked over to Micaiah and slapped him on his face. He said, “Do you think that [RHQ] Yahweh's Spirit left me in order to speak to you?”
\p
\v 24 Micaiah replied, “You will find out for yourself \add to which of us Yahweh's Spirit has truly spoken\add* on the day when you go into a room of some house to hide \add from the Syrian soldiers\add*!”
\p
\v 25 King Ahab commanded \add his soldiers\add*, “Seize Micaiah and take him to Amon, the governor of this city, and to my son Joash.
\v 26 Tell them that I have commanded that they should put this man in prison and give him only bread and water. Do not give him anything else to eat until I return safely \add from the battle\add*!”
\p
\v 27 Micaiah replied, “If you return safely, \add it will be clear that\add* it was not Yahweh who told me what to say to you!” Then he said \add to all those who were standing there\add*, “Do not forget what I have said \add to King Ahab\add*!”
\s1 Ahab died in the battle at Ramoth-Gilead
\p
\v 28 So the king of Israel and the king of Judah \add led their armies\add* to Ramoth, in the Gilead \add region\add*.
\v 29 King Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “I will put on different clothes, \add in order that no one will recognize that I am the king\add*. But you should wear your ◄royal robe/robe that shows that you are a king►.” So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they both went into the battle.
\p
\v 30 The King of Syria told his soldiers who were driving the chariots, “Attack only the king of Israel!”
\v 31 So when the soldiers who were driving the Syrian chariots saw Jehoshaphat \add wearing the ◄royal robes/clothes that showed that he was a king►\add*, they thought “He must be the king of Israel!”
\v 32 So they turned to attack him. But when Jehoshaphat cried out, Yahweh helped him, and they realized that he was not the king of Israel. And God caused them to stop pursuing him.
\p
\v 33 But one \add Syrian\add* soldier shot an arrow at Ahab, without knowing that it was Ahab. The arrow struck Ahab between the places where the parts of his armor joined together. Ahab told the driver of his chariot, “Turn the chariot around and take me out of here! I have been \add severely\add* wounded!”
\v 34 The battle continued all the day. Ahab was sitting propped up in his chariot, facing the Syrian soldiers. And late in the afternoon, when the sun was setting, he died.
