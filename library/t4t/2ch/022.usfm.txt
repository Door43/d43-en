\c 22
\s1 King Ahaziah of Judah
\p
\v 1 The people of Jerusalem appointed Jehoram's youngest son Ahaziah to be their king, because the men \add from Philistia\add* who had invaded Judah with some Arabs had killed all of Jehoram's other sons. So Ahaziah started to rule Judah.
\p
\v 2 Ahaziah was 22 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for one year. His mother's name was Athaliah, a granddaughter of \add King\add* Omri \add of Israel\add*.
\p
\v 3 King Ahab conducted his life just like the members of Ahab's family had done, because his mother encouraged him to do things that are wrong/evil.
\v 4 He did things that Yahweh says are evil, like the descendants of Ahab had done, because after Ahaziah's father died, they became his advisors. And Ahaziah died as a result of heeding their bad advice.
\v 5 He also did what they advised when he went with Joram, the son of King Ahab of Israel, to fight against the army of Hazael, the king of Syria, at Ramoth-Gilead.
\p
\v 6 Then King Ahaziah went down to Jezreel \add city\add* to see Joram, the son of \add King\add* Ahab, because he had been wounded.
\p
\v 7 God caused Ahaziah to die as a result of his going to visit Joram. When Ahaziah arrived, he went with Joram to meet Jehu, the son of Nimshi, whom Yahweh had appointed to kill all the descendants [MTY] of Ahab.
\v 8 While Jehu \add and the men who were with him\add* were killing the descendants [MTY] of Ahab, they found the leaders of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah's relatives who had been working for Ahaziah, and they killed all of them.
\v 9 Then Jehu went to find Ahaziah, and his soldiers found Ahaziah while he was hiding in Samaria \add city\add*. They brought him to Jehu and executed him. Then they buried his corpse, because they said, “\add He deserves to be buried, because\add* he was a descendant of Jehoshaphat, who tried hard to please Yahweh.” There were no descendants [MTY] of Ahaziah who were powerful enough to become the kings of Judah.
\s1 Athaliah and Joash
\p
\v 10 When Athaliah, the mother of Ahaziah, saw that her son had been killed, she commanded that all the members of Ahaziah's family \add who might become king\add* must be executed.
\v 11 But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Jehoram, took Joash, Ahaziah's very young son, away from the other sons of the king who were about to be murdered, and she hid him and ◄his nursemaid/the woman who took care of his► in a bedroom in the temple. Because Jehosheba, who was the daughter of King Jehoram and the wife of the Supreme Priest Jehoiada, was Ahaziah's sister, she was able to hide the child, with the result that Athaliah could not kill him.
\v 12 He remained hidden there for six years while Athaliah ruled \add Judah\add*.
