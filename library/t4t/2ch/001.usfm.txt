\s1 Solomon prayed for wisdom
\p
\v 1 David's son \add King\add* Solomon was able to gain complete control over his kingdom, because Yahweh his God ◄was with/helped► him and enabled him to become very great.
\p
\v 2-5 When David \add was king, he arranged for a new\add* Sacred Tent to be made in Jerusalem. Then David \add and the Israeli leaders\add* brought God's Sacred Chest from Kiriath-Jearim \add city\add* to the new Sacred Tent in Jerusalem that he had prepared for it. But \add when Solomon became the king\add*, the first Sacred Tent was still at Gibeon \add city\add*. That was the tent that Moses, the man who served God \add well\add*, had \add arranged\add* to be made in the desert. And the bronze altar that Bezalel, the son of Uri and grandson of Hur, had made was also still in Gibeon, in front of the first Sacred Tent.
\p \add One day\add* Solomon summoned the army commanders of 1,000 soldiers and the commanders of 100 soldiers and the judges and all the other leaders in Israel. He told them to go with him to Gibeon. So they all went to a hill in Gibeon \add where the Sacred Tent was\add*, and Solomon and all the others with him worshiped Yahweh there.
\v 6 Then Solomon went up to the bronze altar in front of the Sacred Tent, and he offered a thousand animals to be \add killed and\add* completely burned \add on the altar\add*.
\p
\v 7 That night God appeared to Solomon \add in a dream\add* and said to him, “Request whatever you want me to give to you.”
\p
\v 8 Solomon replied to God, “You were very kind to David my father, and now you have appointed me to be the king to succeed him.
\v 9 So Yahweh my God, you have caused me to become the king to rule people who are as many as [HYP] the grains/particles of dirt on the earth. So do what you promised to my father David.
\v 10 Please enable me to be wise and to know \add what I should do\add*, in order that I may rule these people \add well\add*, because there is no one [RHQ] who can rule all this great nation of yours \add without your help\add*.”
\p
\v 11 God replied to Solomon, “That is what you desire; you have not requested a huge amount of money [DOU] or to be honored or that your enemies be killed. And you have not requested that you be enabled to live for ◄a long time/many years►. Instead, you have requested that \add I enable\add* you to be wise and to know \add what you should do\add* in order that you may govern \add well\add* my people whom I have appointed you to rule.
\v 12 Therefore I will enable you to be wise and to know \add what you should do to rule my people well\add*. But I will also enable you to have a huge amount of money [DOU] and to be honored, more than anyone who was previously a king ever was honored, more than anyone who later becomes king will be honored.”
\v 13 Then Solomon \add and the people who were with him\add* all left from being in front of he Sacred Tent \add on the hill in Gibeon\add*, and they returned to Jerusalem. There he ruled the Israeli people.
\s1 Solomon's wealth
\p
\v 14 Solomon acquired 1,400 chariots and 12,000 men who rode \add on horses\add*. He put some of the chariots and horses in Jerusalem, and put some of them in various other cities.
\v 15 During the years that Solomon was king, silver and gold were as common in Jerusalem as [SIM] stones, and \add lumber from\add* cedar trees were as plentiful as [SIM] \add lumber from\add* ordinary sycamore trees in the foothills.
\v 16 Solomon's horses were imported/brought from Egypt and from the Kue \add region in Turkey\add*.
\v 17 In Egypt his men paid ◄15 pounds/7 kg.► of silver for each chariot and ◄3-3/4 pounds/1.7 kg.► of silver for each horse. They also exported/sold many of them to the kings of the Heth and Aram people-groups.
