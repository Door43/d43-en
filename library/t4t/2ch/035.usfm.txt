\s1 Josiah led them in celebrating the Passover
\p
\v 1 Josiah \add commanded that the people should\add* celebrate the Passover festival in Jerusalem. So they slaughtered the lambs for the Passover at the end of March.
\v 2 Josiah assigned to the priests to the tasks that they should perform at the temple, and encouraged them do their work well.
\v 3 The descendants of Levi were the ones who taught all the Israeli people; they had been ◄set apart for/dedicated to► Yahweh. Josiah said to them, “Put the Sacred Chest in the temple that \add the workers of\add* David's son \add King\add* Solomon of Israel built. But \add carry it on poles\add*; do not carry it on your shoulders. And do well your work for Yahweh your God and for his Israeli people.
\v 4 Divide yourselves into clans, obeying the instructions that King David and his son Solomon wrote.
\p
\v 5 Then stand in the temple, with one group of the descendants of Levi to help each ◄clan/family group► of the people \add when they bring their offerings to the temple\add*.
\v 6 Slaughter the lambs for the Passover. Perform the rituals to cause yourselves to be acceptable to Yahweh for doing this work. Prepare the sacrifices, doing what Yahweh told Moses to tell you that you should do.”
\p
\v 7 Josiah provided \add from his own flocks and herds\add* 30,000 sheep and goats for the Passover sacrifices.
\p
\v 8 His officials also voluntarily contributed animals for the people and the priests and the other descendants of Levi. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the officials who were in charge of the temple, gave to the priests 2,600 lambs and 300 cattle to be sacrifices for he Passover.
\v 9 And Conaniah along with his \add younger\add* brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, and Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, the leaders of the descendants of Levi, provided 5,000 lambs and 500 cattle for the other descendants of Levi, to be sacrifices for the Passover.
\p
\v 10 Everything \add for the Passover\add* was arranged: The priests and the other descendants of Levi stood in their places in their groups, like the king had commanded.
\v 11 Then they slaughtered the Passover lambs. The priests sprinkled the blood from \add the bowls that\add* were handed to them, while the other descendants of Levi removed the skins from the animals.
\v 12 They set aside the animals to be completely burned on the altar, in order to give them to the various family groups to offer to Yahweh, obeying the instructions that were written in the laws God gave Moses. They did the same thing with the cattle.
\v 13 Obeying those regulations, they roasted over the fire the lambs for the Passover. And they boiled the \add meat of the\add* sacred offerings in pots and kettles and pans, and served the meat immediately to all the people \add who were there\add*.
\v 14 After that, they prepared meat for themselves and for the priests, because the priests were busy until nighttime, sacrificing the offerings to be completely burned and burning the fat parts of the offerings. So the descendants of Levi prepared meat for themselves and for the priests, who were descendants of Aaron, \add the first Supreme Priest\add*.
\p
\v 15 The musicians, who were descendants of Asaph, stood in their places, like had been commanded by King David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king's prophet. The men who guarded the gates \add of the temple\add* did not need to leave their places, because their fellow descendants of Levi prepared food for them to eat.
\p
\v 16 So on that day everything that needed to done for worshiping Yahweh was done. They celebrated the Passover festival {The Passover festival was celebrated}, and they presented offerings to be completely burned on the altar, which was what Josiah had commanded.
\v 17 The Israelis who were there celebrated the Passover on that day, and for seven days they celebrated the festival of \add Eating\add* Unleavened Bread.
\v 18 The Passover festival had not been celebrated like that in Israel since the time that the prophet Samuel lived. And none of the kings of Israel had ever celebrated the Passover like Josiah did, along with the priests, the other descendants of Levi, and all \add the other people of\add* Judah and Israel who were there with the people who lived in Jerusalem.
\v 19 They celebrated this Passover festival when Josiah had been ruling for almost eighteen years.
\s1 The end of Josiah's life
\p
\v 20 After Josiah had done all those things to \add restore the worship at\add* the temple, King Neco of Egypt went \add with his army\add* to attack Carchemish \add city\add* alongside the Euphrates \add River\add*, and Josiah marched \add with his army\add* to fight against them.
\v 21 Neco sent some messengers to Josiah, to tell him, “You are the king of Judah, and there is certainly no [RHQ] quarrel between you and me. My army is not attacking you(pl); we are attacking the army of Babylonia. God has told me to hurry. So stop opposing God, who is for me. If you do not stop, God will get rid of you.”
\p
\v 22 But Josiah would not heed him. Instead, he disguised himself in order to be able to attack \add the army of Egypt without anyone recognizing him\add*. He did not pay any attention to what God had told Neco to say. Instead, he \add and his army\add* went to fight Neco's army at the plain of Megiddo.
\p
\v 23 Some ◄archers/men who shot arrows► shot King Josiah. He told his officers, “Take me away from here because I am badly wounded.”
\v 24 So they took him out of his chariot and put him in another chariot that he had brought with him, and they took him to Jerusalem, where he died. He was buried in the tombs where his ancestors \add had been buried\add*, and all \add the people of\add* Jerusalem and other places in Judah mourned for him.
\p
\v 25 \add The prophet\add* Jeremiah composed a song to lament for Josiah, and all the men and women singers in Israel still mourn for Josiah by singing that song. That became a custom in Israel; the words of that song are written in a scroll of funeral songs.
\p
\v 26-27 A record of the other things that happened while Josiah ruled, from the time he started to rule until he died, including how he faithfully was devoted to honoring God by obeying all that was written in the laws of Yahweh, is written in the scroll called 'the History of the Kings of Israel and Judah.'
