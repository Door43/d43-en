\s1 Preparations to celebrate the Passover
\p
\v 1-3 The king and his officials and all the other people who had gathered in Jerusalem wanted to celebrate the Passover festival. But they were not able to celebrate it at the usual time, because many of the priests had still not performed the rituals to purify/consecrate themselves; therefore they were not allowed to do the work of that festival. Also, everyone had still not come to Jerusalem \add to celebrate it\add*. So they decided to celebrate it one month later than usual.
\v 4 The king and all the other people who had gathered thought that was a good plan.
\v 5 So they decided to send messages to all the towns in Judah and in Israel, from Beersheba \add in the far south\add* to Dan \add in the far north\add*, including towns in the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, to invite people to come to the temple in Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover to \add honor\add* Yahweh, the God whom the Israeli people \add worshiped\add*. Many of the people had not previously celebrated that festival, even though it had been written \add in the laws of Moses that they should do that\add*.
\p
\v 6 Obeying what the king commanded, messengers went throughout Judah and Israel, taking messages that had been written by the king and his officials. This is what they wrote:
\b
\li “You Israeli people, you who survived after being ◄slaves of/captured by► the kings of Assyria, return to Yahweh, the God whom \add our great ancestors\add* Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob \add worshiped\add*, in order that he may return to you. Your fathers and brothers did not faithfully obey Yahweh, the God whom our ancestors \add worshiped\add*.
\v 7 Do not act like they did, because what they did caused other people to become disgusted with them.
\v 8 Do not be stubborn [IDI] as our ancestors were. Do what Yahweh desires. Come \add to Jerusalem\add* to the temple, which he has set apart forever. Do what pleases Yahweh our God, in order that he will no longer be angry with you.
\v 9 If you return to Yahweh, the people who have captured our brothers \add and sisters\add* and our children will act kindly toward them, and allow them to return to this land/country. Do not forget that Yahweh our God is kind and merciful. If you return to him, he will no longer reject you.”
\p
\v 10 The messengers went to all the towns in the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, as far \add north\add* as the tribe of Zebulun, \add and gave them this message\add*, but most of the people there scorned them and ridiculed them.
\v 11 But some of the people of \add the tribes of\add* Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and went to Jerusalem.
\v 12 Also in Judah God motivated [IDI] the people to be united in wanting to do what Yahweh wanted them to do, which is what the king and his officials had told them to do in the message that they sent.
\s1 They celebrated the Passover festival
\p
\v 13 So a huge crowd of people gathered in Jerusalem in May, to celebrate the festival of eating unleavened bread.
\v 14 They removed the altars \add of Baal\add* in Jerusalem and took away the altars for burning incense \add to honor other gods and burned them\add* in Kidron Valley.
\p
\v 15 They slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of that month. The priests and the other descendants of Levi \add who had not performed the rituals to ◄purify themselves/cause them to be acceptable to work for Yahweh►\add* set themselves apart, and brought to the temple animals to be completely burned \add on the altar\add*.
\p
\v 16 Then they stood in the places that Moses had written in his laws that they should stand in. Then the descendants of Levi gave to the priests \add bowls containing blood of the animals that were being sacrificed\add*, and the priests sprinkled \add the altar\add* with some of the blood.
\v 17 Many people in the crowd had not purified themselves, and therefore they were not able to kill the lambs \add and dedicate them\add* to Yahweh. So it was necessary for the descendants of Levi to kill the lambs for them.
\v 18 Although most of the people who had come from \add the tribes of\add* Ephraim, Manasseh, and Issachar had not purified themselves, they ate the food of the Passover festival anyway, ignoring the rules written \add by Moses\add*. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying “Yahweh, you always do what is good; I pray that you will forgive everyone
\v 19 who sincerely wants to honor you, the God whom our ancestors \add worshiped\add*, even if they have not purified themselves by obeying the sacred laws that you gave to us.”
\v 20 And Yahweh heard what Hezekiah prayed; he forgave the people, \add and did not punish them\add*.
\p
\v 21 The Israeli people who were there in Jerusalem celebrated the festival of eating unleavened bread for seven days. They rejoiced greatly as they celebrated, while the priests and other descendants of Levi sang to Yahweh every day, and played musical instruments to \add praise\add* God.
\p
\v 22 Hezekiah thanked all the descendants of Levi for doing this work for Yahweh, and for very skillfully leading the people who were worshiping. For those seven days the people ate the Passover food and brought offerings to maintain fellowship with Yahweh and praised Yahweh, the God whom their ancestors \add had worshiped\add*.
\p
\v 23 Then the whole group decided to celebrate for seven more days, so they did: they celebrated joyfully for seven more days.
\v 24 King Hezekiah provided 1,000 bulls and 7,000 sheep to be slaughtered for the people \add to eat during the festival\add*, and the officials also gave them 1,000 bulls and 10,000 sheep and goats. Many priests consecrated themselves.
\v 25 All the people of Judah rejoiced, including the priests and other descendants of Levi and all the people from Israel who had come, and including some from other countries who were living in Israel and some from other countries who were living in Judah.
\v 26 Everyone in Jerusalem was very joyful, because nothing like this had happened in Jerusalem since the time when David's son Solomon was the king of Israel.
\v 27 The priests and the other descendants of Levi stood up to bless the people, and God heard them, because their prayers reached up to heaven, the holy place where God lives.
