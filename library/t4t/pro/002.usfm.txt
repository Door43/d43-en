\s1 The results of wisdom
\q1
\v 1 My son, listen to what I say,
\q2 and \add consider my instructions to be as valuable as\add* [MET] a treasure.
\q1
\v 2 Pay attention to wisdom
\q2 and try hard to understand what is wise.
\q1
\v 3 Call out \add to God\add* to get insight;
\q2 plead with him to help you to understand more \add of what he wants you to know\add*.
\q1
\v 4 Search eagerly for wisdom, like you would search for silver,
\q2 like you would search for a treasure that someone has hidden.
\q1
\v 5 If you do that, you will understand how to revere Yahweh,
\q2 and you will succeed in knowing God.
\q1
\v 6 Yahweh is the one who gives us wisdom.
\q2 He is the one who tells us things that we need to know and understand.
\q1
\v 7 He gives good advice to those who conduct their lives as they should.
\q2 He protects [MET] those who do what is right.
\q1
\v 8 He guards those who act justly/fairly toward others,
\q2 and he watches over those who are faithful/loyal to him.
\q1
\v 9 \add If you ask God for wisdom\add*, you will understand what is right and just [DOU] to do,
\q2 and you will know the right way to conduct your lives,
\q1
\v 10 because you will have wisdom in your inner being;
\q2 knowing \add what God wants you to know\add* will cause you to be joyful.
\q1
\v 11 If you know [PRS] how to choose what is right to do
\q1 and if you understand \add what God wants\add* you to do,
\q2 God will protect you and guard you and keep you safe.
\q1
\v 12 If you are wise [PRS], you will not do what evil people do,
\q2 and you will not \add believe what\add* deceitful people say.
\q1
\v 13 Deceitful people have stopped acting fairly/justly toward others
\q2 and ◄walk on dark and evil paths/do what evil people do► [MET].
\q1
\v 14 They enjoy doing what is wrong;
\q2 they like to do what is evil and to deceive people.
\q1
\v 15 They ◄walk on crooked paths/always deceive others►
\q2 and are always dishonest.
\b
\q1
\v 16 If you are wise [PRS], you will also be saved from ◄immoral women/prostitutes►;
\q2 you will not pay attention when adulterous women try to seduce/entice you by what they say.
\q1
\v 17 Those women have left the husbands whom they married when they were young;
\q2 they have disregarded the solemn promise they made to God \add not to commit adultery\add*.
\q1
\v 18 If you go into houses of women who are like that,
\q2 you will die \add when you are still young\add*;
\q2 the road \add to their houses\add* leads to hell.
\q1
\v 19 No man who ◄visits/sleeps with► a woman like that will again \add live harmoniously with his family\add*.
\q2 He will never have a \add happy\add* life again.
\b
\q1
\v 20 If \add you are wise\add*, you should behave like good men behave.
\q2 You should ◄stay on the paths that righteous people walk on/do what godly people do► [MET],
\q1
\v 21 because only godly people will live in this land \add and receive God's blessings\add*;
\q2 only those who have not done wrong will stay here \add for a long time\add*.
\q1
\v 22 Wicked people will be expelled from this land,
\q2 and people who are not trustworthy will be thrown {God will throw them} out of it.
