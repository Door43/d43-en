\c 12
\q1
\v 1 While you are still young, keep thinking about \add God\add*, who created you.
\q2 Do that before \add you are old\add* and you experience many troubles,
\q1 during the years when you say
\q2 “I no longer enjoy being alive.”
\q1
\v 2 \add When you become old\add*, the light from the sun and moon and stars will seem dim to you,
\q2 and it will seem that the rain clouds \add always\add* return quickly after it rains.
\q1
\v 3 Then your \add arms that you use to protect\add* [MET] your bodies will shake/tremble,
\q2 and your \add legs that support\add* [MET] your bodies will become weak.
\q1 Many of your \add teeth that you use to\add* grind/chew \add your food\add* will fall out,
\q2 and your \add eyes that you use to\add* look out of windows will not see clearly.
\q1
\v 4 Your \add ears\add* [MET] will not hear the noise in the streets,
\q2 and you will not be able to hear clearly the sound of people grinding grain with millstones.
\q1 You will be awakened in the morning by hearing the birds singing/chirping,
\q2 but you will not be able to hear well the songs that ◄the birds/people► sing.
\q1
\v 5 You will be afraid to be in high places
\q2 and afraid of dangers on the roads that you walk on.
\q1 \add Your hair\add* will become \add white like\add* [MET] the flowers of almond trees.
\q2 \add When you try to walk\add*, you will drag yourself along like [MET] grasshoppers,
\q2 and you will no longer desire \add to have sex/anything\add*.
\q1 Then you will \add die and\add* go to your eternal home,
\q2 and people who will mourn for you will be in the streets.
\q1
\v 6 \add Think much about God now, because\add* soon our lives will end,
\q2 like [MET] silver chains or golden bowls that break easily,
\q1 or like pitchers/jugs that are broken at the water fountain,
\q2 or like broken pulleys at a well.
\q1
\v 7 Then our corpses will \add decay and\add* become dirt again,
\q2 and our spirits will return to God, the one who gave us our spirits.
\b
\q1
\v 8 So I say \add again\add* that it is difficult to understand why everything happens;
\q2 everything is mysterious.
\s1 The conclusion
\p
\v 9 I was considered to be a very wise man, and I taught the people many things. I assembled/collected and wrote down many proverbs, and I carefully thought about and studied them.
\v 10 I searched for words that would be pleasing to hear/read, and what I have written is reliable and true.
\p
\v 11 The things that \add I and other\add* wise people say \add teach people what they should do\add*; they are like [SIM] ◄goads/sharp sticks that people use to strike animals to direct where they should go►. They are like [SIM] nails that stick out of pieces of wood. They are given to us by \add God, who is like\add* [MET] our shepherd.
\v 12 So, my son, pay careful attention to what I have written, and choose carefully what you read that others have written, because writing proverbs/books is endless, and \add trying to\add* study them all will cause you to become exhausted.
\b
\q1
\v 13 Now you have heard all \add that I have told you\add*,
\q2 and here is the conclusion:
\q1 Revere God, and obey his commandments,
\q2 because those commandments summarize everything that people should do.
\q1
\v 14 And do not forget that God will judge everything that we do,
\q2 good things and bad things,
\q2 even things that we do secretly.
