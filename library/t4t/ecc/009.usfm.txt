\c 9
\s1 Everyone dies
\p
\v 1 I thought about all those things, and I concluded that God controls \add what happens to\add* everyone, even those who are wise and those who are righteous. No one knows whether \add others\add* will love them or whether they will hate them.
\p
\v 2 But \add we know that some time in the future\add* we will all die;
\q1 it does not matter whether we act righteously or wickedly,
\q2 whether we are good or whether we are bad,
\q1 whether we are acceptable for \add worshiping God\add*
\q2 or whether \add we have done things to cause us to be\add* unacceptable;
\q1 it does not matter if we offer sacrifices \add to God\add* or if we do not;
\q1 it does not matter if we do what we have promised God that we will do or if we do not;
\q2 \add we all die\add*.
\q1 The same thing will happen to good people and to sinful people,
\q2 to those who solemnly promise \add to do things for God\add* and to those who are afraid to make such promises.
\p
\v 3 It seems wrong that the same thing happens to everyone on this earth: Everyone dies [EUP]. Furthermore, people's inner beings are full of evil. People do foolish things while they are alive, and then they join those who are dead.
\v 4 While we are alive, we confidently expect \add that good things will happen to us\add*. \add We despise\add* dogs, but it is better to be a dog that is alive than to be a \add majestic\add* lion that is dead.
\q1
\v 5 We who are alive know that \add some day\add* we will die,
\q2 but dead people do not know anything.
\q1 Dead people do not receive any more rewards,
\q2 and people soon forget them.
\q1
\v 6 \add While they were alive\add*, they loved \add some people\add*, they hated \add some people\add*, they envied \add some people\add*,
\q2 but that all ends when they die.
\q1 They will never again be a part of anything that happens here on the earth.
\p
\v 7 \add So I say\add*, be joyful [DOU] while you eat your food and drink your wine, because that is what God wants you to do.
\v 8 Wear nice [MTY] clothes and cause your face to have a good appearance.
\v 9 Enjoy living with your wife whom you love, all during the time that God has given to you to be alive here on this earth. And even though it is difficult to understand why many things happen, enjoy doing the work that you do here on this earth.
\v 10 Whatever you are able to do, do it with all your energy, because \add some time you will die\add*, and in the place of the dead where you are going, no one works or plans to do anything or knows anything or has any wisdom.
\p
\v 11 I have seen something else here on the earth:
\q1 The person who runs fastest does not always win the race,
\q1 the strongest soldiers do not always win the battle,
\q1 the wisest people do not always have food,
\q1 the smartest people do not always become rich,
\q1 and the people who have studied a lot are not always ◄honored/treated very specially► by others;
\q1 we cannot always control what things will happen to us and where they will happen.
\p
\v 12 No one knows when he will die [EUP];
\q1 fish are cruelly caught in a net,
\q2 and birds are caught in snares/traps;
\q1 similarly [SIM], people experience disasters
\q2 at times when they do not expect them to happen.
\s1 Being wise is better than being foolish
\p
\v 13 Once I saw here on this earth something that a wise man did that impressed me.
\v 14 There was a small town, where only a few people lived. The army of a great king came to that town and surrounded it. They built dirt ramps up against the walls in order to climb up and attack the town.
\v 15 In that town there was a man who was poor but very wise. Because of what that man \add suggested\add*, the town was saved; but people soon forgot about him.
\v 16 So I realized that although being wise is better than being strong, if you are poor, no one will appreciate what you do, and people will soon forget what you said.
\b
\q1
\v 17 Speaking quietly what is very wise is much more sensible
\q2 than a king shouting to foolish people.
\q1
\v 18 Being wise is more useful
\q2 than a lot of weapons;
\q1 but if you do one foolish thing,
\q2 it is possible that because of doing that you will ruin all the good things that you have done.
