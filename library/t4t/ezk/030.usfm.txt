\s1 Yahweh will punish Egypt
\p
\v 1 Yahweh gave me another message. He said,
\v 2 “You human, prophesy \add about what will happen to Egypt\add*. Say, ‘This is what Yahweh the Lord says:
\q1 Weep and wail [DOU],
\q2 because terrible things will happen some day.
\q1
\v 3 That day is near,
\q2 the day when I, Yahweh, \add will punish people\add*;
\q1 it will be a day of clouds and disaster for many nations.
\q1
\v 4 \add An enemy army\add* [PRS] will come to attack Egypt with their swords,
\q2 and there will be great distress the people in Ethiopia.
\q1 Many people will be killed in Egypt;
\q2 everything valuable will be taken away,
\q2 and even the foundations \add of the buildings\add* will be torn down.
\m
\v 5 Soldiers of Ethiopia, Libya, Lydia, and from all of Arabia, and all the other groups who are their allies, will be killed in the battles.’
\p
\v 6 This is what I, Yahweh say:
\q1 ‘The allies of Egypt will be defeated,
\q2 and the power that \add the people of Egypt\add* are proud of will end.
\q1 From Migdol \add city in the north\add* to Aswan \add city in the south\add* the soldiers of Egypt will be killed by their enemies' swords;
\q2 that is what I, Yahweh the Lord, declare.
\b
\q1
\v 7 Egypt will become the most deserted country in the world,
\q1 and its cities will be ruined,
\q2 surrounded by ruined cities \add in nearby nations\add*.
\q1
\v 8 Then, when I cause \add everything in\add* Egypt to be burned in fires,
\q2 and all their allies are defeated,
\q2 people will know that I, Yahweh, \add have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*.
\p
\v 9 At that time, I will send messengers to go swiftly \add up the Nile River\add* in boats to cause the people of Ethiopia who ◄are complacent/confident/think that nothing terrible will happen to them► to become afraid. They will be terrified [PRS] when Egypt is destroyed; and it will soon be that time!
\p
\v 10 This is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say:
\q1 by the power of [MTY] of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon
\q2 I will get rid of very many people in Egypt.
\q1
\v 11 Nebuchadnezzar and his army, whose soldiers are extremely ruthless,
\q2 will come to destroy Egypt.
\q1 They will pull out their swords
\q2 and fill Egypt with the corpses of those whom they have killed.
\q1
\v 12 I will cause the Nile \add River\add* to become dry,
\q2 and I will sell the nation to evil men.
\q1 By the power [MTY] of foreigners
\q2 I will ruin the land and everything that is in it.
\m \add That will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have predicted it.’
\p
\v 13 This is also what I, Yahweh the Lord, say:
\q1 ‘I will cause the idols and statues of idols [DOU]
\q2 in Memphis \add city\add* to be destroyed.
\q1 No longer will there be a king in Egypt,
\q2 and all their allies will also be crushed.
\q1 I will cause \add the people of\add* Egypt to be very afraid.
\q1
\v 14 I will cause the Pathros \add area in southern Egypt\add* to be abandoned.
\q2 I will start fires in Zoan \add city in northeast Egypt\add*
\q2 and punish the people in Thebes, \add the capital of southern Egypt\add*.
\q1
\v 15 I will pour out my punishment [MTY] on \add the fortress in\add* Pelusium \add in northern Egypt\add*
\q2 and I will get rid of very many people in Thebes.
\q1
\v 16 I will burn Egypt by fires;
\q2 the people in Pelusium will suffer severe pain.
\q1 Enemies will conquer Thebes,
\q2 and the people in Memphis will constantly be terrified.
\q1
\v 17 Many young men in Heliopolis and Bubastis \add cities in northern Egypt\add* will be killed by \add their enemies\add* swords,
\q2 and the others from those cities will be captured and taken \add to Babylon\add*.
\q1
\v 18 It will be a dark day \add of destruction\add* at Tahpenes \add city in northeast Egypt\add*
\q2 when I cause the power [MET] of Egypt to end;
\q2 that country will no longer be proud of being strong.
\q1 \add It will be as though\add* a dark cloud will cover Egypt,
\q2 because the people of its villages will be captured and forced to go \add to Babylon\add*.
\q1
\v 19 That is how I will punish Egypt,
\q2 and people will know that I, Yahweh, \add have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*.’~”
\s1 The king of Egypt will be defeated by Nebuchadnezzar's army
\p
\v 20 Almost eleven years \add after we had been taken to Babylon\add*, on the seventh day of the first month \add of that year\add*, Yahweh gave me another message. He said,
\v 21 “You human, I \add have enabled the army of Nebuchadnezzar to defeat the army of\add* the king of Egypt. \add It is as though\add* I have broken one of the arms of the king of Egypt, and it has not been bandaged in order that it could be healed, and it has not been put in splints in order that \add after it heals\add* the arm will be strong enough to hold a sword.
\v 22 Therefore, this is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say: I am the enemy of the king of Egypt. \add I will completely destroy the power of Egypt; it is as though\add* now I will break both of the king's arms, the good/strong one and the broken one, and cause the sword to fall from his hand.
\v 23 I will cause the people of Egypt to be scattered among the nations [DOU].
\v 24 \add It is as though\add* I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and put a sword in his hand, and \add as though\add* I will break the arms of the king of Egypt, and he will groan in front of the king of Babylon like [SIM] a soldier who is wounded and about to die.
\v 25 I will cause the power [MTY] of the king of Babylon to become greater, and the power of the king of Egypt will be useless [MET]. When that happens, when I give power to the army of the king of Babylon, they will use that power to attack Egypt.
\v 26 I will cause the people of Egypt to be scattered among the nations [DOU]. And when that happens, people will know that I, Yahweh, \add have the power to do what I say that I will do\add* [DOU].”
