\c 12
\s1 Ezekiel symbolizes what will happen when they are exiled.
\p
\v 1 Yahweh gave me another message. He said,
\v 2 “You human, you are living among people who are very rebellious. They have eyes, but they do not see \add what I want them to see\add*; they have ears, but they do not hear \add what I want them to hear\add*, because they are rebellious/stubborn people.
\p
\v 3 Therefore, you human, pack your belongings as though you were ◄going into exile/being forced to go to another country►. Then, during the daytime, while people are watching, \add prepare to\add* go to another place. Even though the people are rebellious, perhaps they will understand \add what you are symbolizing\add*.
\v 4 During the daytime, while they are watching, bring out the things that you want to take, and pack them. Then in the evening, while they are watching, do what those who are preparing to go into exile do.
\v 5 Dig through the \add city\add* wall and take your things through the hole.
\v 6 Put them \add in a sack\add* on your shoulder while they are watching, and leave at dusk. Cover your face in order that you cannot see the path. \add I want you to do this\add* because I want you to warn the Israeli people.”
\p
\v 7 So I did what Yahweh told me to do. During the day I brought things out of my house\add as though\add* I was packing to go into exile. Then in the evening I dug through the \add city\add* wall. Then while people watched, I put my sack of belongings on my shoulder and left.
\p
\v 8 The next morning, Yahweh gave me this message:
\v 9 “You human, the rebellious people [MTY] of Israel asked you, ‘What are you doing?’
\p
\v 10 So \add go back and\add* say to them, ‘What I did is about the king in Jerusalem and all the other people of Israel who are there.’
\v 11 Tell them, ‘What I \add did\add* is a warning to you. What has happened to you will happen to them. They will be captured and forced to go to another country.
\v 12 Their king will put his belongings on his shoulder at dusk and leave. \add His servants\add* will dig a hole through the city wall, \add and he will take his belongings\add* through it. He will cover his face in order that \add others will not recognize\add* him.
\v 13 But \add it will be as though\add* I will spread a net for him \add to be captured\add*; \add enemy soldiers will\add* capture him and take him to Babylon \add city\add*. But he will not \add be able to\add* see it; and there he will die.
\v 14 I will scatter in all directions [IDI] all those who have been around him—his advisors and his soldiers—and I will cause his enemies to pursue them, with their swords ready to strike them.
\p
\v 15 Then, when I scatter them among many nations [DOU], they will know that I, Yahweh \add have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*.
\v 16 But I will spare/save a few of them from being killed by swords and from dying from famines or plagues, with the result that in the nations to which they are forced to go, they will realize/admit that they have been doing disgusting things, and they will know that I, Yahweh, \add have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*.”
\p
\v 17 Then Yahweh gave me another message. He said,
\v 18 “You human, tremble while you eat your food, and shudder fearfully while you drink your water.
\v 19 Tell this to the Israeli people: ‘This is what Yahweh the Lord says about those who are still living in Jerusalem and in \add other places in\add* Israel: They also will be very anxious/worried [DOU] while they eat their food and drink their water, because their country will soon have everything taken away. That will happen because the people who live there continually act very violently.
\v 20 The towns where people live will be devastated, and the land will become barren/empty. Then you people will know that it is I, Yahweh, \add who have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*.’~”
\p
\v 21 Yahweh gave me another message. He said,
\v 22 “You human, the people in Israel have this proverb/saying: ‘The days pass, and what \add the prophets\add* predict never happens.’
\v 23 So say to them, ‘This is what Yahweh the Lord says: I am going to prove that ◄what they say/that proverb► is not correct, and then they will never say it again in Israel.’ Tell them, ‘It will soon be the time when everything that the prophets predict will happen.
\v 24 No longer will \add prophets tell\add* to the Israeli people false visions, or prophecies that try to please people.
\v 25 Instead, I, Yahweh, will say what I want to tell the people, and what I predict will quickly happen. You rebellious people, I will cause to happen everything that I say will happen. That is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say.’~”
\p
\v 26 Yahweh also gave me this message:
\v 27 “You human, the Israeli people are constantly saying about you, ‘The things that he sees in visions \add will not happen soon\add*. They are about \add things that will happen\add* many years from now, far in the future.’
\p
\v 28 Therefore say to them, ‘This is what Yahweh the Lord [DOU] says: I will no longer delay \add causing to happen\add* any of the things that I have prophesied. Whatever I have predicted will \add soon\add* happen.’~”
