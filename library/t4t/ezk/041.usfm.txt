\v 1 Then \add in the vision\add* the man brought me to into the Holy Place in the temple and measured the doorways of the main room:: they were about ◄10.5 ft./3.2 meters► wide.
\v 2 The entrance was ◄17.5 ft./5.3 meters► wide, and the walls of each side of it were ◄8.75 ft./2.6 meters►thick. He also measured the Holy Place, it was 68 ft. long and 34 ft. wide.
\p
\v 3 Then he entered the inner room of the temple and measured the walls of the entrance; each was ◄3.5 ft./1.1 meter► thick/wide . The doorway way 10.5 ft. wide and 10 ft.long, and the walls on each side of the ebtrance were◄12-1/6 ft./3.7 meters► long .
\v 4 Then he measured the inner room: it was ◄35 ft./10.6 meters► long and ◄35 ft./10.6 meters► wide. He said to me, “This is the Very Holy Place.”
\p
\v 5 Then he measured the wall of the temple: it was ◄10.5 ft./3.2 meters► thick. Each of the rooms around the outside of the temple were ◄7 ft./2.1 meters► wide.
\v 6 Those rooms had three levels, one above the other. There were thirty rooms on each level. There were ledges all around the wall of the temple that were supports for those side rooms; so those supports were not built into the wall of the temple.
\v 7 Each of those side rooms was wider than the one below it. The most narrow rooms were built first, at the bottom. Then a wider set of rooms was built over it, and the widest set was at the top. A set of stairs was built from the lowest level through the middle level to the highest level.
\p
\v 8 I saw that there was a terrace (OR, raised platform) around the temple. The edge of the terrace was the foundation for those side rooms; it was ◄10.5 ft./3.2 meters► high.
\v 9 The outer wall of those side rooms was ◄8.75 ft./2.6 meters► thick. All around the temple there was an open area between those side rooms
\v 10 and the priests' rooms; it was ◄35 ft./10.6 meters► wide.
\v 11 There were two doors from those side rooms into another open area; one faced north and one faced south. That open area was ◄8.75 ft./2.6 meters► wide.
\p
\v 12 There was a large building on the west side of the temple area. It was ◄122.5 ft./37.1 meters► wide and ◄157.5 ft./47.7 meters► wide. And its walls were also ◄8.75 ft./2.6 meters► thick.
\p
\v 13 Then the man measured the temple. It was ◄175 ft./53 meters► long, and the temple courtyard, where the large building was, including its walls was also ◄175 ft./53 meters► long.
\v 14 The courtyard on the east side of the temple, across the front of the temple, was also 175 ft./53 meters wide.
\p
\v 15 Then he measured the building on the west side. Including its walls it was also ◄175 ft./53 meters►long.
\p The outer walls of the Holy Place, of the Very Holy Place, and the entry room,
\v 16 the inner walls above and below the windows, and the frames of the windows were all covered with thin panels of wood.
\v 17 All the walls inside the temple were decorated with \add carvings of\add* winged creatures and palm trees: between each figure of a winged creature was a carving of a palm tree. Each winged creature had two faces:
\v 18-19 one was a face of a human, and one was the face of a lion. Those figures were carved on the walls all around the inside of the temple.
\v 20 They covered all the walls, from the floor to the top of the walls,.
\p
\v 21 At the entrance to the main room of the temple there were square doorposts. In front of the Very Holy Place there was something that resembled
\v 22 a wooden altar. It was ◄5-.2 ft./1.6 meters► high and ◄3-1/2 ft./1.1 meters► wide on all four sides. Its corners and base and sides were all made of wood. The man said to me, “This is the table that is in the presence of Yahweh.”
\v 23 The Holy Place and the Very Holy Place had folding doors.
\v 24 Each doorway had two doors/sections that swung \add on hinges\add*.
\v 25 On the doors of the Holy Place there were carvings of winged creatures and palm trees, like those on the walls of the Holy Place. There was also a wooden roof over the front of the entry room \add of the temple\add* .
\v 26 On the side walls of the entry room were narrow windows with figures of palm trees carved on the sides of the windows. The rooms around the temple also had roofs.
