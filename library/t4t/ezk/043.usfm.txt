\s1 Yahweh's glory returned to the temple
\p
\v 1 Then the man brought me to the entrance on the east side.
\v 2 Suddenly I saw the glory/brightness of the God of Israel coming from the east. The sound of his coming was like the roar of a rushing river, and all that area shone with his glory.
\v 3 What I saw in this vision was like what I saw in the visions that I had seen previously, first by the Kebar River and later when God came to destroy Jerusalem. I prostrated myself on the ground.
\v 4 The glory of Yahweh entered the temple through the east entrance.
\v 5 Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner courtyard, and the glory of Yahweh filled the temple.
\p
\v 6 Then while the man was standing beside me, I heard someone speak to me from inside the temple.
\v 7 He said, “You human, this is my temple, the place where \add I sit on\add* my throne and where I rest my feet. This is where I will live with the Israeli people forever. The Israeli people and their kings will never again disgrace me [SYN] by worshiping other gods [MET] at the shrines on their hilltops, or by building monuments to honor their kings who have died.
\v 8 They placed their altars near mine, and the doorposts of their temples were next to the doorposts of my temple. There was only a wall between them. And they disgraced me by the detestable things that they did. So, being very angry with them, I got rid of them.
\v 9 Now they must stop this disgusting worship of idols and these rituals to honor their kings who have died. If they stop doing those things, I will live among them forever.
\p
\v 10 You human, describe to the Israeli people what this temple that I have shown you \add in a vision\add* is like, in order that they will be ashamed of the sins that they have committed \add which resulted in their temple in Jerusalem being destroyed\add*.
\v 11 If they are ashamed of all the evil things that they have done, tell them all about the temple \add that I showed you\add*: Its design/shape, the exits and entrances, and everything else about it. And tell them all my laws and regulations abiut wiorshiping me there. Write all these things down while they watch you, in order that they will be able to faithfully obey them.
\p
\v 12 And this is the supreme law about the temple [DOU]: All of the area on top of the hill where the temple will be built must be kept sacred and holy.”
\s1 The altar
\p
\v 13 These are the measurements of the altar, using the same kind of measuring stick that was used for the temple area: There is a gutter around the altar that is ◄21 in./53 cm.► deep and ◄21 in./53 cm.► wide. There is a rim/curb around it that is ◄9 in./23 cm.► wide.
\v 14 The lower part of the gutter is ◄3.5 ft./1.1 meters► high to the lower ledge/rim that surrounds the altar. The altar is ◄21 in./53 cm.► wide. The upper part of the altar is ◄7 ft./2.1 meters► high, up to the upper ledge. That part of the altar is also ◄21 in./53 cm.► wide.
\v 15 The ◄hearth/place where the sacrifices are burned► at the top of the altar is another ◄7 ft./2.2 meters► high, and there is a projection that juts/extends up from each of the four corners.
\v 16 That place at the top of the altar is square,◄ 21 ft./6.4 meters► on each side.
\v 17 The upper ledge is also a square, ◄24.5 ft./7.4 meters► on each side. There is a ◄21 in./53 cm.► gutter \add at the bottom of the altar\add*, and a ◄10.5 in./26.6 cm.► rim all around it. There are steps up to the east side of the altar.
\p
\v 18 Then the man said to me, “You human, this is what Yahweh the Lord says: These are the regulations for sacrificing offerings that will be completely burned and for sprinkling the blood against the sides of the altar when it is built:
\v 19 You must present to the priests a young bull to be an offering to cause the altar to be acceptable to me. The priests are descendants of Levi, from the clan of Zadok, who come near to the altar to serve me.
\v 20 You must take some of the blood \add from the bull\add* and smear it on the four projections of the altar and on the four corners of the upper ledge, and all around the rim, to cause the altar to be acceptable to me and to consecrate it.
\v 21 You must burn that bull outside the temple in the part of the temple area that I have designated for that.
\p
\v 22 The next day you must offer a male goat that has no defects, to be an offering to cause the altar to be acceptable to me. Then you must purify the altar again , like you did with the bull that was sacrificed.
\v 23 When you have finished doing all that, you must offer a young bull and a ram, both of them without any defects.
\v 24 You must offer them to me, Yahweh, and the priests must sprinkle salt on them and completely burn them \add on the altar\add* for a sacrifice to me.
\p
\v 25 Then, each day for seven days you must bring to the priest a male goat to be sacrificed for an offering to cause the alterto be acceptable to me. You must also sacrifice a young bull and a ram, each without any defect.
\v 26 For seven days the priests will consecrate the altar and cause it to be acceptable to me. By doing that they will dedicate it to me.
\v 27 At the end of those seven days, starting on the following day, the priests will continue to put on the altar offerings to be completely burned and offerings to maintain fellowship with me. Then I will accept you. That it what I, Yahweh the Lord, declare.”
