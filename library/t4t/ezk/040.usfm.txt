\c 40
\s1 In a vision, Ezekiel was taken to Jerusalem
\p
\v 1 Almost twenty-five years after we had been taken \add to Babylonia\add*, on the tenth day of the first month of that year, almost fourteen years after Jerusalem had been destroyed, in a vision I felt the power [MTYY] of Yahweh on me, and he took me to Israel.
\v 2 He set me on a very high mountain. On the south side of that mountain there were some buildings that appeared to be \add part of\add* a city.
\v 3 When he took me there, I saw a man whose face was like [SIM] bronze. He was standing in the entrance \add of a building\add*.He had a linen cord and a measuring stick in his hand.
\v 4 He said to me, “You human, look carefully at everything that I am going to show you, and pay attention to everything that I say and everything that I wll show you, because that is why you have been brought here. And then later you must tell the Israeli people everything that you have seen here.”
\s1 The east gate of the outer courtyard
\p
\v 5 \add In the vision I saw that\add* there was a wall that completely surrounded the temple area. The measuring stick in the man's hand was ◄10.5 ft./3.2 meters► long. He measured the wall: it was 10.5 ft. thick and 10.5 ft.high.
\p
\v 6 Then he went to gate on the east side \add of the temple\add*. He climbed the steps and measured the threshold/opening for the gate: it was 10.5 ft. thick and 10.5 ft. high. There were ◄alcoves/very small rooms► where the guards stood on each side of the gateway; the alcoves were built into the walls. Each of the alcoves was 10.5 ft. on each side. There was a distance of ◄8.7 5 ft./2.7 meters► between each alcove along the wall.
\v 7 The inner threshold/opening for the gate, which led to the entry room at the inner end of the hall facing the temple, was 10.5 ft. long.
\p
\v 8 Then he measured the entry room near the gate.
\v 9 It was about ◄14 ft./4.2 meters► long, and its supporting columns were ◄3-1/2 ft./1.1 meters► thick. The entry room of the gate was at the end of the hall that faced the temple.
\v 10 Inside the east gate there were three alcoves on each side of the wall. They each had the same length and width. And the measurements of the walls that projected out between them all measured the same.
\p
\v 11 Then he measured the opening of the gate: it was ◄17.5 ft./5.3 meters► wide, and the gate was ◄22.7 ft./6.9 meters► wide.
\v 12 In front of each alcove was a low wall about ◄21 in./53 cm.► high, and the alcoves were 10.5 ft. on each side.
\v 13 Then he measured the distance between the top of the rear wall of one alcove to the top of the next wall; it was ◄43.75 ft./13.3 meters►.
\v 14 Then he measured along the projecting walls between the alcoves all along the inside of the gate: it was ◄105 ft./31.8 meters►. He measured them as far as the entry room of the gate.
\v 15 The distance from the entrance of the gate to the other end of the entrance was ◄87.5 ft./26.5 meters► long.
\v 16 There were small windows in the outside walls of all the rooms, and also in the inner walls between the rooms. The windows were narrower on the side towards the gate. The walls that were between the rooms were decorated with \add carvings of\add* palm trees.
\s1 The outer courtyard
\p
\v 17 Then he brought me to the outer courtyard. There I saw some rooms, and a stone path/pavement along the walls around the courtyard. There were thirty rooms along the path.
\v 18 The stone path was all around the courtyard, and it extended out from the walls into the courtyard for the same distance as the gate entrance. That was the lower path.
\v 19 Then the man measured the distance \add across the outer courtyard of the temple\add*, between the outer gate and inner courtyard: it was ◄175 ft./53 meters► \add on the east side and on the north side of that courtyard\add*.
\s1 The north gateway
\p
\v 20 Then he measured how long and how wide was the entrance for the gate that was on the north side, the entrance into the outer courtyard of the temple.
\v 21 There were three alcoves on each side of the entrance. The walls that were between the alcoves and the walls of the entry room were the same length as the first e ntrance: they were ◄87.5 ft./36.5 meters► long and ◄43.7 ft./13.3 meters► wide. There were carvings of palm trees that decorated its windows and its entry room, and they all measured the same.
\v 22 Its windows and the entry room and the palm tree decorations all measured the same as the ones on the east side. There were seven steps up to the gate entrance, and an entry room was opposite it.
\v 23 There was a gate to the inner courtyard that faces the north gate, like there was on the east side.The man measured the distance from the north gate to the gate on the other side; it was ◄175 ft./53 meters►.
\s1 The south gateway
\p
\v 24 Then he brought me through the south gateway into the inner courtyard, and he measured the entrance. It measured the same as the other gateways. Its alcoves, its walls between the alcoves, and its entry room measured the same as the ones on the other sides.
\v 25 The entrance and the entry room had narrow windows along the walls, like on the other sides. The entrance was ◄87.5 ft./36.5 meters► long and ◄43.7 ft./13.3 meters► wide.
\v 26 There were seven steps up to it, and an entry room was ◄opposite it/at the side of the entrance facing the courtyard►. It also had carvings of palm trees on the walls that were between the rooms.
\v 27 The inner courtyard also had an entrance on the south side. He measured from that gateway to the entrance on the south side of the outer courtyard; it was also ◄87.5 ft./36.5 meters►.
\s1 Gateways to the inner courtyard
\p
\v 28 Then he brought me through the south entrance into the inner courtyard, and he measured the south entrance. It measured the same as the other entrances.
\v 29 Its alcoves, its projecting walls, and its entry room measured the same as the ones on the other sides. The entrance and the entry room had windows. The entrance was ◄87.5 ft./36.5 meters► long and ◄43.75 ft./13.3 meters► wide.
\v 30 The entry rooms of the around the inner courtyard were ◄42.75 ft./13.3 meters► long and ◄8.7 ft./2.6 meters► wide.
\v 31 The door of the entry room faced the outer courtyard. There were carvings of palm trees that decorated the columns, and there were eight steps up to it.
\p
\v 32 Then he led me to the east side of the inner courtyard, and he measured the entrance. It had the same measurements as the other entrances.
\v 33 Its alcoves and projecting walls and entry room measured the same as the others.
\v 34 Its entry room faced the outer courtyard. It also had carvings of palm trees that decorated the walls, and it had eight steps up to it.
\p
\v 35 Then he led me to the entrance on the north side and measured it. It measured the same as the other entrances.
\v 36 And its alcoves and walls between them and the entry room all had small windows in the walls. It was ◄87.5 ft./36.5 meters► long and ◄43.7 ft./13.3 meters► wide.
\v 37 Its entry room faced the outer courtyard. There were \add carvings of\add* palm trees that decorated its walls, and there were eight steps up to it.
\s1 The rooms for preparing sacrifices
\p
\v 38 In each of the inner entrances there was a room with a door. They were rooms where the \add carcasses of the\add* animals that would be burned completely \add on the altar\add* were washed.
\v 39 In the entry room, there were two tables on each side of the room. On those tables would be slaughtered the animals that would be completely burned, and the animals for offerings fo sins that people had committed, and offerings to cause people to longer be guilty for having sinned.
\v 40 Along the outside wall of the entry room, near the steps at the entry to the entrance on the north side, were two tables, and on the other side were two tables.
\v 41 So there were four tables on one side of the entrance and four tables on the other side, on which the animals to be sacrificed were slaughtered.
\v 42 There were also four tables of cut stone for the offerings to be completely burned, ◄31.5 in./80 cm.► on each side and ◄21 in./53 cm.► high. On those stone tables would be placed the tools for slaughtering all the animals for the sacrifices.
\v 43 There were hooks, each with two prongs, each ◄3 in./8 cm.► long, fastened to the walls. The meat for the offerings would be placed on those stone tables.
\s1 Rooms for the priests
\p
\v 44 Outside the inner gateway, inside the inner courtyard, there were two rooms, one on the north side and one on the south side.
\v 45 The man said to me, “The room whose door faces south is for the priests who are in charge of the work in the temple.
\v 46 The room whose door faces north is for the priests who are in charge of the work at the altar. They are the descendants of Zadok; they are the only descendants of Levi who are permitted to approach Yahweh while they work for him.”
\p
\v 47 Then he measured the courtyard: it was square, ◄175 ft./53 meters► long and ◄175 ft./53 meters► wide. The altar was in front of the temple.
\s1 The temple
\p
\v 48 Then he brought me to the entry room of the temple, and measured the walls on each side of the entrance: they were ◄8-3/4 ft./3.6 meters► thick. The entrance was ◄24-1/2 ft./7.4 meters► wide, and the walls on each side of the entrance were ◄5 ft./1.6 meters► long.
\v 49 The entry room was ◄17-1/2 ft./7.3 meters► wide on each side. There were ten steps up to it, and there were pillars on each side of the entrance.
