\s1 The division of the land
\p
\v 1 When the land of Israel is divided among the twelve tribes, you must present to Yahweh one part of the land to be a sacred district. It will be ◄8.3 miles/13.3 km.► long and ◄6.7 miles/10.6 km.► wide. That entire area will be ◄holy/set apart for Yahweh►.
\v 2 Part of that area, ◄875 ft./265 meters► on each side, will be for the temple area. An additional strip of ground, ◄87-1/2 ft./26.5 meters► wide will be left empty all around the temple area.
\v 3 Inside the sacred district, measure a section ◄8.3 miles/13.3 km.► long and ◄3.5 miles/5.3 km.► wide.
\v 4 It will be the sacred portion of the land for the priests who work in the temple and who come near to Yahweh to serve him. It will be a place for their houses as well as being a holy place for the temple.
\v 5 An area ◄8.3 miles/13.3 km.► long and ◄3.5 miles/5.3 km.► wide will be for the descendants of Levi who work in the temple. That area will belong to them, and they can build towns there to live in.
\p
\v 6 Alongside this sacred area will be a section of land that is ◄8.3 miles/13.3 km.► wide and ◄1.7 miles/2.65 km.► wide. It will be for a city where anyone in Israel may live.
\p
\v 7 The king will have the land that is on each side of the area formed by the sacred district and the city. It will extend to the west from the western end of those areas, and to the east from the eastern end of those areas. The far eastern and far western borders of the king's land will be next to the areas where the tribes live.
\v 8 That land will be the only land in Israel that belongs to the king. So, the kings will no longer need to oppress my people and steal \add land\add* from them. They will assign the remaining parts of the land to the people, giving a part to each tribe.
\p
\v 9 This is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say: You kings of Israel must stop acting violently and oppressing the people! You must do what is fair and right. Stop taking land from the people!
\v 10 And you must use accurate scales, and accurate containers for measuring things.
\v 11 The baskets for measuring dry things and containers for measuring liquids must be the same size; each must hold 175 quarts/liters.
\v 12 When you weigh things, you must use weights that everyone accepts as being correct [MTY].
\s1 Special offerings and holy days
\p
\v 13 You must present to the king one bushel of wheat or barley for every 60 that you harvest.
\v 14 You must give him one quart/liter of olive oil for every 100 quarts/liters that you make.
\v 15 Also, I, Yahweh, declare that you must take one sheep or goat from each 200 in your flocks in the pastures of Israel. The sheep that you take will be used with the offerings of things made from grain and for the offerings that will be completely burned and the offerings to maintain fellowship with Yahweh, offerings to cause the people to no longer be guilty for their sins.
\v 16 All the people of the land must join in bringing these offerings to the king of Israel.
\v 17 And the king must provide the animals to be completely burned on the altar, grain for the offerings made from grain, and wine for the sacred festivals that I have appointed for the people Israel—including the festivals to celebrate the new moons, and the Sabbaths. He must provide the animals for the offerings for the people to become acceptable to God, offerings of things made from grain, offerings to be completely burned, and offerings to maintain fellowship with Yahweh, to purify the people of Israel.
\p
\v 18 This is also what I, Yahweh the Lord, declare: On the first day of the first month of each year you must take one young bull that has no defects and \add sacrifice it to\add* purify the temple.
\v 19 The Supreme Priest must take some of the blood of the offering to cause people to become acceptable to God, and smear it on the doorposts of the temple, on the four corners of the upper ledge of the altar, and on the gateposts of the inner courtyard.
\v 20 You must do the same thing on the seventh day of the month for any people who sin accidentally or without knowing that what they did is sinful. By doing that you will purify the temple.
\p
\v 21 In the first month of each year, on the 14th day of the month, you must start to celebrate the Passover festival. The festival will last for seven days. During that time you must not eat bread made with yeast.
\v 22 On the first day, the king must provide a bull to be an offering for himself and for the other people of the country.
\v 23 And every day during those seven days he must provide seven bulls and seven rams that have no defects, to be an offering to cause the people to become acceptable to God.
\v 24 He must also provide a basket of flour to be an offering for each bull, and a basket of flour for each ram, and also four quarts/liters of olive oil for each basket of flour.
\p
\v 25 During the seven days of the festival \add of Living in Temporary Shelters\add*, which starts on the fifteenth day of the seventh month of each year, the king must provide the same things for offerings to cause the people to become acceptable to God, for offerings to be completely burned, for offerings of things made from grain, and of olive oil.
