\s1 A funeral song for the king of Egypt
\p
\v 1 Almost twelve years \add after we had been taken to Babylonia\add*, on the first day of the twelfth month \add of that year\add*, Yahweh gave me another message. He said,
\v 2 “You human, sing a sad/funeral song about the king of Egypt. Sing this to him:
\q1 ‘You \add think that you\add* [IRO] are like [SIM] a lion among the nations;
\q1 or are like [SIM] a monster/crocodile in the river
\q2 thrashing around in the water,
\q2 churning/stirring up the water with your feet
\q2 and causing the water to become muddy.
\p
\v 3 But this is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say:
\q1 I will send many people to throw my net over you,
\q2 and they will haul/drag you up \add onto the land\add* in my net.
\q1
\v 4 They will throw you into a field [DOU];
\q1 I will allow the birds to sit on you,
\q2 and all the wild animals will eat the flesh of your corpse until their stomachs are full.
\q1
\v 5 I will cause them to scatter your flesh on the hills
\q2 and fill the valleys with your bones.
\q1
\v 6 I will cause them to fill the land with your blood,
\q2 all the way to the mountains,
\q2 and the ravines will be filled with your flesh.
\q1
\v 7 When I get rid of you,
\q2 I will cover the sky and not allow the stars to shine.
\q1 I will put a dark cloud in front of the sun,
\q2 and the moon will not shine.
\q1
\v 8 I will cause the stars in the sky to be dark,
\q2 and there will be darkness over your entire land;
\q2 \add that will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh the Lord, have said it.
\b
\q1
\v 9 And when the people of many nations hear about your being destroyed,
\q2 many of them will be afraid/worried—
\q2 people living in countries that you have never known about.
\q1
\v 10 I will cause many people to be appalled because of \add what has happened to\add* you,
\q2 and their kings will be horrified and shudder/shake because of your \add being destroyed\add*,
\q2 when I swing my sword in front of them.
\q1 At the time that you will be destroyed,
\q2 all of them will tremble,
\q2 fearing that they also will be killed.
\p
\v 11 This is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say:
\q1 The swords of \add the army of\add* the king of Babylon will strike you.
\q1
\v 12 I will cause very many of your people to be killed
\q2 by the swords of mighty soldiers \add from Babylonia\add*,
\q2 who are more ruthless/cruel than the soldiers of all other nations.
\q1 They will cause the people of Egypt to quit being proud,
\q2 because very many [HYP] of their people will be killed.
\q1
\v 13 I will destroy all the cattle in Egypt
\q2 that ◄graze/eat grass► alongside the streams.
\q1 As a result, the water in those streams will never again become muddy
\q2 because of people and cattle walking in them.
\q1
\v 14 Then I will allow the streams in Egypt to become calm again
\q2 and flow \add as smoothly\add* [SIM] as olive oil flows.
\b
\q1
\v 15 When I cause Egypt to become empty/desolate
\q2 and strip off everything that grows on the land,
\q1 and when I get rid of all the people who live there,
\q2 people will know that it is I, Yahweh, \add who have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*.’
\p
\v 16 That is the sad song that people will sing about Egypt.
\p Women of many nations will sing it;
\q2 they will chant it about Egypt and all its people;
\q2 \add that will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said that it would happen.”
\s1 Egypt will be destroyed
\p
\v 17 On the fifteenth day of that same month, Yahweh gave me another message. He said,
\p
\v 18 “You human, wail about the many people of Egypt, because I will send them to the place under the earth, where they and people of other mighty nations will be. I will send them there, along with others, down to the place where the dead are.
\v 19 Say to them, ‘You people of [APO] Egypt, \add you think that\add* [IRO, RHQ] you are more beautiful than the people of other nations. But you also will descend to the place where the godless dead people are.
\v 20 You will be killed along with many others who have been killed by \add their enemies'\add* swords. They have pulled out their swords, so a huge number of the people of Egypt will be dragged away.’
\v 21 In the place where the dead people are, mighty leaders \add of other countries\add* will \add make fun of the people of Egypt\add* and say, ‘They have come here to lie with us godless people who were killed by our enemies' swords!’
\p
\v 22 \add The corpses of the people of\add* Assyria and their army will be there. They will be surrounded by \add corpses of\add* others who were killed by \add their enemies'\add* swords.
\v 23 Their graves are there in the deep pit, and \add corpses of soldiers of\add* their army lie around their graves. Corpses of all those who had caused many others in other places to be terrified also will be there, having been killed by swords.
\p
\v 24 A great number of the people of Elam will be there. They also were killed by \add their enemies'\add* swords. They had caused people in many places [HYP] to be terrified. At that time they will lie there in that deep pit below the earth, and they, along with the others who have gone there, will be disgraced.
\p
\v 25 They will lie there among others who were slaughtered, surrounded by the graves of a huge crowd of other people. While they were alive, they caused people of other nations to be terrified; but they were godless, and now, having been killed by \add their enemies\add* swords, they will lie with others in that deep pit, disgraced, all of them avoided by others.
\p
\v 26 \add Corpses of\add* soldiers of Meshech and Tubal will be there, surrounded by the graves of a huge crowd of their people. While they were alive, they also caused people in many places to be terrified. They were all godless people who were killed by swords because while they were alive, they also caused people in many places [HYP] to be terrified. They will surely [RHQ] lie there, along with other godless soldiers who have died, whose shields were buried with their corpses, whose swords were placed on their skulls in the graves.
\v 27 While they were alive, they had caused many people in the land to be terrified, so they will be punished for their sins.
\p
\v 28 You king of Egypt, you also be killed and will lie there with other godless people who have been killed by \add their enemies'\add* swords.
\p
\v 29 People of the Edom people-group will be there, along with their kings and leaders. They were powerful, but they will \add be killed and\add* lie there in the place where the other dead people are. They will lie there in that deep pit, with the other godless people.
\p
\v 30 All the rulers of countries north \add of Israel\add*, including people from Sidon, will be there. Because of their power, they caused people to be terrified, but they will lie there. They were godless, and they will lie there along with others who were killed by \add their enemies'\add* swords. They, along with everyone else who descends into that deep pit, will be disgraced.
\p
\v 31 The king of Egypt and all his army will see them, and they will be comforted to know that there were other huge groups of people who were killed by \add their enemies'\add* swords.
\v 32 While he was living, I allowed him to cause others in many countries to be terrified, but he and his huge army will be there among other godless people who had been killed by \add their enemies'\add* swords. \add That will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh the Lord, am the one who has said \add that it would happen\add*.”
