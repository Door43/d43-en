\c 15
\s1 The people of Jerusalem are like useless grapevines
\p
\v 1 Yahweh gave me another message. He said,
\v 2 “You human, the wood of a grapevine is certainly not [RHQ] more useful that the branches of the trees in a forest.
\v 3 No one [RHQ] ever takes a branch of a grapevine and makes anything useful from it. No one [RHQ] even makes pegs from them to hang things on.
\v 4 And after a branch of a grapevine is thrown into a fire, and the fire burns both ends and chars/scorches the branch in the middle, will it then useful for anything?
\v 5 No; if it was not useful for anything before it was burned, it certainly cannot be \add made into something\add* useful after the fire has burned and charred it.
\p
\v 6 Therefore, this is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say: The wood of grapevines is useful only for fuel in a fire. Similarly, the people who live in Jerusalem \add are useless\add*.
\v 7 I will reject [IDI] them. \add It will be as though\add* they have escaped from a fire, but there will still be a fire will that will burn them up. And when I punish [EUP] them, you people who remain alive will know that I, Yahweh, \add have done it\add*.
\v 8 I will cause your country to become a wasteland because your people have not been loyal to me. That is what I, Yahweh, the Lord, say.”
