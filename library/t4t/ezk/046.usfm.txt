\c 46
\p
\v 1 This is also what I, Yahweh the Lord, declare: The east gateway of the inner courtyard must be shut during the six days in which you work each week, but on the Sabbath days and on the days when there is a new moon, the gateway must remain open.
\v 2 The king must enter the courtyard through the entry room of the gateway, and stand alongside the gatepost. Then the priests must sacrifice the animal that will be completely burned \add on the altar\add*, and also his offering to maintain fellowship with Yahweh. The king must worship Yahweh at the entrance of the gateway, and then he must go out. But the gateway will not be shut until that evening.
\v 3 On the Sabbath days and on the days when there is a new moon, the people must worship Yahweh at the entrance of the gateway.
\v 4 The offering that the king brings to be completely burned on the Sabbath day must be six male lambs and one ram, all with no defects.
\v 5 The offering that he gives with the ram must be a bushel of grain, and the grain that he offers with the lambs should be as much as he pleases, along with one quart/liter of olive oil for each bushel of grain.
\v 6 Then each day that there is a new moon, he must offer a young bull, six lambs and a ram, all with no defects.
\v 7 He must also provide one bushel of grain with the bull, one bushel of grain with the ram, and as much grain as he wants with the lambs, along with one quart/liter of olive oil with each bushel of grain.
\v 8 When the king enters the temple area, he must enter through the entry room of the gateway, and he must go out by the same way.
\p
\v 9 When the people come to worship Yahweh at the festivals that God has appointed, those who enter the temple area through the north gateway must go out through the south gateway. And those who enter through the south gateway must go out through the north gateway. People must not go out through the gateway through which they entered; they must go out through the opposite gateway.
\v 10 The king must go in when the other people go in, and go out when the people go out.
\p
\v 11 During the special feasts and sacred festivals, the king must present a bushel of grain along with a bull or a ram, and as much grain as he wants to with the lambs, along with one quart/liter of olive oil with each bushel of grain.
\v 12 When the king gives an offering that is not required, either one to be completely burned or an offering to maintain fellowship with Yahweh, the gateway on the east side must be opened for him. He must then present his offerings like he does on the Sabbath days. Then he will go out, and after he goes out, they must shut the gateway.
\p
\v 13 Every day, during the morning, someone must provide a one year-old lamb with no defects to be an offering to Yahweh that will be completely burned.
\v 14 Someone must also provide each morning an offering of flour. It must be one sixth of a bushel of flour mixed with one quart//liter of olive oil. You must never stop presenting these offerings of flour and olive oil to me, Yahweh, each day.
\v 15 The lamb and the offering of flour and olive oil must be presented every morning, to be completely burned on the altar.
\p
\v 16 This is what I, Yahweh the Lord, declare: If the king gives some of his land to one of his sons, to belong to him permanently, it will then eventually permanently belong to his son's descendants.
\v 17 However, if he gives some of his land to one of his servants, the servant is allowed to keep that land until the Year of Celebration. Then the king will own it again. But if the king gives land to his sons, that land will belong to them permanently.
\v 18 The king must not take any land that the people own and force them to live somewhere else. The land that he gives to his sons must be from his own property, \add not from anyone else's property\add*, in order that none of my people will be separated from his own property.’~”
\p
\v 19 Then, \add in the vision\add*, the man brought me through the entrance alongside the gateway to the sacred rooms on the north side, the rooms that belonged to the priests, and he showed me a place at the western end.
\v 20 He said to me, “This is the place where the priests will cook the meat of the offerings that people make because they failed to do what they promised Yahweh that they would do, and offerings to cause people to become acceptable to God, and where they will bake bread made with the flour brought as offerings. They will cook those things in their rooms in order to avoid bringing them into the outer courtyard \add to cook them there\add*, lest someone \add might be harmed by\add* touching them.”
\p
\v 21 Then the man brought me to the outer courtyard and led me around to its four corners. In each corner I saw an enclosed area;
\v 22 each was ◄70 ft./21.2 meters► long and ◄52-1/2 ft./15.9 meters► wide.
\v 23 Around the inside of each of these enclosed areas was a stone ledge, with places to make fires all around under the ledge.
\v 24 The man said to me, “These are the kitchens where \add the descendants of Levi\add* who work in the temple will cook the sacrifices that the people bring.”
