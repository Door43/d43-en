\c 27
\s1 The trade with Tyre
\p
\v 1 Yahweh said this to me:
\v 2 “You human, sing a funeral song about Tyre.
\v 3 The city of Tyre is located \add on an island\add* at the edge of the sea, and their merchants ◄traded/boughht and sold goods► with people-groups \add who live\add* along many seacoasts. This is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say that you should tell them:
\q1 You people of Tyre said that your city was very beautiful.
\q1
\v 4 You controlled what was bought and sold by people who lived along the sea.
\q2 Those who built your city caused it to become very beautiful.
\q1
\v 5 You were like [SIM] a huge ship
\q2 that was built from the from pine/cypress trees on Hermon Mountain.
\q1 Then they took cedar wood from Lebanon to make a mast for the ship.
\q1
\v 6 They carved your oars from oak trees from the Bashan \add region\add*.
\q1 They made the deck from cypress/pine wood from Cyprus \add island\add*,
\q2 and they covered the decks with ivory.
\q1
\v 7 The sails for the ship were made from fine embroidered linen from Egypt,
\q2 and those sails were like flags that people could see \add far away\add*.
\q1 For shade they \add hung pieces of\add* blue and purple cloth
\q2 \add brought\add* from \add people living on\add* Cyprus \add island\add*.
\q1
\v 8 Men from Sidon and Arvad \add cities\add* pulled the oars;
\q2 the men who steered the boat were skilled men from Tyre.
\q1
\v 9 Experienced craftsmen from Byblos \add city on the coast\add* ◄did the caulking/filled the holes in the sides ►of the ship.
\q2 Sailors from many countries came in their ships to buy and sell goods there.
\q1
\v 10 Men from far away in Persia, Lydia, and Libya were \add soldiers\add* in your army.
\q1 They hung their shields and helmets on the walls of your city,
\q2 and that caused people to admire your city.
\q1
\v 11 Men from Arvad and Helech \add cities\add* \add were watchmen\add* on your walls \add of your city\add*;
\q2 men from Gammad \add town\add* were in your towers.
\q1 They also hung their shields on your walls;
\q2 they also caused your city to be very beautiful.
\p
\v 12 Because of the many things that you had to sell, men from Tarshish \add in Spain\add* sent merchants to buy things from you, they brought silver, iron, tin, and lead to trade for things that you had.
\p
\v 13 Merchants from Greece, Tubal, and Meshech brought slaves and things made from bronze to trade for things that you had.
\p
\v 14 Men from Beth-Togarmah \add in Armenia\add* brought work horses, war horses, and mules to trade for things that you had.
\p
\v 15 Merchants came to you from Rhodes \add island\add*.
\q1 People from nations along the coast traded with you;
\q2 they brought ◄ivory/elephant tusks► and \add valuable black\add* ebony wood to trade for things that you had.
\p
\v 16 Because you had very many things to sell, people from Syria brought to you valuable turquoise stones, purple cloth, embroidered cloth, fine linen cloth, and \add jewelry made from\add* coral and rubies, to trade for your things.
\p
\v 17 Men from Judah and Israel brought wheat from Minnith \add city in Ammon\add* and figs, honey, olive oil, and ointment to trade for your things.
\p

\q1
\v 25 Cargo ships from Tarshish carried all those things that you sold;
\q2 and the warehouses on your island were full of all those things.”
\s1 The destruction of Tyre
\q1
\v 26 “The men who row your boats took \add the ships full of\add* cargo out to the stormy seas.
\q2 But the strong east wind has wrecked your cargo boats.
\q1
\v 27 Everything in the boats ◄was lost/sank to the bottom of the sea►—
\q2 all the valuable cargo [DOU] and the sailors and ship pilots,
\q1 the ship workers and merchants and soldiers.
\q1 On the day that the ships were wrecked
\q2 everyone on the ships sank to the bottom of the sea.
\q1
\v 28 The people in cities along the coast trembled
\q2 when they heard your ship pilots cry out.
\p
\q1
\v 29 All the men who pulled the oars left the ships;
\q2 the sailors and pilots go to the shore and stand on the beach.
\q1
\v 30 They cry aloud because of \add what has happened to\add* you,
\q2 and they weep bitterly.
\q1 They throw dirt on their heads
\q2 and roll around in ashes.
\q1
\v 31 They shave their heads to show that they are very sad because of what has happened to you,
\q2 and they put on rough sackcloth.
\q1 They weep for you very bitterly
\q2 and mourn for you.
\q1
\v 32 While they wail and mourn because of what has happened to you
\q2 they sing this sad funeral song:
\q1 ‘There was certainly never [RHQ] a city like Tyre
\q2 that now is silent,
\q2 covered by \add the waves of\add* the sea.’
\q1
\v 33 The goods that your merchants traded
\q2 were things that pleased the people of many countries.
\q1 Kings in very distant places became rich
\q2 from the money that they obtained from buying and selling with you.
\q1
\v 34 But now your ship is wrecked in the sea,
\q2 and everything that was in it is broken, at the bottom of the sea.
\q1 All of your cargo and your sailors have sunk to the bottom of the sea along with the ships.
\q1
\v 35 All the people who live along the seacoast are appalled/horrified
\q2 because of what has happened to you.
\q1 Their kings are very horrified,
\q2 causing their faces to be twisted as they watch.
\q1
\v 36 The merchants of the other nations shake their heads
\q2 \add because it is difficult for them to believe what has happened\add*;
\q1 now your city has disappeared,
\q2 and it will not exist anymore.”
