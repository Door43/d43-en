\s1 An illustration about Jerusalem being unfaithful
\p
\v 1 Yahweh gave me another message. He said,
\v 2 “You human, cause the people of Jerusalem to think about their detestable behavior.
\v 3 Say to them, ‘This is what Yahweh the Lord says to you people of Jerusalem: \add It is as though you are a woman who\add* [MET] was born in the country where the Canaan people-group lived. \add It is as though\add* [MET] your father belonged to the Amor people-group and your mother belonged to the Heth people-group.
\v 4 \add It is as though\add* [MET] on the day that you were born, your umbilical cord was not cut, and your body was not washed in water, and it was not rubbed with salt or wrapped in strips of cloth, \add like Israeli babies always are\add*.
\v 5 No one pitied you or acted kindly toward you by doing those things for you. Instead, \add it was as though\add* [MET] you were thrown into a field, because on the day that you were born, you were despised {everyone despised you}.
\p
\v 6 Then \add it was as though\add* [MET] I passed by and saw you lying in your own blood and kicking. And while you lay there kicking in your own blood, I said to you, “I want you to remain alive!”
\v 7 \add It was as though\add* I caused you to grow up, like plants in the field grow; you grew up and became tall and became like [MET] a very beautiful jewel. \add It was as though\add* [MET] your breasts ◄formed/became large►, and your hair became long, although you were still naked [DOU].
\p
\v 8 When I saw you several years later, \add it was as though\add* [MET] I saw that you were old enough to have sex [EUP]. So \add it was as though\add* [MET] I spread the corner of my robe over you \add to symbolize that I would marry you\add*, with the result that you were no longer naked. I solemnly promised \add that I would marry you\add* and made a marriage agreement with you, and you became my wife.’ That is what Yahweh the Lord says.
\p
\v 9 \add And then it was as though\add* [MET] I bathed you and washed the blood from you and put ointment on your body.
\v 10 \add It was as though\add* [MET] I put a fine linen robe on you and gave you other expensive clothes. I put an embroidered dress on you and put leather sandals on your feet.
\v 11 \add It was as though\add* [MET] I put bracelets on your arms and a necklace around your neck. Those things all had nice jewels fastened to them.
\v 12 I put a gold ring in your nose and fastened earrings to your ears and put a beautiful crown on your head.
\v 13 So \add it was as though\add* you wore gold and silver ornaments. You had clothes made from fine ◄linen/white cloth► and other expensive embroidered material/cloth. You ate \add bread made from\add* fine flour, honey, and olive oil. You became very beautiful, like [MET] a queen.
\v 14 You were very beautiful, with the result that people in other nations heard about you, because they knew that I, Yahweh the Lord, am the one who had caused you to become very beautiful.
\p
\v 15 But \add it was as though\add* [MET] you realized that because people knew that you were very beautiful, you could \add earn a lot of money by\add* becoming a prostitute. \add It was as though\add* you had sex with [EUP] every man who came along, and they all enjoyed your beauty.
\v 16 \add It was as though\add* you took some of your clothes to make beautifully decorated shrines, and that is where you had sex with those men. Those things should certainly never occur!
\v 17 You took the fine gold and silver jewelry that I gave you, and you made male idols for yourself, in order to have sex with (OR, worship) them.
\v 18 You took some of your embroidered clothes to put on those idols, and you burned oil and incense in front of them \add to honor them\add*.
\v 19 And the \add bread that was made from\add* fine flour and the olive oil and honey that I gave to you to eat, you offered to be a fragrant sacrifice to those idols. I, Yahweh the Lord, declare that that is what happened.
\p
\v 20 And you even took your sons and daughters who were \add as though they were\add* [MET] my children, and sacrificed them to be food for the idols. That was much worse [RHQ] than your becoming a prostitute.
\v 21 You slaughtered \add those who were like\add* [MET] my children, and offered them to be sacrifices to the gods!
\v 22 All during the time when you were acting like a prostitute and doing other detestable things, you did not think about the time when \add it was as though\add* you were very young, naked [DOU], lying in your own blood and kicking.
\p
\v 23 So I, Yahweh the Lord, declare that terrible things will happen to you. In addition to all the other wicked things that you did,
\v 24 you built a shrine to worship idols in every \add city\add* square/plaza.
\v 25 At the beginning of every street you built a shrine, and showed people your beautiful body, offering it to have sex with every man who walked by, becoming a better known prostitute every day.
\v 26 \add It was as though\add* [MET] you had sex with men from Egypt who were eager to have sex with you, men who lived near to Israel. You caused me to become very angry because you became more eager to have sex with more and more of them.
\v 27 So I punished [IDI] you and caused your enemies to capture some of your country. I enabled your greedy enemies from Philistia to defeat you; and even they were shocked because of your disgraceful behavior.
\v 28 \add It was as though\add* you had sex with soldiers from Assyria, too, because you always wanted more sex. And after that, you still were not satisfied.
\v 29 So you also had sex \add with soldiers from\add* Babylonia, a country full of merchants/businessmen, but even that did not satisfy you.
\p
\v 30 I, Yahweh the Lord, declare that when you did all those things, acting like [MET] a bold prostitute, you were showing that you were ready to do anything that you wanted to [IDI].
\v 31 When you built shrines to worship idols in every city square/plaza, and in every city square/plaza, you were not like a prostitute: Prostitutes charge money, but you refused to take money for what you did.
\p
\v 32 You are like [MET] a woman who commits adultery: You prefer to \add have sex with\add* strangers rather than with your husband.
\v 33 Prostitutes are paid, but \add it is as though\add* you give gifts to all your lovers; you bribe them to come to you from everywhere to have sex with you.
\v 34 So although you act like [MET] a prostitute, you are not like other prostitutes: no one needs to request you to have sex [EUP] with them. You are the opposite of other prostitutes; instead of them giving any money to you, you give men money to have sex with you.
\p
\v 35 Therefore, \add you people of\add* Jerusalem, who are like a prostitute [MET], listen to what Yahweh the Lord is saying about you!
\v 36 He says that \add what you have done is as though\add* [MET] you took off your clothes and acted like a prostitute and had sex with men who are not your husband. \add What I mean is\add* \add that you have been worshiping\add* detestable idols, and you have murdered [MTY] your own children to be sacrifices to them.
\v 37 So \add what I am going to do is as though\add* I will gather those who you think have loved you and those whom you hated. I will gather them around you \add to attack you\add*, and \add what I will do is as though\add* I will strip your clothes off you, and they will see you when you are completely naked.
\v 38 I will punish you like women who commit adultery and who murder people [MTY] are punished. I will get revenge on you and get rid of you because I am extremely angry with you.
\v 39 I will allow \add your enemies who you thought\add* loved you [IRO] to defeat you, and they will tear down your shrines. \add It will be as though\add* they will strip off your fancy clothes and take away your fine jewelry and cause you to be completely naked [DOU].
\v 40 They will bring a mob to attack you, and that mob will throw stones at you and cut you to pieces with their swords.
\v 41 They will burn down your houses and punish you while many women are watching.
\v 42 Then I will no longer be angry [DOU] with you. I will stop being jealous \add because of your worshiping gods other than me only\add*.
\p
\v 43 You have forgotten \add the wonderful things that I did for you\add* in previous years [MET]. You have caused me to become extremely angry because of all the \add evil things\add* that you have done. In addition to all the other detestable things that you did, you committed many sexual sins. So I Yahweh the Lord declare that I will punish you [IDI] for doing those things.
\p
\v 44 People who \add like to\add* quote proverbs will quote this proverb about you: ‘Daughters \add behave\add* like their mothers \add behave\add*.’
\v 45 You are like your mother; \add it was as though\add* she detested her husband and her children. You are like your sisters, who also despised their husbands and their children. \add It was as though\add* [MET] your father belonged to the Amor people-group and your mother belonged to the Heth people-group.
\v 46 And \add it was as though\add* [MET] your older sister was Samaria, and she and her daughters lived to the north of you, and \add it was as though\add* your younger sister was Sodom, and she her daughters lived to the south of you.
\v 47 You not only imitated all [DOU] their detestable behavior, but you quickly became more sinful than they were.
\v 48 I, Yahweh the Lord, solemnly declare that as surely as I am alive, \add the people who lived in\add* [MTY] Sodom and other nearby cities never did the detestable things that you \add people in Jerusalem and other places in Judah\add* have done.
\p
\v 49 These are the sins of \add the people who lived in\add* Sodom, who were like your sister [MET]: The people who lived there and in nearby cities were arrogant, they had more food to eat than they needed, and they refused to help the poor and needy [DOU] people among them.
\v 50 The people of Sodom and nearby cities [MET] were proud and did detestable things in my presence, so I got rid of them when I saw what they had been doing.
\v 51 Also, \add the people of\add* Samaria did not commit half as many sins as you commit. You have done more disgusting things than they have done. You cause the people of Samaria to appear to be good, compared to you.
\v 52 Your sins are worse than their sins, so they seem to be less wicked than you are. So I will punish you more than I punished them. As a result, you will be ashamed and disgraced [DOU].
\p
\v 53 However, \add some day\add* I will cause \add the people of\add* Sodom and Samaria and the cities near to them [MET] to prosper again. And I will cause you to prosper again, too.
\v 54 You will be very ashamed [DOU] of the wicked things that you have done, and that will cause the people +of those cities to be encouraged.
\v 55 \add The people of\add* Sodom and Samaria will prosper again, and you and the people in nearby cities will prosper also.
\v 56 You ◄sneered at/despised► \add the people of\add* Sodom when you were proud,
\v 57 before it was revealed that you were very wicked. And now \add the people of\add* Edom and \add the people of\add* Philistia all insult you and despise you.
\v 58 And you are being punished for all your immoral behavior and other detestable things that you do.
\p
\v 59 This is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say: I will continue to punish you like you deserve to be punished, because by rejecting the agreement that I made with you, you have despised that solemn agreement that you promised to obey.
\v 60 But I will not forget the agreement that I made with you long ago [MET], and I will make an agreement with you that will endure forever.
\v 61 Then you will think about what you have done, and you will be ashamed about those things when you welcome \add the people of\add* Sodom and Samaria, cities which are like [MET] older and younger sisters to you people of Jerusalem. I will \add put them under your control by\add* causing them to become like [MET] your daughters, but they will not have the same agreement that I will make with you.
\v 62 I will establish my agreement with you, and you will know that I, Yahweh, \add have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*.
\v 63 Then when I have forgiven you for all your sins, you will think about all the sins that you committed and you will be ashamed, and you will never again \add boast about them\add*, because you will be humiliated.”
