\c 31
\s1 Egypt is compared to defeated Assyria
\p
\v 1 Almost eleven years \add after we had been taken to Babylonia\add*, on the first day of the third month \add of that year\add*, Yahweh gave me another message. He said,
\v 2 “You human, say to the king of Egypt and all of his people,
\q1 ‘\add You think that\add* there is [RHQ, IRO] no country whose power is as great as the power of your country.
\q1
\v 3 You think that your country is as great as Assyria was:
\q2 Assyria was previously like [MET] a tall cedar tree in Lebanon;
\q1 it had big beautiful branches
\q2 that provided shade for \add other trees in\add* the forest.
\q1 It was very tall;
\q2 its top was above the leaves of the other trees.
\q1
\v 4 Water came from deep springs,
\q2 and as a result that cedar tree grew tall and very green.
\q1 Then water flowed around the base of the tree
\q2 into channels that took water to other nearby trees.
\q1
\v 5 That huge tree grew very tall,
\q2 higher than all the other trees around it.
\q1 Its branches grew very thick and long [DOU]
\q2 because of the abundant water \add at the base of the tree\add*.
\q1
\v 6 Birds built their nests in the branches,
\q2 and wild animals gave birth to their babies under those branches.
\q1 \add And it was as though people of\add* all the great nations lived in the shade of that tree.
\q1
\v 7 It was majestic and beautiful;
\q1 its branches spread out widely
\q2 because the roots of the tree grew down into the ground where there was a plentiful supply of water.
\q1
\v 8 The cedar trees in my garden \add in Eden\add* were not as great as that tree,
\q2 and the branches of the pine/cypress trees were not as long and thick as the branches of that cedar tree.
\q1 And the branches of the plane trees were not as long and thick, either.
\q2 No tree in my garden was as beautiful as that cedar tree.
\q1
\v 9 Because I caused that tree to become very beautiful
\q2 because of its magnificent green branches,
\q1 \add all the leaders of other countries represented by\add* [MET] those other trees in Eden envied \add the country represented by\add* that tree.’
\p
\v 10 Therefore, this is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say: ‘That tree, which \add represents Egypt\add*, grew very tall, and its top was higher than the other trees, and it became very proud because of being very tall.
\v 11 Therefore, I enabled another mighty nation to conquer it, and to destroy it as it deserved to be destroyed. I have already discarded it.
\v 12 A foreign army, one that has caused people of other nations to be terrified, cut it down and left it. Its branches fell on the mountains and in the valleys. Some of its branches lay broken in all the ravines in the land. All the people of other nations came out from being under its shade and left it.
\v 13 Birds ◄settled/went to live► on the fallen tree, and wild animals lived among its branches.
\v 14 The result of what I have done is that no other trees, even if they have plenty of water, will ever grow very high and become proud, and lift their tops above the branches of other trees. I do not want any other tree to grow high like that cedar tree did; trees will all certainly die and decay in the ground, like people die and go down to their graves.
\p
\v 15 This is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say: When that great tree was cut down, \add it was as though\add* the springs that watered it mourned for it, because I caused the plentiful water \add from the springs\add* to dry up. I caused \add the mountains in\add* Lebanon to become black, and all the trees there to wither.
\v 16 I caused the people of other nations to tremble when they heard that tree fall to the ground. \add They realized\add* that it would decay, like all people who die and are buried decay. And all the \add people represented by\add* other beautiful trees in my garden in Eden and in Lebanon, who were like beautiful trees that were very proud, ones which had roots that grew down deep into the \add ground where there was plenty of\add*water, were comforted when \add the king represented by\add* [MET] that cedar tree was there with them in the place where the dead people are.
\v 17 The \add people represented by \add* [MET] trees that grew in shade of the huge tree, \add the allies of\add* the great nation \add that the cedar tree represents\add*, had also died and gone down to where the dead people are.
\p
\v 18 \add This parable is about you\add* people of Egypt. \add You think that\add* [RHQ, IRO] there is no other nation that is as great and glorious as yours is. But your nation will also be destroyed, along with those other nations. Your people will be there among the other people who are not fit to worship me, people who have been killed by their enemies' swords. That is what will happen to the king of Egypt and all his people. \add That will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh, \add have predicted it\add*.’~”
