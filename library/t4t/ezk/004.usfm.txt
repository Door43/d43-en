\c 4
\s1 Ezekiel symbolized the coming destruction of Jerusalem
\p
\v 1 \add Yahweh also said to me\add*, “You human, take a large clay tablet/brick and put it in front of you. Then on the clay \add engrave/draw\add* on it lines that represent Jerusalem.
\v 2 Then \add draw figures around it to represent enemy soldiers who will\add* surround the city. Make mounds around it and a dirt ramp up against the wall \add around the city\add*. Set \add figures around it that represent\add* ◄battering rams/heavy logs that will break though the walls►.
\v 3 Then take an iron pan, and place it to be like an iron wall between you and \add the drawing of\add* the city. Then turn your face toward the drawing. It will symbolize that \add enemy troops will\add* surround the city to attack it. That will be a warning to the Israeli people [MTY].
\p
\v 4-5 Then lie on your left side, and stay like that for 390 days. That will \add symbolize that the Israeli people will be punished for\add* their sins; you must lie like that one day for each year during which they will be punished.
\p
\v 6 After that, lie down again. This time, lie on your right side for 40 days. That will \add symbolize that the Israeli people will be punished more\add* for their sins, one day for each more year \add during which they will be punished\add*.
\v 7 Turn your face toward \add the drawing of\add* Jerusalem and bare your arm \add like a soldier does who prepares to go into a battle\add* [MTY], and prophesy about \add what will happen to\add* the city.
\v 8 \add Youn will not be able to move; it will be as though\add* I have tied you with ropes in order that you cannot turn from one side to the other until you have finished \add symbolizing how many years the city\add* will be ◄besieged/surrounded by enemy soldiers►.
\p
\v 9 \add Before you do that\add*, take some wheat and barley, beans, lentils, and millet, and put them in a storage jar, and use that to bake bread \add for yourself\add*. That is what you will eat during the 390 days while you lie on your left side.
\v 10 You will eat ◄8 ounces/a small loaf► of bread each day.
\v 11 Also measure out ◄1.5 pints/0.6 liter► of water to drink each day.
\v 12 Eat that bread like you would eat a loaf of barley bread. But use your own dried dung for fuel to bake the bread while people are watching.
\v 13 That will symbolize that the Israeli people will be forced to eat food that is unacceptable to me when they are living in the nations to which I will force them to go.”
\p
\v 14 Then I said, “No, Yahweh God! \add Do not force me to do that\add*! I have never caused myself to become unacceptable to you. From the time when I was young, I have never eaten meat of any animal that was found dead or that had been killed by wild animals. And I have never eaten any meat that is unacceptable to you.”
\p
\v 15 Yahweh replied, “Okay, I will allow you to bake your bread using dried cow manure instead of human dung \add for fuel\add*.”
\p
\v 16 Then he said to me, “You human, I will cause the supply of food to Jerusalem to be cut off. Then the people will eat the small amounts of food and drink the small amounts of water \add that the government permits them to have\add*, and they will be very distressed and anxious as they do that,
\v 17 because water and food will be very scarce. They will see each other becoming extremely thin, and they will be appalled; but this will happen because \add they are being punished for\add* the sins \add that they have committed\add*.”
