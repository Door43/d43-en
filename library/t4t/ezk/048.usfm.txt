\s1 The division of the land
\p
\v 1 Here is a list of the tribes of Israel and the territory that each tribe is to receive. The northern boundary will extend east from the Mediterranean Sea east to Hethon \add city\add*, then to Hamath Pass, and on to Hazar-Enan south of Damascus, between Damascus and Hamath. Each tribe will be allotted land that will extend from the eastern boundary of Israel west to the Mediterranean Sea.
\p The tribe of Dan will receive land on the northern border of Israel.
\p
\v 2 South of their area will be the territory for the tribe of Asher.
\p
\v 3 South of their land will be territory for the tribe of Naphtali.
\p
\v 4 South of their land will be territory for the tribe of Manasseh.
\p
\v 5 South of their land will be territory for the tribe of Ephraim.
\p
\v 6 South of their land will be territory for the tribe of Reuben.
\p
\v 7 South of their land will be territory for the tribe of Judah.
\p
\v 8 South of their land will be an area set apart for special use. The temple will be in the center of this area.
\p
\v 9 It will be ◄8.3 (OR, 7) miles/13.3 km.► long and ◄6.7 (OR, 3) miles/10.6 km.► wide.
\v 10 For the priests, there will be a strip of land ◄8.3 miles/13.3 km.► wide and ◄3.3 miles/5.3 km.► wide, with the temple in the center.
\v 11 That area is for the priests who are descendants of Zadok. They are ones who served me faithfully and did not turn away from Yahweh like most of the descendants of Levi and the other Israeli people did.
\v 12 When the land is distributed, that area will be the priests' special portion, land that is very sacred. Next to the priests' territory will be where the other descendants of Levi will live.
\p
\v 13 The land that will be allotted to the descendants of Levi will be the same size as the land allotted to the priests. So together, these two portions of land will be ◄8.3 miles/13.3 km.► long and ◄6.7 miles/10.6 km.► wide.
\v 14 None of this special land may ever be sold or traded or used by other people, because it belongs to Yahweh. It is set apart for him.
\p
\v 15 Another strip of land ◄8.3 miles/13.3 km.► long and ◄1.7 miles/2.65 km.► wide will be allotted for use by other people, where they may build homes and have pasturelands, with a city at the center.
\v 16 The city will be square, ◄1.5 miles/2.4 km.► on each side.
\v 17 There will be an open area around the city, outside the sacred area, that will be 150 yards/meters in each direction.
\v 18 Outside the city there will be a farming area that will extend ◄3 miles/4.8 km.► to the east and ◄3 miles/4.8 km.► to the west. Men who work there [PRS] will produce food for the people who work in the city.
\v 19 Those who come from the various tribes to work in the city may also work on the farmland.
\v 20 This entire special area, including the sacred lands and the city, will be a square that is ◄8.3 miles/13.3 km.► on each side.
\p
\v 21 The areas to the east and to the west of the sacred land and the city will belong to the king. One area will extend east to the eastern boundary of Israel and the other will extend west to the Mediterranean Sea. The sacred area containing the temple will be in the middle.
\v 22 The area that belongs to the king will be between the tribe of Judah to the north and the tribe of Benjamin to the south.
\p
\v 23 South of that special area, each of the other tribes will be allotted one portion of land that extends from the eastern boundary of Israel west to the Mediterranean Sea.
\p On the north will be territory for the tribe of Benjamin.
\p
\v 24 South of their land will be territory for the tribe of Simeon.
\p
\v 25 South of their land will be territory for the tribe of Issachar.
\p
\v 26 South of their land will be territory for the tribe of Zebulun.
\p
\v 27 South of their land will be territory for the tribe of Gad.
\p
\v 28 The southern boundary of the tribe of Gad will extend south from En-Gedi to the springs at Meribah-Kadesh, and then to the west along the dry riverbed of Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea.
\p
\v 29 That is the land that you must allot to the tribes of Israel, to belong to them permanently. That is what I, Yahweh the Lord, declare.
\s1 The gates of the city
\p
\v 30 These will be the exits from the city: On the north side, which is ◄1.5 miles/2.4 km.► long,
\v 31 there will be three gates. They will all have different names; each one will have the name of one of the tribes of Israel. The first one will be named for Reuben, the next for Judah, the next for Levi.
\p
\v 32 On the east side, also ◄1.5 miles/2.4 km.► long, will be gates named for Joseph, Benjamin, and Dan.
\p
\v 33 On the south side, also ◄1.5 miles/2.4 km.► long, will be gates named for Simeon, Issachar, and Zebulun.
\p
\v 34 On the west side, also ◄1.5 miles/2.4 km.► long, will be gates named for Gad, Asher, and Naphtali.
\p
\v 35 The distance around the city will thus be ◄6 miles/9.6 km.►.
\p And from that time on, the name of the city will be 'Yahweh is there.'
