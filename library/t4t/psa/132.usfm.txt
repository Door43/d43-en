\c 132
\s1 A song to sing along the road up to Jerusalem
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, do not forget \add king\add* David
\q2 and all the hardships/troubles he endured!
\b
\q1
\v 2 He made a solemn promise to you,
\q2 the mighty God whom \add our ancestor\add* Jacob \add worshiped\add*.
\q1
\v 3 He said, “I will not go home,
\q1 I will not \add rest\add* on my bed,
\q1
\v 4 I will not sleep at all
\q1
\v 5 until I build a place for Yahweh,
\q2 a home for the mighty God whom Jacob \add worshiped\add*.”
\b
\q1
\v 6 In Bethlehem we heard news about the sacred chest.
\q2 We \add went and\add* found it in the fields of Jearim \add city, and we took it to Jerusalem\add*.
\q1
\v 7 \add Later we said\add*, “Let's go to the temple of Yahweh \add in Jerusalem\add*;
\q2 let's worship \add there\add* in front of the throne \add where he is sitting\add*.”
\q1
\v 8 Yahweh, come to the place where you live eternally,
\q2 to the place where your sacred chest is,
\q2 to that place that shows that you are very powerful.
\q1
\v 9 I want/desire that the righteous behavior of your priests \add will always be evident\add*,
\q2 \add just like the beautiful\add* robes that they wear [MET],
\q1 and that your people will always shout joyfully.
\b
\q1
\v 10 You chose David to serve you \add as king of Israel\add*;
\q2 do not reject/abandon him!
\b
\q1
\v 11 Yahweh, you made a solemn promise to David,
\q2 a promise that you will not ◄break/take back►.
\q1 You said, “I will cause your descendants to rule [MTY] as kings like you.
\q2
\v 12 If they obey my agreement with them
\q2 and obey all the commands that I will give them,
\q1 the line of kings descended from you will never end.”
\b
\q1
\v 13 Yahweh has chosen Jerusalem;
\q1 he has wanted to make that city his home;
\q1
\v 14 he said, “This is the city where I will live forever [DOU];
\q2 this is the place where I wanted to stay.
\q1
\v 15 I will give to the people of Jerusalem all that they need;
\q2 I will give enough food even to satisfy the poor people there.
\q1
\v 16 I will cause the priests \add to behave in a manner worthy of\add* ones whom I have saved;
\q2 \add that will be as evident as the beautiful\add* robes that they wear [MET];
\q2 and all my people who live there will shout joyfully.
\b
\q1
\v 17 There \add in Jerusalem\add* I will cause one of David's descendants [MET] to become a great king;
\q2 he also will be my chosen king,
\q1 and he will be like a \add bright\add* lamp [MET] \add that shines continually\add*.
\q1
\v 18 I will \add defeat his\add* enemies and cause them to be very ashamed/disgraced;
\q2 but the crown that my king wears will always shine.”
