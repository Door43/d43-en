\c 27
\s1 A psalm written by David
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh is the one who gives light \add to my soul/spirit\add* and the one who saves me,
\q2 so I do not [RHQ] need to be afraid of anyone.
\q1 Yahweh is the one to whom I go for refuge,
\q2 so I will never be afraid.
\q1
\v 2 When those who do evil come near me to attack me,
\q2 they stumble and fall down.
\q1
\v 3 Even if an army surrounds me,
\q2 I [SYN] will not be afraid.
\q1 Even if they attack me,
\q2 I will trust \add in God\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 4 There is one thing that I have requested from Yahweh;
\q2 this is the one thing that I desire:
\q1 that I may worship in Yahweh's house/temple every day during my life,
\q2 and see that Yahweh is wonderful
\q2 and inquire \add what he wants me to do\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 5 He will protect me when I have troubles;
\q2 he will keep me safe in his temple.
\q1 He will set me safely ◄on a high rock/in a secure place►.
\q1
\v 6 Then I will triumph over [IDI] my enemies.
\q1 I will shout joyfully as I offer sacrifices in his temple,
\q2 and I will praise Yahweh as I sing.
\b
\q1
\v 7 Yahweh, listen to me while I pray.
\q2 Act kindly toward me and answer my prayer.
\q1
\v 8 Within my inner being I heard you say, “Come and worship me [IDI],”
\q2 so, Yahweh, I will worship you.
\q1
\v 9 I am your servant;
\q2 Do not be angry with me and turn away from me.
\q2 You have always helped me.
\q1 You are the one who has saved me,
\q2 so do not abandon me now.
\q1
\v 10 Even if my father and mother desert me,
\q2 you will take care of [IDI] me.
\b
\q1
\v 11 Yahweh, teach me to do what you want me to do,
\q1 and lead me on a safe path
\q2 because I have many enemies.
\q1
\v 12 Do not allow my enemies to do to me what they want;
\q2 they say many false things about me and \add threaten to do\add* violent things to me.
\b
\q1
\v 13 But I know that because I trust in you
\q2 I will experience your being good to me as long as I live.
\q1
\v 14 So trust in Yahweh!
\q2 Be strong and courageous,
\q2 and wait expectantly for him \add to help you\add*!
