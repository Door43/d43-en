\v 1 God is the one who protects us and causes us to be strong;
\q2 he is always ready to help us when we have troubles.
\q1
\v 2 So, even if the earth shakes,
\q2 we will not be afraid.
\q1 Even if the mountains fall into the middle of the sea,
\q1
\v 3 and if the water in the sea roars and foams,
\q2 and the hills shake violently,
\q2 we will not be afraid!
\qr (Think about that!)
