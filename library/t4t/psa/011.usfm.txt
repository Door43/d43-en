\c 11
\s1 A psalm written by David for the choir director
\q1
\v 1 I trust that Yahweh will protect [MTY] me.
\q2 So do not [RHQ] say to me, “You need to escape/flee to the mountains like birds do,
\q1
\v 2 because wicked people have hidden in the darkness,
\q1 they have pulled back their bowstrings and aimed their arrows
\q2 to shoot them at godly/righteous [IDI] people.
\q1
\v 3 When people are not punished for disobeying the laws,
\q2 ◄what can righteous people do?/there is not much that righteous people can do.►” [RHQ]
\b
\q1
\v 4 But Yahweh is sitting on his throne in his sacred temple in heaven,
\q2 and he [SYN] watches everything that people do.
\q1
\v 5 Yahweh examines what righteous people do and what wicked people do,
\q2 and he hates those who like to perform violent actions \add to injure others\add*.
\q1
\v 6 He will send down \add from the sky\add* flaming coals and burning sulfur,
\q2 and send scorching hot winds to punish the wicked people.
\b
\q1
\v 7 Yahweh is righteous and he loves those who act righteously;
\q2 righteous people are able to come into his presence.
