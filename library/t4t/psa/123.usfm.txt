\c 123
\s1 A psalm written for people going up to the temple to worship
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, I look up toward you,
\q2 up to heaven, from where you rule.
\q1
\v 2 Like servants request [IDI] their masters \add for what they need\add*
\q1 and like maids request their mistresses \add for what they need\add*,
\q2 we request you, Yahweh our God, \add for what we need\add*,
\q2 and we request you to act mercifully toward us.
\b
\q1
\v 3 Yahweh, act very mercifully [DOU] toward us
\q2 because \add our enemies\add* have acted very contemptuously toward us.
\q1
\v 4 Rich people have made fun of us for a long time,
\q2 and proud people who have ◄oppressed/acted cruelly toward► us have acted toward us as though we were worthless.
