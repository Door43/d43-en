\c 140
\s1 A psalm written by David
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, rescue/save me from \add being attacked by\add* evil men;
\q2 and even more, ◄keep me safe/protect me► from being attacked by violent people.
\q1
\v 2 They are always planning to do evil things
\q2 and they are always inciting/urging people to start quarrels.
\q1
\v 3 By what they say [MTY] \add they injure people like\add* poisonous snakes do;
\q2 the words that they speak [MTY] \add can kill people as easily as\add* cobras/vipers do.
\qr (Think about that!)
\b
\q1
\v 4 Yahweh, protect me from the power [MTY] of wicked people.
\q2 Keep me safe from violent men who plan to ruin/defeat me [SYN].
\q1
\v 5 \add It is as though\add* proud people have set a trap for me;
\q2 \add it is as though\add* they have spread their nets to catch me;
\q2 \add it is as though\add* they have put these things along the road to catch/seize me.
\qr (Think about that!)
\b
\q1
\v 6 I say to you, “Yahweh, you are my God;”
\q2 so listen to me while I cry out to you to help me.
\q1
\v 7 Yahweh, my Lord, you are the one who defends me strongly;
\q2 you have \add protected me\add* during battles [MET] \add as though you had put a helmet on\add* my head.
\q1
\v 8 Yahweh, do not give to wicked people the things that they desire,
\q2 and do not allow them to do the \add evil things that\add* they plan to do.
\qr (Think about that!)
\b
\q1
\v 9 \add Do not allow\add* my enemies to ◄become proud/defeat me►;
\q2 cause the evil things that they say [MTY] they will do to me to happen to them, instead.
\q1
\v 10 Cause burning coals to fall on their \add heads\add*!
\q2 Cause them to be thrown into deep pits, from which they cannot climb out!
\q1
\v 11 Do not allow those who slander others to succeed;
\q2 cause evil things to happen to violent men and destroy them!
\b
\q1
\v 12 Yahweh, I know that you defend those who are oppressed,
\q2 and that you do what is just/fair for those who are needy/poor.
\q1
\v 13 Righteous people will surely thank you [MTY],
\q2 and they will live ◄in your presence/with you►.
