\c 82
\s1 A psalm written by Asaph
\q1
\v 1 God gathers all the \add rulers and judges who think they are\add* gods for a meeting in heaven;
\q2 and he tells them that he has decided this:
\q1
\v 2 “You must [RHQ] stop judging people unfairly;
\q1 you must no longer make decisions that favor wicked people!
\qr (Think about that!)
\q1
\v 3 You must defend people who are poor and orphans;
\q2 you must act fairly toward those who are needy and those who have no one to help them.
\q1
\v 4 Rescue them from the power [MTY] of evil people [DOU]!”
\b
\q1
\v 5 \add Those rulers\add* do not know or understand anything!
\q2 They are very corrupt/evil,
\q2 and \add as a result of their corrupt/evil behavior\add*,
\q2 \add it is as though\add* the foundation of the world is being shaken!
\b
\q1
\v 6 I \add previously\add* said to them, “You think you are gods!
\q1 \add It is as though\add* you are all my sons,
\q1
\v 7 but you will die like people do;
\q2 your lives will end, like the lives of all rulers end.”
\b
\q1
\v 8 God, arise and judge \add everyone on\add* [MTY] the earth,
\q2 because all the people-groups belong to you!
