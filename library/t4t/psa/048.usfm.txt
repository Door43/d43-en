\c 48
\s1 A psalm written by one of the descendants of Korah
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh is great, and he deserved to be greatly praised in the city where he \add lives\add*,
\q2 \add which is built on Zion\add*, his sacred hill.
\q1
\v 2 That city, on a high \add hill\add*, is beautiful;
\q2 it is the city where the true \add God\add*, the great king \add lives\add*,
\q2 and it causes people all over the world to rejoice \add when they see it\add*.
\q1
\v 3 God is in the strong towers there,
\q2 and he shows that he protects the people in that city.
\b
\q1
\v 4 Many kings gathered \add with their armies\add* to attack \add that city\add*,
\q1
\v 5 but when they saw it, they were amazed;
\q2 they became terrified, and ran away.
\q1
\v 6 Because they were very afraid, they trembled
\q2 like a woman who is about to give birth to a child;
\q1
\v 7 they shook like ships sailing from Tarshish are shaken by a strong wind.
\b
\q1
\v 8 We had heard \add that this city is glorious\add*,
\q1 and now we have seen that it is.
\q2 It is the city in which Yahweh, the one who is greater that all their gods, \add lives\add*.
\q2 It is the city which God will preserve/protect forever.
\qr (Think about that!)
\b
\q1
\v 9 God, here in your temple we think about your faithfully loving us.
\q1
\v 10 You [MTY] are famous and ◄are praised/people praise you► all over the earth,
\q2 because you rule powerfully [MTY] and justly.
\q1
\v 11 The people who live near Zion Hill should be happy!
\q1 The people in all the cities [MTY] of Judah should rejoice
\q2 because you judge people fairly.
\b
\q1
\v 12 \add You Israeli people should\add* walk around Zion \add Hill\add*
\q2 and count the towers there;
\q1
\v 13 notice the walls there and examine the forts
\q2 in order that you can tell about them to your children.
\q1
\v 14 \add Say to them\add*, “This is \add the city of\add* our God, \add the one who lives\add* forever;
\q2 he will guide us during all of our lives.”
