\c 126
\s1 A psalm written for people going up to the temple to worship
\q1
\v 1 When Yahweh brought \add us Israeli people\add* back to Jerusalem (OR, enabled us Israelis to prosper again),
\q1 \add it was wonderful\add*;
\q2 it seemed as though [SIM] we were dreaming.
\q1
\v 2 We were extremely happy
\q1 and we [SYN] continued shouting joyfully.
\q1 Then the other people-groups said about us,
\q2 “Yahweh has done great things for them!”
\q1
\v 3 \add And we say, “Yes\add*, Yahweh truly has done great things for us,
\q2 and we are very happy.”
\b
\q1
\v 4 But Yahweh, when it rains, water flows in the streams again \add after they were dry\add* [SIM].
\q2 Similarly, enable our nation to become great again like it was before.
\q1
\v 5 We cried when we planted \add seeds because it was hard work preparing the soil that had not been plowed for many years\add*;
\q1 \add now we want to\add* shout joyfully because we are gathering a big harvest.
\q1
\v 6 Those who cried as they carried the bags of seeds \add to the fields\add* will shout joyfully
\q2 when they bring the crops \add to their houses\add* at harvest time.
