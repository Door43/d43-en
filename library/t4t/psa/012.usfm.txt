\c 12
\s1 A psalm written by David for the choir director
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, help us!
\q2 \add It seems that\add* people who are loyal to you have all vanished.
\q1
\v 2 Everyone tells lies to other people;
\q2 they deceive others by ◄flattering them/saying good things about them that they know are not true►.
\b
\q1
\v 3 Yahweh, we wish that you would cut off their tongues
\q2 so that they cannot continue to boast.
\q1
\v 4 They say, “By telling lies we will get what we want;
\q2 we control what we say [MTY], so no one can tell us what we should not do!”
\b
\q1
\v 5 But Yahweh replies, “I have seen the violent things that they have done to helpless people;
\q2 and I have heard those people groaning,
\q2 so I will arise and rescue the people who are wanting me to help them.”
\b
\q1
\v 6 Yahweh, you always do what you have promised to do;
\q2 what you have promised is \add as precious and pure as\add* silver
\q2 that has been heated seven times in a furnace \add to get rid of all the\add* impure material.
\b
\q1
\v 7-8 Wicked people strut around \add proudly\add*,
\q2 and people praise them for doing vile/wicked deeds,
\q1 but Yahweh, \add we know that\add* you will protect/rescue us
\q2 from those wicked people.
