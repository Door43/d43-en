\c 30
\s1 A psalm written by David for the dedication of the temple
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, I praise you because you rescued me.
\q2 You did not allow \add me to die\add*,
\q2 \add with the result that\add* my enemies could gloat/rejoice.
\q1
\v 2 Yahweh, my God, I called out for you to help \add me when I was ill\add*,
\q2 and you healed me.
\q1
\v 3 You saved/restored me when I was dying [MTY].
\q2 I was nearly dead,
\q2 but you caused me to become healthy again.
\b
\q1
\v 4 All you who belong to Yahweh, sing to praise him!
\q2 Think about what God, the holy one, has done, and thank him!
\q1
\v 5 When he becomes angry, he is angry for only a very short time [HYP],
\q2 but he is good to us all of our life.
\q1 We may cry during the night,
\q2 but the next morning we will be joyful.
\b
\q1
\v 6 As for me, when I had no troubles, I said \add to myself\add*,
\q2 “No one will defeat me!”
\q1
\v 7 Yahweh, because you were good to me,
\q2 at first you caused me to be safe \add as though I was inside\add* [MET] a mountain.
\q1 But then \add I became ill, and I thought that\add* you had turned away from me,
\q2 and I became afraid.
\b
\q1
\v 8 Then I called out to you,
\q2 and I pleaded for you to help me.
\q1
\v 9 \add I said\add*, “Yahweh, what will you gain if I die [MTY]?
\q1 In what way will it benefit you if I go to the place where the dead people are [RHQ]?
\q1 Dead people are certainly not able to praise you [RHQ],
\q2 and they are not able to tell others that you are trustworthy [RHQ]!
\q1
\v 10 Yahweh, listen to me, and act mercifully to me!
\q2 Yahweh, help me!”
\b
\q1
\v 11 But \add now you have healed me\add*, and you have changed me from being sad to dancing \add joyfully\add*.
\q1 You have taken away the clothes that showed that I was very sad
\q2 and given me clothes that showed that I was very joyful.
\q1
\v 12 So I will not be silent;
\q2 I will sing out loudly to praise you.
\q1 Yahweh, you are my God,
\q2 and I will thank you forever.
