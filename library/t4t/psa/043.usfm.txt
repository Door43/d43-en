\c 43
\s1 (A continuation of psalm 42)
\q1
\v 1 God, declare that I ◄am innocent/have not done things that are wrong►.
\q1 Defend me when ◄ungodly people/people who do not worship you► say things against me,
\q2 rescue me from people who deceive and \add say things about me that are\add* not true.
\q1
\v 2 You are God, the one who protects me;
\q2 ◄why have you abandoned me?/it seems that you have abandoned me!► [RHQ]
\q1 It does not seem right that [RHQ] I am forced to mourn/cry constantly
\q2 because of my enemies acting cruelly toward me.
\q1
\v 3 Show your light to me and speak your truth to me;
\q1 and by your words guide me,
\q2 and take me back to Zion, your sacred hill \add at Jerusalem\add*,
\q2 and to \add your temple\add*, where you live.
\q1
\v 4 When you do that, I will go to your altar,
\q2 to \add worship you\add*, my God, who causes me to be extremely joyful.
\q2 There I will praise you, the God whom I \add worship\add*, while I play my harp.
\b
\q1
\v 5 So ◄why am I sad and discouraged?/I should not be sad and discouraged!► [RHQ]
\q1 I confidently expect God \add to bless me\add*,
\q2 and I will praise him again,
\q2 my God, the one who saves me.
