\c 130
\s1 A psalm written for people going up to the temple to worship
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, I have great troubles/difficulties, so I call out to you.
\q1
\v 2 Yahweh, hear me,
\q2 while I call out to you [SYN] to help me!
\b
\q1
\v 3 Yahweh, if you kept a record of the sins that we have committed,
\q2 not one of us [RHQ] would escape from being condemned \add and punished\add*!
\q1
\v 4 But you forgive us,
\q2 with the result that we have an awesome respect for you.
\b
\q1
\v 5 Yahweh has said \add that he would help/rescue me\add*;
\q2 I trust what he said, and I wait eagerly for him to do that.
\q1
\v 6 I wait for Yahweh \add to help me\add*
\q2 more than watchmen wait for the light to dawn;
\q2 yes, I wait more eagerly than they do!
\b
\q1
\v 7 You my fellow Israelis, confidently expect that Yahweh \add will bless us\add*.
\q2 He will bless us because he faithfully loves us,
\q2 and he is very willing to save/rescue us.
\q1
\v 8 And he will save us Israeli people from \add being punished for\add* all the sins that we have committed.
