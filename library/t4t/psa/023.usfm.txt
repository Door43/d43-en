\q1
\v 2 You ◄\add refresh my soul/encourage me\add*►

\q2 like a shepherd leads his sheep to places where is plenty of green grass \add for them to eat\add*,
\q2 and lets them rest beside streams where the water \add is flowing\add* slowly.

\v 3 You renew my strength.

\v 4 Even when I walking through very dangerous dark ravines
\q2 where I might ◄die/be killed►,
\q1 I will not be afraid of anything
\q2 because you are with me.
\q1 You protect me \add like a shepherd protects his sheep\add*.
\q2 He uses his club and his walking stick to protect them \add from being attacked by wild animals\add*.
\b
