\c 131
\s1 A psalm written by David for people going up to the temple to worship
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, I am not proud
\q2 and I have not thought highly about ◄myself/the things that I have done►.
\q1 And I do not worry about things \add that you have done\add* that are very big or very wonderful.
\q1
\v 2 Instead, I am calm and peaceful in my inner being,
\q2 like a small child who lies quietly at its mother's breast [SIM].
\q2 In the same way, I am peaceful within my inner being.
\b
\q1
\v 3 You my fellow Israelis, confidently expect that Yahweh \add will do good things for you\add*,
\q2 now and forever!
