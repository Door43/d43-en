\c 142
\s1 A psalm that David prayed when he was hiding in a cave
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, I cry out to you;
\q2 I plead that you will help me.
\q1
\v 2 I am bringing to you all my problems;
\q2 I am telling you all my troubles/difficulties.
\q1
\v 3 When I am very discouraged,
\q2 you know what I should do.
\b
\q1 Wherever I walk, \add it is as though\add* my enemies have hidden traps for me \add to fall into\add*.
\q1
\v 4 I look around,
\q2 but there is no one who sees me,
\q2 no one who will protect me,
\q2 no one who cares about \add what happens to\add* me.
\b
\q1
\v 5 So Yahweh, I cry out to you \add to help me\add*;
\q2 you are the one who protects me;
\q1 and you are all that I need while I am alive.
\q1
\v 6 Listen to me while I cry out to you for help
\q2 because I am very distressed.
\q1 Rescue/Save me from those who ◄persecute/cause trouble for► me,
\q2 because they are very strong,
\q2 with the result that I cannot \add escape from them\add*.
\q1
\v 7 Free/Rescue me from my troubles/difficulties [MET]
\q2 in order that I may thank you.
\b
\q1 If you do that, when I am with godly/righteous people,
\q2 \add I will praise you\add* for having been very good to me.
