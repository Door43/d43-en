\c 143
\s1 A psalm written by David
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, hear me while I pray to you!
\q2 Because you are righteous
\q2 and because you faithfully do what you have promised,
\q2 listen to what I am pleading that you \add do for me\add*.
\q1
\v 2 I am one who serves you;
\q1 do not judge me,
\q2 because you do not consider anyone to ◄be completely innocent/never have done anything that is wrong►.
\b
\q1
\v 3 My enemies have pursued me;
\q2 they have completely defeated me.
\q1 \add It is as though\add* they have put me in a dark prison,
\q1 where I \add have nothing good to\add* ◄\add hope for/expect\add*►, like those who died long ago [SIM].
\q1
\v 4 So I am very discouraged in my inner being;
\q2 I am very dismayed/worried.
\b
\q1
\v 5 I remember what has happened previously:
\q2 I ◄meditate on/think about► all the things that you have done;
\q1 I consider all the great deeds that you [SYN] have performed.
\q1
\v 6 I lift up my hands/arms to you while I pray;
\q2 I [SYN] need you, like very dry ground \add needs rain\add* [SIM].
\qr (Think about that!)
\b
\q1
\v 7 Yahweh, I am very discouraged,
\q2 so please answer me right now!
\q1 Do not hide from me,
\q2 because if you do that, I will soon be [SIM] among those who descend to where the dead people are.
\q1
\v 8 Every morning cause me to remember that you faithfully love me,
\q2 because I trust in you.
\q1 I ◄pray/send my prayers up [IDI]► to you;
\q2 show me the things that I should do.
\q1
\v 9 Yahweh, I have gone/run to you to be protected,
\q2 so rescue me from my enemies.
\q1
\v 10 You are my God;
\q2 teach me to do what you want me to do.
\q1 I want your good Spirit to lead me on a path that is not difficult to walk on.
\b
\q1
\v 11 Yahweh, restore me when I am close to dying, as you promised to do.
\q2 Because you are righteous/good, rescue me from my troubles/difficulties!
\q1
\v 12 I am one who serves you;
\q1 so because you faithfully love me,
\q2 kill my enemies
\q2 and get rid of all those who ◄oppress/cause trouble for► me.
