\c 26
\s1 A psalm written by David
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, show that I ◄am innocent/have not done what is wrong►.
\q1 I always do what is right;
\q2 I have trusted in you and never doubted \add that you would help me\add*.
\q1
\v 2 Yahweh, examine what I have done and test me;
\q2 thoroughly evaluate what I think in my inner being [IDI].
\q1
\v 3 I never forget that you faithfully love me,
\q2 I conduct my life according to your truth.
\q1
\v 4 I do not spend my time with liars
\q2 and I stay away from hypocrites.
\q1
\v 5 I do not like to be with evil people,
\q2 and I avoid wicked people
\q1
\v 6 Yahweh, I wash my hands to show that I ◄am innocent/have not done what was wrong►.
\q1 As I join with others marching around your altar,
\q1
\v 7 we sing songs to say that we thank you,
\q2 and we tell others the wonderful things that you \add have done\add*.
\q1
\v 8 Yahweh, I love \add to be in\add* the temple where you live,
\q2 in the place where your glory appears.
\b
\q1
\v 9 Do not get rid of me like you get rid of sinners;
\q2 do not cause me to die like you cause those who murder [MTY] people to die,
\q1
\v 10 and people who [SYN] are ready to do wicked things
\q2 and people who are always taking bribes.
\q1
\v 11 But as for me, I always try to do what is right.
\q2 So act kindly toward me and rescue me.
\b
\q1
\v 12 I stand in places where I am safe,
\q2 and when all your people gather together, I praise you.
