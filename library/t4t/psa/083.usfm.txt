\c 83
\s1 A psalm which is a song written by Asaph
\q1
\v 1 God, do not continue to be silent!
\q1 Do not be quiet and say nothing,
\q1
\v 2 because your enemies are rioting against you;
\q2 those who hate you are rebelling against you!
\q1
\v 3 They are secretly planning to do things to harm us, your people;
\q2 they are ◄conspiring together against/planning how to defeat► the people whom you protect.
\q1
\v 4 They say, “Come, we must destroy their nation,
\q2 with the result that no one will remember that Israel ever existed!”
\q1
\v 5 They have agreed on \add what they want to do to destroy Israel\add*,
\q2 and they have formed an agreement against you.
\q1
\v 6 \add The people who have done that are\add* the people of Edom \add region\add*,
\q2 and the descendants of Ishmael \add who live on the east side of the Jordan River\add*,
\q2 and the Moab people-group, and the descendants of Hagar \add who also live on the east side of the Jordan River\add*,
\q2
\v 7 the Gebal people-group, and the Ammon people-group, and the Amalek people-group,
\q2 and the Philistia people-group, and the people of Tyre \add city\add*.
\q2
\v 8 The people of Assyria have joined them;
\q2 they are strong allies of the Moab and Ammon people-groups, who are descendants of \add Abraham's nephew\add* Lot.
\qr (Think about that!)
\b
\q1
\v 9 \add God\add*, do to those people things like you did to the Midian people-group,
\q2 like you did to Sisera and Jabin at Kishon River.
\q1
\v 10 You destroyed them at Endor \add town\add*,
\q2 and their corpses \add lay on\add* the ground and decayed.
\q1
\v 11 Do to them things like you did to \add Kings\add* Oreb and Zeeb;
\q2 defeat their leaders like you defeated Zebah and Zalmunna,
\q2
\v 12 who said, “We will take for ourselves the land that \add the Israelis say\add* belongs to God!”
\b
\q1
\v 13 My God, cause them \add to disappear quickly\add* like whirling dust,
\q2 like chaff that the wind blows away!
\q1
\v 14 Like a fire completely burns a forest
\q1 and like flames burn in the mountains,
\q1
\v 15 expel them with your storms
\q2 and cause them to be terrified by your big storms/hurricanes!
\q1
\v 16 Cause them [SYN] to be very ashamed
\q2 in order that they will admit that you are very powerful.
\q1
\v 17 Cause them to be forever disgraced \add because of being defeated\add*,
\q1 and cause them to die while they are still disgraced.
\q1
\v 18 Cause them to know that you, whose name is Yahweh,
\q2 are the supreme ruler over everything on the earth.
