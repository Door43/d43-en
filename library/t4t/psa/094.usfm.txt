\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, you are able to get revenge \add on your enemies\add*.
\q2 So show them that you are going to punish them!
\b
\q1
\v 2 You are the one who judges all \add people on\add* the earth;
\q1 so arise, and give/punish the proud \add leaders of our\add* people what/like they deserve.
\q1
\v 3 Yahweh, how long will those wicked people be glad/happy?
\q2 It is not right that [RHQ] they continue being glad!
\b
\q1
\v 4 They do evil things, and they boast about doing them;
\q2 how long will they \add be allowed to\add* continue doing that?
\q1
\v 5 Yahweh, \add it is as though\add* those wicked people crush us, your people;
\q2 they ◄oppress/treat cruelly► those who belong to you [DOU].
\q1
\v 6 They murder widows and orphans
\q2 and people from other countries who \add think it is safe to\add* live in our land.
\q2
\v 7 Those wicked people say, “Yahweh does not see anything;
\q2 so the God whom those Israelis \add worship\add* does not see \add the evil things that we do\add*.”
\b
\q1
\v 8 You evil people \add who rule Israel\add*, you are foolish and stupid;
\q2 when will you become wise [RHQ]?
\q1
\v 9 God made our ears;
\q2 so \add do you think that\add* he cannot hear \add what you say\add* [RHQ]?
\q1 He created our eyes;
\q2 so do you think that he cannot see \add the evil things that you do\add* [RHQ]?
\q1
\v 10 He scolds \add the leaders of\add* \add other\add* nations;
\q2 so do you think that he will not punish \add you\add* [RHQ]?
\q1 He is the one who knows everything;
\q2 \add so why do you think that he does not know what you do\add* [RHQ]?
\q2
\v 11 Yahweh knows \add everything\add* that people are thinking;
\q2 he knows that what they think ◄\add is useless/vanishes as quickly as\add*► smoke [MET].
\b
\q1
\v 12 Yahweh, you are pleased with people who \add want you to\add* discipline/correct them,
\q2 with people who \add want you to\add* teach them your laws.
\q1
\v 13 When those people have had troubles, you cause those troubles to cease,
\q1 and some day \add it will be as though\add* you will dig pits for the wicked people,
\q2 and they will fall into those pits \add and die\add*.
\q1
\v 14 Yahweh will not abandon his people;
\q2 he will not desert those who belong to him [DOU].
\q1
\v 15 \add Some day\add* judges will decide matters fairly for people,
\q2 and all honest/righteous people will be pleased about that.
\b
\q1
\v 16 But when wicked people ◄\add oppressed me/treated me cruelly\add*►,
\q1 ◄who defended me?/no one defended me.► [RHQ]
\q2 No one stood up to testify for me against those evil people [RHQ].
\q1
\v 17 If Yahweh had not helped me \add at that time\add*,
\q2 \add I would have been executed\add*,
\q2 \add and\add* my soul/spirit would have gone to the place where \add dead people\add* say nothing.
\q1
\v 18 I said/thought \add to myself\add*, “I am ◄falling/about to die►,”
\q2 but Yahweh, you held me up by faithfully loving me.
\q1
\v 19 Whenever I am very worried,
\q2 you comfort/encourage me and cause me to be happy.
\b
\q1
\v 20 You have nothing to do with wicked judges,
\q2 who establish laws that allow people to do what is not legal.
\q1
\v 21 They plan to get rid of righteous people,
\q1 and they declare that ◄innocent people/people who have not done what is wrong► must be executed.
\q1
\v 22 But Yahweh ◄has become like my fortress/protects me► [MET];
\q2 my God is like a huge rock under which I am protected/safe [MET].
\q1
\v 23 He will punish those wicked leaders in return for the wicked things that they have done,
\q2 and will get rid of them for the sins that they have committed;
\q2 yes, Yahweh our God will ◄wipe them out/destroy them completely►.
