\c 32
\s1 A psalm written by David, which will help people to be wise
\q1
\v 1 Those whom God has forgiven for rebelling against him,
\q2 whose stains of sin have been wiped away,
\q2 are truly blessed \add by God\add*!
\q1
\v 2 Those whose record of their sins Yahweh has erased,
\q2 those who no longer do deceitful things,
\q2 are truly blessed \add by God\add*!
\b
\q1
\v 3 When I did not confess my sins,
\q2 ◄my body/I► was very weak and sick,
\q2 and I groaned ◄all day long/continually►.
\q1
\v 4 Day and night, \add Yahweh\add*, you [SYN] punished me severely.
\q2 My strength disappeared like \add water that\add* ◄\add evaporates/dries up\add*► on a hot summer \add day\add*.
\qr (Think about that!)
\q1
\v 5 Then/Finally I admitted/confessed my sins to you;
\q2 I stopped trying to hide them.
\qr (Think about that!)
\q1 I said \add to myself\add*,
\q2 “I will confess to Yahweh the wrong things that I have done.”
\q1 And \add when I confessed them\add*, you forgave me,
\q2 so now I ◄am no longer guilty/will no longer be punished► for my sins.
\b
\q1
\v 6 Therefore, the people who are godly should pray to you
\q2 \add when they\add* ◄\add realize that they have sinned/have difficulties\add*►.
\q1 If they do that, \add difficulties\add* [MET] will not come upon them like a great flood.
\q1
\v 7 You are \add like\add* a place where I can hide \add from my enemies\add* [MET],
\q2 you protect me from troubles,
\q2 and you ◄enable me/\add put people around me who will enable me\add*► to shout, praising you for saving me \add from my enemies\add*.
\qr (Think about that!)
\b
\q1
\v 8 \add Yahweh says\add*, “I will instruct you about how you should conduct your life.
\q2 I will teach you and watch over you.
\q1
\v 9 Do not be stupid like horses and mules that do not have understanding;
\q2 they need ◄bits/pieces of metal put in their mouths► and ◄bridles/ropes fastened to their head►
\q2 so they will go in the direction you want them to go.”
\q1
\v 10 Wicked people will have many \add troubles that will make them\add* sad,
\q2 but those who trust in Yahweh will experience him faithfully loving them all the time.
\b
\q1
\v 11 So, all you righteous people, rejoice about what Yahweh \add has done for you\add*;
\q2 you whose ◄inner beings/lives► are pure, be glad and shout joyfully!
