\s1 Written by David
\q1
\v 1 I praise Yahweh, who is like a huge rock \add under which I\add* ◄\add get refuge/am protected\add*►!
\q1 He trains my hands so that I can use them to fight battles;
\q2 he trains my fingers so that I can \add shoot arrows in a war\add*.
\q1
\v 2 He is the one who protects me;
\q2 he is like a fortress [DOU] in which I am safe,
\q2 he protects me like shields \add protect soldiers\add* [MET],
\q2 and he gives me refuge.
\q1 He defeats other nations and then puts them under my power.
\b
\q1
\v 3 Yahweh, we people are \add very insignificant/unimportant\add*, so why ◄are you concerned/do you care about us► [RHQ]?
\q1 \add It is amazing to me that\add* you pay attention to humans.
\q1
\v 4 \add The time that we live is as short\add* as [SIM] a puff of wind;

\b
\q1
\v 5 Yahweh, ◄tear open/open up► the sky and come down!

\v 6 Cause lightning to flash with the result that your enemies will run away!

\q1
\v 7 \add It is as though my enemies are like\add* a flood around me;
\q2 reach your hand down from heaven
\q1 and rescue me from them [SYN].
\q1 They are men from other countries
\q1
\v 8 who [SYN] always tell lies.
\q1 \add Even in a courtroom where\add*
\q2 they tell lies.
\b
\q1
\v 9 God, I will sing a new song to you,

\b
\q1
\v 11 \add So I ask you to\add* save me from \add being killed by\add* the swords that those evil people carry.
\q1 Rescue me from the power [MTY] of those foreigners
\q2 who [SYN] always tell lies,
\q2 and who raise their right hands \add in courtrooms when they solemnly declare that they will tell the truth\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 12 I wish/hope that our young sons will grow up to be like strong plants [SIM],
\q1 and I wish/hope that our daughters will grow up to be \add straight and tall\add*
\q2 like the pillars [SIM] that stand in the corners of palaces.
\q1
\v 13 I wish/hope that our barns will be full of many different crops.

\q1
\v 14 I wish/hope that our cows will give birth to many calves
\q2 without having any miscarriages or deaths when they are born (OR, that no enemies will break through our city walls and take us ◄into exile/to their own countries►).
\q1 I wish/hope that \add there will not be a time when\add* the people in our streets cry out in distress
\q2 \add because foreign armies are invading\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 15 If good things like that happen to a nation,
\q2 the people will be very happy.
\q1 The people whose God is Yahweh are the ones who will be happy!
