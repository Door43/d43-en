\c 124
\s1 A psalm written by David for people going up to the temple to worship
\q1
\v 1 You Israeli people, \add answer this question:\add*
\q1 What \add would have happened to us\add* if Yahweh had not been ◄helping/fighting for► us?
\q1
\v 2 When \add our enemies\add* attacked us,
\q1 if Yahweh had not been fighting for us,
\q1
\v 3 we would have all been killed [IDI]
\q2 because they were very angry with us!
\q1
\v 4 They would have been like [MET] a flood that swept/carried us away;
\q1 \add it would have been as though\add* the water would have covered us,
\q2
\v 5 and we would all have drowned in the flood that was ◄raging/flowing very fast►.
\b
\q1
\v 6 But praise Yahweh
\q2 because he has not allowed our \add enemies to destroy us\add*
\q2 \add like wild animals\add* [MET] tear apart \add the creatures that they capture\add*.
\q1
\v 7 We have escaped \add from our enemies\add* like a bird escapes from the trap that hunters have set;
\q1 \add it is as though\add* the trap \add that our enemies set for us\add* was broken
\q2 and we have escaped from it!
\q1
\v 8 Yahweh is the one who helps us [MTY];
\q2 he is the one who made heaven and the earth.
