\s1 A psalm written by David for the choir director, concerning the time when the prophet Nathan rebuked David after he had committed adultery with Bathsheba
\q1
\v 1 O God, act mercifully toward me,
\q2 because you love me faithfully;
\q2 because you are very merciful,
\q2 erase \add the record of\add* the ways that I disobeyed you!
\q1
\v 2 Make me pure from the wrong things that I have done;
\q2 make me clean from \add the guilt of\add* my sin.
\b
\q1
\v 3 \add I say that\add* because I know the ways that I have disobeyed you;
\q2 I cannot forget them.
\q1
\v 4 You, you only, are the one I that have really sinned against,
\q2 and you have seen the evil things that I have done.
\q1 When you say that I am guilty, you are right/correct,
\q2 and when you judge me, you justly say \add that I deserve to be punished\add*.
\q1
\v 5 I have been a sinner since the day that I was born;
\q2 truly, I have been like that since my mother conceived me.
\q1
\v 6 What you desire is that in my inner being I desire what is true
\q2 in order that you can teach me in my inner being how to act wisely.
\b
\q1
\v 7 Purify me from the guilt of my sins, and after that happens, I will be clean \add in my inner being\add*;
\q2 cleanse me, and then \add in my inner being\add* I will be ◄whiter than snow/very clean►.
\q1
\v 8 Allow/Cause me to be joyful [DOU] again;
\q2 you have ◄crushed my spirit/completely discouraged me► [MTY];
\q1 but now let me rejoice again.
\q1
\v 9 Do not continue to look at the sins [IDI] that I have committed;
\q2 erase the record of the evil things that I have done.
\b
\q1
\v 10 O God, cause my inner being to be pure.
\q2 Put a new and faithful spirit within me.
\q1
\v 11 Do not send me away from you \add because of my sin\add*,
\q2 and do not take your Holy Spirit from me.
\q1
\v 12 Cause/Allow me to be happy again because of \add knowing\add* that you have freed me \add from the guilt of my sin\add*,
\q2 and make my spirit willing \add to obey you\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 13 If you do that, I will \add be able to\add* teach to \add other\add* sinners what you want them to do,
\q2 and they will repent and begin to obey you.
\q1
\v 14 O God, you are the one who saves me;
\q2 forgive me for being guilty of causing someone \add who was not my enemy\add* to die.
\q2 When you do that, I will sing joyfully about your being very good and righteous.
\q1
\v 15 O Yahweh, help me to speak
\q2 in order that I may praise you.
\q1
\v 16 You are not pleased \add only\add* with the sacrifices \add that people bring to you\add*.
\q2 If that was \add enough to\add* please you, I would bring you sacrifices.
\q1 You are not pleased with burnt offerings \add alone\add*.
\q1
\v 17 The sacrifice that you really want is for people to be truly humble and sorry \add for having sinned\add*;
\q2 O God, you will not refuse that kind of sacrifice.
\b
\q1
\v 18 O God, be good to \add the people who live in\add* Jerusalem [MTY],
\q2 \add and help them\add* to rebuild the city walls.
\q1
\v 19 When that happens, \add they will bring you\add* the proper sacrifices,
\q2 animals that they completely burn,
\q2 young bulls that they burn on your altar
\q2 and you will be pleased.
