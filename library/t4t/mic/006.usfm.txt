\c 6
\s1 Yahweh accuses his people
\p
\v 1 Pay attention to what Yahweh says \add to you Israeli people\add*:
\q1 “Stand up \add in court\add* and state what you are accusing me about.
\q2 And allow the hills and mountains to hear what you will say.
\q1
\v 2 But then you mountains must also listen carefully [DOU] to what I, Yahweh, am complaining \add about my people\add*.
\q2 I have something to say about what [DOU] my Israeli people are doing that displeases me.
\b
\q1
\v 3 My people, what have I done to \add cause trouble for\add* you [RHQ]?
\q2 What have I done to cause you to experience difficulties?
\q1 Answer me!
\q1
\v 4 I \add did great things for your ancestors\add*;
\q2 I brought them out of Egypt;
\q2 I rescued them from that land where they were slaves.
\q1 I sent Moses to \add lead\add* them,
\q2 and \add his older brother\add* Aaron and \add his older sister\add* Miriam.
\q1
\v 5 My people, think about when Balak, the king of Moab, requested Beor's son Balaam \add to curse your ancestors\add*,
\q2 and think about what Balaam replied.
\q1 Think about \add how your ancestors crossed the Jordan River miraculously while\add* they were traveling from Acacia to Gilgal.
\q2 Think about those things in order that you may know that I, Yahweh, do what is right.”
\b
\q1
\v 6 \add The Israeli people ask\add*, “What shall we bring to Yahweh \add who lives in\add* heaven
\q2 when we come to him and bow down before him?
\q1 Should we bring calves that are a year-old
\q2 that will be offerings that will be \add killed and\add* completely burned \add on the altar\add*?
\q1
\v 7 Will Yahweh be pleased \add if we offer to him\add* a thousand rams
\q2 and ten thousand streams of \add olive\add* oil?
\q1 Should we offer our firstborn children \add to be sacrifices\add*
\q2 to pay for the sins that we have committed [DOU]?”
\q1
\v 8 \add No, because\add* he has shown each of us what is good to do;
\q2 he has shown [RHQ] us what he requires each of us to do:
\q1 he wants us to do what is just/fair and to love to act mercifully toward others,
\q2 and he wants us to live humbly \add while we fellowship\add* with him, our God.
\s1 The people of Israel are guilty and must be punished
\q1
\v 9 “I am Yahweh, so if you are wise, you should revere me.
\q2 I am calling out to \add you people of\add* Jerusalem,
\q1 ‘The armies [MET] that will destroy your city are coming,
\q2 so pay careful attention to me, the one who is causing them to punish you with my rod.
\q1
\v 10 Do you think that [RHQ] I should forget that you wicked people filled your homes with valuable things
\q2 that you acquired by cheating others?
\q1 Do you think that [RHQ] I should forget that you used false measures \add when you bought and sold things\add*?
\q2 Those are things that I hate.
\q1
\v 11 \add Do you think\add* that [RHQ] I should say nothing about people who use scales that do not weigh correctly,
\q2 and who use weights that are not accurate?
\q1
\v 12 The rich people among you always act violently \add to get money from poor people\add*.
\q2 All of the people \add in Jerusalem\add* are liars,
\q2 and they [SYN] always deceive people.
\q1
\v 13 Therefore, I have already begun to get rid of you,
\q2 to ruin you because of the sins that you have committed.
\q1
\v 14 \add Soon\add* you will eat food, but you will not have enough to satisfy you;
\q2 your stomachs will \add still feel as though they are\add* empty.
\q1 You will try to save up \add money\add*,
\q2 but you will be able to save nothing,
\q1 because I will send your enemies to take it from you in wars [MTY].
\q1
\v 15 You will plant \add crops/seed\add*,
\q2 but you will not harvest anything.
\q1 You will press olives,
\q2 but \add others\add*, not you, will use the olive oil.
\q1 You will trample on the grapes \add and make wine from the juice\add*,
\q2 but \add others\add*, not you, will drink the wine.
\q1
\v 16 \add Those things will happen to you because\add* you obey only the wicked laws of \add King\add* Omri,
\q2 and \add you do the terrible things that wicked King\add* Ahab and his descendants commanded.
\q1 So, I will destroy your country,
\q2 and I will cause your people to be despised;
\q2 people of other nations will insult you.’~”
