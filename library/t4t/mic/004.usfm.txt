\c 4
\s1 Yahweh's future rule
\p
\v 1 Yahweh says that some day his temple will be on top of a mountain,
\q1 and that mountain will be the most important [MET] one on the earth;
\q2 it will be \add as though it is\add* higher than all the hills,
\q1 and huge groups of people from all over the world will come there \add to worship\add*.
\p
\v 2 People from many nations will say to each other,
\q1 “Let's go to the mountain where Yahweh is,
\q2 to the temple where we can worship the God whom Jacob \add worshiped\add*.
\q1 There he will teach us how he wants us to conduct our lives,
\q2 and we will do what he wants us to do.”
\q1 Zion \add Hill\add* is the place where he will teach people;
\q2 and \add people will\add* go out from Jerusalem \add to tell others\add* his messages.
\q1
\v 3 Yahweh will settle disputes between many people,
\q2 and he will also settle disputes between powerful nations that are far away.
\q1 Then people will hammer their swords to cause them to become plow blades,
\q2 and hammer their spears to cause them to become pruning knives.
\q1 \add Armies of\add* nations will no longer fight against \add armies of other\add* nations,
\q2 and they will no longer train \add men how to fight\add* in wars.
\q1
\v 4 Everyone will sit \add peacefully\add* under his own grapevines,
\q2 and under his own fig trees;
\q1 no one will cause them to be afraid.
\q2 \add That is what will surely happen\add* because the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels has said it.
\q1
\v 5 Many of [HYP] \add the people of other\add* nations will worship [IDI] their own gods,
\q2 but we will worship Yahweh our God always, forever.
\s1 The Israeli people will return from exile
\p
\v 6 Yahweh says, “There will soon be a time when I will gather the people whom I have punished,
\q1 who have been ◄exiled/forced to go to other countries►,
\q2 all those whom I have caused to suffer much.
\q1
\v 7 My people who did not die while they were exiled will become a strong nation again.
\q1 Then I, Yahweh, will be their king,
\q2 and I will rule from Jerusalem forever.
\q1
\v 8 As for you people of Jerusalem [MET]
\q2 who guard \add all of my people\add* like [MET] \add a shepherd guards his sheep\add* from a tower,
\q1 you \add who live on\add* Zion \add Hill\add* will have great power again.
\q2 You people who live in Jerusalem will again rule like you did previously.
\b
\q1
\v 9 So why [RHQ] are you wailing now?
\q2 Is it because you have no king?
\q1 Have all your wise people died?
\q2 You are weeping loudly like [SIM] a woman who is giving birth to a baby.
\q1
\v 10 Well, you people of Jerusalem should twist and groan like [SIM] a woman who is having birth pains,
\q2 because now you must leave this city,
\q1 and \add while you are traveling\add*, you will set up tents in open fields \add at night\add*;
\q2 you will go to \add live in\add* Babylon.
\q1 But while you are there,
\q2 I, Yahweh, will rescue you;
\q1 I will free you from the power/control [MTY] of your enemies.
\b
\q1
\v 11 Now \add the armies of\add* many nations have gathered to attack you.
\q2 They are saying, ‘Jerusalem must be destroyed!
\q2 We want to see this city \add when it becomes ruins\add*!’
\q1
\v 12 But they do not know what I, Yahweh, think,
\q2 and they do not understand what I plan:
\q1 I will gather them and punish them
\q2 like [SIM] \add farmers\add* thresh grain on the ground.
\b
\q1
\v 13 So, you people of Jerusalem, rise up and punish [MET] \add the nations who oppose you\add*.
\q2 I will cause you \add to be very strong\add*,
\q1 \add as if\add* [MET] you had horns made of iron,
\q2 as if [MET] you had hoofs made of bronze;
\q2 and you will crush many nations.
\b
\q1 And \add then you will take\add* from your enemies the valuable things that they have taken \add from other countries\add*,
\q2 and you will dedicate those things to me, the one who is the Lord of all \add the people on\add* the earth.”
