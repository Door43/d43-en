\c 2
\s1 Yahweh will punish those who oppress the poor
\q1
\v 1 Terrible things will happen to you who lie awake at night,
\q2 planning to do wicked things.
\q1 Then you get up at dawn, and you do those things,
\q2 \add as soon as\add* you are able to do them.
\q1
\v 2 You want fields \add that belong to other people\add*,
\q2 so you seize them;
\q2 you also take their houses.
\q1 You cheat people to get their homes,
\q2 taking away the property that belongs to their families.
\p
\v 3 Therefore, this is what Yahweh says:
\q1 “I will cause you people to experience disasters,
\q2 and you will not be able to escape [MTY] from them.
\q1 You will no longer walk around proudly,
\q2 because when that happens, it will be a time of much trouble for you.
\q1
\v 4 At that time, \add your enemies\add* will make fun of you;
\q2 they will ridicule you by singing this sad song:
\q1 ‘We are completely ruined;
\q2 Yahweh is taking our land/fields from us,
\q1 and he will give it to those who will capture us.’~”
\q1
\v 5 So \add when it is the time for the land to be given back to you\add* people who belong to Yahweh,
\q2 there will be no one [MTY] who will be able to ◄cast lots/throw marked stones► to determine which land belongs to whom.
\s1 False prophets
\q1
\v 6 The people \add who heard me say that\add* replied to me,
\q2 “Do not prophesy such things!
\q2 Do not say that \add Yahweh\add* is going to humiliate us \add by causing us to experience disasters\add*!”
\q1
\v 7 But you people [MTY] of Israel should not [RHQ] talk like that!
\q2 The Spirit of Yahweh will certainly not [RHQ] be \add patient with people who say such things\add*!
\q2 People who continually do things that are righteous will certainly [RHQ] like/appreciate what I say.
\q1
\v 8 \add But Yahweh says\add*,
\q2 “\add Recently\add* my people have been acting toward me like an enemy.
\q1 When soldiers return from fighting \add against their enemies\add*,
\q1 you \add rich people refuse to return the coats of those poor soldiers who have borrowed money from you \add*
\q2 \add and given you their coats to guarantee that they will pay back the money that they borrowed from you\add*.
\q2 \add It is as though\add* you are waiting to forcefully take their coats off their backs!
\q1
\v 9 You have forced women to leave their nice homes,
\q2 and you have stolen from their children forever the ◄blessings/good things► that I wanted to give them.
\q1
\v 10 So get up and leave here!
\q2 This is not a place where you can rest \add and be safe/protected\add*,
\q1 because you have ◄defiled it/caused it to be a place that I hate►;
\q2 it will be completely destroyed.
\q1
\v 11 \add You people want\add* a prophet who will lie to you,
\q2 saying ‘I will preach \add that you should drink\add* plenty of wine and other alcoholic drinks!’
\q2 That is the kind of prophet who \add would please\add* you.”
\s1 Yahweh promised to restore them
\q1
\v 12 “But some day, you descendants of Jacob, I will bring back \add from ◄exile/other countries►\add* the Israeli people who have survived.
\q1 I will gather you together
\q2 like [SIM] a shepherd gathers his sheep from the pasture into a pen [DOU],
\q2 and there will be many of you in your land/country.
\q1
\v 13 Your leader will enable them to leave the countries where they have been exiled;
\q2 he will lead them out of the gates \add of their enemies' cities\add*,
\q2 back to your own country.
\q1 Your king will lead them;
\q2 it is I, Yahweh, who will be their king!”
