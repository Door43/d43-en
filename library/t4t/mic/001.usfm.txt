\v 1 \add I am\add* Micah. I am from Moresheth \add town in Judah\add*. Yahweh gave me these \add messages in\add* visions about Samaria and Jerusalem during the time when Jotham, \add and then\add* Ahaz, and \add then\add* Hezekiah were the kings of Judah.
\s1 Yahweh will punish Samaria
\q1
\v 2 You people everywhere on the earth, pay attention to this [DOU]!
\q2 Yahweh our God is accusing you from his holy temple \add in heaven\add*.
\q1
\v 3 He will come down \add from heaven\add*
\q2 and walk on the tops of the highest mountains.
\q1
\v 4 \add It will be as though\add* the mountains will melt under his feet
\q2 like [SIM] wax melts in front of a fire,
\q1 and like [SIM] water \add disappears\add*
\q2 when it rushes/flows down into a valley.
\q1
\v 5 Those things will happen because of the terrible sins [DOU] that the people [MTY] of Israel, \add the descendants of\add* Jacob, have committed.
\q2 But it was [RHQ] \add the people of\add* Samaria \add city who persuaded all the people of\add* Israel to sin,
\q1 and it was [RHQ] because the people of Jerusalem \add set up altars to worship their gods\add*
\q2 that \add the other people of\add* Judah \add were persuaded to worship idols on\add* their hilltops.
\b
\q1
\v 6 So Yahweh will cause Samaria to become a heap of rubble/ruins;
\q2 it will be \add only\add* a field for planting vineyards.
\q1 He will cause the stones of its buildings to roll down into the valley,
\q2 and the foundations of the buildings will be uncovered.
\q1
\v 7 All the idols in Samaria will be smashed,
\q2 and the gifts \add given to prostitutes at the temples of their idols\add* will be destroyed in a fire.
\q1 And because people paid prostitutes there,
\q2 \add their enemies will take away those idols and sell them\add* to get money to pay to prostitutes \add in other countries\add*.
\s1 Micah mourned for Judah also
\q1
\v 8 Because \add Samaria will be destroyed\add*, I will weep and wail.
\q2 I will walk around ◄barefoot/without any sandals on my feet► and naked.
\q1 I will howl like a jackal/wolf
\q2 and screech like an owl,
\q1
\v 9 because Samaria will be completely destroyed [MET];
\q2 nothing can save that city.
\q1 But the same thing will happen to Judah!
\q2 \add It is as though\add* the enemy army has already reached the city gates of Jerusalem,
\q2 \add the main city where\add* my people \add live\add*.
\q1
\v 10 Do not tell that to \add our enemies\add* in Gath \add city in Philistia\add*!
\q2 Do not cry, \add lest the people there find out what is happening\add*!
\q1 Instead, just roll in the dirt in Beth-Leaphrah \add because the name of that town means 'house of dust'\add*.
\q1
\v 11 You people who live in Shaphir, \add town whose name means 'beautiful'\add*,
\q2 naked and ashamed, you will be taken \add to another country\add*.
\q1 You people in Beth-Ezel \add town\add* should mourn,
\q2 because no one from Zaanan \add town whose name means 'one who goes out'\add*, will go out to help you.
\q1
\v 12 \add The name of\add* Maroth \add town sounds like 'bitterness'\add*,
\q2 and everyone there is anxiously waiting for good things to happen to them,
\q1 but good things will not happen because terrible things are about to happen to them,
\q2 and it will soon happen at the gates of Jerusalem.
\q1
\v 13 You people of Lachish \add city whose name sounds like 'team'\add*,
\q2 hitch your horses to pull the chariots \add in which you can ride to flee from your enemies\add*:
\q1 the Israeli people rebelled against Yahweh,
\q2 and you ◄imitated them/did the same evil things that they did►,
\q1 and that caused the people of Jerusalem [IDI] to start sinning, too.
\q1
\v 14 \add You people of Judah\add*, send a farewell gift to \add the people\add* of Moresheth \add town\add*,
\q2 \add because their enemies will soon destroy it\add*.
\q1 \add The name of the town Aczib means 'deception'\add*,
\q2 and the kings of Israel \add will soon find out that the people of that town\add* will deceive them.
\q1
\v 15 \add The name of your town of\add* Mareshah \add means 'conqueror'\add*,
\q2 and Yahweh will soon send someone to conquer your town.
\q1 \add It will be necessary for\add* the great/glorious leaders of Israel to go \add and hide in the cave at\add* Adullam \add city\add*.
\q1
\v 16 \add You people of Judah\add*, shave your heads while you will be mourning,
\q2 because your children whom you love will \add soon\add* be ◄exiled/forced to leave you and go to another country►.
