\c 5
\q1
\v 1 “But now, you people of Jerusalem, gather your troops together,
\q2 \add even though\add* you have a wall \add around your city to protect it\add*,
\q1 enemy soldiers are surrounding the city.
\q2 And soon with a rod they will strike your leader on his face.”
\s1 A ruler will come from Bethlehem
\q1
\v 2 But you \add people of\add* [APO] Bethlehem in Ephrathah \add district need to know that\add*
\q2 even though your \add town\add* is a very small one among all the towns in Judah,
\q2 someone who will rule Israel will be born in your town.
\q1 He will be someone whose family existed a very long time ago [DOU].
\b
\q1
\v 3 \add But now\add* you people of Israel will be conquered by your enemies;
\q2 \add but it will be for only a short time\add*,
\q1 like [MET] \add the short time that\add* women have great pain while their babies are being born.
\q2 After that, your fellow-countrymen who were ◄exiled/forced to go to other countries► will return to their own country.
\b
\q1
\v 4 And that man who will be ruling \add there in Jerusalem\add* will stand and lead his people well,
\q2 because Yahweh, his God, will cause him to be strong and greatly honored.
\q1 Then the people whom he rules will live \add in Jerusalem\add* safely;
\q2 he will be greatly honored by people all over the earth
\q2 \add so no one will dare to attack Jerusalem\add*.
\q2
\v 5 And he will cause things to go well \add with his people\add*.
\s1 Yahweh will rescue some and get rid of others
\q1 When \add the army of\add* Assyria attacks our country
\q2 and breaks though our fortresses,
\q1 we will appoint ◄seven or eight/several► leaders \add to lead our army\add* to fight against them.
\q1
\v 6 With their swords \add our army\add* will defeat the army of Assyria, \add whose capital was founded by\add* Nimrod \add long ago\add*.
\q1 So our army will rescue us from the Assyrian army
\q2 when they invade our country [DOU].
\b
\q1
\v 7 The ◄descendants of Jacob/Israelis► who survive will be \add a blessing\add* to the people of other nations
\q2 like [SIM] dew and rain sent by Yahweh do good to the grass.
\q1 They will not trust in humans \add to help them\add*;
\q2 instead, they will rely on Yahweh.
\q1
\v 8 In the midst of \add their enemies in\add* many people-groups [DOU],
\q2 the descendants of Jacob who remain alive will be like [SIM] a lion among the other wild beasts of the forest,
\q1 like [SIM] a young lion who goes among a flock of sheep and pounces on one and ◄mauls it/tears it to pieces►,
\q2 and no one can rescue that sheep.
\q1
\v 9 You Israelis will defeat [MTY] all your enemies
\q2 and completely destroy them.
\b
\p
\v 10 Yahweh says,
\q1 “At that time, I will destroy \add you Israeli people's\add* horses \add that your soldiers use in\add* war
\q2 and your chariots.
\q1
\v 11 I will tear down your city \add walls\add*
\q2 and destroy all your fortified cities.
\q1
\v 12 I will get rid of all those among you who practice magic
\q2 and the ◄fortune-tellers/those who say that they can predict what will happen in the future►.
\q1
\v 13 I will destroy all your idols and \add sacred stone\add* pillars,
\q2 and then you will no longer bow down \add and worship\add* things that you yourselves [SYN] have made.
\q1
\v 14 I will get rid of your poles \add that represent the goddess\add* Asherah,
\q2 and I will also destroy all your idols.
\q1
\v 15 And because I will be very angry,
\q2 I will also punish \add the people of\add* all the nations who have not obeyed me.”
