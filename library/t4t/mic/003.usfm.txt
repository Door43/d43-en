\c 3
\s1 Micah rebuked the Israeli leaders
\p
\v 1 Then I said, “You Israeli [MTY] leaders, listen to what I say!
\q1 You should certainly [RHQ] know what things are right \add to do\add*
\q2 \add and what things are wrong\add*,
\q1
\v 2 but you hate what is good
\q1 and love what is evil.
\q2 \add You act like butchers\add*:
\q1 \add it is as though\add* you strip the skin off my people
\q2 and tear the flesh from their bones.
\q1
\v 3 \add It is as though\add* you chop them into pieces like [SIM] meat \add to be cooked\add* in a pot.
\q1
\v 4 Then, \add when you have troubles\add*, you plead to Yahweh \add to help you\add*,
\q2 but he will not answer you.
\q1 At that time, he will turn his face away from you
\q2 because of the evil things that you have done.”
\b
\p
\v 5 This is what Yahweh says
\q1 about your false prophets are deceiving the people:
\q2 “If someone gives them food,
\q1 those prophets say that things will go well for him.
\q2 But they declare war against anyone who does not give them food.
\q1
\v 6 So now \add it is as though\add* [MET] night will descend on you prophets;
\q2 you will not receive any more visions.
\q1 \add It is as though\add* [MET] the sun will set for you;
\q2 the time \add when you are greatly honored\add* will end.
\q1
\v 7 Then you ◄seers/people who predict what will happen in the future► [DOU] will be disgraced;
\q2 you will cover your faces \add because you will be ashamed,\add*
\q2 because when you ask me \add what will happen\add*, there will be no answer from me.”
\b
\q1
\v 8 But as for me, I am full of \add God's\add* power,
\q2 power from the Spirit of Yahweh.
\q1 I am courageous and strong
\q2 to declare to the Israeli people [MTY, DOU]
\q2 that they have sinned and rebelled \add against Yahweh\add*.
\q1
\v 9 You leaders of the people [MTY] of Israel, listen to this!
\q2 You hate it when people do what is just,
\q1 and when people say what is true,
\q2 you distort it, saying it is false.
\q1
\v 10 \add It is as though\add* you are building \add houses in\add* Jerusalem on foundations
\q2 that consist of murdering people and doing what is corrupt.
\q1
\v 11 Your leaders make \add favorable\add* decisions \add only if they receive\add* bribes.
\q2 Your priests teach people only if those people pay them well.
\q2 Your false prophets require people to pay them to tell people what will happen to them in the future.
\q1 Those prophets say, “Yahweh is telling us \add what we should say\add*,
\q2 and we say that we will not experience any disasters.”
\q1
\v 12 Because of what you \add leaders do\add*,
\q2 Zion Hill will be plowed like a field;
\q1 it will become a heap of ruins/rubble;
\q2 the top of the hill, where the temple is now, will be covered with bushes.
