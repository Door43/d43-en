\s1 Job replied again
\p
\v 1 Then Job replied again, saying this:
\q1
\v 2 “Today I am again complaining bitterly/strongly \add to God\add*;
\q2 I continue groaning, but he [SYN] continues to ◄punish me/cause me to suffer►.
\q1
\v 3 I ◄wish that I knew/want to know► where I could meet/talk with him,
\q2 so that I could go to the place where he lives.
\q1
\v 4 If I could do that, I would tell him why \add I know that\add* I am innocent;
\q2 I would tell [MTY] to him all my ◄arguments/evidence \add to show that I have not done what is evil\add*►.
\q1
\v 5 Then I would find out and understand what he would reply to me [DOU].
\q1
\v 6 Would he use his great power to argue with me?
\q2 No, he would listen to me carefully.
\q1
\v 7 I am ◄an honest/a righteous► man; so I would be able to discuss things with him \add fairly\add*,
\q2 and then he would declare that I am innocent, \add and that decision would endure\add* forever.
\b
\q1
\v 8 But, I have gone to the east, and he is not there;
\q2 I have gone to the west, but I have not found him there.
\q1
\v 9 I have gone north and I have gone south,
\q2 but I have not seen him anywhere.
\q1
\v 10 But he knows how I have conducted my life;
\q2 and when he has finished testing me, \add he will see that\add* I am as pure as [SIM] gold \add whose impurities have all been burned out\add*.
\q1
\v 11 I [SYN] have faithfully walked on the road that he showed me;
\q2 I have not turned away from \add obeying\add* him.
\q1
\v 12 I have always obeyed what he [SYN] commanded;
\q2 I have hidden away in my inner being the words that he has spoken.
\b
\q1
\v 13 He never changes. There is no one who can [RHQ] stop him \add from doing what he desires\add*.
\q2 Whatever he wants to do, he does.
\q1
\v 14 And he will finish doing the things that he has planned for me;
\q2 \add and I am sure that\add* he has thought about doing many things for me.
\q1
\v 15 So I am terrified in his presence;
\q2 when I think \add about what he can do\add*, I am very afraid [DOU].
\q1
\v 16 Almighty God has caused me [SYN] to feel timid and terrified [DOU].
\q1
\v 17 \add It is as though\add* there is only thick darkness in front of me,
\q2 but it is God that I am afraid of, not the darkness.”
