\c 2
\q1
\v 1 \add After I said that, I said to myself\add*, “I will climb up into my watchtower,
\q2 and stand there at my guard post.
\q1 I will wait there to find out what Yahweh will say,
\q2 what he will reply to what I have complained about.”
\s1 Yahweh's second reply
\p
\v 2 Then Yahweh replied to me,
\q1 “Write plainly on tablets \add what I am revealing to you in\add* this vision,
\q2 \add and then read it to a messenger\add*
\q2 in order that he can run with it \add to tell it to\add* other people.
\q1
\v 3 In this vision \add I will be talking about things that will happen\add* in the future.
\q1 Now is not the time when those things will happen,
\q2 but they certainly will happen,
\q2 and when they occur, they will occur quickly,
\q2 and they will not be delayed.
\q1 Now you \add want those things to happen immediately, but\add* they are not happening.
\q2 But wait patiently for them \add to happen\add*!
\b
\q1
\v 4 Think about the proud \add people of Babylonia\add*!
\q2 They are certainly not doing what is righteous.
\q1 But people who are righteous will live
\q2 because they faithfully \add do what I want them to do\add*.
\q1
\v 5 If people \add trust in their wealth\add* they will deceive themselves,
\q2 and proud people are never able to rest.
\q1 \add It is as though\add* the greedy people \add of Babylonia open their mouths\add* as wide as the place where dead people are,
\q1 and they never have enough,
\q2 like \add the place where\add* dead people go never has enough dead people [PRS].
\q1 The \add armies of Babylonia\add* conquer many nations for themselves,
\q2 and capture all their people.
\q1
\v 6 But \add soon\add* all those \add whom they have captured\add* will ridicule \add the soldiers from Babylonia\add*!
\q1 They will make fun of them, saying,
\q2 ‘Terrible things will happen to you who have stolen things \add from other countries\add*!
\q1 You got many things by forcing people to give them to you.
\q2 \add But you certainly will not keep those things\add* for a long time [RHQ]!’
\q1
\v 7 Suddenly those whom you ◄oppressed/treated cruelly► will rise up
\q2 and cause you to tremble,
\q2 and they will take away all the things that you have stolen from them.
\q1
\v 8 You stole things from the people of many nations.
\q1 You murdered [MTY] people of many people-groups,
\q2 and you destroyed their land and their cities.
\q1 So those who are still alive will steal valuable things from you.
\b
\q1
\v 9 Terrible things will happen to you \add people of Babylonia\add* who build big houses
\q2 with money that you got by forcing others to give it to you.
\q1 You are proud and you think that your houses will be safe
\q2 because you have built them in places where you can easily defend them.
\q1
\v 10 But because you have destroyed others,
\q2 you have caused your family [MTY] to be shamed/disgraced
\q2 and you yourselves will be killed.
\q1
\v 11 \add It is as though\add* the stones in the walls \add of your houses\add* cry out to accuse you,
\q2 and \add it is as though\add* the beams \add in your ceilings\add* also say the same things.
\b
\q1
\v 12 Terrible things will happen to you \add people of Babylonia\add* who kill people [MTY] in order to build cities,
\q2 cities that you build by using money that you have gotten by committing crimes.
\q1
\v 13 But the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels has [RHQ] declared that everything that is built by people who do things like that \add will be destroyed by\add* fire;
\q2 they will have worked hard uselessly.
\q1
\v 14 But \add in contrast\add*, like [SIM] the oceans are filled with water,
\q2 the earth will be filled with people who know that Yahweh is very great.
\b
\q1
\v 15 Terrible things will happen to you \add people of Babylonia\add*
\q2 who cause people who live in nearby countries to become drunk.
\q1 You force them to drink a lot of wine from wineskins
\q2 \add until they are drunk and then they walk around\add* naked
\q2 in order that you will be happy when you see that.
\q1
\v 16 But you are the ones who \add soon\add* will be disgraced instead of being honored.
\q2 \add It will be as though you are forced to\add* drink \add a lot of wine\add* in order that you will also stagger around, drunk.
\q1 You will drink the wine \add that symbolizes that Yahweh will punish you\add*,
\q2 and he will cause you to be disgraced instead of being greatly respected anymore.
\q1
\v 17 You did violent [PRS] things to the people in Lebanon,
\q2 and you killed the wild animals there,
\q1 but you will be punished severely for doing that.
\q1 You have killed [MTY] many people
\q2 and you have destroyed their lands and their cities.
\b
\q1
\v 18 \add You people of Babylonia need to know that your\add* idols are completely [RHQ] useless,
\q2 because it is people who made them.
\q1 Statues that have been carved or made in a mold deceive you.
\q2 Those who trust in idols
\q2 are trusting in things that they themselves created,
\q1 things that cannot speak!
\q1
\v 19 Terrible things will happen to you who say to lifeless idols that are made of wood,
\q2 ‘Wake up!’
\q1 Idols certainly cannot [RHQ] tell you what you should do;
\q2 they \add look nice/beautiful because\add* they are covered with silver and gold,
\q2 but they are not alive.
\q1
\v 20 But Yahweh is in his holy temple;
\q2 everyone on the earth should be silent in his presence.”
