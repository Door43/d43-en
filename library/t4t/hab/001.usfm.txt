\v 1 \add I am\add* Habakkuk, a prophet. This is the \add conversation I had with Yahweh\add* that was given to me in a vision.
\s1 Habakkuk's first complaint
\q1
\v 2 \add I said\add*, “Yahweh, how long must I continue to call \add to you\add* for help
\q2 before you respond?
\q1 I cry out to you \add for help\add*, saying that \add people are acting\add* violently \add everywhere\add*,
\q2 but you do not rescue us!
\q1
\v 3 ◄Must I/I do not want to► continue seeing people doing what is unjust [RHQ].
\q2 Why do you not punish people who are doing what is wrong [RHQ]?
\q1 I see people destroying things and \add acting\add* violently.
\q2 There is fighting and quarreling \add everywhere\add*.
\q1
\v 4 No one obeys laws [PRS],
\q2 and judges [PRS] never do what is fair/just.
\q1 Wicked people always defeat the righteous people \add in the courts\add*,
\q2 with the result that matters are never decided fairly/justly.”
\s1 Yahweh's reply
\q1
\v 5 \add Yahweh replied to me\add*,
\q1 “\add I know that what you say is true, but\add* look around at \add what is happening in\add* the other nations;
\q2 \add if you look\add*, you will be amazed,
\q1 because I am doing something during this time that you would not believe \add would happen\add*,
\q2 even if someone told you about it.
\q1
\v 6 The soldiers of Babylonia are fierce/cruel and swift.
\q2 And now I am causing them \add to become very powerful\add*;
\q1 they will march across the entire earth
\q2 and conquer \add many\add* other countries.
\q1
\v 7 They are people whom \add others\add* fear very much [DOU],
\q2 and they do whatever they want to,
\q2 paying no attention to the laws of other countries.
\q1
\v 8 The horses \add that pull their chariots\add* go faster than leopards,
\q2 and they are fiercer than wolves are in the evening.
\q1 The horses on which the soldiers ride gallop swiftly;
\q2 the soldiers riding them come from distant places.
\q1 They are like [SIM] eagles that swoop down to \add snatch and\add* kill small animals.
\q1
\v 9 As they ride along,
\q2 they are determined to act violently.
\q1 They advance like [SIM] a wind from the desert,
\q2 gathering prisoners that are as \add numerous as grains of\add* sand.
\q1
\v 10 They make fun of kings and princes \add of other countries\add*,
\q2 and they ridicule all the cities that have high walls around them.
\q1 They pile dirt \add outside those walls\add*
\q2 \add in order to climb up\add* and capture those cities.
\q1
\v 11 They rush past like the wind,
\q2 and then they go \add to attack other cities\add*,
\q1 But they are very guilty,
\q2 because \add they think that\add* their own power is their god.”
\s1 Habakkuk's second complaint
\q1
\v 12 \add Then I said\add*, “Yahweh, you have certainly [RHQ] always/forever been God.
\q2 You are my Holy one; you will not die.
\q1 So \add why\add* have you appointed those men \add from Babylonia\add* to judge and get rid of us?
\q2 You are like [MET] a huge rock \add under which we are protected/safe\add*,
\q2 so why have you sent them to punish us?
\q1
\v 13 You [SYN] are pure, and you cannot endure looking at what is evil,
\q2 so why are you ignoring men who are treacherous?
\q1 Why do you do nothing
\q2 \add to punish\add* those wicked men \add from Babylonia\add*
\q2 who destroy people who are more righteous than they are?
\q1
\v 14 \add Do you consider that\add* we are like fish in the sea,
\q2 or like other creatures in the sea, that have no ruler?
\q1
\v 15 \add The soldiers of Babylonia think that we are fish\add* [RHQ] for them to pull out of the sea with hooks
\q2 or to catch in their nets,
\q2 while they rejoice and celebrate.
\q1
\v 16 If they catch us, they will \add worship\add* their weapons [MET] with which they captured us and offer sacrifices to them
\q2 and burn incense in front of them!
\q1 \add They will say\add* ‘Those weapons have enabled us to become rich and be able to eat expensive food.’
\q1
\v 17 \add Will you allow\add* them to continue \add to conquer people\add* [MET] forever?
\q2 \add Will you allow\add* them to destroy people of other nations without their acting mercifully \add toward anyone\add*?”
