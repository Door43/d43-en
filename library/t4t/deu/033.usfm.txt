\c 33
\s1 Moses blessed the Israeli tribes
\p
\v 1 Before God's prophet Moses died, he \add asked God to\add* bless the Israeli people.
\v 2 This is what he said:
\b
\q1 “Yahweh came \add and spoke\add* to us at Sinai \add Mountain\add*;
\q2 he \add came like\add* [MET] the sun rises in the Edom \add region\add*
\q2 and like his light shone on us when we were \add in the desert\add* near Paran Mountain \add after we left Sinai Mountain\add*.
\q1 He came with ten thousand angels,
\q2 and there was a flaming fire at his right side.
\q1
\v 3 Yahweh truly loves his people,
\q2 and protects [MTY] all those who belong to him.
\q1 So they prostrate themselves in front of him,
\q2 and they listen to his instructions.
\q1
\v 4 I gave them laws to obey,
\q2 laws that would be the most precious thing that \add the descendants of\add* Jacob owned.
\q1
\v 5 So Yahweh became the king of his Israeli people
\q2 when all the tribes and their leaders were gathered together.
\b
\p
\v 6 \add I say this about the tribe of\add* Reuben:
\q1 I desire/hope that their tribe will never disappear,
\q2 but that they will never become numerous.
\b
\p
\v 7 I say this about \add the tribe of\add* Judah:
\q1 Yahweh, listen to them when they call out \add for help\add*;
\q2 and \add after they separate from\add* the other tribes, unite them with the other tribes again.
\q1 Fight for them,
\q2 and help them to fight against their enemies.
\p
\v 8 I say this about \add the tribe of\add* Levi:
\q1 Yahweh, give to those who are dedicated to you the sacred stones \add that they will use to find out what you want to be done\add*;
\q1 You tested them at a spring in the desert, a spring that they named Massah and also named Meribah
\q2 \add to find out if they would ◄remain loyal to/continue to obey► you\add*.
\q1
\v 9 The tribe of Levi did what you told them to do
\q2 and obeyed the agreement that you \add made with the Israeli people\add*;
\q1 those laws were more important to them [HYP]
\q2 than their siblings and parents and children.
\q1
\v 10 The tribe of Levi will teach the Israeli people [DOU] your rules and regulations,
\q2 and they are the ones who will burn incense and who will completely burn on the altar the offerings \add that the people bring\add*.
\q1
\v 11 Yahweh, bless their work
\q2 and ◄accept/be pleased with► all that they do.
\q1 Crush/Destroy all their enemies;
\q2 do not enable their enemies to be able to fight against them again.
\b
\p
\v 12 I say this about \add the tribe of\add* Benjamin:
\q1 They are the tribe that Yahweh loves;
\q2 he keeps them safe.
\q1 He protects them continually,
\q2 and he lives among their hills [MET].
\b
\p
\v 13 I say this about \add the tribes of\add* Joseph:
\q1 I desire/hope that Yahweh will bless their land
\q2 by giving them rain/dew from the sky
\q2 and water from deep down \add in the ground\add*,
\q1
\v 14 by giving them good fruit \add ripened by\add* the sun
\q2 and good crops ◄in the right months/at harvest time►.
\q1
\v 15 I desire/hope that very nice fruit will grow on trees in their ancient mountains/hills [DOU],
\q1
\v 16 and that their land will be filled with many good crops,
\q2 blessed by \add Yahweh\add*, the one who appeared to me in a burning bush.
\q1 I desire/hope that Yahweh will bless the tribes of Joseph in all those ways,
\q2 because he was his \add older\add* brothers' leader \add when they were in Egypt\add*.
\q1
\v 17 The descendants of Joseph will be as strong as [SIM] a bull,
\q2 \add with their weapons they will wound their enemies like\add* [MET] a wild ox \add gores other animals\add* with its horns.
\q1 They will push other people-groups,
\q2 all of them, to the most distant places on the earth.
\q1 That is what \add the descendants of the two sons of Joseph\add* will do,
\q2 the ten thousands \add of the tribe\add* of Ephraim and the thousands \add of the tribe\add* of Manasseh.
\b
\p
\v 18 I say this about \add the tribes of\add* Zebulun \add and Issachar:\add*
\q1 I desire/hope that the people of Zebulun will prosper in their travels \add across the seas\add*,
\q2 and that the people of Issachar will prosper while they stay at home \add and take care of their cattle and crops\add*.
\q1
\v 19 They will invite people \add from the other Israeli tribes\add* to the mountain where they \add worship Yahweh\add*,
\q2 and they will offer the correct/proper sacrifices to him.
\q1 They will become rich from \add the work that they do on\add* the seas
\q2 and from \add the things that they make from\add* (OR, \add find in\add*) the sand \add on the beaches\add*.
\b
\p
\v 20 I say this about \add the tribe of\add* Gad:
\q1 Praise \add Yahweh\add*, the one who made their \add territory\add* large.
\q2 The people of their tribe \add will attack their enemies fiercely\add* [SIM] like a lion that crouches,
\q2 waiting to tear off the arm or the scalp \add of some animal\add*.
\q1
\v 21 They chose the best part of the land for themselves;
\q2 \add a large share of the land\add*, a share that should be given to a leader was allotted to them.
\q1 When the leaders of the tribes of Israel \add gathered together\add*,
\q2 they decided that the tribe of Gad should have a large share of the land.
\q2 The tribe of Gad obeyed the commands of Yahweh and the things that he decided that they should do.
\b
\p
\v 22 I say this about \add the tribe\add* of Dan:
\q1 The people of the tribe of Dan are like [SIM] a young lion;
\q2 they leap out from \add their caves in the\add* Bashan \add region to attack their enemies\add*.
\b
\p
\v 23 I say this about \add the tribe of\add* Naphtali:
\q1 \add The people of the tribe of\add* Naphtali have been blessed by Yahweh, who has been very kind to them;
\q2 their land extends far south from Lake \add Galilee\add*.
\b
\p
\v 24 I say this about \add the tribe of\add* Asher:
\q1 Yahweh will bless the descendants of Asher more than he will bless the other tribes.
\q2 Yahweh will favor them most of all.
\q2 I desire/hope that their land will \add be filled with olive trees that will\add* produce a lot of [IDI] \add olives to make olive\add* oil.
\q1
\v 25 Their \add towns will be protected by high walls with gates that have\add* bronze and iron bars;
\q2 I desire/hope that they will be strong and secure/protected all the time that they are alive.
\b
\q1
\v 26 You people of Israel, there is no god like your God,
\q2 who rides majestically across the sky to help you.
\q1
\v 27 God, who lives forever, is the one who ◄gives you refuge/protects you►;
\q2 \add it is as though\add* he puts his everlasting arms under you \add to support you\add*.
\q1 He will expel your enemies while you advance;
\q2 he has told you to destroy all of them.
\q1
\v 28 So, you Israeli people will live safely;
\q2 you descendants of Jacob will not be disturbed by others {others will not cause you trouble};
\q1 in the land where \add you will live\add*, there will be plenty of grain and wine,
\q2 and plenty of rain will fall from the sky.
\q1
\v 29 You people of Israel, Yahweh ◄has blessed/is pleased with► you.
\q2 There is certainly [RHQ] no nation like your nation,
\q2 whom Yahweh has rescued \add from being slaves in Egypt\add*.
\q1 \add He will be like\add* [MET] a shield to protect you
\q2 and like [MET] a sword to enable you to defeat \add your enemies\add*.
\q1 Your enemies will come to you begging for you \add to act mercifully toward them\add*,
\q2 but you will trample on their backs/necks.”
