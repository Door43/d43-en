\c 5
\s1 The vision of the flying scroll
\p
\v 1 I looked up again, and I saw a scroll that was flying \add through the air\add*.
\p
\v 2 The angel asked me, “What do you see?”
\p I replied, “I see a flying scroll that is \add huge\add*, ◄30 ft./9 meters► long and ◄15 ft./4.5 meters► wide.”
\p
\v 3 Then he said to me, “On this scroll is written the \add words that Yahweh is speaking to\add* curse the entire country. On one side of the scroll it is written that every thief will be banished. On the other side it is written that everyone who tells a lie when he is solemnly promising to tell the truth will also be banished from the country.
\v 4 The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says, ‘I will send \add copies of\add* this scroll to the places where thieves live and to the houses of those who use my name when they solemnly promise to tell the truth. \add The copies of\add* this scroll will stay in their houses, until those houses and all their wood and stones are destroyed.’~”
\s1 The vision of the woman in a basket
\p
\v 5 Then the angel who had been talking to me came closer to me and said, “Look up and see what is appearing!”
\p
\v 6 I asked him, “What is it?”
\p He replied, “It is a big basket \add for measuring grain\add*. But it contains \add a record of\add* the sins that everyone in this nation has committed.”
\p
\v 7 Then \add the angel\add* lifted the basket's cover, which was made of lead. There was a woman sitting inside the basket!
\v 8 The angel said, “She represents the wicked things that people do.” Then he pushed her back into the basket and closed the very heavy lid again.
\p
\v 9 Then I looked up and saw two women in front of me. They \add were flying toward us\add*, with their wings spread out in the wind. Their wings were \add large\add*, like [SIM] storks' wings. They lifted the big basket up into the sky.
\p
\v 10 I asked the angel who had been talking to me, “Where are they taking that basket?”
\p
\v 11 He replied, “\add They are taking it\add* to Babylonia to build a temple for it. When the temple is finished, they will set the basket there on a pedestal \add for people to worship it\add*.”
