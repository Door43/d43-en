\c 12
\s1 Jerusalem will be rescued
\p
\v 1 This is a message from Yahweh concerning Israel. Yahweh is the one who stretched out the sky, who created the earth, and who ◄gave life to humans/caused humans to be alive►. This is what he says:
\v 2 “I will soon cause Jerusalem to be like [MET] a cup full \add of very strong alcoholic drink\add*, and the people of other nations who drink it will stagger around. And they will come and attack Jerusalem and \add the other towns in\add* Judah.
\v 3 At that time, \add the armies of\add* all the nations will gather to attack Jerusalem, but I will cause the leaders of Judah to be like [SIM] a very heavy rock, and all who try to lift it will be badly injured.
\v 4 At that time I will cause every one of their enemies' horses to panic, and their riders to become crazy. I [IDI] will protect the people of Judah, but I will cause all their enemies' horses to become blind.
\v 5 Then the leaders of Judah will say to themselves, ‘The people in Jerusalem are strong because the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels is their God.’
\p
\v 6 At that time I will enable the leaders of Judah to be like [SIM] a pan containing hot coals \add that is put\add* in a woodpile, or like [SIM] a burning torch \add that is put\add* in a \add field of\add* ripe grain. The leaders of Judah \add and their army\add* will destroy the people of the surrounding nations in all directions. But \add the people of\add* Jerusalem will remain safe.
\p
\v 7 And I, Yahweh, will protect the tents of \add the soldiers in other places in\add* Judah before \add I rescue the people of Jerusalem\add*, in order that the leaders of Jerusalem [DOU] will be honored more than \add the people in other places in\add* Judah are honored.
\v 8 At that time, I will protect [MET] the people of Jerusalem. When that happens, even the weakest people in Jerusalem will be strong like \add King\add* David was. And the descendants [MTY] of David will \add rule the people\add* like I \add would\add*, as though an angel sent from me, Yahweh, was their leader.
\v 9 At that time, I will prepare to destroy all the nations that attack Jerusalem.”
\s1 Mourning for the one who will be stabbed
\p
\v 10 “I, \add Yahweh\add*, will cause the descendants [MTY] of \add King\add* David to act very kindly and mercifully. They will look at me, the one who has been stabbed, and they will cry bitterly, like people cry for a firstborn son \add who has died\add* [DOU].
\v 11 At that time, many people in Jerusalem will be crying bitterly, like people cried \add when King Josiah was killed in the battle\add* at Hadad-Rimmon on the Megiddo Plain.
\v 12 Many people in Judah will cry, each family by themselves: The male descendants of David by themselves, and their wives by themselves, the male descendants of \add David's son\add* Nathan by themselves, and their wives by themselves,
\v 13 the male descendants [MTY] of Levi by themselves, and their wives by themselves, the male descendants of \add Levi's grandson\add* Shimei by themselves, and their wives by themselves,
\v 14 and all the other members of \add the kings' clans and the priests' clans\add* by themselves, and their wives by themselves.”
