\s1 Yahweh summons his people to return to him
\p
\v 1 \add I am\add* Zechariah, a prophet, the son of Berekiah and grandson of Iddo. When Darius \add had been the emperor of Persia\add* for almost two years, during November of that year, Yahweh gave me this message:
\p
\v 2 “I was very angry with your ancestors.
\v 3 So tell this to the people: I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, say this: Return to me, and if you do that, I will \add help\add* you again.
\v 4 Do not be like your ancestors. Prophets, who have now died, continually proclaimed to your ancestors that they should stop doing the evil things that they were continually doing. But they refused to pay attention to what I said.
\v 5 Your ancestors \add have died and are now in their graves\add* [RHQ]. And the prophets did not [RHQ] live forever, either.
\v 6 But I punished [IDI] \add the people for disobeying\add* the commands and the decrees which I commanded my servants the prophets \add to tell to the people\add*.
\p Then they ◄repented/turned away from their evil behavior► and said, ‘The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels has done to us what we deserved for our evil behavior, just like he said that he would do.’~”
\s1 The vision of the horses
\p
\v 7 Three months later, on February 15, Yahweh gave \add another\add* message to me.
\p
\v 8 During the night I had a vision. In the vision I saw an \add angel\add* who was on a red horse. He was in a narrow valley among some myrtle trees. Behind him were \add angels on\add* other horses—red, brown, and white horses.
\p
\v 9 I asked the angel who had been talking to me, “Sir, who are those \add angels on the horses\add*?”
\p He replied, “I will show you who they are.”
\p
\v 10 Then the \add angel\add* who had been under the myrtle trees explained. He said, “They are the \add angels\add* whom Yahweh sent \add to ◄patrol/see what is happening in►\add* the entire world.”
\p
\v 11 Then those angels reported to the angel who was there among the myrtle trees, “We have traveled throughout the world, and we have found out that \add the army of the emperor has conquered nations\add* throughout the world, and that they are now ◄helpless/unable to resist them►.”
\p
\v 12 Then the angel asked, “Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, how long will you continue to not act mercifully toward Jerusalem and the other towns in Judah? You have been angry with them for 70 years!”
\v 13 So Yahweh spoke kindly to the angel who had talked to me, saying things that comforted/encouraged him.
\p
\v 14 Then the angel who had been talking with me said to me, “Proclaim this to the people \add of Jerusalem\add*: The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says that he is very concerned about \add the people who live on\add* Zion \add Hill\add* and in the other parts of Jerusalem.
\v 15 But he is very angry with the nations that are proud and feel safe. He was only a little bit angry \add with the people of Judah\add*, but \add he is very angry with the surrounding nations because\add* they \add caused the people of Judah to experience\add* complete disaster.
\p
\v 16 Therefore, this is what he says: ‘I will again act mercifully toward \add the people of\add* Jerusalem, and they will rebuild my temple. Men will measure all \add the land in\add* the city \add before they start rebuilding the houses\add*.’
\p
\v 17 The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels also said this: ‘Tell the people that \add the people in\add* my towns \add in Judah\add* will soon be very prosperous again, and I will encourage \add the people of Jerusalem\add*, and their city will again be my chosen \add city\add*.’~”
\s1 The vision of the four horns
\p
\v 18 Then I looked up, and I saw in front of me four \add animal\add* horns.
\v 19 I asked the angel who had been speaking to me, “What are those horns?”
\p He replied, “Those horns \add represent the armies that\add* forced \add the people of\add* Jerusalem and other places in Judah and Israel to go \add to other countries\add*.”
\p
\v 20 Then Yahweh showed me four ◄craftsmen/men who make things from metal►.
\v 21 I asked, “What are those men coming to do?”
\p He replied, “\add The armies represented by\add* those horns caused \add the people of\add* Judah to be scattered, with the result that they suffered greatly. But the craftsmen have come to cause those who attacked [IDI] Judah to be terrified and crushed.”
