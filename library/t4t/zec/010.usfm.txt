\c 10
\s1 Yahweh's promises for Judah and Israel
\q1
\v 1 Ask Yahweh to cause rain to fall ◄in the springtime/before the hot season starts►,
\q2 because he is the one who makes the clouds \add from which the rain falls\add*.
\q1 He causes showers to fall on us,
\q2 and he causes crops to grow well in the fields.
\q1
\v 2 What people think that the idols in their houses suggest is only nonsense,
\q2 and people who \add say that they can\add* interpret dreams tell only lies.
\q1 When they tell people things to comfort them, what they say is useless,
\q2 so the people \add who ◄consult/trust in► them\add* are like lost sheep;
\q1 they are attacked because they have no \add one to protect them \add*
\q2 like [MET] a shepherd \add protects his sheep\add*.
\q1
\v 3 Yahweh says, “I am angry with the leaders [MET] of my people,
\q2 and I will punish them.
\q1 I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, take care of my people, the people of Judah,
\q2 \add like a shepherd takes care of his\add* [MET] flock,
\q2 and I will cause them to be like [SIM] proud/powerful war horses.
\q1
\v 4 From Judah will come rulers who will be very important,
\q2 like [MET] a cornerstone is \add the most important stone\add* for a house,
\q2 like [MET] a tent peg is very important for a tent,
\q2 like [MET] a bow is very important for ◄an archer/a man who shoots arrows►.
\q1
\v 5 They will all be like [SIM] mighty warriors
\q2 trampling \add their enemies\add* in the mud during a battle.
\q1 I, Yahweh, will be with them,
\q2 so they will fight and defeat their enemies who ride on horses.
\b
\q1
\v 6 I will cause the people [MTY] of Judah to become strong,
\q2 and I will rescue the people [MTY] of Israel.
\q1 I will bring them back \add from the countries to which they were ◄exiled/forced to go►\add*;
\q2 I will do that because I pity them.
\q1 Then they will be as though I had not abandoned them
\q2 because I am Yahweh, their God,
\q1 and I will answer them \add when they pray for help\add*.
\q1
\v 7 The people of Israel will be like [SIM] strong soldiers;
\q2 they will be as happy as \add people who have drunk a lot of\add* wine.
\q1 Their children will see \add their fathers being very happy\add*,
\q2 and they also will be happy because of what Yahweh \add has done for them\add*.
\q1
\v 8 I will signal for my people to return from ◄being exiled/other countries►,
\q2 and I will gather them together \add in their own country\add*.
\q1 I will rescue them,
\q2 and they will become very numerous like they were previously.
\q1
\v 9 I have caused them to be scattered among many people-groups,
\q2 but in those distant countries they will think about me again.
\q1 They and their children will remain alive and return \add to Judah\add*.
\q1
\v 10 I will bring them back from Egypt and from Assyria;
\q1 I will bring them back from the Gilead and Lebanon \add regions\add*,
\q2 and there will hardly be enough [HYP] space for them all \add to live in Judah\add*.
\q1
\v 11 They will endure/experience many difficulties
\q2 as though [MET] they were walking through a sea,
\q2 but I will calm the waves of the sea;
\q1 the Nile \add River which is usually\add* deep will dry up.
\q1 I will defeat the proud \add soldiers of\add* Assyria,
\q2 and I will cause Egypt to no longer be powerful [MTY].
\q1
\v 12 I will enable my people to be strong,
\q2 and they will honor me and obey [IDI] me.
\q1 \add That will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it.”
