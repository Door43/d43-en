\c 9
\s1 Israel's enemies will be punished
\p
\v 1 \add This is another\add* message \add that I received\add* from Yahweh.
\q1 \add Yahweh said\add*, “I watch [MTY] everyone, especially the tribes of Israel;
\q2 so I will \add punish the people in\add* the Hadrach \add region\add* and in Damascus \add city\add*
\q2 \add because of what they did to the people of Israel\add*.
\q1
\v 2 I will also \add punish\add* \add the people in\add* nearby Hamath \add city\add*.
\q1 I will also \add punish\add* \add the people in\add* Tyre and Sidon \add cities\add*,
\q2 even though they are \add considered to be\add* [IRO] very wise.
\q1
\v 3 \add The people in\add* Tyre built a high wall \add around their city\add*.
\q2 They piled up huge amounts of silver and gold
\q2 as though they were piles of dirt in the streets.
\q1
\v 4 But I, Yahweh, will cause their precious possessions to be taken away
\q2 and all their ships to be destroyed,
\q2 and their city will be destroyed by a fire.
\q1
\v 5 The people in Ashkelon \add city\add* will see that \add happen\add*,
\q2 and they will become very afraid.
\q1 \add The people in\add* Gaza \add city\add* will shake because of being terrified,
\q2 and the people in Ekron \add city\add* will shake too,
\q2 because they will no longer expect \add to prosper\add*.
\q1
\v 6 Foreigners will occupy Ashdod \add city\add*.
\q2 I will cause the \add people in all those cities of\add* Philistia to no longer be proud.
\q1
\v 7 I will no longer allow them to eat [MTY] meat that still has blood in it,
\q2 and I will forbid them to eat [MTY] food that I [MTY] have not allowed them to eat \add because it was offered to idols\add*.
\q1 At that time, the people \add in Philistia\add* who survive will worship me,
\q2 and they will become my people,
\q2 like [SIM] the people of Jebus did \add when they were conquered\add*.
\q1
\v 8 I will protect my temple,
\q2 and I will not allow any \add enemy soldiers\add* to enter it.
\q1 No \add enemies\add* will harm my people again,
\q2 because I will be watching over them carefully.
\s1 The coming King
\q1
\v 9 Rejoice very much, \add you people of\add* Jerusalem [APO, DOU]
\q2 and shout joyfully,
\q2 because your king will be coming to you.
\q1 He is righteous and victorious;
\q2 he will be gentle,
\q1 and he will be riding on a donkey,
\q2 on a young female donkey.
\q1
\v 10 I will get rid of the chariots in the Ephraim \add region that are used in battles\add*
\q2 and all the war horses in Jerusalem.
\q1 All the bows used in wars will be broken.
\q2 \add Your king\add* will proclaim that he will cause things to go well and peacefully in the nations.
\q1 He will rule \add the area\add* from the \add Mediterranean\add* Sea to the \add Dead\add* Sea,
\q2 and from the \add Euphrates\add* River to the most distant places on the earth.
\q1
\v 11 As for you my \add people of Jerusalem\add*,
\q2 because of the blood \add of the animals that were sacrificed to make\add* my agreement with you,
\q1 I will free your people who were forced to go to other countries
\q2 where \add it was as though they were kept\add* in a waterless pit.
\q1
\v 12 \add You people who were\add* prisoners \add in those countries\add* who still confidently expect \add God to help you\add*,
\q2 return to \add Judah\add*, where you will be safe.
\q1 This day I declare that I will give you two blessings
\q2 for \add each of the troubles that you have experienced\add*.
\q1
\v 13 I will cause Judah to be like [MET] my bow,
\q2 and I will cause Israel to be like [MET] my arrow.
\q1 I will enable you young men of Jerusalem to fight against the soldiers of Greece;
\q2 you will be like [SIM] a warrior's sword.”
\s1 Yahweh will protect his people
\q1
\v 14 \add Some day\add* Yahweh will appear \add in the sky\add* above his people,
\q2 and the arrows that he shoots will be like [SIM] lightning.
\q1 Yahweh our Lord will blow his trumpet,
\q2 and he will march \add fiercely\add*
\q2 like [MET] the storms from the south.
\q1
\v 15 The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels will protect \add his people\add*;
\q2 \add the soldiers of Judah\add* will attack and defeat their enemies \add who attack them\add* using slingshots.
\q1 \add Those soldiers of Judah\add* will drink and celebrate and shout like [SIM] people who are drunk;
\q2 they will be as full \add of wine\add* as the bowl that holds \add the blood of the animals that are sacrificed\add*
\q2 and which is then sprinkled on the corners of the altar.
\q1
\v 16 On that day, Yahweh our God will save his people
\q2 like \add a shepherd saves his flock\add* of sheep \add from danger\add*.
\q1 In their land, they will be like [SIM] jewels that sparkle on a crown.
\q1
\v 17 They will be delightful and beautiful.
\q2 The young men will become strong from \add eating\add* grain,
\q2 and the young women will become strong from \add drinking\add* new wine.
