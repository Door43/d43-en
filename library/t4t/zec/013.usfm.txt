\c 13
\s1 Getting rid of idols and false prophets
\p
\v 1 At that time \add it will be as though\add* [MET] there will be a fountain from which water flows continually to cleanse the descendants [MTY] of \add King\add* David and all the \add other\add* people in Jerusalem from the guilt of the sins that they have committed, especially from becoming unacceptable to me \add by worshiping idols\add*.
\p
\v 2 The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says, “At that time, I will prevent \add people from even mentioning\add* the names of the idols in their country, and no one will remember them anymore. I will also expel from the land all the people who falsely claim that they are prophets [DOU].
\v 3 If someone continues to prophesy \add falsely\add*, his parents must say to him, ‘You have told lies saying that Yahweh [MTY] gave those messages to you, so you must be executed.’ So if someone prophesies \add like that\add*, his own father and mother must stab him \add and kill him\add*.
\p
\v 4 At that time, the false prophets will be ashamed \add that they claimed to have received messages from me in\add* their visions and prophesies \add that they told to people\add*. They will no longer \add deceive people by\add* wearing the clothes \add that prophets usually wear\add*, clothes made of \add animals'\add* hair.
\v 5 So each of them will say, ‘I am not really a prophet; I am a farmer, and I have been a farmer on my land ever since I was a boy!’
\v 6 But others, \add seeing the wounds on his body\add* will \add suspect that he injured himself during rituals to worship idols\add*, and they will ask, ‘Why are those wounds on your body?’ And each of them \add will lie and\add* reply, ‘I was injured when I was at my friend's house.’~”
\s1 What will happen to the shepherd and the sheep
\p
\v 7 The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says,
\q1 “My sword [APO] must strike the one who is like [MET] my shepherd,
\q2 the man who is ◄my companion/very <close/dear> to me►.
\q1 When the shepherd is killed,
\q2 \add those who are like\add* [MET] his sheep will scatter.
\q2 And those who are like [MET] my little sheep will also be attacked [IDI].”
\q1
\v 8 Yahweh also says, “Two-thirds of the people in Judah will die [DOU].
\q2 \add Only\add* one-third of the people in Judah will remain alive.
\q1
\v 9 And I will test the ones that remain alive \add by causing them to experience great difficulties, to find out if they will continue to worship me\add*.
\q2 I will purify them like [MET] a man purifies gold or silver by putting it into a \add very hot\add* fire.
\q1 Then my people will call to me [MTY] \add for help\add*,
\q2 and I will answer them.
\q1 I will say to them, ‘You are my people,’
\q2 and they will say, ‘Yahweh is our God.’~”
