\c 7
\s1 The people must act justly and mercifully, not only habitually fast
\p
\v 1 When Darius had been the emperor for almost four years, on December 7, Yahweh gave me \add another\add* message.
\v 2 The people of Bethel \add city\add* sent two men, Sharezer and Regem-Melech, along with some other men, \add to the temple of the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels\add*, to request that Yahweh bless them.
\v 3 They also asked the priests at Yahweh's temple and the prophets this question: “For many years, during the fifth month \add and during the seventh month of each year\add*, we have mourned and ◄fasted/abstained from eating food►. Should we \add continue to do that\add*?”
\p
\v 4 Then the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels gave me a message.
\v 5 He said, “Tell [RHQ] the priests and all the other people of Judah that during the past 70 years, when they mourned and fasted during the fifth and seventh months \add of each year\add*, it was not really [RHQ] me, Yahweh, whom they were \add honoring\add*.
\v 6 And when they ate and drank, it was really [RHQ] to \add benefit\add* themselves.
\v 7 That is certainly [RHQ] what I continually told the former prophets to proclaim \add to the people\add*, when Jerusalem and the nearby towns were prosperous and filled with people, and people also lived in the desert area to the south and in the foothills to the west.”
\p
\v 8 Yahweh gave another message to me, saying
\v 9 “\add Tell the people that\add* this is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says: ‘Do what is just/right, and act kindly and mercifully toward each other.
\v 10 Do not ◄oppress/treat cruelly► widows or orphans or foreigners or poor people. Do not even think about doing evil to anyone else.’~”
\p
\v 11 But the people refused to pay attention \add to what Yahweh said\add*. They turned their backs to him, and put their hands over their ears \add in order to not hear what he said\add*.
\v 12 They were very stubborn [IDI], and they would not listen to the laws \add that God gave to Moses\add* or the messages that the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels told his Spirit to give to the former prophets. So the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels was very angry.
\p
\v 13 The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says, “When I called/spoke to them, they would not listen. So when they called/prayed to me, I did not listen.
\v 14 And I caused them to be scattered among many nations, where they were strangers. \add It was as though\add* [MET] a whirlwind \add picked them up and carried them away from their country\add*. The country/land that they \add were forced to\add* leave was ruined, with the result that no one could \add live there or\add* even travel through it. \add It was previously\add* a delightful land, but they caused it to become ◄desolate/like a desert►.”
