\mt1 Peter’s first letter
\c 1
\p
\v 1 Dear brothers and sisters in the faith who were chosen by God:
\p Greetings from Peter, an apostle of Christ Jesus.
\p I’m writing this letter especially to you who, because you believe in Jesus, were persecuted so that you were forced to leave the province of Judea. So now you live as foreigners in several different provinces in the Roman kingdom— namely Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.
\v 2 According to God’s plan from the beginning, He has chosen you, to be purified through the work of the Holy Spirit. And spiritually, through the Holy Spirit and by the blood\f + \fr 1:2 \fk by the blood... given a sign \ft Literally, “sprinkled with blood.”\f* of Christ Jesus, you were given a sign that you’ve become possessions of God. And because of that, you’ve become people who obey God.
\p I pray that God will always be kind to each of you and watch over you so that you live calmly under the Lord’s protection!
\s Our hope is in Jesus who lives
\p
\v 3 Praise God, the Father of our Lord Christ Jesus! Because of His amazing mercy, He has given us new life through His Son, who came back to life from death— so that we have hope that’s certain, based on Jesus who came back to life.
\v 4 And our hope is to receive all the blessings that God has prepared for us, His children. All of those blessings are kept in heaven, and they can’t be ruined or spoiled, and their beauty will never fade.
\v 5 Because you’ve believed in Jesus, God, with His great power, keeps guarding you until you reach the salvation which God has prepared for us, and which is ready to be revealed to us on the last day.
\p
\v 6 So our hope makes us very joyful, even though for awhile there are many opportunities to feel sad. For in the will of the Lord, we’re experiencing many kinds of difficulties.
\v 7 In this way, the Lord is allowing us to be tested, to prove whether we sincerely believe in Christ, or not. Our faith can be compared to gold, which is also tested and purified by burning in fire. However, gold doesn’t endure forever either. So the faith we possess is more valuable than gold, because that’s what will make us receive honor, praise and glory when Christ Jesus reveals Himself on the last day.
\v 8 You, of course, have not yet seen Jesus, but you already love Him. Even though you can’t see Him now, yet you still believe in Him. For that reason, you feel very joyful to the extent that it can’t be explained with any words. And your feeling of joy is full of glory that comes from heaven.
\v 9 You’re happy because it’s clear that we who believe in Christ Jesus will reach what we hope for— which is to have eternal life.
\p
\v 10 The prophets in times past tried diligently and carefully to understand more about how humans are saved. Even though they didn’t understand completely, they still kept telling the news of salvation from God— that we’re saved only because of God’s kindness.
\v 11 Those prophets wanted to know, of course, “Who’s the King of Salvation that will come?” And, “When will those things happen?” They asked about the prophetic news that was given by the Holy Spirit, who was within them, “When the Christ comes later on, why is He appointed to suffer so much before He’s glorified?”
\v 12 But the Holy Spirit only answered that the news about God’s plan wasn’t for they themselves. But actually, they were working to serve us, to prove the truth that we’ve heard through the Good News. Now the Holy Spirit has been sent from heaven, and with the power of His Spirit, that Good News has been given to us, including the news about God’s plan. In fact, the angels in heaven desire to know more in depth about those things.
\s A call to live holy lives
\p
\v 13-14 So get ready! Be on guard, and control yourselves. And put your hope completely in God the Father, who’ll show His kindness to us when Christ Jesus reveals Himself to us. So we should live like children of our Father, who obey Him. Let’s not slide back again to satisfy our old desires. When we lived like that, we didn’t yet know God.
\v 15 But now we should be holy in all our actions, just like God who has called us is holy.
\v 16 For it’s written in the Lord’s Word, “You should live holy, because I’m holy.”\x + \xo 1:16 \xt Lev. 11:44, 45, 19:2, 20:7\x*
\p
\v 17 We ought to remember that He, whom we call “Father”, when we pray, doesn’t discriminate between people. He’ll judge all of us according to our own deeds. So we should live with respect and fear of Him, as long as we live like foreigners on this earth.
\v 18 For we know that God has paid in full, in order to free us from our worthless lives that we inherited from our forefathers. And that payment wasn’t made using the things of this world— like gold and silver. For all of those can be ruined.
\v 19 But the payment that was used to free us is far more valuable, which is the blood of Christ— who was offered like a sacrificial lamb without any defect or blemish.
\v 20 Christ’s work was determined by God before this world was created, but He has only recently revealed Himself so that we could be saved. Christ’s coming shows that the final age of this world has begun.
\v 21 So through Christ, we believe in God, who has brought Him to life from death and given Him glory. For that reason we believe and put all of our hope completely in God.
\p
\v 22 When we surrendered ourselves to follow true teaching, we were cleansed from our sins. That enables us to love each other as brothers and sisters in our faith, with sincere hearts. So let’s really love each other with all our hearts.
\v 23 For we’ve become new people. We’ve been born again because of receiving God’s Word, and that Word grows in our hearts. God’s Word can’t be destroyed, but continues to be valid forever.
\v 24 This agrees with what’s written in the Holy Bible:
\q1 “Every human is just like grass
\q2 which quickly wilts and dies.
\q1 And the glory of humans is like wild flowers,
\q2 which quickly fall off and fade.
\q1
\v 25 But God’s Word remains valid forever.”\x + \xo 1:25 \xt Is. 40:6-8\x*
\m And of course the Good News which was given to you is included in God’s Word which ‘remains valid’!
\c 2
\s Jesus is the most important foundation stone for us
\p
\v 1 For that reason, release yourself from every kind of evil. Don’t lie, don’t pretend that you’re better than other people, don’t envy, and don’t speak about the wrongs of other people.
\v 2-3 Just like a newborn baby is always thirsty for pure milk from its mother, so you should also always be thirsty for true spiritual teaching— which is that found in God’s Word. For in God’s Word it says, “You yourselves have tasted the kindness of the Lord.”\x + \xo 2:2-3 \xt Ps. 34:8\x* In that way, you’ll keep maturing spiritually until the day God saves us from this world.
\p
\v 4 For we are now getting closer to the Lord Jesus. Even though man considered Him useless, God highly valued Him, and chose Him to become like the most important foundation stone in God’s Temple. For us, He has become a living foundation stone.
\v 5 And each of us are also like pillars and other beams that God uses to build His Temple, until we become a dwelling place for God’s Spirit Himself. And in His Temple, we become priests who serve God. Our task as priests is to bring spiritual offerings to Him, which God accepts because we’ve become one with Christ Jesus.
\v 6 This agrees with what’s written in the Lord’s Word,
\q1 “See, I chose a stone which I highly value,
\q2 which I placed as the foundation stone in My Temple in Jerusalem.\f + \fr 2:6 \fk Jerusalem \ft Peter used another name for Jerusalem— namely Zion.\f*
\q1 Everyone who believes in Him won’t be disappointed.”\x + \xo 2:6 \xt Is. 28:16\x*
\m
\v 7 So for us who believe in Jesus, He’s extremely valuable. But for everyone who doesn’t believe, it happens to them like this verse in the Lord’s Word:
\q1 “The stone which was considered useless by the builders
\q2 God made into the most important foundation stone.”\x + \xo 2:7 \xt Ps. 118:22\x*
\m
\v 8 And there’s another verse that says,
\q1 “That stone will cause many people to fall,
\q2 like when someone’s foot stubs something so that he falls.”\x + \xo 2:8 \xt Is. 8:14-15\x*
\m They fall because they don’t want to believe and follow God’s Word. That’s what God determined for them.
\p
\v 9 But we were chosen by God to become a special people for Him, a holy people group, and priests who serve Him who’s the High King. God has done all of that for us so that we tell the amazing things which He has done— especially when He called us out of darkness to enter into His amazing light.
\v 10 So we’re the ones intended in the verse of God’s Word where it’s written,
\q1 “You weren’t God’s possessions before now,
\q2 but now you’ve become His own special possessions.
\q1 God didn’t take pity on you before now,
\q2 but now you’ve become people whom He loves.”\x + \xo 2:10 \xt Hos. 2:23\x*
\s Live as citizens of God’s kingdom
\p
\v 11 Brothers and Sisters whom I love, we’re like foreigners and nomadic people in this world. For that reason, I beg each of you not to follow your evil bodily desires. Those desires fight against the desires of our souls.
\v 12 For now we’re living among people who don’t yet know God, and they accuse us of being evil people. So we need to show our good behavior to them, and eventually they may become aware and repent. In that way, they’ll praise God when they see Him on the last day.
\p
\v 13 In order that the good name of our Lord Christ Jesus isn’t smeared, we should submit to all of the government authorities in this world, both to the head of the nation as the highest authority
\v 14 and also to his representatives to whom he gives the duty to punish people who do evil, and to honor people who do good.
\v 15 For the will of God for us is that through our good deeds we’ll shut the mouths of people who aren’t wise, who like to spread slander.
\v 16 Remember that before we were set free by Jesus, we lived like the devil’s slaves. Let’s not think: “I’m free now, and included in those who are chosen by God, so it doesn’t matter if I commit sin.” Instead, we have to consider ourselves to be servants belonging to God.
\v 17 So we have to respect everyone, love our brothers and sisters in the faith, live with feelings of fear and respect for God, and respect the head of our nation in this world.
\s Christ’s suffering is an example for us to follow
\p
\v 18 Each of you who’ve been sold to rich people and work as their slaves should obey their desires with complete respect— not only when they’re good, but also when they’re mean.
\v 19 If you don’t do wrong, and then are beaten by your master, you should just be quiet and remember that the Lord sees the situation too. In that way, the Lord will bless you.
\v 20 But if you’ve done wrong and are punished, don’t hope that the Lord will bless you— even if you remain quiet. You’re the one who was wrong— you know?! But if you’re made to suffer even though you’re serving well, and you endure it patiently, God will bless you.
\v 21 It was for that purpose that God called you! For Christ Himself has suffered for us. And He became the example for us, so that we can endure in suffering like He did.
\q1
\v 22 “He never ever committed sin,
\q2 and no one ever heard Him lie.”\x + \xo 2:22 \xt Is. 53:9\x*
\m
\v 23 When Christ was insulted, He didn’t answer back with insults. When He suffered, He didn’t say, “Look out, I will pay you back too.” But He just submitted Himself to God, because He knew that God is a just judge.
\v 24 Jesus took our sins in His own body on the cross, so that spiritually we die to the power of sin, and live again to become new people who live right before God. So through Jesus wounds, we’ve been healed.
\v 25 We used to live like sheep that had gone astray. But now we’ve returned to the Shepherd who takes care of our lives!
\c 3
\s Regarding living as husband and wife
\p
\v 1 In the same way, each of you wives should obey the will of your husband. In doing that, if your husband doesn’t yet believe in the teaching of Christ, by just seeing the way you live, he may become a believer. You don’t need to say anything to him,
\v 2 because every day you testify to him through your pure deeds that are based on respect for God.
\v 3 Don’t let your beauty be just outward beauty, such as hair arrangements, wearing gold jewelry or beautiful clothes.
\v 4 But let your beauty be something that’s invisible too— which is beauty that comes from within your heart. That means a heart which is gentle and calm. Even when you’re old, that beauty won’t fade away and is very valuable in God’s eyes.
\v 5 That was the way holy women in ancient times made themselves beautiful: They relied on God, and followed the will of their own husband.
\v 6 For example, Sarah followed the will of Abraham and called him “Master.” Each of you will also be daughters of Sarah, if you keep doing good and don’t fear any kind of threat from your husband or other people.
\p
\v 7 In the same way, each of you husbands should live well with your wife, and be aware that women are physically weaker than men. You also have to respect your wife, remembering that she will enter eternal life too— through the kindness of God. If you don’t respect your wife, then your prayers won’t be heard, and won’t be answered by God.
\s Suffering for doing right
\p
\v 8 So in conclusion, you should live with one purpose, be humble, love each other, have compassion on each other, and be kind to each other as brothers and sisters in the faith.
\v 9 When someone else does evil to you, don’t repay it with evil. When someone insults you, don’t repay it by insulting him. But pray that God will bless him. It’s for this very reason that we’ve been called to become God’s special possessions: So that when you’re made to suffer, you repay with blessing. In that way, you’ll be blessed by God in days to come too.
\v 10 For it’s written in God’s Word,
\b
\q1 “If you want to enjoy this life
\q2 and experience many days full of blessings,
\q1 you have to guard your tongue so that you don’t lie,
\q2 and so that you don’t speak evil about others.
\q1
\v 11 You must also stop doing evil things,
\q2 and try to do what’s good.
\q1 You should seek the straight path,
\q2 so that you may live in peace with other people.
\q1
\v 12 For the Lord’s eyes are always focused on the people who live right,
\q2 and the Lord’s ears are always open to hear their prayers,
\q1 but closed to the prayers of people who do evil.”\x + \xo 3:12 \xt Ps. 34:12-16\x*
\p
\v 13 If you’re always zealous to do good like that, no one will trouble you.
\v 14 But if you still suffer because of doing things that are right, remember that the Lord will certainly bless you. And remember this Word of the Lord’s: “Don’t be afraid of those who threaten you. Don’t be worried.”\x + \xo 3:14 \xt Is. 8:12\x*
\v 15 In situations like that, lift up Christ as the one and only Lord of your heart. And each of you should always be ready to answer people who ask, “Why do you still hope in Jesus?”
\v 16 But you should answer with gentleness and respect. And watch out so that your heart stays clean. In that way, people who tell untrue stories about you will be ashamed of themselves when they see proof that your behavior is good, because you serve Christ.
\p
\v 17 For that reason, remember: We don’t need to be ashamed of suffering just for doing good— if that happens according to God’s will. But if we suffer because of doing evil things, we should be ashamed.
\p
\v 18 For Christ is our example. He Himself suffered when He died for our sins. He who wasn’t guilty, took the place of us who are guilty. He did that to make us at peace with God. But after He was physically killed, God’s Spirit brought Him back to life.
\v 19 And with power from God’s Spirit, He descended to the world of the dead, to tell the news from God to the spirits who had been imprisoned for a long time.
\v 20 Those were the spirits of people who didn’t obey God in the time of Noah, even though God waited patiently for them to repent while Noah was building that big ship. Finally, not many— only eight people, entered the ship and were carried safely through the flood.
\v 21 That flood illustrates the water of baptism for us. Baptism isn’t for cleaning dirt from our bodies. But when we’re baptized, we’re saved, because we promise God with a clean heart, “Now I want to follow Christ Jesus.” Then we join in being spiritually buried and made alive again with Jesus.
\v 22 But now Jesus has ascended to heaven, and He’s ruling there with God.\f + \fr 3:22 \fk ruling there with God \ft Literally, “at God’s right hand.”\f* And God has made all angels, authorities, and all governments obey Jesus.
\c 4
\s Advice to live to glorify God
\p
\v 1 So, we need to remember that Christ suffered for us when He lived as a normal human being in this world. For that reason we should also encourage ourselves by thinking thoughts like Christ’s. For anyone who suffers because of following Jesus has also decided to stop sinning.
\v 2 In that way, for the rest of the time you live in this world, you won’t live with worldly human desires anymore, but according to the will of God.
\v 3 For before following Jesus, we had already wasted a lot of time in living as worldly people who didn’t know God! So we don’t need to live like those who are involved in all kinds of immoral sins and follow all the desires of the body anymore, drunkenness, taking part in sex parties and drinking parties, and doing filthy things in worshipping idols.
\p
\v 4 People who still chase their desires here and there are surprised by us and think, “Why don’t they join us anymore?” Because of that, they insult us.
\v 5 But before long, they’ll each have to give an account for their wickedness. For God is now prepared to judge everyone— both those who’ve already died, as well as those who are still alive.
\v 6 That’s why the Good News was given by Christ to those spirits in the world of the dead. Let that be a warning to us all: God will judge all of us according to what we have done. But the Good News has been given so that we can live with God forever.
\s The way to use the abilities which we receive from God
\p
\v 7 The last day of this world is already near. For that reason, we should control ourselves and guard our thoughts so that we’re always ready to pray.
\v 8 But the most important thing of all is that we must sincerely love each other. For the trait of loving each other motivates us to forgive each other.
\v 9 And if a brother in the faith needs a place to stay, I hope that you’re always ready to receive him in your home without complaining.
\p
\v 10 As a sign of God’s kindness, we’ve each received different abilities from God’s Spirit. And each of those abilities was given so that we would serve each other. So each of us are responsible to use those abilities well.
\v 11 So if you were given the ability to teach the Lord’s Word, or to give news from God, you should think like this, “The words that I give don’t come from myself, but from the Lord.” If you were given the ability to serve in another way, you should think, “I can serve only because the Lord gives that ability to me.” In doing that, God will be glorified through everything we do, for Christ Jesus gives those abilities to us. He’s the one who’s powerful and deserves to be praised forever! Amen.
\s Suffering for becoming a follower of Christ
\p
\v 12 Brothers and Sisters whom I love, don’t be shocked when you experience a lot of suffering because of following Jesus. We’ll experience sufferings which are very painful, of course, which feel like being burned with fire. This happens in order to test if we sincerely believe in Christ, and to prove if we’re faithful to Him or not. So we shouldn’t think that the trouble we experience is something unusual.
\v 13 But we really should be happy, for if we take part in experiencing suffering like Jesus experienced, that means we really are one with Him. In that way, we’ll really be full of joy for sure, when He comes back to reveal His glory!
\v 14 So if someone insults you for following Christ, may you feel that you’ve been blessed by God. For that person’s insults are a sign proving that the glory of God’s Spirit is with you.
\v 15 But if you suffer for becoming a murderer, a thief, a criminal, or even because you meddle in other people’s affairs, you should be ashamed.
\v 16 But if you suffer because you’re a Christian, don’t be ashamed. Instead, you should praise God because others call you a follower of Christ.
\v 17 For the last day has come in which God has begun to judge the world. And we— who are His own people, are the ones now being judged first. This happens because through suffering, we’re made perfect. In that way, the people who don’t want to believe in the Good News about Christ will be punished much more harshly than the suffering we’re experiencing now.
\v 18 As it’s written in God’s Word,
\q1 “It isn’t easy for a good person to be saved.
\q2 So sinners and those who oppose God
\q2 will be thrown into the fire of hell for sure.”\x + \xo 4:18 \xt Prov. 11:31\x*
\m
\v 19 For that reason, if God desires for us to suffer, we should keep doing what’s good and surrender ourselves to God with this thought, “Our Creator is always faithful to do everything just like He promised us.”
\c 5
\s Advice for church elders
\p
\v 1 I want to give this message to every elder among you: I became an eye witness of all the sufferings of Christ, and I was also chosen to be an elder. So I will take part, along with you, in the glory that Christ will reveal to us when He comes again. For that reason, I’m asking each of you:
\v 2 Shepherd the sheep who were entrusted to you by God gladly— not because you have to. And don’t take on this responsibility in order to make a profit. But do this ministry because you sincerely want to serve God.
\v 3 Don’t consider yourself to be a king over the flock of sheep which God has entrusted to you, but be an example to them.
\v 4 Then when our King— who’s the Great Shepherd comes, each of us will be given a crown. And that crown will reflect the glory of Christ, and its beauty won’t fade away.
\s Giving final encouragements
\p
\v 5 This is what I also want to tell all the young people: You should obey the elders. Show the attitude of humility to all of the other members, because
\q1 “God opposes those who are proud,
\q2 but He’s kind to those who are humble.”\x + \xo 5:5 \xt Prov. 3:34\x*
\m
\v 6 For that reason, whatever happens, humble yourself before Almighty God, then at the time He desires, He’ll lift you up.
\v 7 Commit to God all of the problems that make you worry, because He cares for you.
\p
\v 8 Watch out! And you should keep controlling yourselves. For our enemy, the devil, is like a lion who roars loudly while walking around looking for someone he can eat.
\v 9 Oppose him by continuing to believe in Christ! For you know that our brothers and sisters in the faith, in the whole world, are standing firm while experiencing suffering like you experience.
\p
\v 10 Of course the sufferings that we experience now, are just temporary. But because God is always very kind, He has called us through Christ to take part in His glory forever. After we suffer for just a short time, He Himself will help, strengthen, heal, and give us new inspiration.
\v 11 He is the powerful One forever. Amen!
\s Final greetings
\p
\v 12 I’ve written this short letter to you with the help of Silas, whom I consider to be our trustworthy brother in the faith. My purpose in writing this letter is to encourage your hearts by convincing you that God shows His kindness to us through everything we experience. So you should keep standing firm in God’s kindness!
\p
\v 13 The church here in the city of Babylon—\f + \fr 5:13 \fk church in the city of Babylon \ft Literally, “She (the woman) who’s in Babylon.” Peter used the name of the city of Babylon in exchange for the actual name— namely Rome. That name reminds the first readers of the time the people of Israel were exiled to Babylon.\f* which like you, has been chosen by God, sends their greetings to you all. Greetings also from Mark, whom I love as my own son.
\v 14 Brothers and Sisters, as those who’ve been purified by God, you should give each other greetings full of love.\f + \fr 5:14 \fk greetings full of love \ft Literally, “holy kiss.”\f*
\p To each of you who are one with Christ, I pray that you’ll keep living with the feeling of calm in the Lord’s protection.
