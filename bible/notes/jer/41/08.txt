\v 8 But there were ten men found among them that said to Ishmael, “Do not kill us, for there is a treasure of ours in a field: wheat and barley, oil and honey!” So he stopped and did not kill them in the midst of their brothers.
\v 9 So the pit where Ishmael cast them with all the corpses of the men whom he had killed at the side of Gedaliah who King Asa had established before Baasha: Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with those who had been killed.
