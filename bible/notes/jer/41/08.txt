\v 8 But there were ten men among them who said to Ishmael, "Do not kill us, for there are provisions of ours in a field: wheat and barley, oil and honey." So he did not kill them with their other companions.
\v 9 The pit where Ishmael threw all the corpses of the men whom he had killed with Gedaliah—this large pit had been dug by King Asa when he was attacked by King Baasha of Israel. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with those whom he had killed.
