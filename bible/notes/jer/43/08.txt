\v 8 So the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes and said,
\v 9 "Take some large stones in your hand, and, in the sight of the people of Judah, hide them in the cement pavement at the entrance to Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes."
\v 10 Then say to them, "Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this, 'See, I am about to send messengers to take Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon as my servant. I will place his throne over these stones that you, Jeremiah, have buried. Nebuchadnezzar will place his pavilion over them.
