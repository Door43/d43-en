\v 1 It happened that Jeremiah finished proclaiming to all the people all the words of Yahweh their God that Yahweh their God had told him to say.
\v 2 Azariah son of Hoshaiah, Johanan son of Kareah, and all the arrogant men said to Jeremiah, “You are telling lies. Yahweh our God has not sent you to say, ‘Do not go to Egypt to live there.’
\v 3 For Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you against us so that you can give us over into the hand of the Chaldeans, for you to cause our death and to make us captives in Babylon.”
