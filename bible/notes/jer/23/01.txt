<usfm>
\v 1 Yahweh declares, "Terrible things will happen to the leaders \f + \ft metaphor \f* of my people—those who are like shepherds of the people who are like my sheep—because they have scattered my people and sent them away, and have not taken care of them.
\v 2 So, this is what I, Yahweh, the God whom the Israelite people \add worship\add*, say to those leaders: 'Instead of taking care of my people and \add leading them to places where they are safe like a shepherd does for\add* his sheep, you have scattered them. So I will punish you for the evil things that you have done.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In verses 1-4, Yahweh refers to Israel as his pasture, the people of Israel as his sheep, and the leaders of Israel as the shepherds. Shepherds have a duty to protect the sheep, but the leaders were not doing that. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **You have scattered my flock and have driven them away** - These two phrases have similar meanings. The second one strengthens the thought in the first. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
