===== Translation Notes: =====

   * **the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture**  -  Yahweh refers to Israel as his pasture, the people of Israel as his sheep and their leaders in Israel as the shepherds. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Yahweh's declaration** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. 
  * **You are scattering my flock and driving them away** - These two clauses have similar meanings. The second one strengthens the thought in the first. (See” Parallelism)
  * **pay you back for the evil** - Yahweh refers to evil actions like a loan that was given and can be paid back. AT: "have revenge for the evil"
