\v 2 So, this is what I, Yahweh, the God whom the Israelite people \add worship\add*, say to those leaders: 'Instead of taking care of my people and \add leading them to places where they are safe like a shepherd does for\add* his sheep, you have scattered them.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture** - Yahweh refers to Israel as his pasture, the people of Israel as his sheep and their leaders in Israel as the shepherds. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Yahweh's declaration** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. 
  * **scattering my flock and driving them away** - These two phrases have similar meanings. The second one strengthens the thought in the first. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **pay you back for the evil** - Yahweh refers to evil actions like a loan that was given and can be paid back. AT: "have revenge for the evil"
