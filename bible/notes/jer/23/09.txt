\v 9 Regarding the prophets, my heart is broken in me, and all of my bones tremble. I have become like a drunk man,
\q like a man whom wine has overpowered, because of Yahweh and his holy words.
\q
\v 10 For the land is full of adulterers. Because of these the land is dried up.
\q The meadows in the wilderness dry up. These prophets' paths are wicked; their power is not used in a right manner.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The speaker has changed from Yahweh to Jeremiah.

  * **Regarding the prophets, my heart is broken in me, and all of my bones tremble** - The prophet's heart is broken and bones are trembling because he is afraid of the judgment that will result from the lies of the false prophets. AT: "I have great fear for what will happen because of the false prophets" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **my heart is broken in me** - The prophet's emotions are spoken of as if they were his heart. AT: "I am very sad" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **all of my bones tremble** - Here the emotion of fear is spoken of as if the prophet's bones were trembling. AT: "I am very afraid" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I have become like a drunk man, like a man whom wine has overpowered** - Here being very sad and afraid is spoken of as if the sufferer were like a drunk man. AT: "I am like a drunk man; I cannot control myself" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **the land is full of adulterers** - This exaggeration is used to show the level of sinfulness which was present at the time of Jeremiah. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **adulterers** - This word probably stands here both for the literal idea that most men in the nation had committed adultery against their own wives, and also, as is common in biblical language, for the idea that they had abandoned Yahweh in order to worship idols. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the land is dried up** - Some modern versions interpret this Hebrew phrase as "the land mourns."
