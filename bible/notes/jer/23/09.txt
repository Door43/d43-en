\q
\v 9 Regarding the prophets, my heart is broken in me, and all of my bones tremble. I have become like a drunk man,
\q like a man whom wine has overpowered, because of Yahweh and his holy words.
\q
\v 10 For the land is full of adulterers. Because of these the land mourns.
\q The meadows in the wilderness dry up. These prophets' paths are wicked; their power is not used in a right manner.

===== Translation Notes: =====

The speaker has changed from Yahweh to Jeremiah.

  * **Regarding the prophets, my heart is broken in me and all of my bones tremble,** - AT: "I have great fear for what will happen because of the false prophets" (See : [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I have become like a drunk man, like a man whom wine has overpowered** - AT: "I have lost control" (See : [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
  * **the land is full of adulterers** - This exaggeration is used to show the level of sinfulness which was present at the time of Jeremiah. (See : [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **the land mourns** - The land suffers because of the people's sin. (See : [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
