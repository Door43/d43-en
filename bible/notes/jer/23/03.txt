===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues to speak about the people of Israel as his sheep and the leaders of Israel as shepherds.

    * **to a grazing place** - AT: "to where all their needs will be supplied"
    * **dismayed** - a feeling of hopelessness.
    * **fruitful and increase** - These two words mean the same thing and are used together for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
    * **None of them** - "None of my people"
