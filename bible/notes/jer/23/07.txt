====== Jeremiah 23:7-8 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 Yahweh also says that at that time, people who are solemnly promising to do something will no longer say, "\add I will do it\add* as surely as Yahweh lives, who rescued the Israelite people from Egypt."
\v 8 Instead, they will say, "\add I will do it\add* as surely as Yahweh lives, who brought us Israelite people back to our own land, from the land to the northeast and from all the other countries to which he had exiled us." And they will live in their own land again.

\v 7 Therefore see, days are coming—this is Yahweh's declaration—when they will no longer say, 'As Yahweh lives, who brought the people of Israel up from the land of Egypt.'
\v 8 Instead they will say, 'As Yahweh lives, who brought up and who led back the descendants of the house of Israel from the northern land and all the lands where they had been driven.' Then they will live in their own land."
