===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 Yahweh also says that at that time, people who are solemnly promising to do something will no longer say, "\add I will do it\add* as surely as Yahweh lives, who rescued the Israelite people from Egypt."
\v 8 Instead, they will say, "\add I will do it\add* as surely as Yahweh lives, who brought us Israelite people back to our own land, from the land to the northeast and from all the other countries to which he had exiled us." And they will live in their own land again.

\v 7 Therefore, behold, the days come, says Jehovah, that they shall no more say, As Jehovah liveth, who brought up the
children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
\v 8 but, As Jehovah liveth, who brought up and who led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all
the countries whither I had driven them. And they shall dwell in their own land.
