====== Jeremiah 23:25-27 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 25 I have heard those prophets prophesy lies, saying that they are telling people messages from me \f + \ft metonymy \f*. They say, '\add Listen to me tell you\add* the dream I received \add from God last night\add*! I really had this dream!'
\v 26 How long will they continue to do this? How long will those lying prophets continue to prophesy things that come only from their own minds?
\v 27 They think that because of the dreams that they tell to each other, people will forget me \f + \ft metonymy \f*, like their ancestors forgot about me when they started to worship Baal.

\v 25 I have heard what the prophets have said, those who were prophesying deceit in my name. They said, 'I had a dream! I had a dream!'
\v 26 How long will this go on, prophets who prophesy lies from their minds, and who prophesy from the deceit in their hearts?
\v 27 They are planning on making my people forget my name with the dreams that they report, each one to his neighbor, just as their ancestors forgot my name in favor of Baal's name.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues to deliver his message about the false prophets and priests that he began in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:23:09|23:9]] and completes in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:23:37|23:40]].

  * **prophesying deceit** - The word "deceit" can be expressed as an adjective. AT: "prophesying deceitfully" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **in my name** - This phrase refers to speaking with Yahweh's power and authority or as his representative. See how you translated this phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:14:13|14:14]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I had a dream!** - They meant that this dream was from God. This can be made explicit. AT: "I had a dream from Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **How long will this go on, prophets who prophesy lies from their minds, and who prophesy from the deceit in their hearts?** - Yahweh asks this question to emphasize that this is something that should not continue. AT: "This should not continue, prophets declaring lies which they themselves have made up." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **prophesy lies from their minds ... prophesy from the deceit in their hearts** - These two phrases mean the same thing and emphasize that the false prophets made up their prophesies. AT: "prophesy things that come only from their own minds" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **forget my name ... forgot my name** - Here the word "name" refers to the whole being of Yahweh. AT: "forget me ... forgot me" or "forget who I am ... forgot who I am" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **in favor of Baal's name** - Here "Baal's name" refers to the god Baal. AT: "leading my people to worship Baal instead of me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
