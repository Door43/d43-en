\v 28 Allow those false prophets to tell people their dreams, but those who have messages that really come from me should proclaim those messages faithfully. I, Yahweh, say that like straw and grain are certainly very different, my messages and the message from those false prophets are certainly very different .
\v 29 It is as though my messages burn like a fire  and is like a hammer that smashes rocks into pieces when it affects someone's heart.
\p
\v 30 Therefore, I, Yahweh say, I oppose all those prophets who steal messages from each other and claim that those messages came from me.
