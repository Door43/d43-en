===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 37 This is what you should ask each prophet: 'What did Yahweh reply \add when you talked to him\add*? What is he saying to us?'
\v 38 If he replies, '\add What I told you\add* is a prophecy\f + \ft Or: message \f* from Yahweh,' you should say to him, 'You have continued to say, "I received a prophecy\f + \ft Or: message \f* from Yahweh" even though I told you to not claim that you have received prophecies\f + \ft Or: messages \f* from Yahweh.'
\v 39 So I, Yahweh, will get rid of you \add false prophets\add*. I will expel you from my presence. And I will get rid of this city that I gave to you and to your ancestors.
\v 40 I will cause people to make fun of you forever. People will never forget that you were disgraced."

\v 37 This is what you should ask each prophet: 'What did Yahweh reply when you talked to him? What is he saying to us?'
\v 38 If he replies, 'What I told you is a prophecy from Yahweh' then let him know I will punish him, becasue I told my true prophets not to give any messages to this people right now.
\v 39 So I, Yahweh, will get rid of you false prophets. I will expel you from my presence. And I will get rid of this city that I gave to you and to your ancestors.
\v 40 I will cause people to make fun of you forever. People will never forget that you were disgraced."

\v 37 Thus you shall say to the prophet, ‘What did Yahweh answer you, and what did Yahweh declare?’
\v 38 And if you speak the pronouncement of Yahweh, therefore thus says Yahweh: Because of your speaking this word, the pronouncement of Yahweh, when I sent out to you and said 
‘Do not speak the pronouncement of Yahweh!’
\v 39 Therefore behold! I will forget you who have forgotten and abandon you along with the city that I gave you and your fathers from before me.
\v 40 Then I will set everlasting shame and insult upon you that will not be forgotten.”
