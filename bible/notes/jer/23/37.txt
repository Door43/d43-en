====== Jeremiah 23:37-40 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 37 This is what you should ask each prophet: 'What did Yahweh reply \add when you talked to him\add*? What is he saying to us?'
\v 38 If he replies, '\add What I told you\add* is a prophecy\f + \ft Or: message \f* from Yahweh,' you should say to him, 'You have continued to say, "I received a prophecy\f + \ft Or: message \f* from Yahweh" even though I told you to not claim that you have received prophecies\f + \ft Or: messages \f* from Yahweh.'
\v 39 So I, Yahweh, will get rid of you \add false prophets\add*. I will expel you from my presence. And I will get rid of this city that I gave to you and to your ancestors.
\v 40 I will cause people to make fun of you forever. People will never forget that you were disgraced."

\v 37 This is what you should ask each prophet: 'What did Yahweh reply when you talked to him? What is he saying to us?'
\v 38 If he replies, 'What I told you is a prophecy from Yahweh' then let him know I will punish him, becasue I told my true prophets not to give any messages to this people right now.
\v 39 So I, Yahweh, will get rid of you false prophets. I will expel you from my presence. And I will get rid of this city that I gave to you and to your ancestors.
\v 40 I will cause people to make fun of you forever. People will never forget that you were disgraced."

<usfm>
\v 37 This is how you talk to the prophet, ‘What did Yahweh answer you? What did Yahweh declare?
\v 38 You report a declaration from Yahweh, but Yahweh says this, "Because you say, 'Here is a declaration of Yahweh,' even though I sent a command to you and said, 'Do not say: This is a declaration from Yahweh.'
\v 39 Therefore, see, I am about to pick you up and throw you away from me, along with the city that I gave you and your ancestors.
\v 40 Then I will put everlasting shame and insult on you that will not be forgotten."'”
