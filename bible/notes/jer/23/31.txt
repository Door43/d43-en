\v 31 I oppose those prophets who speak \f + \ft metonymy \f* their own messages but claim that those messages came from me.
\v 32 I oppose those prophets who falsely say that I told them something in a vision, but they are only telling lies that cause my people to sin. I did not send those prophets. I did not even appoint them to be prophets. And they have no messages that will benefit my people at all. \add That is what I\add*, Yahweh, declare."

<usfm>
\v 31 See, I am against the prophets—this is Yahweh’s declaration—who use their tongues to prophesy proclamations.
\v 32 See, I am against the prophets who dream deceitfully—this is Yahweh’s declaration—and then proclaim them and in this way mislead my people with their deceit and boasting. I am against them, for I have not sent them out nor given them commands. So they will certainly not help this people—this is Yahweh’s declaration.
