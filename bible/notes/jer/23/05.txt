===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **See** - AT: "Understand this"
    * **days are coming** - A future time period is referred to as days because it will be a short period of time.  The future is referred to as coming to say it will happen. AT: "this will happen" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
    * **Yahweh’s declaration** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]].
    * **a righteous branch** - AT: "a righteous descendant" Like a branch comes from a tree, this future leader will come from king David's family line. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **he will bring prosperity** - When this future leader takes control, his people will become more successful.  It will be like he brought success with him as a possession. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]) 
    * **Judah will be rescued, and Israel will live in security** - These two sentences have similar meanings. The second one strengthens the thought in the first. (See” Parallelism) 
    * **Judah will be rescued** - AT: "He will rescue Judah from their enemies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
