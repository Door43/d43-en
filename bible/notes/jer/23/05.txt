\q
\v 5 See, the days are coming—this is Yahweh's declaration—when I will raise up for David a righteous branch.
\q He will reign as king; he will act wisely and cause justice and righteousness in the land.
\q
\v 6 In his days Judah will be rescued, and Israel will live in security.
\q Then this is the name by which he will be called: Yahweh is our righteousness.
