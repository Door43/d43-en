====== Jeremiah 23:16-18 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 This is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says:
\q1 "Do not pay any attention to what those \add false\add* prophets say to you,
\q2 because they are just fooling\f + \ft Or: deceiving \f* you.
\q1 They tell you about visions that they have only thought\f + \ft Or: created \f* in their own minds,
\q2 not about visions that I have given them.
\q1
\v 17 They habitually say to those who hate me,
\q2 '\add Yahweh says that\add* you will have peace.'
\q1 And they say to those who stubbornly do what they want to do,
\q2 'Nothing bad will happen to you \add because of your doing those things\add*.'
\q1
\v 18 But none of them \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* has ever been in a council meeting in heaven
\q2 in order to listen to a message from me.
\q2 None of them has paid attention to \f + \ft doublet \f* anything that I, Yahweh, have said.
\q1

\v 16 This is what Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, says:
\q1 "Do not pay any attention to what those false prophets say to you,

<usfm>
\q
\v 16 Yahweh of hosts says this, "Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you.
\q They have deluded you! They are announcing visions from their own minds, not from Yahweh's mouth.
\q
\v 17 They are constantly saying to those who dishonor me, 'Yahweh declares there will be peace for you.'
\q For everyone walking in the stubbornness of his own heart says, 'Disaster will not come upon you.'
\q
\v 18 Yet who has stood in Yahweh's council meeting? Who sees and hears his word?
\q Who pays attention to his word and listens?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jeremiah continues to deliver Yahweh's message about the false prophets and priests that he began in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:23:09|23:9]].

  * **Yahweh of hosts says this** - Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:06:06|6:6]].
  * **They have deluded you!** - "The prophets have caused you to believe something that is not true!"
  * **visions from their own minds** - Here "minds" refers to the thoughts of the false prophets. AT: "visions that they imagined" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **not from Yahweh's mouth** - Here "mouth" refers to what Yahweh said. AT: "not what Yahweh said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **They are constantly saying** - The word "constantly" is an exaggeration to emphasize that this is what they normally say. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **everyone walking in the stubbornness of his own heart says** - Here "heart" refers to their desires. To follow those desires is spoken of as walking in them. AT: "everyone stubbornly does whatever they desire to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Disaster will not come upon you** - "Nothing bad will happen to you" (UDB) 
  * **Yet who has stood in Yahweh's council meeting? Who sees and hears his word? Who pays attention to his word and listens?** - These questions are used to rebuke the priests and false prophets for not obeying Yahweh. AT: "No one advises Yahweh. No one understands what Yahweh says. No one obeys Yahweh's commands." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **pays attention to his word and listens** - These two phrases mean the same thing. They can be combined in one phrase. AT: "obeys his word at all"
