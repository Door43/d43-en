<usfm>
\v 16 This is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says:
\q1 "Do not pay any attention to what those \add false\add* prophets say to you,
\q2 because they are just fooling\f + \ft Or: deceiving \f* you.
\q1 They tell you about visions that they have only thought\f + \ft Or: created \f* in their own minds,
\q2 not about visions that I have given them.
\q1
\v 17 They habitually say to those who hate me,
\q2 '\add Yahweh says that\add* you will have peace.'
\q1 And they say to those who stubbornly do what they want to do,
\q2 'Nothing bad will happen to you \add because of your doing those things\add*.'
\q1
\v 18 But none of them \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* has ever been in a council meeting in heaven

<usfm>
\q
\v 16 Yahweh of hosts says this, "Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you. 
\q They have deluded you! They are announcing visions from their own minds, not from Yahweh's mouth.
\q
\v 17 They are constantly saying to those who dishonor me, 'Yahweh declares there will be peace for you.'
\q And everyone walking in the stubbornness of his own heart says, 'Disaster will not come upon you.'
\q
\v 18 Yet who has stood in Yahweh's council meeting? Who sees and hears his word?
\q Who pays attention to his word and listens?
