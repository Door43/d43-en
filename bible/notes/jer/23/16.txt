\p
\v 16 Thus says Jehovah of hosts, Listen not to the words of the prophets that prophesy to you: they teach you vanity;
they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of Jehovah.
\v 17 They say continually to them that despise me, Jehovah has said, You shall have peace; and to every one that walks
in the stubbornness of his own heart they say, No evil shall come upon you.
\v 18 For who has stood in the council of Jehovah, that he should perceive and hear his word? who has marked my word, and
heard it?
