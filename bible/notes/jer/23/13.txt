====== Jeremiah 23:13-15 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 Previously I saw that the prophets in Samaria were doing something that was wrong;
\q2 they were prophesying, saying that Baal \add gave them the messages that they were proclaiming\add*,
\q1 and they were deceiving my people.
\q1
\v 14 And now I have seen the prophets in Jerusalem doing terrible things.
\q2 They commit adultery
\q2 and habitually tell lies.
\q1 They encourage [IDI] evil people to continue to do evil things,
\q2 with the result that the people do not stop sinning.
\q1 Those prophets are as wicked as the people in Sodom and Gomorrah were.
\p
\v 15 So, this is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says about those \add false\add* prophets:
\q1 "I will give those prophets bitter things to eat
\q2 and poison to drink,
\q1 because it is because of them that this land is filled with \add people who do\add* wicked deeds."

\q
\v 13 Among the prophets in Samaria I saw this disgusting thing. They prophesied by Baal
\q and they caused my people Israel go the wrong way.
\q
\v 14 And among the prophets in Jerusalem I have seen horrible things: 
\q They commit adultery and walk in deceit.
\q They strengthen the hands of evildoers; no one turns back from his evildoing.
\q All of them have become like Sodom to me and its inhabitants like Gomorrah!"
\q
\v 15 Therefore Yahweh of hosts says this concerning the prophets,
\q "Look, I am about to make them eat wormwood and drink poisonous water,
\q for pollution has gone out from the prophets of Jerusalem to all the land."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I have seen offensiveness** - "I have seen sinfulness" or "I have seen wrongdoing."
  * **off the right path** - led in the wrong direction morally or spiritually. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]) 
  * **walk in deceit** - "live in dishonesty"
  * **strengthen the hands of evildoers** - "they strengthen those who do evil" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **no one turns back from his evildoing** - "They continue in their sin"
  * **All of them have become like Sodom ... like Gomorrah.** - "They became very evil" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]]) 
  * **I am about to make them eat wormwood and drink poisonous water** - wormwood was something that was bitter and unpleasant to eat. This phrase describes the punishment that Yahweh was going to bring about on the evil prophets. In the same way, wormwood was bitter and the water was poisonous, so would Yaweh's judgment be on the evil prophets. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **pollution has gone out from the prophets** - "evil has come from the prophets"
