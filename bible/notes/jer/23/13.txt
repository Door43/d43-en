====== Jeremiah 23:13-15 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 Previously I saw that the prophets in Samaria were doing something that was wrong;
\q2 they were prophesying, saying that Baal \add gave them the messages that they were proclaiming\add*,
\q1 and they were deceiving my people.
\q1
\v 14 And now I have seen the prophets in Jerusalem doing terrible things.
\q2 They commit adultery
\q2 and habitually tell lies.
\q1 They encourage [IDI] evil people to continue to do evil things,
\q2 with the result that the people do not stop sinning.
\q1 Those prophets are as wicked as the people in Sodom and Gomorrah were.
\p
\v 15 So, this is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says about those \add false\add* prophets:
\q1 "I will give those prophets bitter things to eat
\q2 and poison to drink,
\q1 because it is because of them that this land is filled with \add people who do\add* wicked deeds."

<usfm>
\q
\v 13 For I have seen the prophets in Samaria doing what is repulsive: 
\q They prophesied by Baal and led my people Israel astray.
\q
\v 14 Among the prophets in Jerusalem I have seen horrible things:
\q They commit adultery and walk in deceit.
\q They strengthen the hands of evildoers; no one turns back from his evildoing.
\q All of them have become like Sodom to me and its inhabitants like Gomorrah!"
\q
\v 15 Therefore Yahweh of hosts says this concerning the prophets,
\q "Look, I am about to make them eat wormwood and drink poisonous water,
\q for pollution has gone out from the prophets of Jerusalem to all the land."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jeremiah continues to deliver Yahweh's message about the false prophets and priests that he began in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:23:09|23:9]].

  * **led my people Israel astray** - The deception of the people by the false prophets is spoken of as leading them down the wrong path. AT: "deceived my people, the Israelites" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **They commit adultery** - Possible meanings are 1) they were literally unfaithful to their wives or 2) their worship of other gods is spoken of as spiritual adultery. 
  * **walk in deceit** - This idiom means they lived a life of deceit. AT: "live in dishonesty" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **They strengthen the hands of evildoers** - Here "hands" refers to the whole person. AT: "They strengthen those who do evil" or "They encourage people who do evil" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **no one turns back from his evildoing** - This can be state in positive form. AT: "everyone continues in their sin"
  * **All of them have become like Sodom ... like Gomorrah** - Sodom and Gomorrah were cities that were so wicked that God destroyed them with fire from heaven. AT: "They all became as evil as Sodom ... as wicked as Gomorrah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]]) 
  * **Yahweh of hosts says this** - Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:06:06|6:6]].
  * **Look** - The word "look" here alerts the reader to pay attention to the important information that follows.
  * **I am about to make them eat wormwood and drink poisonous water** - Wormwood is a plant that is very bitter and unpleasant to eat. This phrase describes the punishment that Yahweh was going to bring about on the evil prophets. In the same way wormwood was bitter and the water was poisonous, so would Yaweh's judgment be on the evil prophets. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I am about to** - "I will soon"
  * **pollution has gone out from the prophets** - Here the evil teaching of the priests and false prophets is spoken of as if it were something filthy that ruined the land. AT: "evil has come from the prophets" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **pollution** - dirty and unsafe things that spoil the air, water, or land where they are found
