====== Jeremiah 23:13-15 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 Previously I saw that the prophets in Samaria were doing something that was wrong;
\q2 they were prophesying, saying that Baal \add gave them the messages that they were proclaiming\add*,
\q1 and they were deceiving my people.
\q1
\v 14 And now I have seen the prophets in Jerusalem doing terrible things.
\q2 They commit adultery
\q2 and habitually tell lies.
\q1 They encourage [IDI] evil people to continue to do evil things,
\q2 with the result that the people do not stop sinning.
\q1 Those prophets are as wicked as the people in Sodom and Gomorrah were.
\p
\v 15 So, this is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says about those \add false\add* prophets:
\q1 "I will give those prophets bitter things to eat
\q2 and poison to drink,
\q1 because it is because of them that this land is filled with \add people who do\add* wicked deeds."

\q
\v 13 "For I have seen offensiveness among the prophets in Samaria. They prophesied by Baal
\q and led my people Israel off the right path.
\q
\v 14 And among the prophets in Jerusalem I have seen horrible things: They commit adultery and walk in deceit.
\q They strengthen the hands of evildoers! No one turns back from his evildoing.
\q All of them have become like Sodom to me, the ones inhabiting Jerusalem like Gomorrah."
\q
\v 15 Therefore Yahweh of hosts says this concerning the prophets:
\q "See, I am about make them eat wormwood and drink poisonous water,
\q for pollution has gone out from the prophets of Jerusalem to all the land."
