\v 20 For I will give them into the hand of their enemies and those who seek their life, and their corpse will be food for the birds of heaven and the beasts of earth!
\v 21 So I will give Zedekiah the king of Judah and his princes into the hand of their enemies and those seeking their life, and into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon 
that has risen up against you.
\v 22 Look! I am commanding—this is Yahweh’s declaration—and will return them to this city so they will wage war against it and take it, and burn it with fire! For I will make 
the cities of Judah a wasteland in which there is no inhabitant.”
