\v 15 But you yourselves had turned today and were doing what is right in my eyes to proclaim liberation, each man to his neighbor! And you established a covenant 
before me in the house that is called by my name.
\v 16 But you turned and profaned my name when you caused each man to restore his servant and maid-servant who you had sent out with their life in freedom, 
and you subdued them to become your servants and your maid-servants!
