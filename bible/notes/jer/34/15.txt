\v 16 But now you have disregarded what you solemnly promised, and you have shown contempt for what I \f + \ft metonymy \f* said by taking back the women and men whom you had freed and said they could live wherever they wanted to. Now you have forced them to be your slaves again.

<usfm>
\v 15 Now you yourselves repented and began to do what is right in my eyes. You proclaimed freedom, each man to his neighbor. And you established an agreement before me in the house that is called by my name.
\v 16 But then you turned and polluted my name; you caused each man to bring back his male and female servants, the ones whom you had sent out to go where they wished. You forced them to become your servants again.'
