\v 12 So the world of Yahweh came to Jeremiah from Yahweh and said,
\v 13 “Yahweh, God of Israel, says this: I myself established a covenant with your fathers on the day when I brought them out from the land of Egypt, from the 
house of servitude, and said,
\v 14 ‘At the end of seven years each man will send out his brother, the Hebrew that sold himself to you and served you six years, but send him out in freedom.’ 
But your fathers did not listen to me and would not extend their ears.
