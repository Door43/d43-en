\v 12 So the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah and said,
\v 13 “Yahweh, God of Israel, says this: 'I myself established a covenant with your ancestors on the day that I brought them out from the land of Egypt, out from the 
house of slavery. That was when I said,
\v 14 ‘At the end of every seven years, each man must send away his brother, his fellow Hebrew who had sold himself to you and served you for six years. Send him away in freedom.’ 
But your ancestors did not listen to me and or pay attention.
