\v 12 So the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah and said,
\v 13 "Yahweh, God of Israel, says this, 'I myself established a covenant with your ancestors on the day that I brought them out from the land of Egypt, out from the 
house of slavery. That was when I said,
\v 14 "At the end of every seven years, each man must send away his brother, his fellow Hebrew who had sold himself to you and served you for six years. Send him away in freedom." 
But your ancestors did not listen to me and or pay attention.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the word of Yahweh came to** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:01|1:2]].
  * **each man must send away his brother, his fellow Hebrew who had sold himself to you and served you**  - AT: "each of you must free any fellow Hebrews who sold themselves to you and have have been your slaves"
  * **Send him away in freedom**  - AT: "You must let them be free from serving you"
  * **did not listen to me and or pay attention** - Both these phrase are saying basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
