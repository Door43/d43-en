===== translationNotes: =====

  * **This is the word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh** - After this phrase, the reader will of course expct to see the content of the message from Yahweh. However, the actual message does not begin until [[:en:bible:notes:jer:34:12|39:12]]. For this reason, the translator may choose to omit this phrase here, and to follow the example of the UDB.
  * **word** - "message" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **No one should enslave a fellow Israelite in Judah any longer** - AT: "No one should enslave another member of the nation of Israel anymore"
