\c 34
\p
\v 1 The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh when Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon and all of his army with all the kingdoms of the earth, 
the domains of his hand and all their people were waging war against Jerusalem and all of her cities. It said,
\v 2 “Yahweh, God of Israel, says this: Go and speak to Zedekiah the king of Judah, and say to him, ‘Yahweh says this: Look! I am giving this city into 
the hand of the king of Babylon and he will burn it with fire!’
\v 3 Then you will not escape from his hand, for You will certainly be seized and will be given into his hand, then your eyes will look upon the eyes of the 
king of Babylon and his mouth will declare to your mouth when you go to Babylon.
