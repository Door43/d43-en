\v 18-19 Because you have disregarded what I said in my agreement with you, I will do to you just like you did to the calves that you cut in half to show that you would surely do what you solemnly promised that you would do. I will \add enable your enemies to\add* cut you into pieces, you officials of Judah and you officials of Jerusalem, and you officials in the palace, and you priests and all you common people. I will do that because you have disregarded what you solemnly promised \add about freeing your slaves\add*.

\v 17 Therefore Yahweh says this, 'You yourselves have not listened to me. You should have proclaimed freedom, every one of you, to your brothers and fellow Israelites. So look! I am about to proclaim freedom to youx97this is Yahweh's declarationx97freedom for the sword, the plague, and famine, for I am going to make you a horrible thing in the sight of  every kingdom on earth.
\v 18 Then I will deal with the people who have transgressed my covenant, who did not keep the words of the covenant that they established before me when they cut a bull in two and walked between its parts,
\v 19 and then the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the eunuchs and the priests, and all the people of the land walked between the parts of the bull.
