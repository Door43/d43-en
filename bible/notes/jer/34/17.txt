<usfm>
\v 17 Therefore, this is what I, Yahweh, say: 'Because you have not obeyed me by freeing your fellow Israelites, I will free you to be destroyed by the swords \add of your enemies\add* and by famines and diseases. All the nations of the earth will be horrified because of \add what happens to\add* you.
\v 18-19 Because you have disregarded what I said in my agreement with you, I will do to you just like you did to the calves that you cut in half to show that you would surely do what you solemnly promised that you would do. I will \add enable your enemies to\add* cut you into pieces, you officials of Judah and you officials of Jerusalem, and you officials in the palace, and you priests and all you common people. I will do that because you have disregarded what you solemnly promised \add about freeing your slaves\add*.

\v 17 Therefore Yahweh says this, 'You yourselves have not listened to me. You should have proclaimed freedom, every one of you, to your brothers and fellow Israelites. So look! I am about to proclaim freedom to you—this is Yahweh's declaration—freedom for the sword, the plague, and famine, for I am going to make you a horrible thing in the sight of every kingdom on earth.
\v 18 Then I will deal with the people who have broken my covenant, who did not keep the words of the covenant that they established before me when they cut a bull in two and walked between its parts,
\v 19 and then the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the eunuchs and the priests, and all the people of the land walked between the parts of the bull.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **So look!** - "Listen!" or "Pay attention to the important thing I am going to tell you!"
  * **I am about to proclaim freedom to you ... freedom for the sword, the plague, and famine** - Jeremiah uses irony to say that the "freedom" the people will enjoy will actually be suffering. AT: "I will proclaim misery to you ... misery from the sword, the plague, and famine" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **proclaim freedom to you** - "proclaim that you are free"
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **sword** - This is a metonym for soldiers who carry swords. AT: "enemy soldiers to kill you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **am going to make you a horrible thing in the sight of every kingdom on earth** - The abstract noun "sight" refers to how someone judges or decides on the value of something. The word "kingdom" is a metonym for the people who live in the kingdom. AT: "I am going to make the people in every kingdom on earth think that you are horrible" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **when they cut a bull ... walked ... walked between the parts of the bull** - This passage describes how the people established the covenant. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **established before me** - "agreed to with me" or "established while I was watching"
