\v 18-19 Because you have disregarded what I said in my agreement with you, I will do to you just like you did to the calves that you cut in half to show that you would surely do what you solemnly promised that you would do. I will \add enable your enemies to\add* cut you into pieces, you officials of Judah and you officials of Jerusalem, and you officials in the palace, and you priests and all you common people.

\v 17 Therefore Yahweh says this: You yourselves have not listened to me for each man to proclaim liberation to his brother and his neighbor! Listen! I am proclaiming 
liberation for you—this is Yahweh’s declaration—to the sword, the plague, and the famine, for I am going to make you tremble for every kingdom of the earth!
\v 18 Then I will give up the men who have transgressed my covenant, who did not lift up the words of the covenant that they established before me with a bullock 
that they cut in two and passed between its flesh,
\v 19 the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, the eunuchs and the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the flesh of the bullock.
