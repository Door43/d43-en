\v 16 See! I will send for many fishermenx97this is Yahweh's declarationx97so they will fish the people out. After this I will send for many hunters so they will hunt for them among all the mountains and hills, and in rock crevices.
\v 17 For my eye is on all their ways; they cannot be hidden from before me. Their iniquity cannot be concealed from before my eyes.
\v 18 I will first pay back double for their iniquity and sin for their polluting of my land with their disgusting idol figures, and for their filling my inheritance with their disgusting idols."

  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]].
  * **many fishermen...many hunters** - Yahweh compares the people who will take the Israelites into captivity to people who are skilled at trapping their prey. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **my eye is on all their ways** - AT: "I am watching everything they do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **they cannot be hidden from before me** - Here the word "they" may refer either to the people or to their actions. AT: "I see all that they do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
