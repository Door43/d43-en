\v 16 Behold! I will send out for many fisherman—this is Yahweh’s declaration—so they will fish them out, and after this I will send for many hunters so they will hunt for them from all the mountains and hills, and the clefts of the rocks.
\v 17 For my eye is over all their ways: they cannot be hid from before me, and their iniquity cannot be concealed from before my eye.
\v 18 So I will first complete double their iniquity and their sin against their polluting of my land by their detestable corpses and their filling my inheritance with their abominations!
