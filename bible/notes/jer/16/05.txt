====== Jeremiah 16:5-6 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 This is also what Yahweh said to me: "Do not go to funerals to mourn or to show \add those whose relatives have died\add* that you feel sorry for them, because I have stopped protecting them, and I have caused that things will not go well for them. I have stopped faithfully loving them and acting mercifully toward them.
\v 6 \add Very many people\add* will die in this land, including those who are important and those who are not important. And no one will mourn for them, or even bury \add their corpses\add*. No one will cut himself or shave his head \add to show that he is very sad\add*.

\v 5 For thus says Jehovah, Enter not into the house of mourning, neither go to lament, neither bemoan them; for I have taken
away my peace from this people, says Jehovah, even lovingkindness and tender mercies.
\v 6 Both great and small shall die in this land; they shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut
themselves, nor make themselves bald for them;
</usfm>
