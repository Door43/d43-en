<usfm> \v 12 But you yourselves have brought about more wickedness than your ancestors, for see! Each person is walking by the stubbornness of his wicked heart; there is no one who listens to me. \v 13 So I will throw you from this land to a land that you have not known, neither you nor your ancestors, and you will worship other gods there by day and night, for I will not give any favor to you. </usfm>
