====== Jeremiah 16:12-13 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 But you \add who are living now\add* have done more wicked things than your ancestors did! Each of you stubbornly does the evil things that he desires and refuses to pay attention to what I say.
\v 13 So, I will throw you out of this land, and I will send you to a land that you and your ancestors have never known about. There you will worship other gods day and night. And I will not act mercifully toward you.'

<usfm>
\v 12 But you yourselves have brought about more wickedness than your ancestors, for see! Each person is walking by the stubbornness of his wicked heart; there is no one who listens to me.
\v 13 So I will throw you from this land to a land that you have not known, neither you nor your ancestors, and you will worship other gods there by day and night, for I will not give any favor to you.
