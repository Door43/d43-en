\q
\v 19 Yahweh, you are my stronghold and my refuge, my place of safety in the day of distress.
\q The nations will go to you from the ends of the earth and say, "Surely our ancestors inherited deceit.
\q They are empty; there is no profit in them.
\q
\v 20 Do people make gods for themselves? But they are not gods.
\q
\v 21 Therefore see! I will cause them to know in this time, I will cause them to know my hand and my power,
\q so they will know that Yahweh is my name."

  * **Yahweh, you are my stronghold** - Here Jeremiah begins speaking to Yahweh.
  * **my stronghold and my refuge, my place of safety** - Jeremiah speaks of Yahweh as a place where enemies cannot attack him. He repeats the same idea three times. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **the ends of the earth** - AT: "everywhere on earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])

  * **They are empty; there is no profit in them** - Here the words "They" and "them" refer to the false gods that the ancestors taught us to believe in. The two phrases mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
