\v 19 Yahweh, my stronghold and my refuge, my place of safety in the day of distress! 
\q The nations will go unto you from the ends of the earth and say, ‘Surely our fathers our fathers inherited deceit!
\q They are empty and there is no profit in them!’
\q
\v 20 Shall a man make himself a god, but they are not gods?

\q so they will know that Yahweh is my name!
