====== Jeremiah 16:1-4 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Yahweh gave me another message. He said to me,
\v 2 "Do not get married and have children in this land,
\v 3 because this is what I, Yahweh, say about the children who are born in this city, and about their mothers and fathers:
\v 4 Many of them will die from terrible diseases. And no one will mourn for them. No one will even bury their corpses; the corpses will lie on the ground, scattered like manure. Others will die in wars or from hunger, and then their corpses will become food for vultures and wild animals."

\c 16
\p
\v 1 Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
\v 2 "Do not take a wife for yourself, and do not have sons or daughters for yourself in this place.
\v 3 For Yahweh says this to the sons and daughters who are born in this place, to the mothers who bear them, and to the fathers who caused them to be born in this land,
\v 4 'They will die diseased deaths. They will not be mourned or buried. They will be like dung on the ground. For they will come to an end by sword and famine, and their corpses will be food for the birds of the skies and the beasts of the earth.'
