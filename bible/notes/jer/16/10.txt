===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **iniquity and sin** - These two words mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]].
  * **worshiped and bowed down to them** - These two phrases mean the same thing. The phrase "bowed down to them" describes the posture that people used in worship. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
