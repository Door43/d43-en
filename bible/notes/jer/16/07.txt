\v 7 No one will bring food to comfort those who are mourning, not even if it is their father or their mother \add who has died\add*. No one will give them a cup \add of wine\add* to cheer them up.
\p
\v 8 And do not go to into the houses where people are feasting. Do not eat or drink anything with them.
\v 9 \add I want you to do this\add* because this is what I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, say: 'While you are still alive and seeing it happen, I will cause there to be no more singing and laughing in this land. There will be no more joyful voices of bridegrooms and brides.'

\v 7 No one will break bread for a funeral to comfort because of death, and none will give the cup of comfort to his father or his mother to comfort them.
\v 8 You will not go to the banquet house to sit with them, to eat or to drink.
\v 9 For thus says Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel: Behold! I am putting an end to the sound of joy and jubilation, the voices of the groom and the bride from this place before your eyes and in your days!
