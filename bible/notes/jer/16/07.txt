====== Jeremiah 16:7-9 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 No one will bring food to comfort those who are mourning, not even if it is their father or their mother \add who has died\add*. No one will give them a cup \add of wine\add* to cheer them up.
\p
\v 8 And do not go to into the houses where people are feasting. Do not eat or drink anything with them.
\v 9 \add I want you to do this\add* because this is what I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, say: 'While you are still alive and seeing it happen, I will cause there to be no more singing and laughing in this land. There will be no more joyful voices of bridegrooms and brides.'

\v 7 No one must share any food in mourning to comfort them because of the deaths, and none must give a comforting cup to his father or his mother in order to comfort them.
\v 8 You must not go to a banquet house to sit with them in order to eat or drink.'
\v 9 For Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this, 'See, before your eyes, in your days and in this place, I am about to put an end to the sound of joy and the sound of gladness, the sound of the groom and the sound of the bride.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **No one must share any food in mourning to comfort them because of the deaths ... none must give a comforting cup to his father or his mother** - These two clauses have a similar meaning. God said basically the same thing twice for emphasis. It was customary to take food or wine to people whose relative had died. Yahweh has removed all comfort from the people because of their sin. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **none must give a comforting cup** - Here the word "cup" represents the drink that the cup holds. AT: "none must give a comforting drink" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **a banquet house** - "a house where people are feasting"
  * **Yahweh of hosts ... says this** - Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:06:06|6:6]].
  * **See** - "Indeed." The word "see" here adds emphasis to what follows.
  * **before your eyes** - Here the word "your" is plural and refers to the people of Israel. The idiom means that Yahweh will do this where they can see. AT: "in front of you" or "where you can see" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **in your days** - This idiom means during their lifetime. AT: "during your lifetime" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **the sound of joy and the sound of gladness, the sound of the groom and the sound of the bride** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:07:33|7:34]].
