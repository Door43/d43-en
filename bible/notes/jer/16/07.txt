===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 No one will bring food to comfort those who are mourning, not even if it is their father or their mother \add who has died\add*. No one will give them a cup \add of wine\add* to cheer them up.
\p
\v 8 And do not go to into the houses where people are feasting. Do not eat or drink anything with them.
\v 9 \add I want you to do this\add* because this is what I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, say: 'While you are still alive and seeing it happen, I will cause there to be no more singing and laughing in this land. There will be no more joyful voices of bridegrooms and brides.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **No one must share any food in mourning to comfort them because of the deaths ... none must give a comforting cup to his father or his mother** - These two sentences have a similar meaning. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) It was customary to take food or wine to people whose relative has died. Yahweh has removed all comfort from the people because of their sin. AT: "Do not comfort people when their relative dies" 
  * **Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:07:03|7:3]].
  * **See** - AT: "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you"
  * **before your eyes** - Here the word "your" is plural and refers to the people of Israel. AT: "in front of you" or "where you can see" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **in your days** - AT: "during your lifetime" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **voices of the groom and bride** - This refers to people celebrating at weddings. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
