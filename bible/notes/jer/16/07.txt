\v 8 And do not go to into the houses where people are feasting. Do not eat or drink anything with them.
\v 9 \add I want you to do this\add* because this is what I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, say: 'While you are still alive and seeing it happen, I will cause there to be no more singing and laughing in this land. There will be no more joyful voices of bridegrooms and brides.'
