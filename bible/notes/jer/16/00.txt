====== Jeremiah 16 General Notes ======

=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 16:19-21, which is an extended quotation. This quotation also continues is chapter 17 and these should be seen as one section.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Coming punishment ==

The punishment that is prophesied in this chapter will happen quickly. The author gives many illustrations which describe how quickly this punishment will come. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])

== Israel restored ==

God will bring his people back from captivity. Even though the punishment of Judah will be great, Yahweh does promise a future restoration. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:restore]])
