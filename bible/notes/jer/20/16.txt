====== Jeremiah 20:16-18 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 Allow him to be destroyed like the cities that Yahweh destroyed long ago,
\q2 without acting mercifully toward them.
\q1 Cause that man to hear the people wailing in the morning,
\q2 and to hear the enemy soldiers shout their battle cries at noon.
\q1
\v 17 \add I want that to happen to him because\add* he did not kill me when I was born.
\q2 I wish that I had died in my mother's womb,
\q2 and that my mother's body would have been like \f + \ft metaphor \f* my grave.
\q1
\v 18 I have continually experienced much trouble and sorrow,
\q2 and I am disgraced now when I am about to die;
\q1 why was it necessary \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* for me to me born?

<usfm>
\q
\v 16 Let that man be like the cities that Yahweh overthrew when he would not have mercy.
\q May he hear a call for help in the dawn and the shout of battle at noontime.
\q
\v 17 May this happen, since Yahweh did not kill me in the womb or make my mother my tomb,
\q a pregnant womb forever.
\q
\v 18 Why is it that I came out from the womb to see troubles and agony,
\q so that my days are filled with shame?"
