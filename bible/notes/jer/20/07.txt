<usfm>
\v 7 \add One day I said this to Yahweh\add*:
\q1 "Yahweh, \add when you chose me to be a prophet\add*, you deceived me, and I allowed you to deceive me.
\q2 You insisted that I \add become a prophet\add* because you are stronger than I am.
\q1 And now everyone \f + \ft hyperbole \f* ridicules me.
\q2 They make fun of me all the day.
\q1
\v 8 When I tell \add people your messages\add*, I shout saying,
\q2 '\add Yahweh is going to cause you to experience\add* violence and destruction!'
\q1 So because I tell them those messages from you,
\q2 they insult me and scoff at me all the day.
\q1
\v 9 But if I would say, 'I will never mention Yahweh or say anything about him, \f + \ft metonymy \f*'
\q2 \add it would be as though\add* your message would burn in my inner being like \f + \ft simile \f* a fire;
\q2 it would be like a fire in my bones.
\q1 Sometimes I try to remain silent and not proclaim your messages,
\q2 but I am not able to do that.
\q1

\v 7 One day I said this to Yahweh:
\q1 "Yahweh, when you chose me to be a prophet, you persuaded me to do it, and I allowed you to persuade me.
\q2 You insisted that I become a prophet because you are stronger than I am.
\q1 But now everyone  ridicules me.
\q2 They make fun of me all the day.
\q1
\v 8 When I tell people your messages, I shout saying,
\q2 'Yahweh is going to cause you to experience violence and destruction!'
\q1 So because I tell them those messages from you,
\q2 they insult me and scoff at me all the day.
\q1
\v 9 But if I would say, 'I will never mention Yahweh or say anything about him, '
\q2 it would be as though your message would burn in my inner being like  a fire;

\q
\v 7 You persuaded me, Yahweh; I was indeed persuaded. You seized me and defeated me.
\q I have become a laughingstock. Every day is filled with the mocking of me.
\q
\v 8 For whenever I have spoken, I have called out and proclaimed, ‘Violence and destruction.’
\q And Yahweh's word has turned into reproach and mocking for me every day.every day.
\q
\v 9 If I say, ‘I will not think about Yahweh anymore; I will no longer proclaim his name,'
\q then it is like a fire in my heart, a burning held in by my bones. So I struggle to contain it but am not able to.
