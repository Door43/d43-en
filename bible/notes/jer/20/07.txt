<usfm> \v 7 One day I said this to Yahweh: \q1 "Yahweh, when you chose me to be a prophet, you persuaded me to do it, and I allowed you to persuade me. \q2 You insisted that I become a prophet because you are stronger than I am. \q1 But now everyone ridicules me. \q2 They make fun of me all the day. \q1 \v 8 When I tell people your messages, I shout saying, \q2 'Yahweh is going to cause you to experience violence and destruction!' \q1 So because I tell them those messages from you, \q2 they insult me and scoff at me all the day. \q1 \v 9 But if I would say, 'I will never mention Yahweh or say anything about him, ' \q2 it would be as though your message would burn in my inner being like a fire; \q2 it would be like a fire in my bones. \q1 Sometimes I try to remain silent and not proclaim your messages, \q2 but I am not able to do that.

<usfm> \p \q \v 7 You persuaded me, Yahweh; I was indeed persuaded. You seized me and defeated me. \q I have become a laughingstock. Every day is filled with the mocking of me. \q \v 8 For whenever I have spoken, I have called out and proclaimed, ‘Violence and destruction.’ \q And Yahweh's word has turned into reproach and mocking for me every day.every day. \q \v 9 If I say, ‘I will not think about Yahweh anymore; I will no longer proclaim his name,' \q then it is like a fire in my heart, a burning held in by my bones. So I struggle to contain it but am not able to. </usfm>
