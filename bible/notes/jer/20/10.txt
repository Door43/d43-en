\v 10 I hear many people whispering \add about me\add*,
\q2 saying '\add He is the man who proclaims that there will be things that cause us to\add* be terrified everywhere.
\q2 We must tell \add the authorities what he is saying\add*! We must denounce him!'
\q1 Even my best friends are waiting for me to say something that is wrong.
\q1 \add They are saying\add*, 'Perhaps we can cause him to say something wrong,
\q2 and if he does, we will be able to defeat him.'
\q1
\v 11 But you, Yahweh, are helping me like \f + \ft simile \f* a strong warrior,
\q2 so \add it is as though\add* he will cause those who persecute me to stumble, and they will not defeat me.

\q
\v 10 For I have heard many frightening rumors from all around! ‘Report! So we must report it!’ 
\q Every man at peace with me, who guards me when I stumble; perhaps will be persuaded 
\q So we will prevail against him and have vengeance on him.
\q
\v 11 But Yahweh is with me like a powerful warrior, therefore the one pursuing me will stagger; 
\q And they will not prevail! They will be greatly ashamed for they will not prosper: 
\q A unending reproach that will not be forgotten!
