====== Jeremiah 20:10-11 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 I hear many people whispering \add about me\add*,
\q2 saying '\add He is the man who proclaims that there will be things that cause us to\add* be terrified everywhere.
\q2 We must tell \add the authorities what he is saying\add*! We must denounce him!'
\q1 Even my best friends are waiting for me to say something that is wrong.
\q1 \add They are saying\add*, 'Perhaps we can cause him to say something wrong,
\q2 and if he does, we will be able to defeat him.'
\q1
\v 11 But you, Yahweh, are helping me like \f + \ft simile \f* a strong warrior,
\q2 so \add it is as though\add* he will cause those who persecute me to stumble, and they will not defeat me.
\q1 They will be completely disgraced because of being unable to defeat me;
\q2 and other people will never forget that they were disgraced.

\q
\v 10 I have heard rumors of terror from many people all around. 'Report! We must report it!' 
\q Those who are close to me watch to see if I will fall. 'Perhaps he can be tricked.
\q If so, we can overpower him and take our revenge on him.'
\q
\v 11 But Yahweh is with me like a powerful warrior, so the ones pursuing me will stagger. 
\q They will not defeat me. They will be greatly ashamed, because they will not succeed. 
\q They will have unending shame, it will never be forgotten.
