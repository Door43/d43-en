<usfm>
\v 10 I hear many people whispering \add about me\add*,
\q2 saying '\add He is the man who proclaims that there will be things that cause us to\add* be terrified everywhere.
\q2 We must tell \add the authorities what he is saying\add*! We must denounce him!'
\q1 Even my best friends are waiting for me to say something that is wrong.
\q1 \add They are saying\add*, 'Perhaps we can cause him to say something wrong,
\q2 and if he does, we will be able to defeat him.'
\q1
\v 11 But you, Yahweh, are helping me like \f + \ft simile \f* a strong warrior,

<usfm>
\q
\v 10 I have heard rumors of terror from many people all around: ‘Report. We must report it.’ 
\q Everyone who is close to me watches for me to fall. 'Perhaps he can be fooled.
\q If so, we will defeat him and take vengeance on him.'
\q
\v 11 But Yahweh is with me like a powerful warrior, so the ones pursuing me will stagger. 
\q They will not defeat me. They will be greatly ashamed, for they will not succeed. 
\q They will have unending shame, never to be forgotten.
