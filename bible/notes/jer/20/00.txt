This chapter prophesied punish against a specific leader named Pashhur. He was in charge of protecting the temple and had Jeremiah beaten and arrested. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:obe:kt:temple]])

== Jeremiah's reaction ==
Jeremiah's reaction contrasts with the reaction of the Jews in general. Although Jeremiah was not happy with Yahweh's actions, he still trusting in Yahweh.
