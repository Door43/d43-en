===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I will give him** - Here the word "him" refers to the king of Babylon.
  * **all the wealth...all of its riches, all of its precious items and all the treasures** - Yahweh repeats the same basic idea four times for emphasis. That is Babylon will take away all the wealth of Israel, including the King's possessions. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **I will place these things in the hand of your enemies** - Here the word "hand" refers to possession. AT: "I will allow your enemies to take possession of these things" or "I will give these things to your enemies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **You and all of your loved ones to whom you prophesied 
deceitful things will be buried there** - AT: "There, people will bury you and all of your loved ones to whom you prophesied deceitful things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
