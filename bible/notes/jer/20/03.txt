\v 3 And so it was on the next day that Pashur brought out Jeremiah from the stocks. Then Jeremiah said to him, “Yahweh has not called your name Pashur, since you are Magor-Missabib!
\v 4 For thus says Yahweh: Behold! I will make you an object of horror—you and all of your loved ones—for they will fall by the sword of their enemies and your eyes will see it! I will give 
all of Judah to the hand of the king of Babylon and he will make them captives in Babylon and attack them with the sword!
