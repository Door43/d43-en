===== translationNotes: =====

  * **They will cut down the forests ... although it is very dense** - This continues speaking of the enemy army attacking the Egyptians as if the army were woodcutters cutting down trees. AT: "The enemy army will kill many Egyptians like woodcutters cutting down a forest ... even though there are very many trees" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **locusts** - This is a type of insect that travels in very large groups and can cause great destruction by eating crops.
  * **unable to be counted** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "no one will be able to count them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **The daughter of Egypt will be made ashamed** - The people of Egypt are spoken of as if they were the daughter of Egypt. This can be stated in active form. AT: "The enemy army will humiliate the people of Egypt" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **She will be given into the hand of people from the north** - Here "hand" represents power or control. This can be stated in active form. AT: "I, Yahweh, will allow the people from the north to defeat the Egyptians" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
