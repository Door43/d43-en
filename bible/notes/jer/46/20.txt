\q2 but a powerful king from the northeast is surely coming to attack it
\q2 like a horsefly bites a cow.
\q1
\v 21 The mercenaries that Egypt has hired are like fat calves because of the Egyptians' money;

\q
\v 20 Egypt is a very beautiful young cow, but a stinging insect is coming from the north. It is coming.
\q
\v 21 The hired soldiers in her midst are like a fattened bull, but they will also turn away and run away.
\q They will not stand together, for the day of their disaster is coming against them, the time of their punishment.
\q
\v 22 Egypt hisses like a snake and crawls away, for her enemies are marching against her.
\q They are going toward her like woodcutters with axes.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Egypt is a very beautiful young cow**  - The nation of Egypt is being compared to a beautiful young female cow. It is possible that this comparison is made to have Egypt be the mate of the bull-god Apis. AT: "Egypt is like a very beautiful heifer." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **stinging insect**  - This refers the army of the nation of Babylon. A stinging insect would cause painful sores but would otherwise not cause permanent harm to the animal stung. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **soldiers in her midst are like a fattened bull**  - The writer compares soldiers to "fattened bulls" because the soldiers are well cared for and readied for slaughter. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **They will not stand together**  - The writer is saying that the soldiers will not fight as a unit but will run away thinking only of saving themselves.
  * **Egypt hisses like a snake and crawls away**  - The writer is saying that the nation of Egypt is like snakes that can do nothing but hiss and crawl away in fear when woodcutters disturb their nest. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
