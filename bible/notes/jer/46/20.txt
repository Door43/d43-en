<usfm>
\v 20 Egypt is a very fair heifer; but destruction out of the north is come, it is come.
\v 21 Also her hired men in the midst of her are like calves of the stall; for they also are turned back, they are fled away together, they did not stand: for the day of their calamity is come upon them, the time of their visitation.
\v 22 The sound thereof shall go like the serpent; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood.
