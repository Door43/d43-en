===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Amon of Thebes**  - "Amon" is the king of the Egyptian gods. "Thebes" is the capital of Egypt, and here represents the entire Egyptian empire. AT: "Amon, god over all of Egypt" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * ** I am giving them... into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and his servants** - Here Nebuchadnezzar represents the whole nation of Babylon, and his "hand" represents "control." AT: "Yahweh is giving control of Egypt to the nation of Babylon." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Then after this Egypt will be inhabited as in previous days** - AT: "After the punishment of Yahweh, the nation of Egypt will return to being an independent nation."
