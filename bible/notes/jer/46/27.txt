\v 27 But you people of Israel who serve me,
\q2 do not be at all dismayed \f + \ft doublet \f* now,
\q1 because some day I will bring you back from distant places;
\q2 I will bring your descendants from the land to which they were exiled.
\q2 Then you Israelite people will again live peacefully and safely,

\q1
\v 28 I, Yahweh, say to you people of Israel who serve me,
\q1 'Do not be afraid,
\q2 because I will be with you.
\q1 I will completely destroy the nations among whom I have scattered you,
\q2 but I will not completely get rid of you.
\q1 I will punish you, but I will punish you only as severely as you deserve:
\q2 it would be wrong if I did not punish you at all.'~"

\v 27 "But you, my servant Jacob, do not fear. Do not be dismayed, Israel, for see, I am about to bring you back from far away, and your offspring from the land of their captivity. Then Jacob will return, find peace, and be secure, and there will be no one to terrify him.
\v 28 You, my servant Jacob, do not fear—this is Yahweh’s declaration—for I am with you, so I will bring complete destruction against all the nations where I scattered you. But I will not destroy you completely. Yet I will discipline you justly and will certainly not leave you unpunished.”'"

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **my servant Jacob, do not fear. Do not be dismayed, Israel** - These two phrases mean the same thing and are combined for emphasis. Both "Jacob" and "Israel" here represent the nation of Israel.(See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]].
  * **will certainly not leave you unpunished** - "will certainly punish you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
