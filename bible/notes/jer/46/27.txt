\v 28 You, my servant Jacob, do not fearx97this is Yahweh's declarationx97for I am with you, so I will bring complete destruction against all the nations where I scattered you. But I will not destroy you completely. Yet I will discipline you justly and will certainly not leave you unpunished."'"

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **my servant Jacob, do not fear. Do not be dismayed, Israel **- These two phrases mean the same thing and are combined for emphasis. Both "Jacob" and "Israel" here represent the nation of Israel.(See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration**  - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]].
  * **will certainly not leave you unpunished**  - "will certainly punish you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
