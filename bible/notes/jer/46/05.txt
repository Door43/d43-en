\v 5 But what \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* do I see?

\q2 without even looking backward!
\q1 I, Yahweh, say that their soldiers will be terrified on all sides!
\q1
\v 6 Even the fastest runners will try to run away,
\q2 but even the greatest of their warriors will not escape.

\q2 they will stumble and fall.

\q
\v 5 What am I seeing here? They are filled with terror and are running away, for their soldiers are defeated.
\q They are running for safety and are not looking back. Terror is all around—this is Yahweh's declaration—
\q
\v 6 the swift cannot run away, and the soldiers cannot escape.
\q They stumble in the north and fall beside the Euphrates River.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jeremiah's vision for Egypt continues.

  * **What am I seeing here?** - The word "I" here refer to Yahweh. Yahweh uses a question to introduce the vision and to draw attention to what he says next. This question can be translated as a statement. AT: "Look at what is happening here" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **They are filled with terror** - The abstract noun "terror" can be stated as "terrified." AT: "The Egyptian soldiers are terrified" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Terror is all around** - The abstract noun "terror" can be stated as "terrifying." AT: "Everything around them is terrifying" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **the swift cannot run away, and the soldiers cannot escape** - These two phrases share similar meanings and emphasize that no one, not even the strongest and fastest, can escape. The nominal adjective "the swift" can be stated as an adjective. AT: "even the swiftest soldier cannot escape" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]])
  * **They stumble in the north and fall beside the Euphrates River** - Both statements mean the same thing. Being and dying in battle is spoken of as if the soldiers stumble and fall. AT: "The Egyptian soldiers suffer defeat and die in the north by the Euphrates River" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
