\v 5 But what \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* do I see?

\q2 without even looking backward!
\q1 I, Yahweh, say that their soldiers will be terrified on all sides!
\q1
\v 6 Even the fastest runners will try to run away,
\q2 but even the greatest of their warriors will not escape.

\q
\v 5 What am I seeing here? They are filled with terror and are running away, for their soldiers are defeated.
\q They are running for safety and are not looking back. Terror is all around—this is Yahweh's declaration—
\q
\v 6 the swift cannot run away, and the soldiers cannot escape.
\q They stumble in the north and fall beside the Euphrates River.

  * **the swift cannot run away, and the soldiers cannot escape** - These two phrases share similar meanings emphasize that no one, not even the strongest and fastest, can escape. AT: "even the swiftest soldier cannot escape." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
