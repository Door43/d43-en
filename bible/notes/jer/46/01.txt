===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jeremiah often wrote prophecy in the form of poetry. Hebrew poetry uses different kinds of parallelism. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **This is the word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah** - This idiom is used to introduce a special message from God. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:14:01|14:1]], and make any changes as needed. AT: "This is the message that Yahweh gave to Jeremiah" or "This is the message that Yahweh spoke to Jeremiah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **For Egypt** - This phrase indicates this message is intended for the nation of Egypt.
  * **Necho** - This is the name of a man. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Carchemish** - This is the name of a city on the west bank of the Euphrates. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon** - Here Nebuchadnezzar represents his army. AT: "that the army of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **in the fourth year of Jehoiakim** - Here the words "of the reign" are understood and can be added to make the meaning clear. AT: "in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **the fourth year** - The word "fourth" is the ordinal form of "four." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **Put the harness on the horses; mount up on the horses** - A "harness" is a set of straps placed on a horse so that it can pull a chariot. Here "mount up on the horses" means that the soldiers rode in the chariots that the horses were pulling.
  * **helmets** - A helmet is armor which protects the head in battle.
  * **polish the spears** - This phrase means to "sharpen" the spear.
