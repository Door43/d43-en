===== Translation Notes: =====

Jeremiah's quotation of Yahweh's declaration to the nation of Egypt continues.

  * **That day** - This phrase refers to the day the Egyptians lose the battle to the Babylonians.
  * **his foes**  - This word means enemies of Yahweh.
  * **sword will devour and be satisfied. It will drink its fill of their blood** - Here the sword is eating as a person would. Both these phrases are saying similar thing and are combined to emphasize that there will be complete destruction.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **sword will devour** - The word "sword" here represents the army of the nation of Babylon. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **sacrifice to the Lord Yahweh**  - The "sacrifice" here is the nation of Egypt. AT: "Egypt will be a sacrifice to the Lord Yahweh." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
