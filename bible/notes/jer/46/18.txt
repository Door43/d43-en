===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **someone will come who is like Mount Tabor and Mount Carmel by the sea**  - This refers to the nation of Babylon who will be as overwhelming to the nation of Egypt as the these two mountains are to the plains that surround them. 
  * **Get ready for yourselves your baggage**  - AT: "prepare to travel"
  * **Memphis will become a horror and a ruin**  - Both these phrase are saying basically the same thing, that the capital of the nation of Egypt will be completely destroyed. (See: [:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
