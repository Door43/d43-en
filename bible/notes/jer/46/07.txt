===== Translation Notes: =====

Jeremiah continues quoting Yahweh's declaration to the nation of Egypt.
 
  * **Who is this who rises like the Nile** - "Egypt rises like the Nile," Yahweh asks this question to draw the listener's attention to the nation of Egypt. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Egypt rises like the Nile** - Egypt's army is being compared to the destruction caused by the flooding Nile River.
  * **It says** - Here the nation of Egypt is speaking like a person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **I will go up; I will cover the earth. I will destroy cities and their inhabitants.** - "I" is nation of Egypt that is proudly declaring that its armies will destroy the earth like a flood.
  * **Go up, horses. Be angry, you chariots.** - Yahweh commands the horses and chariots as if they were people. Both the words "horses""chariots" are referring to parts of chariots in battle. These phrases are commanding the chariot drivers to charge into battle.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **Cush...Put...Ludim** - These are Biblical names for the countries of Ethiopia, Libya, and Lydia. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **bending their bows** - This phrase means to use the bow by pulling the string back with an arrow.
