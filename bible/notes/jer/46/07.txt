===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jeremiah continues quoting Yahweh's declaration to the nation of Egypt.
 
  * **Who is this who rises like the Nile ... the rivers?** - Yahweh uses a question to draw attention to what he is about to say concerning Egypt. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "Look at who rises like the Nile ... the rivers." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Egypt rises like the Nile** - The Nile river floods its banks once a year, covering the surrounding area with water. Yahweh compares the kingdom of Egypt to the Nile because the Egyptian people think they are mighty enough to destroy cities in all the lands. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Egypt rises ... I will** - Here "Egypt" represents all the people of Egypt. AT: "The Egyptians rise ... We will" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Go up, horses. Be angry, you chariots** - Here "horses" and "chariots" represent the soldiers who use horses and chariots in battle. The leaders of Egypt are ordering their soldiers to start the battle. AT: "Go up to battle, you soldiers on horses. Fight furiously, you soldiers in chariots" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Let the soldiers go out, Cush and Put, men skillful with a shield** - "You soldiers from Cush and Put, who are skillful with their shields, go out to battle"
  * **Cush ... Put** - These are biblical names for the countries of Ethiopia and Libya. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Ludim, men skillful at bending their bows** - The words "go out to battle" are understood and can be added to make the meaning clear. AT: "you soldiers from Lud, who are skillful with bows and arrows, go out to battle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **Ludim** - This is the name of the people group from the nation of Lud. Lud is the biblical name for Lydia. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **bending their bows** - This phrase means to use the bow by pulling the string back with an arrow. AT: "shooting arrows from their bows" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
