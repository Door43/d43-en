===== Translation Notes: =====

The remnant of the people living in Egypt continue to speak. Beginning in v 19, the women address Jeremiah.

  * **Queen of Heaven**- See background information in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:44:15]].  
  * **did we do these things without our husbands' knowledge?**  - The women are claiming innocence because they had their husbands' knowledge and approval. AT: "our husbands knew what we were doing." (See [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
