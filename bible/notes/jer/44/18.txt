\v 18 When we refrained from doing these things, not offering incense to the queen of heaven and not pouring out drink offerings to her, we were all suffering poverty and were dying by sword and famine."
\v 19 The women said, "When we were making incense offerings before the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, was it against our husbands that we did these things, making cakes in her image and pouring out drink offerings to her?"

  * **General Information:** - The remnant of the people living in Egypt continue to speak. Beginning in 44:19, the women address Jeremiah.

  * **were dying by sword and famine** - Here "sword" represents enemies carrying weapons. AT: "enemy soldiers were killing some of us and some of us were dying of hunger" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **was it against our husbands that we did these things ... to her?** - The women were claiming to be innocent because their husband approved of what they were doing. AT: "our husbands knew what we were doing ... to her." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **cakes in her image** - These were probably small cakes shaped like stars or the crescent moon.
