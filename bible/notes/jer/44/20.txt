\v 20 Then Jeremiah said to all the people—to the men and women, and all the people who answered him—he proclaimed and said,
\v 21 "Did not Yahweh remember the incense that you burned in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem—you and your ancestors, your kings and leaders, and the people of the land? For Yahweh calls this to mind; it comes to his thoughts.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Did not Yahweh remember ... of the land?** - Jeremiah uses a question to scold the people. AT: "Yahweh certainly knew about ... of the land." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **For Yahweh calls this to mind; it comes to his thoughts** - Both of these phrases mean the same thing. They emphasize that Yahweh knows that the people were worshiping false gods. AT: "Yes, Yahweh knows what you were doing, and he does not forget" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
