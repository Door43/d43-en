\v 26 But now, all you people from Judah who are now living here in Egypt, listen to this message from Yahweh. He says, 'I have solemnly declared, using my great name, that soon none of you people from Judah who are here in Egypt will ever again use my name. \add There will be none of you who, when you solemnly promise to do something\add*, will ever again say, "\add I will do it as surely\add* as Yahweh lives."
\v 27 Because I will be watching over you, not to cause good things to happen to you but to cause things to happen that will harm you. Almost everyone \f + \ft hyperbole \f* from Judah who is now here in Egypt will experience being \add killed by their enemies'\add* swords or dying from famine.
\v 28 Only a very few of you will not die, and will return to Judah. When that happens, all those who came to Egypt will find out whose words were true\f + \ft Or: were fulfilled \f*, theirs or mine.'

\v 28 Only a very few of you will not die by the sword and will return to Judah. When that happens, all those who came to Egypt will find out whose words were true, theirs or mine.'

\v 26 So then, hear the word of Yahweh, all of Judah who are staying  in the land of Egypt, 'See, I have sworn by my great name—says Yahweh. My name will no longer be called upon by the mouths of any of the men of Judah in all the land of Egypt, you who now say, "As the Lord Yahweh lives."
\v 27 See, I am watching over them for disaster and not for good. Every person of Judah in the land of Egypt will perish by sword and famine until they are all finished.
\v 28 Then the survivors of the sword will return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah, only a small number of them. So all the remnant of Judah who went to the land of Egypt to live there will know whose word will come true: mine or theirs.
