====== Jeremiah 44:26-28 ======

<usfm>
\v 26 But now, all you people from Judah who are now living here in Egypt, listen to this message from Yahweh. He says, 'I have solemnly declared, using my great name, that soon none of you people from Judah who are here in Egypt will ever again use my name. \add There will be none of you who, when you solemnly promise to do something\add*, will ever again say, "\add I will do it as surely\add* as Yahweh lives."
\v 27 Because I will be watching over you, not to cause good things to happen to you but to cause things to happen that will harm you. Almost everyone \f + \ft hyperbole \f* from Judah who is now here in Egypt will experience being \add killed by their enemies'\add* swords or dying from famine.
\v 28 Only a very few of you will not die, and will return to Judah. When that happens, all those who came to Egypt will find out whose words were true\f + \ft Or: were fulfilled \f*, theirs or mine.'

\v 28 Only a very few of you will not die by the sword and will return to Judah. When that happens, all those who came to Egypt will find out whose words were true, theirs or mine.'

\v 26 So then, hear the word of Yahweh, all of Judah who are staying in the land of Egypt, 'See, I have sworn by my great name—says Yahweh. My name will no longer be called upon by the mouths of any of the men of Judah in all the land of Egypt, you who now say, "As the Lord Yahweh lives."
\v 27 See, I am watching over them for disaster and not for good. Every person of Judah in the land of Egypt will perish by sword and famine until they are all finished.
\v 28 Then the survivors of the sword will return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah, only a small number of them. So all the remnant of Judah who went to the land of Egypt to live there will know whose word will come true: Mine or theirs.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **all of Judah** - Here "Judah" represents the people. AT: "all the people of Judah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I have sworn by my great name** - Yahweh's "great name" refers to his whole being and reputation. AT: "I have sworn upon myself" or "I have sworn by speaking my powerful name" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **My name will no longer be called upon by the mouths of any of the men of Judah in all the land of Egypt** - Here "name" represents the whole being of Yahweh. And, "mouth" represents the whole person. This can be stated in active form. AT: "No person of Judah living in the land of Egypt will ever call upon me again" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **As the Lord Yahweh lives** - "as surely as the Lord Yahweh is alive." The people use this expression to show that what they say next is certainly true. This is a way of making a solemn promise. See how you transited "As Yahweh lives" [[:en:bible:notes:jer:04:01|4:2]]. AT: "I solemnly swear" or "I solemnly swear by the Lord Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Every person of Judah in the land of Egypt will perish by sword and famine until they are all finished** - Here "Every person" is a generalization that means "very many people." Also, "sword" represents enemies carrying weapons. AT: "Nearly every person of Judah in the land of Egypt will die. Enemies will kill many of them and many of them will starve to death until there is very few of them left" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Then the survivors of the sword** - Here "sword" represents enemies carrying weapons. AT: "Then those whom the enemies do not kill" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
