\v 2 "This is what I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, the God whom you Israelites \add say you belong to\add*, say: You saw the disaster that I caused the people in Jerusalem and the other towns in Judah to experience. Those towns are now ruined and deserted.

\v 1 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews that lived in the land of Egypt, that lived at Migdol, and at
Tahpanhes, and at Memphis, and in the country of Pathros, saying,
\v 2 Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: You have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all
the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man lives therein,
\v 3 because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense,
and to serve other gods, that they knew not, neither they, nor ye, nor your fathers.
