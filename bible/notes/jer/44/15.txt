\v 15 Then a large group of the people who had started to live in northern Egypt and southern Egypt, including all the men who knew that their wives had been burning incense to other gods, and all the women who were standing there, said this to me:
\v 16 "You are saying that \f + \ft metonymy \f* Yahweh gave messages to you, but we will not pay any attention to your messages!
\v 17 We will certainly do everything that we said that we would do. We will burn incense to \add worship our goddess Astarte\add*, the Queen of Heaven, and we will pour out offerings \add of wine\add* to her, just like we and our ancestors and our kings and their officials have always done in the streets of Jerusalem and in the other towns in Judah. At that time, we had plenty of food, and we were prosperous and we did not have any troubles.

\v 15 Then all the men who knew that their wives burned incense to other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great assembly, even all the people that lived in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,
\v 16 As for the word that you have spoken to us in the name of Jehovah, we will not listen to thee.
\v 17 But we will certainly perform every word that is gone forth out of our mouth, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings to her, as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.
