\v 9 Have you forgotten the wickedness committed by your ancestors and the wickedness committed by the kings of Judah and their wives? Have you forgotten  the evil committed by yourselves and your wives  in the land of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem?
\v 10 To this day, they still are not humbled. They do not honor my law or decrees that I placed before them and their ancestors, nor do they walk in them.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Have you forgotten ... and in the streets of Jerusalem?** - Yahweh challenges the people with these two questions that mean almost the same thing for emphasis. AT: "You have forgotten ... and in the streets of Jerusalem!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **and the streets of Jerusalem** - Jerusalem is referred to by the part of the city where people walk.  This means the people did evil things in public places. AT: "and Jerusalem" or "and the public places of Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
