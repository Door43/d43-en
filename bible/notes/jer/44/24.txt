\v 25 This is what Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, the God whom Israel worships, says to you men: 'You and your wives have said that you would continue to do what you promised, to burn incense and pour out wine to the goddess whom you call the Queen of Heaven. And you have proved by your actions that you intend to continue to do that. So go ahead and continue doing what you have promised to do for her.'

\v 24 Then Jeremiah said to all the people and all the women, "Hear the word of Yahweh, all of Judah who are in the land of Egypt.
\v 25 Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this, 'You and your wives both have said with your mouths and carried out with your hands what you said, "We will certainly carry out the vows that we made to worship the queen of heaven, to pour out drink offerings to her." Now fulfill your vows; carry them out.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **all of Judah** - Here "Judah" represents the people. AT: "all the people of Judah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Yahweh of hosts ... says this** - Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:06:06|6:6]].
  * **have said with your mouths and carried out with your hands what you said** - Here "mouths" and "hands" represent the whole person. AT: "have done what you promised to do when you said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **carry out the vows** - "fulfill the vows" or "complete the vows"
  * **Now fulfill your vows; carry them out** - This is an ironic statement. Yahweh does not really want them to fulfill their vow to a false goddess. Yahweh knows they will not listen to him so he tells them to go ahead and do what they want. AT: "Very well! If that is what you want to do, then go fulfill your vows and do what you promised to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **Now** - The word "now" does not mean "at this moment," but is used to draw attention to the important point that follows.
