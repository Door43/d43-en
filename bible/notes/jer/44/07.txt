\v 7 So now I, Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, the God whom Israel worships, ask you: Why are you causing yourselves to experience these disasters? Do you not realize that because of what you are doing, soon there will be no more men or women or children or infants left among you who have come here to Egypt from Judah?
\v 8 Why are you provoking me and causing me to be very angry by burning incense to the idols that you have made here in Egypt? If you continue doing this, you will destroy yourselves, and you will cause yourselves to be people whom all the nations on the earth will curse and despise.

<usfm>
\v 7 So now Yahweh the God of hosts and the God of Israel, says this, "Why are you doing great wickedness against yourselves? Why are you causing yourselves to be cut off from among Judah—men and women, children and babies? No remnant of you will be left.
\v 8 By your wickedness you have offended me with the deeds of your hands, by burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, where you have gone to live. You have gone there so that you will be destroyed, so that you will be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Why are you doing ... yourselves? Why are you causing ... and babies?** - Yahweh uses these questions to rebuke the people for doing things that cause him to punish them. AT: "You are doing ... yourselves. You are causing ... and babies." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Why are you doing great wickedness against yourselves?** - The abstract noun "wickedness" can be stated as "wicked." AT: "Why are you doing these wicked things that harm yourselves?" or "You are doing wicked things that cause terrible things to happen to you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Why are you causing yourselves to be cut off from among Judah ... and babies?** - Being separated from the people of Judah is spoken of as if the people are cut off from Judah the way a person may cut off a branch from a vine or cut off a piece of cloth. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Why are you causing me to remove you from the people of Judah ... and babies?" or "You are causing me to remove you from the people of Judah ... and babies." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **By your wickedness you have offended me with the deeds of your hands** - The abstract noun "wickedness" represents actions that are "wicked." Here "hand" represents the whole person. AT: "You have offended me with the wicked things you have done" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **You have gone there so that ... so that** - "The result of going to Egypt is that ... and that"
  * **you will be destroyed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "you will cause me to destroy you" or "you will destroy yourselves" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **you will be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth** - Here "nations" represent the people. AT: "all the people of all the nations of the earth will curse you and hate you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
