\v 13 For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by

\v 14 so that none of the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or be left, to
return into the land of Judah, to which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return save such as shall
escape.
