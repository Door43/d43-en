====== Jeremiah 44:11-12 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 Therefore, this is what I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, the God whom you Israelites \add say you belong to\add*, say: I am determined to cause all of you to experience disasters and to get rid of everyone in Judah.
\v 12 You people from Judah who have survived were determined to come and live here in Egypt. So I will get rid of all of you here in Egypt. Every one of you will die, including those who are important and those who are not important. Some of you will be killed by your enemies' swords, some will die from famines. You will become people whom others curse, be horrified about, and make fun of.

\v 11 Therefore Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this, "See, I am about to set my face against you to bring disaster to you and to destroy all of Judah.
\v 12 For I will take the remnant of Judah that has set out to go to the land of Egypt to live there. I will do this so that they will all perish in the land of Egypt. They will fall by sword and famine. From the least to the greatest they will perish by sword and famine. They will die and will become an object of swearing, cursing, reproaching, and a horrible thing.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Yahweh of hosts ... says this** - Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:06:06|6:6]].
  * **I am about to set my face against you** - Yahweh speaks of being opposed to a person as if he were to set his face against that person. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:21:08|21:10]]. AT: "I will be against you" or "I will oppose you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **set my face** - Here "face" is a metonym for attention or gaze, and "set my face" refers to staring. AT: "stare" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **to bring disaster to you** - Causing disaster to happen is spoken of as if disaster were an object that can be brought to someone. AT: "to cause disaster to happen to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **They will fall by sword and famine** - Here "fall" means to die. And "sword" represents the enemies carrying weapons. AT: "Enemies will kill some of them and others will die of hunger" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **From the least to the greatest** - This is a way to refer to people from every social status. Here "least" and "greatest" represent those who are least important and those who are most important. AT: "all the people from every social status" or "all the people, including the least important and the most important people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **and will become an object of swearing, cursing, reproaching, and a horrible thing** - "and people will be horrified because of what happened to the people of Judah, and people will mock and curse them"
