====== Jeremiah 11:6-8 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 Then Yahweh said to me, "Go into the streets of Jerusalem and to the other cities in Judah. Proclaim my message to the people. Tell them to listen to the agreement \add that I made with their ancestors\add* and to obey it.
\v 7 When I brought their ancestors out of Egypt, I solemnly pleaded with them many times to obey me, and I am still pleading with them now.
\v 8 But they did not obey me or even pay any attention to me. Everyone continued to be stubborn and to do the evil things that they wanted to do. I commanded them to do what was written in the agreement, but they refused. So I punished them in all the ways that I promised that I would."

\p
\v 6 And Jehovah said to me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear
you the words of this covenant, and do them.
\v 7 For I earnestly protested to your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even to this
day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.
\v 8 Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the stubbornness of their evil heart: therefore I
brought upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did them not.
