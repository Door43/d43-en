\q1 "The people \add of Judah\add* whom I love certainly no longer have \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* a right to come to my temple,

\q1 but now I will send \add their enemies to attack\add* them furiously;
\q2 \add it is as though\add* I will break off their branches, and \add their city\add* will be destroyed by fire.

\v 14 So you yourself must not pray for this people! You must not lift up a wail or a prayer on their behalf! For I will not be listening in the time when they cry unto me because of their calamity.
\q
\v 15 What is my beloved, the maker of wicked schemes, within my house?
\q For holy flesh has passed away from you since you have done evil then celebrated triumph!
\q
\v 16 Yahweh announced your name: ‘A leafy olive tree, beautiful with lovely fruit’.
\q With the sound of a great storm he has kindled a fire upon it and its branches are broken!
