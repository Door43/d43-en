===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 Jeremiah, do not pray for these people, and do not plead with me to rescue them. If you plead with me, I will not pay attention; and if they cry out to me for help when they are in distress, I will not listen to them."
\p
\v 15 Then Yahweh said,
\q1 "The people \add of Judah\add* whom I love certainly no longer have \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* a right to come to my temple,
\q2 because they continually do many evil things.
\q1 \add They think that\add* continually making sacrifices of meat to me certainly will \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* protect them from disasters,
\q2 with the result that they will be able to rejoice.
\q1
\v 16 I previously said that they were like an olive tree full of green leaves
\q2 with a lot of good olives on it,
\q1 but now I will send \add their enemies to attack\add* them furiously;
\q2 \add it is as though\add* I will break off their branches, and \add their city\add* will be destroyed by fire.

<usfm>
\p
\v 14 So you yourself, Jeremiah, must not pray for this people. You must not wail or pray on their behalf. For I will not be listening when they call on me in their disaster.
\q
\v 15 Why is my beloved one, the one who has had so many wicked intentions, in my house?
\q The meat of your sacrifices cannot help you. You rejoice because of your evil actions.
\q
\v 16 In the past Yahweh called you a leafy olive tree, beautiful with lovely fruit.
\q But he will light a fire on it that will sound like the roar of a storm; its branches will be broken.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **You must not wail** - "You must not make a loud cry of sadness" 
  * **Why is my beloved one, the one who has had so many wicked intentions, in my house?** - Yahweh uses this rhetorical question to emphasize that the people Judah no longer have a right to be in his temple. This question can be written as a statement. AT: "My beloved one, the one who has had so many wicked intentions, should not be in my house."  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **is my beloved one, the one who has had** - The people of Judah are spoken of as if they were a single woman greatly beloved. AT: "are the people whom I love, those who have had" or "are the people of Judah whom I love, who have had" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **In the past Yahweh called you a leafy olive tree** - In the Old Testament, people were often spoken of as if they were trees or plants. Those who were prosperous and healthy were spoken of as leafy, fruitful tree. AT: "In the past Yahweh said that you were like a leafy olive tree" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **will light a fire on it** - This expression continues the metaphor of the tree. The fire stands for the destruction of the people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
