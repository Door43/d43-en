====== Jeremiah 11:14-16 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 Jeremiah, do not pray for these people, and do not plead with me to rescue them. If you plead with me, I will not pay attention; and if they cry out to me for help when they are in distress, I will not listen to them."
\p
\v 15 Then Yahweh said,
\q1 "The people \add of Judah\add* whom I love certainly no longer have \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* a right to come to my temple,
\q2 because they continually do many evil things.
\q1 \add They think that\add* continually making sacrifices of meat to me certainly will \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* protect them from disasters,
\q2 with the result that they will be able to rejoice.
\q1
\v 16 I previously said that they were like an olive tree full of green leaves
\q2 with a lot of good olives on it,
\q1 but now I will send \add their enemies to attack\add* them furiously;
\q2 \add it is as though\add* I will break off their branches, and \add their city\add* will be destroyed by fire.

\p
\v 14 So you yourself, Jeremiah, must not pray for this people. You must not wail or pray on their behalf. For I will not be listening when they call on me in their disaster.
\q
\v 15 Why is my beloved people, the one who has had so many wicked intentions, in my house?
\q For meat reserved for your sacrifices cannot help you because you have done evil and then been happy about it.
\q
\v 16 In the past Yahweh called you a leafy olive tree, beautiful with lovely fruit.
\q But he has lit a fire on it that will sound like the roar of a storm;  its branches will be broken.
