\p
\v 14 Therefore pray not you for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them; for I will not hear them in the time
that they cry to me because of their trouble.
\v 15 What has my beloved to do in my house, seeing she has wrought lewdness
with many, and the holy flesh is passed from thee? when you do evil, then you rejoicest.
