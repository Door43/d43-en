\v 16 I previously said that they were like an olive tree full of green leaves
\q2 with a lot of good olives on it,
\q1 but now I will send \add their enemies to attack\add* them furiously;
\q2 \add it is as though\add* I will break off their branches, and \add their city\add* will be destroyed by fire.
\m
\v 17 \add It is as though\add* the people of Judah and Israel were a beautiful olive tree that I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, planted,
\q2 but now, by burning incense to \add their god\add* Baal, they have caused me to become very angry.
\q1 So now I have decided to destroy them."

<usfm>
\v 16 Jehovah called your name, A green olive-tree, fair with goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he has kindled
fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.
\v 17 For Jehovah of hosts, who planted thee, has pronounced evil against thee, because of the evil of the house of Israel and
of the house of Judah, which they have wrought for themselves in provoking me to anger by offering incense to Baal.
