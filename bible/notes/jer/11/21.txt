====== Jeremiah 11:21-23 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 21 It was the men of \add my own town\add*, Anathoth, who wanted to kill me, and they told me that they would kill me if I did not stop prophesying what Yahweh told me to say.
\v 22 So the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels said about them, "I will punish them. Their young men will be killed in wars, and their children will die because they have no food.
\v 23 I have set a time when I will bring disasters to the people of Anathoth, and when that happens, none of them will remain alive."

\v 21 Therefore Yahweh says this concerning the people of Anathoth who are seeking your life, "They say, 'You must not prophesy in the name of Yahweh, or you will die by our hand.'
\v 22 Therefore Yahweh of hosts says this, 'See, I am about to punish them. Their vigorous young men will die by the sword. Their sons and their daughters will die by famine.
\v 23 None of them will be left, because I am bringing disaster against the people of Anathoth, a year of their punishment.'"
