<usfm>
\v 21 It was the men of \add my own town\add*, Anathoth, who wanted to kill me, and they told me that they would kill me if I did not stop prophesying what Yahweh told me to say.
\v 22 So the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels said about them, "I will punish them. Their young men will be killed in wars, and their children will die because they have no food.
\v 23 I have set a time when I will bring disasters to the people of Anathoth, and when that happens, none of them will remain alive."

\v 21 Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the men of Anathoth who are seeking your life! He says: You must not prophesy in the name of Yahweh, so you will not die by my hand!
\v 22 Therefore thus says Yahweh of Hosts: Behold! I am appointing against them. The vigorous men will die by the sword! Their sons and their daughters will die by famine!
\v 23 And there will be no remnant of them since I will bring calamity against the men of Anathoth—the year of their appointment!”
