\v 19 \add Before he did that\add*, I was like a lamb that was being led away to be slaughtered; I did not know what they were planning to do. I did not know that they were saying, "Let's get rid of this tree and its fruit," so \add I did not know\add* that they intended to kill me, in order that no one would remember me \f + \ft metonymy \f*.

\q2 and you examine everything that we are thinking \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\q1 Allow me to watch you getting revenge on the people \add who want to kill me\add*,

\v 18 Yahweh made me know, so I know! Then you made me see their practices!
\v 19 For I was like a docile lamb being led to a butcher, and I did not know that they had formed plans against me: “Let us destroy the tree with its fruit! Let us cut him off from the land of the living so his name is no longer remembered!”
\q
\v 20 Yet Yahweh of Hosts is the righteous judge who examines the innards and the heart.
\q I will see your vengeance against them, for I have opened my dispute unto you!
