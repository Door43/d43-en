<usfm>
\v 18 Yahweh revealed to me that my enemies were planning to kill me.
\v 19 \add Before he did that\add*, I was like a lamb that was being led away to be slaughtered; I did not know what they were planning to do. I did not know that they were saying, "Let's get rid of this tree and its fruit," so \add I did not know\add* that they intended to kill me, in order that no one would remember me \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\q1
\v 20 Then I prayed, "The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels you judge people justly\f + \ft Or: fairly \f*,
\q2 and you examine everything that we are thinking \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\q1 Allow me to watch you getting revenge on the people \add who want to kill me\add*,
\q2 because I trust that you will do for me what is right."

\p
\v 18 Yahweh made me know these things, so I know them. You, Yahweh, made me see their deeds.
\v 19 I was like a gentle lamb being led to a butcher. I did not know that they had formed plans against me, "Let us destroy the tree with its fruit! Let us cut him off from the land of the living 
so his name will be no longer remembered."
\q
\v 20 Yet Yahweh of hosts is the righteous judge who examines the heart and the mind.
\q I will witness your vengeance against them, for I have presented my case to you.
