\v 3 Then tell them that I, Yahweh, the God whom the Israelite people \add worship\add*, said that I will curse everyone who does not obey what was written in that agreement that I made with them.
\v 4 It is the same agreement that I made with their ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt. \add What happened to them in Egypt was terrible; it was as though they were\add* living in a hot furnace \f + \ft metaphor \f*. When I brought them out of Egypt, I told them to obey me, and to do everything that I had commanded them to do. I also told them that if they obeyed me, they would be my people and I would be their God.
\v 5 \add Now tell these people that if they obey me\add*, I will do what I promised to do for their ancestors. I will enable them to continue living in this very fertile [IDI] land in which they now live."
\p I replied, "Yahweh, I hope that what you said will happen."

\v 3 Say to them, ‘Thus says Yahweh, God of Israel: Cursed is the man who does not listen to the words of this covenant
\v 4 that I commanded your fathers in the day I brought them out from the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, and said, “Listen to my voice and do all of these things just as I commanded you, for you will be my people and I will be your God!”
\v 5 So that I may establish the oath that I swore to your fathers to give them the land flowing with milk and honey as on this day.’ Then I answered and said, ‘Truly, Yahweh!’
