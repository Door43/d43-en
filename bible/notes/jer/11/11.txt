===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 So now I, Yahweh, am warning them that I will cause disasters to come to them, and they will not escape. And when they cry out for me \add to help them\add*, I will not pay attention.
\v 12 When that happens, the people in Jerusalem and other cities in Judah will \add offer sacrifices and\add* burn incense to their gods and ask for their help, but those gods will not be able to save them when those disasters come to them.
\v 13 There are more gods in Judah than there are towns in Judah, and the people of Jerusalem have erected as many altars to burn incense \add to those gods\add* as there are streets in Jerusalem.

\v 11 Therefore Yahweh says this: "See, I am about to bring disaster on them, disaster from which they will not be able to escape. Then they will call out to me, but I will not listen to them.
\v 12 The cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and call out to the gods to which they had given offerings, but they will certainly not be saved by them at the time of their disaster.
\v 13 For the number of your gods has increased to equal the number of your cities, Judah. And you have made the number of shameful altars in Jerusalem, incense altars for Baal, to equal the number of her streets.
