\v 11 So now I, Yahweh, am warning them that I will cause disasters to come to them, and they will not escape. And when they cry out for me \add to help them\add*, I will not pay attention.
\v 12 When that happens, the people in Jerusalem and other cities in Judah will \add offer sacrifices and\add* burn incense to their gods and ask for their help, but those gods will not be able to save them when those disasters come to them.
\v 13 There are more gods in Judah than there are towns in Judah, and the people of Jerusalem have erected as many altars to burn incense \add to those gods\add* as there are streets in Jerusalem.

\v 11 Therefore thus says Yahweh: Behold! I am bringing calamity upon them from which they will not be able to escape. Then they will cry out unto me but I will not listen to them.
\v 12 And the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will to and cry out to the gods that they had given offerings to them, but they will certainly not be saved by them in the time of their calamity.
\v 13 For the number of your cities has become the number of your gods, Judah! And you have made the number of the streets of Jerusalem the number of altars of shame, alters of incense to Baal!
