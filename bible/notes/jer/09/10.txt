\q
\v 10 I will sing a song of mourning and wailing for the mountains, and a funeral song will be sung for the meadows.
\q For they are burned so no one can pass through them. They will not hear the sound of any cattle.
\q The birds of the skies and the animals have all fled away.
\q
\v 11 So I will turn Jerusalem into piles of ruins, a hideout for jackals.
\q I will make Judah's cities ruined places without inhabitants.
\q
\v 12 Who is the wise man that understands this? What does Yahweh's mouth proclaim to him so he might report it?
\q Why has the land perished? It is destroyed like the wilderness, where there is no one to pass through it.
