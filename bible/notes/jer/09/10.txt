<usfm>
\q
\v 10 I will sing a song of mourning and wailing for the mountains, and a funeral song will be sung for the meadows.
\q For they are burned so no one can pass through them. They will not hear the sound of any cattle.
\q The birds of the skies and the animals have all fled away.
\q
\v 11 So I will turn Jerusalem into piles of ruins, a hideout for jackals.
\q I will make Judah's cities ruined places without inhabitants."
\q
\v 12 What man is wise enough to understand this? To whom has the mouth of Yahweh spoken, and he will declare it?
\q Why has the land perished and been destroyed like the wilderness that no one can pass through?
