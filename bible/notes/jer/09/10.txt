<usfm>
\q
\v 10 I will lift up weeping and wailing over the mountains, and a dirge will be declared over the meadows;
\q For they will be burned and without any man passing through them, and they will not hear the sound of livestock;
\q Both the birds of heaven and the beasts: they flee! They go away.
\q
\v 11 So I will make Jerusalem like heaps, a lair for jackals!
\q And I will make the cities of Judah a wasteland and without inhabitant.
\q
\v 12 Who is the wise man that understands this? And what does the mouth of Yahweh declare to him so he might report it?
\q Why has the land perished? It is destroyed like the desert where there is no one passing through.
