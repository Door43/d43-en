<usfm>
\q
\v 10 I will sing a song of mourning and wailing for the mountains, and a funeral song will be sung for the meadows.
\q For they are burned so no one can pass through them. They will not hear the sound of any cattle.
\q The birds of the skies and the animals have all fled away.
\q
\v 11 So I will turn Jerusalem into piles of ruins, a hideout for jackals.
\q I will make Judah's cities ruined places without inhabitants."
\q
\v 12 Who is the wise man that understands this? What does Yahweh's mouth proclaim to him so he might report it?
\q Why has the land perished? It is destroyed like the wilderness, where there is no one to pass through it.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking about the people of Judah. In v. 12, Jeremiah makes a comment.

    * **I will sing a song... for the meadows**  - Yahweh is mourning for the land of Israel as if it were a person who died. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
    * **meadows**  - "fields where the animals graze" 
    * **For they are burned**  - AT: "Because someone has burned the meadows and pastures." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
    * **They will not hear the sound of any cattle**  - "Nobody will hear the sound of cattle"
    * **a hideout for jackals** - "a place for jackals to hide"
    * **jackals**  - fierce wild dogs
    * **places without inhabitants** - "places where no people live"
    * **Who is the wise man that understands this? Why has the land perished?** - AT: "If your prophets are really wise, they should be able to tell you why the land is ruined." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **What does Yahweh's mouth proclaim to him so he might report it?** - AT: "If Yahweh really speaks to your prophets, they should be able to tell you what Yahweh says about the destruction of the land." 
    * **Why has the land perished...there is no one to pass through it** - AT: "But your prophets are not wise and Yahweh does not speak to them, so they do not know why the land is in ruins."
