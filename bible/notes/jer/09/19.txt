===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Here Yahweh is saying what the people of Judah will say when he destroys the land.

  * **For the sound of wailing is heard in Zion** - This refers to the people of Zion wailing loudly and can be stated in active form. AT: "The people of Zion are crying loudly, saying" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **How we are devastated** - Yahweh tells what the people of Judah will say when the land is destroyed. AT: "We are very upset" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **We are greatly ashamed, for we have abandoned the land since they tore down our houses** - "Our shame is great, because enemies destroyed our houses and we had to leave the land of Israel"
  * **hear Yahweh's word; pay attention to the messages that come from his mouth** - These two phrases mean the same thing and emphasize the command to listen to what Yahweh says. In the second phrase Yahweh's "mouth" is a metonym for himself. AT: "listen to what Yahweh says. Pay attention to his words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **and each neighbor woman a funeral song** - The missing words may be added. AT: "and teach each neighbor woman a funeral song" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
