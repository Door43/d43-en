===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 25-26 There will be a time when I will punish all those people who have changed their bodies by circumcising them but who have not changed their inner beings: the Egyptian, the Moab, of Edom, and of the Ammon people groups, all those who live close to desert areas far from Judah. I will even punish the people of Israel because they are only circumcised on the outside, and physically, and not on the inside, in their inner self."
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 25 See, days are coming—this is Yahweh’s declaration—when I will punish all the circumcised who are such only in their body.
\v 26 I will punish Egypt and Judah, Edom, the people of Ammon, Moab, and all the people who cut the hair on their heads, who live in the desert. For all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel has an uncircumcised heart.’”

===== Translation Notes: =====

These are the words of Yahweh.

  * **This is Yahweh's declaration** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]].
  * **when I will punish all the circumcised who are such only in their body**  - This refers to the people of Israel who have entered into a covenant with Yahweh by getting circumcised physically. However, they have not followed His laws.
  * **and all the people who cut the hair on their heads**  - AT: This probably refers to people who cut their hair short in order to honor a pagan god. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **For all these nations are uncircumcised**  - AT: "Because these nations did not enter into a covenant with Yahweh through circumcision."
  * **and all the house of Israel has an uncircumcised heart**  - An uncircumcised heart represents the character of a person that does not obey Yahweh's laws.  AT: "and all the people of Israel have not kept the covenant with Yahweh by obeying him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
