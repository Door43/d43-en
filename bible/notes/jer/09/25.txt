<usfm>
\v 25-26 There will be a time when I will punish all those people who have changed their bodies by circumcising them but who have not changed their inner beings: the Egyptian, the Moab, of Edom, and of the Ammon people groups, all those who live close to desert areas far from Judah. I will even punish the people of Israel because they are only circumcised on the outside, and physically, and not on the inside, in their inner self."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - These are the words of Yahweh.

  * **See** - Yahweh uses this word here to draw the people's attention to what he says next. AT: "Listen" or "Indeed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]) 
  * **days are coming** - This is an idiom. AT: "there will be a time" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **all the circumcised who are such only in their body** - This refers to the people of Israel who have entered into Yahweh's covenant by getting circumcised physically, but who have not changed their inner beings by following his laws. AT: "all those people who have changed their bodies by circumcising them but who have not changed their inner beings" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and all the people who cut the hair on their heads very short** - This probably refers to people who cut their hair short in order to honor a pagan god. Some modern versions interpret this Hebrew expression as "and all the people who live on the edge of the wilderness."
  * **For all these nations are uncircumcised** - The word "nations" refers to the people who live in these places. Foreigners being uncircumcised was a sign that they were not in Yahweh's covenant. AT: "For the people of these nations did not enter into a covenant with Yahweh through circumcision" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **and all the house of Israel has an uncircumcised heart** - The "heart" represents a person's will and desires. An "uncircumcised heart" represents the character of a person that does not follow Yahweh and his laws. Also, the "house" of Israel refers to the people of Israel. AT: "and all the people of Israel are only circumcised on the outside and have not changed their hearts" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
