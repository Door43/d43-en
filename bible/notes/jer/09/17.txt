Yahweh has just told them he will send them out to other nations and kill them. 

    * **Summon funeral singers; let them come. Send out for women skilled at lamenting; let them come**- The ideas are repeated more than once for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **Summon** - "Call"
    * **so our eyes may run with tears and our eyelids flow with water** - Yahweh really once the people to be sad so he repeats this.
