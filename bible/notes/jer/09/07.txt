\v 7 Therefore I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, say this:
\q1 Listen carefully to what I say: I will \add cause great afflictions to come on my people\add*,
\q2 \add like a metalworker puts metal in a hot fire\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* to completely burn out the impure bits.
\q1 Because of all \add the evil things\add* that my people have done,
\q2 there is absolutely nothing else \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* that I can do.
\q1
\v 8 What they say \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add injures people like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* poisoned arrows do.
\q1 They say to their neighbors, 'I hope things will go well for you,'
\q2 while they are planning to kill them.
\q1
\v 9 Should I not punish them for doing that \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?
\q2 Yes, I should certainly get revenge on\f + \ft Or: give what they deserve to \f* the people of a nation that does things like that!"

<usfm>
\v 7 Therefore I, Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, say this:
\q Listen carefully to what I say: I will test my people, like a metalworker puts metal in a hot fire to completely burn out the impure bits.
\q Because of all the evil things that my people have done, there is absolutely nothing else that I can do.
\q
\v 8 What they say injures people like poisoned arrows do.
\q They say to their neighbors, 'I hope things will go well for you,' while they are planning to kill them.
\q
\v 9 Should I not punish them for doing that?
\q Yes, I should certainly get revenge on the people of a nation that does things like that!"

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 7 Yahweh of hosts says this, "See, I am about to refine them and test them,
\q for what else can I do, because of what my people have done?
\q
\v 8 Their tongues are sharpened arrows; they speak unfaithful things.
\q With their mouths they proclaim peace with their neighbors, but with their hearts they lie in wait for them.
\q
\v 9 Should I not punish them because of these things—this is Yahweh's declaration—
\q and should I not avenge myself on a nation that is like this?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to speak about the people of Judah.

  * **See** - Yahweh uses this word here to draw Jeremiah's attention to what he says next. AT: "Listen" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]) 
  * **to refine them** - Yahweh speaks of testing the people and dealing with their evil ways, as if they were metal that he were melting in a crucible to remove its impurities. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **for what else can I do, because of what my people have done?** - Yahweh uses this rhetorical question to state that this is how he needs to deal with his people because of what they have done. This question can be written as a statement. AT: "for this is how I must deal with my people because of what they have done." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Their tongues are sharpened arrows** - This speaks of people's tongues as if they were sharpened arrows because of how the people hurt others by what they say. Here their speech is represented by their "tongues." AT: "Their words are like sharpened arrows that hurt other people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **With their mouths they proclaim peace with their neighbors** - Here people's speech is represented by their "mouths." AT: "They speak, saying that they want peace with their neighbors" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **but with their hearts they lie in wait for them** - Here a people's desires are represented by their "hearts." This speaks of them wanting to hurt their neighbors as if they were an animal crouching and waiting to attack its prey. AT: "but what they really want is to destroy their neighbors" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Should I not punish them because of these things ... should I not avenge myself on a nation that is like this?** - Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that the things that they are doing are so bad that he will not have mercy and stop himself from punishing them. See how you translated similar words in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:05:07|5:9]]. AT: "Because they do these things, I will punish them ... I will certainly get revenge for myself against them." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]]) 
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
