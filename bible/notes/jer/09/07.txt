<usfm>
\q
\v 7 Therefore thus says Yahweh of Hosts: Behold their testing, for I will examine them!
\q For how shall I act because of the daughter of my people?
\q
\v 8 Their tongue is a sharpened arrow, it declares treason!
\q With his mouth he declares peace with his neighbor, but with his innards he sets his ambush!
\q
\v 9 Should I not attend to them because of these things?—this is Yahweh’s declaration—
\q Or should my soul not avenge itself on the nation that is like this?
