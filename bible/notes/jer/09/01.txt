===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 "I wish that my head could produce as many tears as water from a spring, and that my eyes were like a fountain of tears,
\q since I cry night and day for all of my people who have been killed by their enemies.
\q
\v 2 I wish that I could leave my people and forget them, and go and live in a shack in the desert,
\q because they have not remained faithful to Yahweh; they are a mob of people who deceive others.
\q
\v 3 They use their tongues to tell lies just as people shoot arrows with bows.
\q They are powerful, but not because they are faithful, but they go about doing wicked things. "They do not know me," Yahweh says.


\q

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\c 9
\q
\v 1 If only my head could produce water, and my eyes be a fountain of tears!
\q For I wish to weep day and night for those among the daughter of my people who have been killed.
\q
\v 2 If only someone would give me a place for travelers in the wilderness to stay, where I could go to abandon my people.
\q If only I could leave them, since all of them are adulterers, a band of traitors!
\q
\v 3 Yahweh declares, "They tread on their bows of lies with their tongues,
\q but it is not because of any faithfulness of theirs that they grow strong on the earth.
\q They go from one wicked act to another. They do not know me."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh and Jeremiah continue talking about the people of Judah.

  * **If only my head could produce water, and my eyes be a fountain of tears** - This is Jeremiah speaking. These two phrases mean the same thing and emphasize how much Jeremiah is weeping. AT: "I wish I could make more tears" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **day and night** - By mentioning both "day" and "night" this phrase means all the time. AT: "all the time" or "continually" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **the daughter of my people** - Yahweh shows his love for his people by speaking of them as a daughter. Here Jeremiah uses this same phrase for the people that Yahweh uses. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:04:11|4:11]]. AT: "my people, who are like Yahweh's daughter" or "my dear people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **who have been killed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "whom the enemy has killed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **If only someone would give me** - "I wish someone would give me." This is still Jeremiah speaking. 
  * **a place for travelers in the wilderness to stay** - This refers to a building for people traveling in the wilderness, where they can stop and sleep overnight. 
  * **abandon my people** - "leave my people"
  * **a band of traitors** - "a group of people who betray other people"
  * **Yahweh declares** - See how you translated "this is Yahweh's declaration" in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]].
  * **They tread on their bows of lies with their tongues** - Telling lies is spoken of as being done by the tongues of the wicked. Also, since a spoken lie cannot be taken back, telling lies is spoken of as if it were shooting arrows. Men who use bows must step on their bows in order to fasten the bowstrings, so liars are referred to here as if they were stringing their bows using their tongues. AT: "Their lies are like arrows that they shoot with the tongues" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **but it is not because of any faithfulness of theirs that they grow strong on the earth** - "They do not grow strong on the earth because they are faithful to Yahweh, as they are wicked" and "This means that the people are not faithful to Yahweh, but rather are wicked and have gained their power through wickedness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **They go from one wicked act to another** - Committing one evil action after another is spoken of as if the evildoers were going from one action to another. AT: "They keep doing evil things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
