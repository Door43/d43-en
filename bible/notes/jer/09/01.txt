===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 "I wish that my head could produce as many tears as water from a spring, and that my eyes were like a fountain of tears,
\q since I cry night and day for all of my people who have been killed by their enemies.
\q
\v 2 I wish that I could leave my people and forget them, and go and live in a shack in the desert,
\q because they have not remained faithful to Yahweh; they are a mob of people who deceive others.
\q
\v 3 They use their tongues to tell lies like people shoot arrows with bows.
\q They are not powerful because they are faithful, but go about doing wicked things. "They do not know me," Yahweh has said.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\c 9
\q
\v 1 If only my head could produce water, and my eyes be a fountain of tears!
\q For I wish to weep day and night for those among the daughter of my people who have been killed.
\q
\v 2 If only someone would give me a place for travelers in the wilderness to stay, where I could go to abandon my people.
\q If only I could leave them, since all of them are adulterers, a band of traitors!
\q
\v 3 For they say false things with their tongues, which are their deceitful bows, but they are not great in faithfulness on the earth.
\q They go out from wicked act to another. They do not know me—this is Yahweh’s declaration.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh and Jeremiah continue talking about the people of Judah.

  * **If only my head could produce water, and my eyes be a fountain of tears** - This is Jeremiah speaking. AT: "I wish I could make more tears!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **day and night**  - AT: "all the time." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **the daughter of my people**  - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:jer:04:11|4:11]].
  * **who have been killed **  - AT: "whom the enemy has killed." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **If only someone would give me**  - This is still Jeremiah speaking. "I wish someone would give me"
  * **a place for travelers in the wilderness to stay**  - This refers to a building for people traveling in the wilderness, where they can stop and sleep overnight.  
  * **abandon my people** - "leave my people"
  * **a band of traitors** - "a group of people who betray other other people"
  * **For they say false things with their tongues, which are their deceitful bows** - It is uncertain whether this is Jeremiah or Yahweh speaking, but it is probably Yahweh. This metaphor compares the tongues of the people of Judah to bows that shoot arrows of lies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **but they are not great in faithfulness on the earth**  - AT: "but they are not faithful to Yahweh."
  * **They go out from wicked act to another**  - "They keep doing lots of evil things"
  * **Yahweh's declaration** - See you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]].
