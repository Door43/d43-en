<usfm>
\v 1 "I wish that my head could produce as many tears as water from a spring, and that my eyes were like a fountain of tears,
\q since I cry night and day for all of my people who have been killed by their enemies.
\q
\v 2 I wish that I could leave my people and forget them, and go and live in a shack in the desert,
\q because they have not remained faithful to Yahweh; they are a mob of people who deceive others.
\q
\v 3 They use their tongues to tell lies like people shoot arrows with bows.
\q They are not powerful because they are faithful, but go about doing wicked things. "They do not know me," Yahweh has said.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh and Jeremiah continue talking about the people of Judah.

  * **If only my head could produce water, and my eyes be a fountain of tears** - This is Jeremiah speaking. AT: "I wish I could make more tears!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **day and night**  - AT: "all the time." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **the daughter of my people**  - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:jer:04:11|4:11]].
  * **who have been killed **  - AT: "whom the enemy has killed." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **If only someone would give me**  - This is still Jeremiah speaking. "I wish someone would give me"
  * **a place for travelers in the wilderness to stay**  - This refers to a building for people traveling in the wilderness, where they can stop and sleep overnight.  
  * **abandon my people** - "leave my people"
  * **a band of traitors** - "a group of people who betray other other people"
  * **Yahweh declares** - See you translated this same idea in [[en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]].
  * **They say false things with their tongues, which are their deceitful bows** - This metaphor compares the tongues of the people of Judah to bows that shoot arrows of lies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **but they are not great in faithfulness on the earth**  - AT: "but they are not faithful to Yahweh."
  * **They go out from wicked act to another**  - "They keep doing lots of evil things"
