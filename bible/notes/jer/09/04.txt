    * **Each man mocks his neighbor and does not speak the truth**  - "All of the people mock each other, and they do not tell the truth"
    * **Their tongues teach deceitful things** - AT: "They teach things that are not true." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **They are exhausted from committing iniquity** - "They are tired from committing so much sin"
    * **You live in the midst of deception**  - Yahweh is speaking to Jeremiah. 
    * **in their deceit they refuse to acknowledge me**  - "By telling all of these lies, the people of Judah refuse to obey me as God."  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
