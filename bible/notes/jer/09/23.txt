\q
\v 23 Thus says Yahweh: Do not let the wise man glorify himself with his wisdom,
\q Or the warrior glorify himself with his might! Do not let the wealthy man glorify himself with his riches!
\q
\v 24 For if a man will glorify himself let him glorify himself with this—he has insight and knows me!
\q For I am Yahweh who acts with covenant loyalty, justice and righteousness on the earth. For I have delighted in these!
\q –this is Yahweh’s declaration.
