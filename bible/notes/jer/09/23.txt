\p
\v 23 Thus says Jehovah, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the
rich man glory in his riches;
\v 24 but let him that glories glory in this, that he has understanding, and knows me, that I am Jehovah who exerciseth
lovingkindness, justice, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, says Jehovah.
