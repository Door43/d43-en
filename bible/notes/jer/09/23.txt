\v 23 Yahweh says this, "Do not let the wise man take pride in his wisdom,
\q or the warrior in his might. Do not let the wealthy man take pride in his riches.
\q
\v 24 For if a man takes pride in anything, let it be in this, that he has insight and knows me.
\q For I am Yahweh, who acts with covenant loyalty, justice and righteousness on earth. For it is in these that I take pleasure
\q â€”this is Yahweh's declaration."
