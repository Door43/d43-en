\v 23 Yahweh says this, "Do not let the wise man take pride in his wisdom,
\q or the warrior in his might. Do not let the wealthy man take pride in his riches.
\q
\v 24 For if a man takes pride in anything, let it be in this, that he has insight and knows me.
\q For I am Yahweh, who acts with covenant loyalty, justice and righteousness on earth. For it is in these that I take pleasure
\q —this is Yahweh's declaration."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - These are the words of Yahweh.

  * **Do not let the wise man take pride in his wisdom** - "A wise man should not be proud because he is wise"
  * **or the warrior in his might** - The missing words may be added. AT: "or let the warrior take pride in his might" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **Do not let the wealthy man take pride in his riches** - "A rich man should not be proud because he is rich"
  * **has insight and knows me** - "understands who I am and knows me." Both of these phrases have similar meanings. They emphasize people knowing who Yahweh is and understanding who he is. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **For I am Yahweh** - This refers to people knowing Yahweh and his ways. AT: "Because people should understand that I am Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **For it is in these that I take pleasure** - The word "these" refers to covenant loyalty, justice, and righteousness. 
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
