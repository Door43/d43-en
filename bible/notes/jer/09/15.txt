===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking about the people of Judah.

  * **Yahweh of hosts ... says this** - Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:06:06|6:6]].
  * **See** - Yahweh uses this word here to draw the people's attention to what he says next. AT: "Listen" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]) 
  * **wormwood** - a plant that tastes bitter
  * **Then I will scatter them among the nations** - "Then I will force them to leave here and live in many different countries"
  * **neither they nor their ancestors** - The missing words may be added. AT: "that neither they nor their ancestors have known" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **I will send out a sword after them** - Here the word "sword" refers to an enemy army. AT: "I will send an army of soldiers to fight against them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I have completely destroyed them** - Yahweh will cause the people to be destroyed by their enemies; he will not destroy them himself. AT: "I have caused them to be completely destroyed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
