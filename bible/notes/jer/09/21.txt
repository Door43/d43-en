===== Translation Notes: =====

These are Yahweh's words about the people of Judah.

    * **For death has come through our windows** - Yahweh says what the people of Judah will say when he destroys the land. The people of Judah will compare death to a person who can climb in windows to attack the people inside. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
    * **palaces** - fancy houses where kings live. Death will come to rich and poor alike.
    * **It destroys children from outside**  - AT: "Death is killing children in the streets."
    * **and young men in the the city squares**  - AT: "and death is killing young men in the city squares."
    * **city squares** - marketplaces
    * **Yahweh's declaration**  - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]].
    * **the corpses of men will fall like dung...like grain stalks after the reapers** - AT: "dead bodies will fall all over the place." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **corpses of men will fall like dung in the fields**  - AT: "dead bodies will drop everywhere like animal poop drops all over the fields." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
    * **and like grain stalks after the reapers**  - AT: "and like stalks of grain fall everywhere after the farmers cut them down."
    * **and there will be no one to gather them**  - "and there will be nobody to gather the dead bodies"
