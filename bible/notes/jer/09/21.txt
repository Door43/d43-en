===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Here Yahweh is saying what the people of Judah will say when he destroys the land.

  * **For death has come through our windows ... young men in the city squares** - The people of Judah will compare death to a person who can climb in windows to attack the people inside and attacks people in the palaces, streets, and city squares. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **palaces** - fancy houses where kings live. Death will come to rich and poor alike.
  * **city squares** - marketplaces
  * **This is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "This is what Yahweh has declared" or "This is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **the corpses of men will fall like dung ... like grain stalks after the reapers** - These two phrases mean the same thing and emphasize the large number dead bodies. AT: "dead bodies will fall all over the place" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **corpses of men will fall like dung in the fields** - This describes the great number of people who will die, by comparing their bodies to dung that falls in the fields. AT: "dead bodies will drop everywhere like animal dung falls all over the fields" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **like grain stalks after the reapers** - This describes the great number of people who will die, by comparing their bodies to cut stalks of grain. AT: "like stalks of grain fall everywhere after the farmers cut them down" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **there will be no one to gather them** - "there will be nobody to gather the dead bodies"
