\v 14 This is also what Yahweh said to me: "I will punish the evil nearby nations that have been trying to take away the land that I gave to my Israelite people, and I will force them to leave their own land. But I will throw the people of Judah out of their land, also.
\v 15 But later I will act mercifully toward those nations again, and I will bring them back to their own lands again. Each \add clan\add* will come back to its own land.

\v 14 Yahweh  says this against all my neighbors, the wicked ones who strike at the possession that I made my people Israel inherit, "See, I am the one who is about to uproot them from their own ground, and I will pull up the house of Judah from among them.
\v 15 Then after I uproot those nations, it will happen that I will have compassion on them and bring them back; I will return themâ€”each man to his inheritance and his land.
