\q2 why are wicked people \add often\add* very prosperous?
\q2 Why do things go very well for dishonest\f + \ft Or: unfaithful \f* people?

\c 12
\p
\v 1 Righteous are thou, O Jehovah, when I contend with thee; yet would I reason the cause with thee: wherefore does the way of
the wicked prosper? wherefore are all they at ease that deal very treacherously?
\v 2 You have planted them, yea, they have taken root; they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: you are near in their mouth,
and far from their heart.
