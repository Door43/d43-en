<usfm>
\q
\v 7 I have abandoned my house; I have forsaken my inheritance!
\q I have given the beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.
\q
\v 8 My inheritance has become to me like a lion in the thicket;
\q With her voice she sets herself against me; therefore I have hated her.
\q
\v 9 Is my heritage a colorful bird of prey against me? Does the bird of prey surround her?
\q Go, gather all the living things in the field. Bring them to be eaten.
