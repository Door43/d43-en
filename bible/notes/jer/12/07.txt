\q
\v 7 I have abandoned my house; I have forsaken my inheritance.
\q I have given my own beloved people into the hands of her enemies.
\q
\v 8 My inheritance has become to me like a lion in a thicket;
\q she sets herself against me with her own voice, so I hate her.
\q
\v 9 Has not my prized possession become a speckled bird, that other birds of prey go against her all around?
\q Go and gather all the wild beasts and bring them to devour her.

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **I have abandoned my house; I have forsaken my inheritance. I have given my own beloved people into the hands of her enemies.** - These three sentences have similar meanings. The first and second one strengthens the thought in the third. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **I have abandoned my house; I have forsaken my inheritance** - The two phrases are metaphors in which Yahweh speaks of his people as if they were his "house" and his "inheritance." AT: "I have abandoned my Israelite people, the people whom I chose to belong to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **into the hands of her enemies** - Here the word "hands" represents control. AT: "to be conquered by her enemies" or "over to the control of her enemies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **of her ... she sets herself ... with her ... hate her** - Here Yahweh refers to his people as a female by using feminine pronouns. AT: "of their ... they set themselves ... with their ... hate them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **she sets herself against me with her own voice** - This continues to speaks of Yahweh's people as a lion. This speaks of the people showing they are against him as if they were roaring at him. AT: "it is like she roars at me to defy me" 
  * **Has not my prized possession become a speckled bird, that other birds of prey go against her all around?** - Yahweh uses this rhetorical question to emphasize that his people are surrounded by their enemies. This question can be written as a statement. AT: "My prized possession has become a speckled bird and other birds of prey go against her all around." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Has not my prized possession** - Here Yahweh speaks of his people as his "prized possession." AT: "Have not my people, who are my prized possession" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **become a speckled bird, that other birds of prey go against her all around** - Here Yahweh speaks of his people being in danger and surrounded by their enemies as if they were a speckled bird surrounded by birds of prey. AT: "become like a speckled bird, and her enemies are like birds of prey attacking her on all sides" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a speckled bird** - "a strange looking bird." This refers to a bird that was often picked on and eaten by other birds. 
  * **birds of prey** - birds that attack and eat animals
  * **Go and gather all the wild beasts and bring them to devour her** - Yahweh speaks here in the form of a command to strengthen what he says. This command is not directed to a specific person and may be written as a statement. AT: "Let all the wild beasts in the fields come and eat her" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
