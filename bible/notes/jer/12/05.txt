\q2
\v 5 For if you have run with the footmen and they exhausted you, how can you race the stallions?
\q2 And you are trusting in a land of peace, but how will you act in the majesty of the Jordan?
\q2 
\v 6 For your brother and your father’s house, they also betrayed you and they also loudly proclaimed after you!
\q2 Do not trust in them, though they declare good things to you.
