\q1 "It is as though you have become exhausted from racing against men;
\q2 so how will you be able to race against horses?
\q1 If you only prepare to run on open ground,
\q2 what will happen to you when you are running through the thick foliage near the Jordan River?

\v 6 Already your brothers and other members of your own family oppose you.
\q2 They plot against you and they say bad things about you.

\q
\v 5 Yahweh said, "For if you, Jeremiah, have run with foot soldiers and they have tired you out, how can you compete against horses?
\q If you fall down in the open, safe countryside, how will you do in the thickets along the Jordan?
\q 
\v 6 For even your brothers and your fatherâ€™s family have betrayed you and have loudly denounced you.
\q Do not trust in them, even if they say nice things to you.
