\v 3 But you, O Jehovah, know me; you see me, and triest my heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the
slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.
\v 4 How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of the whole country wither? for the wickedness of them that dwell therein,
the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our latter end.
