<usfm>
\v 3 But Yahweh, as for me, you know what is in my inner being.
\q2 You see what I \add do\add* and you are able to know what I am thinking.
\q1 So drag away those wicked people,
\q2 like \add people drag away\add* sheep that they are going to butcher.
\q1 Set them aside like sheep that are about to be slaughtered!
\q1
\v 4 This land is \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* becoming very dry and even the grass is withering.
\q1 The wild animals and the birds have all died
\q2 because the people are very wicked.
\q1 All this has happened because the people have said,
\q2 "Yahweh does not know what we are doing \f + \ft Or: what will happen to us \f*!"
