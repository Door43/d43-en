\v 16 And it will be if they truly learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name “As Yahweh lives!” even as they taught my people to swear by Baal, then they will be build up in the midst of my people.
\v 17 But if they will not listen then I will uproot that nation. It will be uprooted and destroyed.—this is Yahweh’s declaration.”
