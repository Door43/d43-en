<usfm>
\v 16 And if the people of the other nations \add whose armies have invaded Israel\add* learn the religious customs of my people, and if they learn that I \add am listening\add* when they solemnly promise that they will do something, like they taught my people to believe that \add their god\add* Baal \add was listening\add* when they made solemn promises, I will cause them to become prosperous, and they also will be my people.
\v 17 But I will expel any nation whose people refuse to obey me, and I will destroy that nation and its people. \add That will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it."

\v 16 It will come about that if those nations carefully learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name 'As Yahweh lives!' just as they have taught my people to swear by Baal, then they will be built up in the midst of my people.
\v 17 But if any do not listen, then I will uproot that nation. It will certainly be uprooted and destroyed—this is Yahweh's declaration."
