\v 22 You will ask yourselves, "Why is this happening to us?"

\q1
\v 23 A man from Ethiopia certainly cannot \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* change the color of his \add black\add* skin,
\q2 and a leopard certainly cannot \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* change its spots.
\q1 Similarly, you cannot start doing what is good,
\q2 because you have always done what is evil.
\b

\v 24 \add Yahweh says\add*, "I will scatter you like chaff

<usfm>
\q
\v 22 Then you might say in your heart, “Why are these things happening to me?”
\q It will be for the multitude of your iniquities that your skirts are raised up and you have been raped.
\q
\v 23 Can the people of Cush change their skin color, or a leopard change its spots?
\q If so, then you yourself, although accustomed to wickedness, would be able to do good.
\q
\v 24 So I will scatter them like chaff that perishes in the desert wind.

  * **skirts are raised up**  - AT: "soldiers of the invading armies will raise up the skirts of your women".

  * **a leopard change its spots**  - AT:  "A leopard cannot change its spots"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **If so, then you yourself, although accustomed to wickedness, would be able to do good.**  - AT:  "You cannot do good because of your wickedness."  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **scatter them like chaff that perishes in the desert wind**  -  Yahweh is saying He will scatter His people throughout the world.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
