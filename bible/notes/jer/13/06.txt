===== translationNotes: =====

  * **behold!** - The word "behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.
  * **The undergarment was destroyed; it was no good at all** - These two phrases have the same meaning and are used together to emphasize that the undergarment was destroyed. AT: "The undergarment was spoiled and useless" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
