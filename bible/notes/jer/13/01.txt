\c 13
\p
\v 1 Yahweh said this to me, "Go and buy a linen undergarment and put it on around your waist, but do not put it in water first."
\v 2 So I bought an undergarment as Yahweh directed, and I put in on around my waist.
\v 3 Then the word of Yahweh came to me a second time and said,
\v 4 "Take the undergarment that you purchased that is around your waist, get up and travel to the Euphrates. Hide it there in a rock crevice."
\v 5 So I went and hid it in the Euphrates just as Yahweh had commanded me.
