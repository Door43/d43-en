<usfm>
\q
\v 25 This is your allotment, the portion of your measurement from me!—this is Yahweh’s declaration—
\q Because you have forgotten me and trusted in deceit.
\q
\v 26 So also I myself will strip your skirts from upon you, and your shamefulness will be seen!
\q
\v 27 Your adultery and your neighing, the shamefulness of your fornication on the heights! In the fields! I will cause it to be seen!
\q Your detestable things!  Woe to you, Jerusalem! You have not been clean. How long will this continue?
