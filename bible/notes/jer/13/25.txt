<usfm>
\q
\v 25 This is what I have given to you, the portion I have decreed for you—this is Yahweh's declaration—
\q because you have forgotten me and trusted in deceit.
\q
\v 26 So also I myself will strip your skirts off you, and your private parts will be seen.
\q
\v 27 I have seen your adultery and neighing,
\q the wickedness of your prostitution on the hills and in the fields,
\q and I have seen these detestable things!
\q Woe to you, Jerusalem! How long until you are made clean again?"

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **This is what I have given to you, the portion I have decreed for you** - Both of these phrases have the same meaning and emphasize that these are the things that Yahweh has decided will happen to the people of Judah. AT: "This is what I am making happen to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **I myself will strip your skirts off you, and your private parts will be seen.** - This means that Yahweh will make them feel ashamed. It does not in any way mean that he will rape them. This can be stated in active form. AT: "It is as though I myself will strip your skirts off of you so that everyone will see your private parts and you will be ashamed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **neighing** - This is the sound of a male horse desiring a female horse. AT: "lusting" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
