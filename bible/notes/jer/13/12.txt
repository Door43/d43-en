\v 12 So, tell this to them: 'Yahweh, the God whom you Israelite people worship, says that every leather wineskin should be filled with wine.' And \add when you tell that to them\add*, they will reply, 'Of course\f + \ft Or: Certainly \f* we know \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* that all wineskins should be filled with wine!'
\v 13 And then you must tell them, 'No, that is not what Yahweh means. What he said means that he will cause this land to be filled with people who are drunk. That will include \add all of you\add*—the king who sits on the throne that King David previously sat on, the priests and the prophets, and even the common people of Jerusalem.'
\v 14 He is saying, 'I will cause you to bash each other. Even parents will bash their children. I will not pity you or act mercifully toward you at all; pitying you will not prevent me from getting rid of you.'~"

\v 12 So you must speak this word to them,
'Yahweh, the God of Israel, says this: Every jar will be filled with wine.' They will say to you, 'Do we not indeed know that every jar will be filled with wine?'
\v 13 So say to them, 'Yahweh says this: See, I am about to fill with drunkenness every inhabitant of this land, the kings who sit on David's throne, the priests, prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\v 14 Then I will smash each man against the other, fathers and children together—this is Yahweh's declaration—I will not pity them or have compassion, and I will not spare them from destruction.'"
