\v 12 So you must speak this word unto them,
‘Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel: Every jar will be filled with wine.’ So they will say to you, ‘Do we not truly know that every jar will be filled with wine?’
\v 13 So say to them, ‘Thus says Yahweh: Behold! I will fill every inhabitant of this land and the kings that sit on the throne of David, and the priests, prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with intoxication!
\v 14 Then I will smash each man with his brother, fathers and children together.—this is Yahweh’s declaration. I will not spare them or have compassion, and I will not pity them in their destruction.
