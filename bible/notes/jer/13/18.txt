Yahweh is continuing to talk to Jeremiah. He is telling Jeremiah what to say to the king of Judah and the king's mother.

  * **for the crowns on your head, your pride and glory, have fallen off** - "You will no longer be king and queen mother" (See symbolic action)
  * **queen mother** - the mother of the king.
  * **The cities in the Negev will be shut up** - "Your enemies will shut the cities in the Negev up" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) 
  * **Judah will be taken captive** - "The enemies will take Judah captive" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
