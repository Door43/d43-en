\v 3 So Jeremiah said to them, “This is what you must say to Zedekiah,
\v 4 ‘Yahweh, God of Israel, says this: See, I am about to turn back the instruments of war that are in your hand, with which you are fighting against the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans 
who are closing you in from outside the walls! For I will gather them in the middle of this city.
\v 5 Then I myself will fight against you with a raised hand and a strong arm, and with wrath, fury, and great anger.
