  * **inhabitant of the valley** - Possible meanings are 1) this may refer to Jerusalem, which was located above a valley, because "inhabitant" is singular and feminine, as is Jerusalem or 2) this is directed to another city or group of people. Most versions leave the original form rather than specifying the city.
  * **I am against** - "I oppose" or "I am going to punish"
