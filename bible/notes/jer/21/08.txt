====== Jeremiah 21:8-10 ======

\v 8 And tell this to all the people: 'Yahweh says that you must decide whether you want to die or to remain alive.
\v 9 Everyone who remains in Jerusalem will die. They will be killed in battles or die from being hungry or from diseases. But those who surrender to the army of Babylon that is surrounding your city will remain alive. They will escape dying.
\v 10 This will happen because I, Yahweh, have decided to cause this city to experience disasters, not to experience something good. The army of the king of Babylon will capture this city and will destroy it completely by fire.'~"

\v 8 Then to this people you must say, ‘Yahweh says this: See, I am about to place before you the way of life and the way of death.
\v 9 Anyone staying in this city will die by the sword, famine, and plague; but anyone going out and falling on his knees before the Chaldeans who have closed in against you will live. His life 
will be his plunder.
\v 10 For I have set my face against this city in order to bring disaster, and not to bring good—this is Yahweh’s declaration. It has been given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it.'
