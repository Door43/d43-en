\v 17 So I took the cup from Yahweh's hand, and I made all the nations to which Yahweh had sent me drink it—
\v 18 Jerusalem, the cities of Judah and her kings and officials—to turn them into ruins and something terrifying, and into an object for hissing and cursing, as they are at this present day.

===== Translation Notes: =====

This passage continues the metaphor of Yahweh's wrath as a drink to be poured out.  

  * **I made all the nations to which Yahweh had sent me drink it** - The action of drinking from the cup of wine symbolized God's judgment.
  * **to turn them into ruins and something terrifying**  - AT: "to destroy them"
  * **for hissing and cursing** - AT: "to be despised or cursed"
  * **they are at this present day** - There was apparently a period of time between when this was written and when it actually happened.
