\v 32 Thus says Jehovah of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great tempest shall be raised up
from the uttermost parts of the earth.
\v 33 And the slain of Jehovah shall be at that day from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth: they shall
not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the face of the ground.
