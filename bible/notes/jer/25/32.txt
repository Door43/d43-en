\q
\v 32 Yahweh of hosts says this: "See, disaster is going out from nation to nation,
\q and a great storm is beginning from the farthest parts of the earth.
\v 33 Then those killed by Yahweh will on that day extend from the one end of the earth to the other; they will not be mourned, gathered, or buried. They will be like dung on the ground.
