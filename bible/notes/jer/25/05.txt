\v 5 These prophets said, 'Let each man turn from his wicked way and the corruption of his practices and return to the land that Yahweh gave in ancient times to your ancestors and to you, as a permanent gift.
\v 6 So do not walk after other gods to worship them or bow down to them, and do not provoke him with the work of your hands so that he does you harm.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Let each man turn from his wicked way and the corruption of his practices** - Jeremiah speaks of people who stop committing an action as if those people were turning away from that action. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **his wicked way and the corruption of his practices** - The terms "wicked way" and "corruption of his practices" mean the same thing and refer to every sinful thing that they do. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **the corruption of his practices** - "his corrupt practices"
  * **do not walk after other gods** - Jeremiah speaks of a person being devoted to a god as if the person were walking behind the god. AT: "do not become devoted to other gods" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **do not provoke him with the work of your hands** - The word "him" refers to Yahweh. Possible meanings for the phrase "the work of your hands" are 1) it is a reference to the idols that the people have made with their hands. AT: "do not provoke Yahweh with the idols that you have made" or 2) It is an idiom that refers to the actions of a person, with the word "hands" being a synecdoche that represents the person who does those actions. AT: "do not provoke Yahweh by the things that you do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
