\v 12 Then it will happen when seventy years have been completed, that I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation, the land of the Chaldeans—this is Yahweh's declaration—for their iniquity and make it an unending desolation.
\v 13 Then I will carry out against that land all the words that I had spoken, and everything written in this book that Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.
\v 14 For also many other nations and great kings will make slaves out of these nations. I will repay them for their deeds and the works of their hands.'"
