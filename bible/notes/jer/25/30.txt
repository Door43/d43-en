<usfm>
\v 30 Now tell them all those things that I have said, and also say this to them:
\q1 'Yahweh will \add shout to them\add* from his holy dwelling \add in heaven\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\q2 and \add it will sound like\add* the roar of a lion.
\q1 He will shout like \f + \ft simile \f* people shout when they are treading on grapes \add to make juice for wine\add*;
\q2 he will shout to everyone on the earth.
\q1
\v 31 Even people in very remote places around the earth will hear him shouting,
\q2 because he will say why he will judge and punish all the nations.
\q1 He will cause the wicked people to be slaughtered with swords.
\q2 \add That will surely happen because\add* Yahweh has said it.'

\p
\v 30 So you yourself, Jeremiah, must prophesy to them all these words. You must say to them,
\q 'Yahweh will roar from the heights 
\q and will raise his voice from his holy dwelling,
\q and thunder from his holy dwelling place; 
\q and he will shout like those who tread the grapes
\q against all those who live on the earth. 
\q
\v 31 A noise comes to the ends of the land, 
\q for a dispute from Yahweh is going to bring a lawsuit against the nations.
He will administer justice to all flesh. 
\q He will hand over the wicked ones to the sword—this is Yahweh's declaration.'
