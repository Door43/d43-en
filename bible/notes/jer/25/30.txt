<usfm>
\v 30 Now tell them all those things that I have said, and also say this to them:
\q1 'Yahweh will \add shout to them\add* from his holy dwelling \add in heaven\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\q2 and \add it will sound like\add* the roar of a lion.
\q1 He will shout like \f + \ft simile \f* people shout when they are treading on grapes \add to make juice for wine\add*;
\q2 he will shout to everyone on the earth.
\q1
\v 31 Even people in very remote places around the earth will hear him shouting,
\q2 because he will say why he will judge and punish all the nations.
\q1 He will cause the wicked people to be slaughtered with swords.
\q2 \add That will surely happen because\add* Yahweh has said it.'

\v 30 Now tell them all those things that I have said, and also say this to them:
\q1 'Yahweh will shout to them from from the highest places like a lion roars!
\q2 He will call out with a shout from the holy place where he lives!
\q1 He will roar like a lion against his people because of their sins!
\q2 Like those who shout so loudly when they are treading the grapes, 
\q1 he will shout so that everyone who lives on the earth can hear him!
\q1
\v 31 Even people in very remote places around the earth will hear him shouting,
\q2 because he will say why he will judge and punish all the nations.
\q1 He will cause the wicked people to be slaughtered with swords.
\q2 That will surely happen because Yahweh has said it.'

<usfm>
\p
\v 30 You must prophesy all these words against them, and say to them,
\q 'Yahweh will roar from the heights
\q and he will shout with his voice from his holy dwelling,
\q and he will roar mightily against his fold;
\q and he will shout, like those who tread the grapes
\q against all those who live on the earth.
\q
\v 31 The sound of battle will resound to the ends of the earth,
\q for Yahweh brings charges against the nations,
\q and he brings judgment on all flesh.
\q He will hand over the wicked ones to the sword—this is Yahweh's declaration.'
</usfm>

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Yahweh will roar** - Jeremiah speaks of Yahweh shouting very loudly as if he were roaring like a lion. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **from the heights** - This phrase is a metonym for heaven. AT: "from heaven" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **he will roar mightily against his fold** - Jeremiah speaks of Yahweh as if he were a lion and his people were a flock of sheep. The people will be helpless when Yahweh comes to punish them, as sheep are helpless when a lion attacks. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **those who tread the grapes** - This refers to people who crush grapes in a winepress with their feet in order to make wine.
  * **to the ends of the earth** - This is an idiom that means the farthest places on the earth. By referencing both ends, it refers to everywhere in between. AT: "to the farthest places on the earth" or "to everywhere on earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **on all flesh** - Here the word "flesh" represents humanity. AT: "on all mankind" or "on all people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **He will hand over the wicked ones to the sword** - Here the word "sword" represents war. Jeremiah speaks of Yahweh causing people to die in battle as if he were placing those people under the sword's power. AT: "He will cause wicked people to die in battle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
