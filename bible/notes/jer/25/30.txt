\q2 and \add it will sound like\add* the roar of a lion.
\q1 He will shout like \f + \ft simile \f* people shout when they are treading on grapes \add to make juice for wine\add*;
\q2 he will shout to everyone on the earth.
\q1
\v 31 Even people in very remote places around the earth will hear him shouting,
\q2 because he will say why he will judge and punish all the nations.

\p
\v 30 So you yourself, Jeremiah, must prophesy to them all these words. You must say to them,
\q 'Yahweh roars from the heights and raises his voice from his hidden dwelling.
\q He roars against his dwelling place; he shouts against all the inhabitants of the land, as people sing when they are treading on grapes.
\q
\v 31 A noise comes to the ends of the land, for a dispute from Yahweh is going to bring a lawsuit against the nations.
He will administer justice to all flesh. He will hand over the wicked ones to the swordx97this is Yahweh's declaration.'
