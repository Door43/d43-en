\q2 and \add it will sound like\add* the roar of a lion.
\q1 He will shout like \f + \ft simile \f* people shout when they are treading on grapes \add to make juice for wine\add*;
\q2 he will shout to everyone on the earth.
\q1
\v 31 Even people in very remote places around the earth will hear him shouting,
\q2 because he will say why he will judge and punish all the nations.
\q1 He will cause the wicked people to be slaughtered with swords.
\q2 \add That will surely happen because\add* Yahweh has said it.'

\v 30 So you yourself prophesy unto them all these words, and say to them,
\q Yahweh roars from the heights and gives his voice from his hidden sanctuary!
\q He roars against his settlement; he shouts against all the inhabitants of the land like those who tread on grapes sing!
\q
\v 31 A noise comes to the ends of the land, for a dispute from Yahweh goes against the nations!
He will administer justice to all flesh! He will give the wicked ones to the sword!—this is Yahweh’s declaration.
