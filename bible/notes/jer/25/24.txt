\v 24 In the vision I also went to other places in Arabia and to the kings of tribes in the desert
\v 25 and to the kings of the Zimri, Elam, and Media people groups,
\v 26 and to kings in countries to the north that are near to Israel and to countries that are far from Israel, one after the other—I went to all the kingdoms in the world and finished by giving some wine to the king of Sheshach.

\v 24 These people also had to drink it: all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of people of mixed heritage who live in the wilderness;
\v 25 all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes;
\v 26 all the kings of the north, the ones close by and the ones far away—everyone with his brother and all the kingdoms of the world that are on the surface of the earth. Finally the king of Babylon will drink after them all.”
