\v 24 In the vision other places in Arabia and the kings of tribes in the desert
\v 25 and the kings of the Zimri, Elam, and Media people groups,
\v 26 and kings in countries to the north that are near to Israel and to countries that are far from Israel, one after the other—all the kingdoms in the world had to drink, and finally the king of Babylon had to drink some of the wine.

\v 24 These people also had to drink it: All the kings of Arabia and all the kings of people of mixed heritage who live in the wilderness;
\v 25 all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes;
\v 26 all the kings of the north, the ones close by and the ones far away—everyone with his brother and all the kingdoms of the world that are on the surface of the earth. Finally the king of Babylon will drink after them all.
