\v 7 And Yahweh says, 'But you would not pay attention to the messages that I \add gave to those prophets\add*. You caused me to become extremely angry by your worshiping idols that you had made with your own hands. That resulted in my punishing you.

\v 8 So now, I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, say that because you have not paid attention to what I said,
\v 9 I will gather all \add the armies of\add* the nations that will come from the northeast. I have appointed King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon to lead them. I have appointed him to do my work for me.

\v 7 But you have not listened to me—this is Yahweh's declaration—so you have provoked me with the work of your hands to do harm to you.
\v 8 So Yahweh of hosts says this, 'Because you did not listen to my words,
\v 9 see, I am about to send out a command to gather all the peoples of the north—this is Yahweh's declaration—with Nebuchadnezzar my servant, king of Babylon, and bring them against this land and its inhabitants, and against all the nations around you. For I will set them apart for destruction. I will turn them into a horror, an object for hissing, and an unending desolation.
