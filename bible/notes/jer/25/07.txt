\v 7 But you have not listened to me—this is Yahweh’s declaration—so to provoke me with the work of your heandsto do harm to you!
\v 8 Therefore, thus says Yahweh of Hosts: Because you did not listen to my words,
\v 9 behold! I will send forth and take all the families of the north—this is Yahweh’s declaration—for Nebuchadnezzar my servant, the king of Babylon, and bring them against this land and its inhabitants, and against all of these surrounding nations. For I will devote them to destruction and make them a horror, a hissing and a perpetual desolation.
