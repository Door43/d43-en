\v 7 But you have not listened to me—this is Yahweh's declaration—so you have provoked me with the work of your hands to do harm to you.
\v 8 So Yahweh of hosts says this, 'Because you did not listen to my words,
\v 9 see, I am about to send out a command to gather all the peoples of the north—this is Yahweh's declaration—with Nebuchadnezzar my servant, king of Babylon, and bring them against this land and its inhabitants, and against all the nations around you. For I will set them apart for destruction. I will turn them into a horror, an object for hissing, and an unending desolation.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **you have provoked me with the work of your hands to do harm to you** - Translate this as you did the similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:25:05|25:6]]. Possible meanings for the phrase "the work of your hands" are 1) it is a reference to the idols that the people have made with their hands. AT: "you have provoked me to harm you because of the idols that you have made with your hands" or 2) It is an idiom that refers to the actions of a person, with the word "hands" being a synecdoche that represents the person who does those actions. AT: "you have provoked me to harm you because of the things that you do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **to do harm to you** - "so that I do harm to you"
  * **Yahweh of hosts says this** - Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:06:06|6:6]].
  * **see** - "Indeed." The word "see" here adds emphasis to what follows.
  * **and bring them against this land** - The idiom to "bring ... against this land" means that they will attack the people who live in the land. AT: "bring them to attack this land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])

  * **I will turn them into a horror** - The word "horror" may be translated with a verbal phrase. AT: "I will turn them into something that horrifies people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **an object for hissing** - The word "hissing" refers to a sound that shows strong disapproval and can be translated with a verbal phrase. AT: "an object at which people will hiss" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
