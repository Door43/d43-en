\v 27 Then \add in the vision\add* Yahweh said to me, "Tell them that this is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels the God whom we Israelites \add worship\add*, says: 'Drink from this cup \add some of the wine that represents the punishment that I will give you\add*. Drink a lot of it and become drunk and vomit. You will fall down and not get up again, because I will cause you to be killed in wars \f + \ft metonymy \f* that I will send to you.
\v 28 If any of those to whom you give this wine \f + \ft metonymy \f* refuse to drink it, tell them that the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says that they must drink it.
\v 29 I am starting to bring disaster to my own \f + \ft metonymy \f* city. \add Do you think that\add* you should not be punished \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? No, you will surely be punished \f + \ft litotes \f* because I am sending wars to all the nations on the earth. \add That will surely happen because\add* I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, have said it.'

\v 27 Then you will say to them, “Thus says Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel: Drink and become drunk, then vomit, fall down and do not rise before the sword that I am sending among you.
\v 28 Then it will be that if they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink, then you will say to them, ‘Thus says Yahweh of Hosts: You will certainly drink it!
\v 29 For behold! I will begin by bringing calamity in the city that is called by my name, for should you yourselves be wholly exempt? You will not be exempt, for I am calling a sword upon all the inhabitants of the land!—this is Yahweh of Host’s declaration!’
