\v 27 Then \add in the vision\add* Yahweh said to me, "Tell them that this is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels the God whom we Israelites \add worship\add*, says: 'Drink from this cup \add some of the wine that represents the punishment that I will give you\add*. Drink a lot of it and become drunk and vomit. You will fall down and not get up again, because I will cause you to be killed in wars \f + \ft metonymy \f* that I will send to you.
\v 28 If any of those to whom you give this wine \f + \ft metonymy \f* refuse to drink it, tell them that the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says that they must drink it.
\v 29 I am starting to bring disaster to my own \f + \ft metonymy \f* city. \add Do you think that\add* you should not be punished \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? No, you will surely be punished \f + \ft litotes \f* because I am sending wars to all the nations on the earth. \add That will surely happen because\add* I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, have said it.'

\v 29 I am starting to bring disaster to my own people. They will not be exempt from punishment, for I am sending wars to all the nations on the earth. That will surely happen because I, Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies, have said it.'

\v 27 Yahweh said to me, "Now you must say to them, 'Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: Drink and become drunk, then vomit, fall down, and do not rise before the sword that I am sending among you.'
\v 28 Then it will happen that if they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink, you will say to them, 'Yahweh of hosts says this: You must certainly drink it.
\v 29 For see, I am about to bring disaster on the city that is called by my name, and should you yourselves be free from punishment? You will not be free, for I am calling a sword against all the inhabitants of the land!—this is the declaration of Yahweh of hosts.'

===== Translation Notes: =====

The vision that God gave to the prophet Jeremiah continues.

  * **Drink and become drunk, then vomit, fall down, and do not rise before the sword that I am sending among you.** - This shows the inevitability of the coming punishment and the futility of trying to avoid it. 
  * **the cup from your hand to drink** - AT: "their punishment"
  * **"You must certainly drink it** - This is not a cup that nations can refuse to drink. Nations can not refuse God's Judgments of war and natural disasters.
  * **drink it** - AT: be punished" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the city that is called by my name** - AT: "the people of Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **should you yourselves be free from punishment? **- AT: "you are to be punished." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **I am calling a sword against all the inhabitants of the land** - AT: "I am punishing those who live in the land"
