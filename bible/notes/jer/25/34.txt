\q
\v 34 Wail, shepherds, and shout for help! 
\q Roll about on the ground, 
\q you majestic people in the flock.
\q For your day to be slaughtered and scattered has come. 
\q You will fall like chosen rams.
\q
\v 35 Refuge for the shepherds is gone. There is no escape for the majestic ones in the flock.
\q 
\v 36 There are the distressed cries of the shepherds and the wails of the majestic ones in the flock,
\q for Yahweh is devastating their pastures.
