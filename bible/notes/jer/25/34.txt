<usfm>
\v 34 You evil leaders, they call out for someone to help them!
\q2 You who were the leaders of my people, fell down and and they rolled in the dust.
\q1 Now is time for you to be slaughtered!
\q2 You will fall down and be shattered like a fragile vase shatters when it falls to the ground.
\q1
\v 35 Those who should have taken care of my people will not find any place to hide;
\q2 there will be no place for the leaders of my people to find safety.
\q1
\v 36 Your who take care of my people now crying out for help, and and those who were the leaders of my people they cry and beg for help—
\q2 while I, Yahweh, am destroying your nation.

<usfm>
\q
\v 34 Wail, shepherds, and shout for help!
\q Roll about in the dust,
\q you leaders of the flock,
\q for the days of your slaughter have come;
\q you will be scattered when you fall like fine pottery.
\q
\v 35 There is no refuge for the shepherds, there will be no escape for the leaders of the flock.
\q
\v 36 Hear the cries of the shepherds and the wails of the leaders of the flock,
\q for Yahweh is destroying their pastures.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **shepherds** - Yahweh speaks of the leaders of Israel as if they were shepherds who are responsible for protecting and caring for the people, who, implicitly, are spoken of as if they are the sheep. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Roll about in the dust** - This is a sign of sorrow, mourning or distress. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **you leaders of the flock** - This phrase also refers to the leaders of Israel who are responsible to care for the people, who are spoken of as if they were a flock of sheep. AT: "you leaders of the people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **for the days of your slaughter have come** - Usually it is the sheep that are slaughtered, but here Yahweh says that he will slaughter the shepherds. The word "slaughter" can be translated with a verbal phrase.

  * **Yahweh is destroying their pastures** - Yahweh speaks of the nation in which the leaders think that they live peacefully as if it were the "pastures" in which they care for the sheep (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
