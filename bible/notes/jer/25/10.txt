\v 10 The sounds of joy and celebration—the voices of the bridegroom and bride, the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamps—I will make all these things disappear from these nations.
\v 11 Then all of this land will become a desolation and a horror, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon for seventy years.
