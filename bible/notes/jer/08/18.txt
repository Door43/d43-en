===== Translation Notes: =====

Jeremiah and Yahweh have a conversation about the people of Judah. 

  * **My sorrow has no end** - The word "my" refers to Jeremiah. AT: "I am very sad." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])  
  * **and my heart is sick**  - The word "my" refers to Jeremiah. AT: "I feel sick deep down inside me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **See! The screaming voice of the daughter of my people from a far distant land!**  - Jeremiah is speaking about the people of Judah. Possible meanings are 1) "The people of Judah call out from exile in a far-away land" or 2) "The people of Judah call out from all over the land of Israel." 
  * **daughter of my people** - Israel as a daughter. (See: Metonymy)
  * **Is not Yahweh in Zion** - Jerusalem is referred to as Zion. (See: Metonymy)
  * **Is not Yahweh in Zion? Or is not her king in her?**  - Jeremiah tells what the people of Judah are saying. The two parallel questions show that the people of Judah are wondering why Yahweh is not saving them. AT: "Why does Yahweh not save us if he is the king in Jerusalem?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Why then would they offend me with their carved figures**  - The word "me" refers to Yahweh. AT: "If they want me to save them, then they must not offend me by worshiping their idols." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
