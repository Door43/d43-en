  * **snorting** - a loud sound that a horse makes with its nose
  * **stallions** - adult male horses 
  * **The whole earth shakes** - This is an exaggeration that is a metaphor for the people of Judah trembling with fear. AT: "All the people of the land shake with fear" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
