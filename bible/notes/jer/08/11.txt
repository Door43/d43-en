\q
\v 11 For they treated the fracture of the daughter of my people as if it were a trivial thing.
\q They said, "Peace, Peace," but there was no peace.
\q
\v 12 Were they ashamed when they practiced abominations? They were not ashamed. They had no humility.
So they will fall at the time of their punishment, with those who have already fallen. They will be overthrown, says Yahweh.
\q
\v 13 I will remove them completelyx97this is Yahweh's declarationx97there will be no grapes on the vine, nor will there be figs on the fig trees. For the leaf will wither, and 
what I have given to them will pass away.

===== Translation Notes: =====

These are Yahweh's words about the people of Judah.

  * **For they treated the fracture of the daughter of my people...says Yahweh**  - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:jer:06:13|6:14-15]].
  * **the leaf will wither**  - "the leaf will dry up"
  * **and what I have given to them will pass away**  - The meaning of the hebrew is uncertain. Possible meanings are 1) "I gave instructions to my people, but my people disobeyed the instructions" or 2) "therefore, I have given these people over to their enemies, so their enemies can trample over them."
