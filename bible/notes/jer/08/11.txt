====== Jeremiah 08:11-13 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 \add They act as though the sins of my people\add* are not serious,
\q2 like \f + \ft metaphor \f* wounds that do not need to be cleaned and bandaged.
\q1 They tell the people that everything will go well with them,
\q2 \add but that is not true\add*; things will not go well with them.
\q1
\v 12 They should be \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* ashamed when they do disgusting things \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*,
\q2 but they do not even know how to show on their faces that they are ashamed \add about their sins\add*.
\q1 So, \add they will be killed, and\add* their corpses also will lie among the corpses of others who have been slaughtered \add by their enemies\add*.
\q2 They will be killed when I punish them.
\q1
\v 13 I will \add allow their enemies to\add* take away the figs and grapes that the people would have harvested from their fields.
\q2 Their fruit trees will all wither.
\q1 They will not receive all the blessings that I prepared for them.
\q2 \add This will certainly happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it.'~"

\v 11 They act as though the sins of my people are like small wounds that they can easily treat.
\q They tell the people that everything will go well with them, but that is not true; things will not go well with them.
\q
\v 12 They should be ashamed when they do disgusting things, but they do not even know how to show on their faces that they are ashamed about their sins.
\q So, they also will be among those who will be killed. They will be destroyed when I punish them.
\q
\v 13 I will allow their enemies to take away the figs and grapes that the people would have harvested from their fields. Their fruit trees will all wither.
\q They will not receive all the blessings that I prepared for them. This will certainly happen because I, Yahweh, have said it.'"

<usfm>
\q
\v 11 They healed the wounds of my people lightly, 
\q saying, "Peace, Peace," when there was no peace.
\q
\v 12 Were they ashamed when they practiced abominations? They were not ashamed; they did not know how to blush! So they will fall among the fallen; they will be brought down when they are punished, says Yahweh.
\q
\v 13 I will remove them completely—this is Yahweh's declaration—there will be no grapes on the vine, nor will there be figs on the fig trees. For the leaf will wither, and
what I have given to them will pass away.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues giving Jeremiah his message to the people of Judah.
  * **General Information:** - The words "they," "their" and "them" in these verses refer to the people of Judah.

  * **They healed the wounds of my people lightly** - Possible meanings are 1) the wounds represent the problems the people have as a result of their sin. AT: "They act as though my people's problems are not serious, like small wounds" or 2) the wounds represent the people's sin. AT: "They act as though my people's sins are not serious, like small wounds" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **They healed the wounds ... lightly** - Here "lightly" represents treating the wounds as if they were not serious, as if they were not difficult. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **"Peace, Peace," when there was no peace** - "'All is well, All is well,' but it was not well"
  * **Were they ashamed when they practiced abominations?** - God uses this question to show his anger that the people were not ashamed of their sins. AT: "They committed terrible sins, and they were not ashamed." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **they did not know how to blush** - "their faces did not even turn red." When a person is ashamed, his face normally turns red. 
  * **they will fall among the fallen** - Here "fall" represents being killed. AT: "they will be killed along with the others who are killed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **they will be brought down when they are punished** - Here "will be brought down" represents being destroyed. This can be stated in active form. AT: "I will destroy them when I punish them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **the leaf will wither** - "the leaf will dry up"
  * **what I have given to them will pass away** - The meaning of the original text is uncertain here.
