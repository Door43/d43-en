\v 11 \add They act as though the sins of my people\add* are not serious,
\q2 like \f + \ft metaphor \f* wounds that do not need to be cleaned and bandaged.
\q1 They tell the people that everything will go well with them,
\q2 \add but that is not true\add*; things will not go well with them.
\q1
\v 12 They should be \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* ashamed when they do disgusting things \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*,
\q2 but they do not even know how to show on their faces that they are ashamed \add about their sins\add*.
\q1 So, \add they will be killed, and\add* their corpses also will lie among the corpses of others who have been slaughtered \add by their enemies\add*.
\q2 They will be killed when I punish them.
\q1
\v 13 I will \add allow their enemies to\add* take away the figs and grapes that the people would have harvested from their fields.

\v 11 And they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.
\v 12 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush:
therefore shall they fall among them that fall; in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, says Jehovah.
\v 13 I will utterly consume them, says Jehovah: there shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig-tree, and the leaf
shall fade; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them.
