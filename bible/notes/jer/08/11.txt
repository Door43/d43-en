<usfm>
\v 11 \add They act as though the sins of my people\add* are not serious,
\q2 like \f + \ft metaphor \f* wounds that do not need to be cleaned and bandaged.
\q1 They tell the people that everything will go well with them,
\q2 \add but that is not true\add*; things will not go well with them.
\q1
\v 12 They should be \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* ashamed when they do disgusting things \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*,
\q2 but they do not even know how to show on their faces that they are ashamed \add about their sins\add*.
\q1 So, \add they will be killed, and\add* their corpses also will lie among the corpses of others who have been slaughtered \add by their enemies\add*.
\q2 They will be killed when I punish them.
\q1
\v 13 I will \add allow their enemies to\add* take away the figs and grapes that the people would have harvested from their fields.
\q2 Their fruit trees will all wither.
\q1 They will not receive all the blessings that I prepared for them.
\q2 \add This will certainly happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it.'~"

\v 11 They act as though the sins of my people are not serious, like wounds that do not need to be cleaned and bandaged.
\q They tell the people that everything will go well with them, but that is not true; things will not go well with them.
\q
\v 12 They should be ashamed when they do disgusting things, but they do not even know how to show on their faces that they are ashamed about their sins.
\q So, they will be killed, and their corpses also will lie among the corpses of others who have been slaughtered by their enemies. They will be killed when I punish them.
\q
\v 13 I will allow their enemies to take away the figs and grapes that the people would have harvested from their fields. Their fruit trees will all wither.

<usfm>
\q
\v 11 For they treated the fracture of the daughter of my people as if it were a trivial thing.
\q They said, "Peace, Peace," but there was no peace.
\q
\v 12 Were they ashamed when they practiced abominations? They were not ashamed. They had no humility.
So they will fall at the time of their punishment, with those who have already fallen. They will be overthrown, says Yahweh.
\q
\v 13 I will remove them completely—this is Yahweh's declaration—there will be no grapes on the vine, nor will there be figs on the fig trees. For the leaf will wither, and
what I have given to them will pass away.
