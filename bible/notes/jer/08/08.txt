\q2 because they sinned by rejecting what I told them.
\q1 Truly, they were not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* very wise to do that!
\q1
\v 10 So, I will give their wives to other men;
\q2 I will give their fields to \add the enemy soldiers\add* who conquer them.
\q1 All the people, including those who are important and those who are not important, deceive others in order to obtain their possessions.

<usfm>
\q
\v 8 Why do you say, “We are wise! And the law of Yahweh is with us”?
\q Indeed, see! The deceitful pen of the scribes has created deceit.
\q
\v 9 The wise men will be ashamed. They are dismayed and trapped.
\q See! They reject Yahweh's word, so what use is their wisdom?
\q
\v 10 So I will give their wives to others, and their fields to those who will possess them,
\q for from the youngest to the greatest, all of them are exceedingly greedy! From the prophet to the priest, all of them practice deceit.

===== Translation Notes: =====

These are Yahweh's words about the people of Judah.

    * **Why do you say, “We are wise! And the law of Yahweh is with us”?** - "Why do you say, we are wise! And we have the law of Yahweh?" AT: "You should not say that you are wise and that you have the law of Yahweh." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
    * **Why do you say**  - The "you" here refers to the people of Judah. 
    * **The deceitful pen of the scribes has created deceit**  - The pen represents the words that the scribes write. AT: "The false things that the scribes have been writing have given you false ideas about the law of Yahweh." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **The wise men will be ashamed**  - "These men who think they are wise will feel ashamed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
    * **They are dismayed and trapped**  - "Enemies will defeat them and take them away" 
    * **so what use is their wisdom?**  - AT: "so their so called wisdom does not do them any good." 
    * **those who will possess them**  - "the people who will take control of their land"
    * **for from the youngest...all of them practice deceit**  - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:jer:06:13|6:13]].
