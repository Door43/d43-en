<usfm>
\v 8 Your men who teach you \add the laws that Moses wrote\add* have been saying false things \add about those laws\add*.
\q2 So, why \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* do they continue saying, "We are very wise because we have the laws of Yahweh"?
\q1
\v 9 Those teachers, who think that \f + \ft irony \f* they are wise, will be ashamed\f + \ft Or: disgraced \f* and dismayed when they are taken \add to other countries by their enemies\add*
\q2 because they sinned by rejecting what I told them.
\q1 Truly, they were not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* very wise to do that!
\q1
\v 10 So, I will give their wives to other men;
\q2 I will give their fields to \add the enemy soldiers\add* who conquer them.
\q1 All the people, including those who are important and those who are not important, deceive others in order to obtain their possessions.
\q2 Even my prophets and my priests do that.

<usfm>
\q
\v 8 Why do you say, "We are wise! And the law of Yahweh is with us"?
\q Indeed, see! The deceitful pen of the scribes has created deceit.
\q
\v 9 The wise men will be ashamed. They are dismayed and trapped.
\q See! They reject Yahweh's word, so what use is their wisdom?
\q
\v 10 So I will give their wives to others, and their fields to those who will possess them,
\q for from the youngest to the greatest, all of them are exceedingly greedy! From the prophet to the priest, all of them practice deceit.
