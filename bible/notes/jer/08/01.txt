\v 1 Yahweh says, "After your enemies have destroyed you, then they will break open the graves of your kings and other officials who lived in Judah, and the graves of your priests and prophets and other people who lived there.
\v 2 They will take out their bones from their graves and dishonor them by scattering them on the ground under the sun and the moon and the stars—those are the gods which my people loved and served and worshiped. No one will gather up their bones and bury them again; they will remain scattered on the ground like dung.
\v 3 And all the people of this wicked nation who are still alive and whom I have exiled to other countries will say, 'We would prefer to die than to continue to stay alive here in these countries.' That will be true because I, Yahweh, have said it."

\c 8
\p
\v 1 At that time—this is Yahweh’s declaration—they will bring out from the graves the bones of the kings of Judah and its officials, the bones of the priests and the prophets, and the bones 
of the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\v 2 Then they will spread them out in the light of the sun and moon and all the stars of the skies—these things that they have followed and served, that they have walked after and sought, 
and that they have worshiped. They will not be gathered or buried. They will be like dung on the surface of the earth.
\v 3 In every remaining place where I have driven them, they will choose death instead of life for all those who are still left over from this evil nation. This is Yahweh of host's declaration.
