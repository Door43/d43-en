\q
\v 14 Why are we sitting here? Come together; let us go to the fortified cities, and we will become silent there in death.
\q For Yahweh our God will silence us. He will make us drink poison, since we have sinned against him.
\q
\v 15 We are hoping for peace, but there will be nothing good.
\q We are hoping for a time of healing, but see, there will be terror.
