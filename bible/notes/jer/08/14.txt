\v 14 Then the people will say, "Why should we wait here in these small towns? We should go to the cities that have high walls around them, but even if we do that we will be killed there,
\q Because Yahweh our God has decided that we must be destroyed; it is as though he has given us a cup of poison to drink, because we sinned against him.
\q
\v 15 We hoped that things would go well for us, but things have not gone well.
\q We hoped that we would recover and be strong again, but only things that terrify us are happening to us.

<usfm>
\q
\v 14 Why are we sitting here? Come together; let us go to the fortified cities, and we will become silent there in death.
\q For Yahweh our God will silence us. He will make us drink poison, since we have sinned against him.
\q
\v 15 We are hoping for peace, but there will be nothing good.
\q We are hoping for a time of healing, but see, there will be terror.
