<usfm>
\v 6 I have listened carefully to what they say, but they do not say what they should say. Not one of them is sorry for having sinned.
\q No one says, "I have done wicked things." They are sinning and doing what they want to;
\q Charging into sinful behavior with the excitement of a horse that is running into a battle.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 6 I have paid attention and heard. They did not declare rightly; there is no man sorrowful for his wickedness.
\q Who says, “What have I done” All of them turn in their course;
\q Like a stallion rushing towards battle!
\q
\v7 The stork in heaven even knows its time; and the turtledove, swift, and crane –
\q They keep the time of their coming; but my people do not know the justice of Yahweh!
</usfm>
