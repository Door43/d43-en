<usfm>
\v 6 I listened and heard, but they spoke not aright: no man repenteth him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every
one turns to his course, as a horse that rusheth headlong in the battle.
\v 7 Yea, the stork in the heavens knows her appointed times; and the turtle-dove and the swallow and the crane observe the
time of their coming; but my people know not the law of Jehovah.
