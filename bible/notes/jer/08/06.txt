<usfm>
\v 6 I have listened carefully to what they say, but they do not say what they should say. Not one of them is sorry for having sinned.
\q No one says, "I have done wicked things." They are sinning and doing what they want to;
\q Charging into sinful behavior with the excitement of a horse that is running into a battle.
\q
\v 7 Even the stork knows when the seasons change,
\q and the dove, the swallow, and the crane understanding the time of their migration! 
\q But my people do not know what I, Yahweh, require them to do.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 6 I paid attention and listened, but they did not speak right; no one was sorry for his wickedness,
\q no one who says, "What have I done?" All of them go where they wish,
\q like a stallion rushing toward battle.
\q
\v 7 Even the stork in heaven knows the right times; and the doves, swifts, and cranes.
\q They go on their migrations at the right time, but my people do not know Yahweh's decrees.
