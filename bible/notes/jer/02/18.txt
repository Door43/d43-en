\v 18 So why are you trying to make an alliance with the rulers of Egypt who live near the Shihor? Why are you trying to make an alliance with  the rulers of Assyria who live near the Euphrates River?
\v 19 It is because you have been very wicked that I will punish you. It is because you have turned away from me that I will condemn you. When I do that, you will realize that bitter and evil things will happen to you because you have forsaken me, Yahweh, your God, and you no longer have an awesome respect for me. That will certainly happen because I, the Lord, Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies in heaven, have said it.

\v 18 So now, why take the road to Egypt and drink the waters of Shihor?
\q Why take the road to Assyria and drink the waters of the Euphrates River?
\q
\v 19 Your wickedness rebukes you, and your faithlessness punishes you. So think about it; understand that it is wicked and bitter
\q for you to abandon me, Yahweh your God, and to dread me no more—this is the declaration of Yahweh the Lord of hosts.
