\v 1 Yahweh gave me another message
\v 2 to proclaim to everyone in Jerusalem. He said that I should tell them this,
\q1 "I, Yahweh, remember in your favor that you followed me and trusted in our covenant long ago.
\q2 You tried to please me like a bride tries to please her husband;
\q1 You loved me,
\q2 and you followed me through the desert.
\q1
\v 3 At that time you Israelites were set apart to me;
\q2 you belonged to me like the first part of the harvests belong to me.
\q1 I promised to punish all those who harmed you, my people,
\q2 and send disasters on them.
\q2 This is the way it will always be since I, Yahweh, said that it would happen."

\q
\v 3 Israel was set apart to Yahweh, the firstfruits of his harvest!
\q All who ate from the firstfruits were held guilty; disaster came upon them—this is Yahweh's declaration.'"
