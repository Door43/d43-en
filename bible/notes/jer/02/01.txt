\v 1 Yahweh gave me another message
\v 2 to proclaim to everyone in Jerusalem. He said that I should tell them this: 
\q "I, Yahweh, remember in your favor that you followed me and trusted in our covenant long ago. You tried to please me like a bride tries to please her husband;
\q You loved me, and you followed me through the desert.
\q
\v 3 At that time you Israelites were set apart to me; you belonged to me like the first part of the harvests belong to me.
\q I promised to punish all those who harmed you, my people, and send disasters on them. This is the way it will always be since I, Yahweh, said that it would happen."

\c 2
\p
\v 1 The word of Yahweh came to me and said,
\q
\v 2 “Go and proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem. Say, ‘Yahweh says this:
\q I have called to mind on your behalf the covenant faithfulness in your youthfulness, your love at the time when we were engaged,
\q when you went after me in the wilderness, the land that was not sown.
\q
\v 3 Israel is holy to Yahweh, the first fruits of the harvest!
\q All who ate from the first fruits were sinning! Evil will come on them—this is Yahweh’s declaration.'"
