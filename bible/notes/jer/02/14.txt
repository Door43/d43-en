\v 14 You Israelite people, you were certainly not slaves when you were born;
\q2 so why were you captured by your enemies?

\v 15 Your enemies roared like lions,
\q2 and they destroyed your land.
\q1 Now your towns have been burned,
\q2 and no one lives in them.
\q1
\v 16 Soldiers from Memphis and Tahpenes, cities in Egypt, have defeated you
\q2 and shaved your heads to show that you are their slaves.
\q1
\v 17 But it is because you abandoned me, Yahweh your God,
\q2 that these disasters have happened to you, since I had been leading your to safety.

<usfm>
\q
\v 14 Is Israel a slave? Was he born in his master's home? So why has he become plunder?
\q
\v 15 Young lions roared against him. They made a lot of noise and made his land a horror.
\q His cities are destroyed without any inhabitants.
\q
\v 16 Also, the people of Memphis and Tahpanhes will shave your skull.

\q
\v 17 Did you not do this to yourselves
\q when you abandoned Yahweh your God, while he was leading you along the way?
