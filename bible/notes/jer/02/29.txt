<usfm>
\q
\v 29 So why will you contend with me? All of you have sinned against me.—this is Yahweh’s declaration.
\q
\v 30 I have struck your children in vain; they would not accept discipline.
\q Your sword has devoured your prophets like a destructive lion!
\q
\v 31 You of this generation! See the word of Yahweh! Have I been a wilderness to Israel?
\q Or a land of deep darkness? Why would my people say, “Let us wander. We will not go to you anymore.”?
