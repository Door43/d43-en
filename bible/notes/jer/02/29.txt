\v 29 You complain that it was wrong for me not to have rescued you, but you have all rebelled against me.
\v 30 I punished some of you, but you did not learn anything from my doing that. Instead you have killed many of the prophets that I sent to you, like  fierce lions kill other animals.
\v 31 You people of Israel, pay attention to what I say. I have certainly  never abandoned you in a desert; I have never left you in a very dark land. So, why do you, my people, say, that you are free from my control and that you will not return to worship me anymore?

\q
\v 29 So why  do you accuse me of doing wrong? All of you have sinned against mex97this is Yahweh's declaration.
\q
\v 30 I have punished your people in vain. They would not accept discipline.
\q Your sword has devoured your prophets like a destructive lion!
\q
\v 31 You who belong to this generation! Pay attention to my word, the word of Yahweh! Have I been a wilderness to Israel?
\q Or a land of deep darkness? Why would my people say, 'Let us wander around, we will not go to you anymore.'?

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **So why  do you accuse me of doing wrong? All of you have sinned against me** - AT: "Israel you claim that I was wrong when I did not rescue you when you called on me,  even though you continue to sin against me." (See:[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
    * **destructive** - capable of causing a very large amount of damage
    * **You who belong to this generation! Pay attention to my word, the word of Yahweh! Have I been a wilderness to Israel? Or a land of deep darkness? Why would my people say, "Let us wander around. We will not go to you anymore"?**  - AT: "House of Judah, you must pay attention to what I say to you.  I never abandoned you in the desert or left you in very dark land. Why do you say, "We can go where we want to go and not worship Yahweh anymore."?" (See:[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **wander** -  move around or go to different places usually without any particular purpose or direction
