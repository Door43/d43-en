\v 31 You people of Israel, pay attention to what I say.
\q1 I have certainly \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* never \add abandoned you\add* in a desert;
\q2 I have never \add left you\add* in a very dark land.

<usfm>
\q
\v 29 So why  do you accuse me of doing wrong? All of you have sinned against me—this is Yahweh’s declaration.
\q
\v 30 I have punished your people in vain. They would not accept discipline.
\q Your sword has devoured your prophets like a destructive lion!
\q
\v 31 You who belong to this generation! Pay attention to my word, the word of Yahweh! Have I been a wilderness to Israel?
\q Or a land of deep darkness? Why would my people say, 'Let us wander around, we will not go to you anymore.'?
</usfm>
