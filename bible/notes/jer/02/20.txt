<usfm>
\v 20 Long ago, you stopped obeying me \f + \ft metaphor \f*, and you would not allow me to lead you \f + \ft metaphor \f*;
\q2 you refused to worship me.
\q1 Instead, you worship idols that are under trees on the top of every hill,
\q2 and your young women have sex with \f + \ft euphemism \f* \add men at those places\add*.
\q1
\v 21 \add It is as though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* you were a grapevine that I planted
\q2 when it was a cutting from a very good vine.
\q1 So now it is disgusting that \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* you have become like a rotten worthless vine.
\q1
\v 22 Your guilt from your sins is like \f + \ft metaphor \f* very bad stains on a cloth,
\q2 and you cannot get rid of those stains even by using very strong soap.
\q1 \add This is true because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it.

<usfm>
\q
\v 20 For I have broken your yoke from ancient days; I tore your fetters yet you said,
\q “I will not serve!” since you bowed down on every high hill and beneath every leafy tree, promiscuous one.
\q
\v 21 But I myself planted you as a choice vine, a completely true seed.
\q Yet how you have changed towards me, a disloyal one from a foreign vine!
\q
\v 22 For even if you clean yourself in the river or wash with powerful soap,
\q Your iniquity is a stain before me!—This is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.
