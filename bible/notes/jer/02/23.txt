\q2 You are like desperate female camels, running here and there \add to find male camels to have sex with\add*.
\q1
\v 24 You are like wild female donkeys in the desert.
\q2 They sniff the air to find where the male donkeys are,
\q2 and no one can \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* restrain them.
\q1 The male donkeys that want them do not become tired searching for them,
\q2 because at mating time they find them easily.
\q1
\v 25 You constantly run here and there \add to find idols to worship\add*, with the result that your sandals are worn out,
\q2 and your throats have become dry.
\q1 \add I told you to stop doing that\add*

\v 23 You say that you have not sinned.
\q1 You claim to be acceptable to God
\q2 and that you have not worshiped the images of Baal.
\q1 But think about the disgusting things that you do very eagerly in Hinnom Valley outside Jerusalem.
\q2 You are like desperate female camels, running here and there to find male camels to sleep with.
\q1
\v 24 You are like wild female donkeys in the desert.
\q2 They sniff the air to find where the male donkeys are,
\q2 and no one can restrain them.
\q1 The male donkeys that want them do not tire themselves out searching for them,
\q2 because at mating time they find them easily.
\q1
\v 25 You constantly run here and there to find idols to worship, with the result that your sandals are worn out,
\q2 and your throats have become dry.
\q1 I told you to stop doing that but you said that you could not stop,
\q2 and you said that you loved those foreign gods
\q2 and had to worship them!

\q
\v 23 How can you say, 'I am not defiled! I have not walked after the Baals'?
\q Look at what you did in the valleys! Consider what you have done—you are a swift female camel running here and there,
\q
\v 24 a wild donkey accustomed to the wilderness, in her heat sniffing the wind!
\q Who can restrain her lust? None of the males need wear themselves out pursuing her; at mating time they will find her. 
\q
\v 25 You must restrain your feet from becoming bare and your throat from being thirsty!
\q But you have said, 'It is hopeless! No, I love strangers and go after them!'
