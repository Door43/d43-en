\q
\v 23 "How can you say, ‘I am not defiled! I have not walked after the Baals?’
\q Look at your behavior in the valleys! Understand what you have done, you swift camel running its own way!
\q
\v 24 You are a wild donkey, accustomed to the wilderness, longing for life and panting after the useless wind!
\q Who turns her around when she is in heat? Anyone seeking her does not tire himself. They go out to her in her month of heat.
\q
\v 25 You must restrain your feet from becoming bare and your throat from being thirsty!
\q But you have said, “It is hopeless! No, I love strangers and go after them!”
