<usfm>
\v 35 Yet you saidst, I am innocent; surely his anger is turned away from me. Behold, I will enter into judgment with thee,
because you sayest, I have not sinned.
\v 36 Why gaddest you about so much to change your way? you shall be ashamed of Egypt also, as you was ashamed of Assyria.
\v 37 From thence also shall you go forth, with your hands upon your head: for Jehovah has rejected those in whom you
trustest, and you shall not prosper with them.
