===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 35 you say 'We have not done anything that is wrong;
\q2 so surely \add Yahweh\add* is not angry with us.'
\q1 But I will punish \f + \ft metonymy \f* you \add severely\add*
\q2 for saying 'We have not sinned.'
\b
\q1
\v 36 Previously you requested \add the army of\add* Assyria to help you,
\q2 but they were not able to help you.
\q1 Now you have requested \add the army\add* Egypt to help you,
\q2 but they will not be able to help you, either.
\q1
\v 37 They will capture you, and you will be \add their prisoners\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*,
\q2 led to Egypt, \add very ashamed\add* with your hands on your heads.
\q1 That will happen because I, Yahweh, have rejected those nations that you are relying on,
\q2 and they will not be able to help you at all."

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 35 Yet you say 'We have not done anything that is wrong; so surely Yahweh is not angry with us.'
\q But I will punish  you severely for saying 'We have not sinned.'
\q
\v 36 Previously you requested the army of Assyria to help you, but they were not able to help you.
\q1 Now you have requested the army of Egypt to help you, but they will not be able to help you, either.
\q1
\v 37 They will capture you, and you will be their prisoners, led to Egypt, very ashamed with your hands on your heads.
\q That will happen because I, Yahweh, have rejected those nations that you are relying on, and they will not be able to help you at all."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 35 Instead, in spite of all these things, you keep saying, 'I am blameless. Surely Yahweh's anger will turn from me.'
\q But look! You will be judged since you say, 'I have not sinned.'"
\q
\v 36 Why do you treat so very lightly this change in your ways?
\q You will also be disappointed by Egypt, just as you were by Assyria.
\q
\v 37 You will also go out from there dejected, with your hands on your head,
\q for Yahweh has rejected the ones whom you trusted, so you will not be helped by them.
</usfm>
