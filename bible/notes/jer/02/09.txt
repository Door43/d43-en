\v 9 So I will still accuse you—this is Yahweh's declaration—and I will accuse your sons' sons.

\v 10 For cross over to the coasts of Kittim and look. Send messengers out to Kedar and find out
\q and see if there has ever before been anything like this.
\q
\v 11 Has a nation exchanged gods, even though they were not gods?
\q But my people have exchanged their glory for what cannot help them.

  * **your sons' sons** - "your future generations"
  * **cross over to the coasts of Kittim** - Kittim was an island west of Israel. Today it is called Cyprus. It represented all the lands far to the west of Israel. AT: "go west across the ocean to Kittim" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])

  * **But my people have exchanged their glory for what cannot help them** - Here God speaks as though he were not speaking directly to his people. AT: "But you, my people, have exchanged me, your glorious God, for what cannot help you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
