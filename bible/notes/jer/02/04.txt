\v 4 So, you descendants of Jacob, all you people of  Israel,
\q
\v 5 listen to what Yahweh says: "What sin did I commit that caused your ancestors to turn far away from me? 
\q They worshiped worthless idols, and they themselves became worthless.
\q
\v 6 They had no need to say, 'Yahweh is no longer able to help us, even though it was he who brought us safely out of Egypt and led us through a desert plain where there were a lot of pits.
\q It was Yahweh who led us where there was no water and where it was very dangerous, through a land where no one lives or even travels. But Yahweh is useless for us now.'
