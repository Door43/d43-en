\v 4 So, you descendants of Jacob, all you people of  Israel,
\q
\v 5 listen to what Yahweh says: "What sin did I commit that caused your ancestors to turn far away from me? 
\q They worshiped worthless idols, and they themselves became worthless.
\q
\v 6 They had no need to say, 'Yahweh is no longer able to help us, even though it was he who brought us safely out of Egypt and led us through a desert plain where there were a lot of pits.
\q It was Yahweh who led us where there was no water and where it was very dangerous, through a land where no one lives or even travels. But Yahweh is useless for us now.'

\q
\v 4 Hear the word of Yahweh, house of Jacob and every family in the house of Israel.

\v 5 Yahweh says this, "What did your fathers find wrong with me, that they went far from following me?
\q That they went after useless idols and became useless themselves?
\q
\v 6 They did not say, 'Where is Yahweh, who brought us up from the land of Egypt?
\q Where is Yahweh, who led us to the wilderness, into the land of the Arabah,

\q a land through which no one passes and where no one lives?'
