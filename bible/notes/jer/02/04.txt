\v 4 Hear the word of Yahweh, house of Jacob and every family of the house of Israel:
\q
\v 5 Thus says Yahweh: What abnormality did your fathers find against me, that they went far from following me?
\q And went after empty idols and became empty themselves?
\q
\v 6 For have they not said, “Where is Yahweh who brought us up from the land of Egypt?
\q Who led us to the wilderness, in the land of the Arabah, 
\q and a pit in a land of drought and deep darkness, 
\q that no one passes through and where no one lives?”
