\q
\v 26 As the shame of a thief when he is found, so will the house of Israel be ashamed!
\q They, their kings, their princes, and their priests and prophets!
\q
\v 27 Who say to the tree, “You are my father!” and to the stone, “You birthed me!”
\q For their back faces against me and not their faces, but in the time of their troubles they will say, “Arise and save us!”
\q
\v 28 Yet where are your gods that you made for yourselves? Let them arise if they will save you in your time of troubles,
\q For the number of your cities are your gods, Judah!
