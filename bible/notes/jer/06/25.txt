\q1 because the enemy soldiers have swords and they are everywhere;

\v 26 So I, Jeremiah, say to you, 
\q "My dear people, put on rough clothes and sit in ashes 
\q to show how much you are grieving.
\q1 Mourn loudly and cry very much,
\q2 as a mother would cry when her only son has died.
\q1 For your enemies are very near,
\q2 and they are going to destroy everything."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jeremiah speaks to the people of Jerusalem. Some versions interpret this as Yahweh speaking to the people of Jerusalem.

  * **for the swords of the enemy and terror are all around** - The phrase "swords of the enemy" represents the enemy with their swords ready to attack. The abstract noun "terror" refers to things that cause people to be frightened and can be translated with an adjective. AT: "For the enemy is everywhere with their swords and everyone else is terrified" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Daughter of my people** - Jeremiah shows Yahweh's love for his people by speaking to them as a daughter. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:04:11|4:11]]. AT: "My people, you who are like a daughter to me" or "My dear people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]).
  * **put on sackcloth and roll in ashes** - People do these things to show that they are extremely sad. AT: "Show how sad you are by wearing sackcloth and rolling in ashes" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **mourn with painful sobs as for an only son** - Jeremiah compares the people's great sadness to the sadness that a mother feels if her only son dies. AT: "mourn with painful sobs as you would if your only son died" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **for the destroyer will suddenly come upon us** - "because the enemy army will suddenly come to attack us"
