\v 13 Everyone is trying to get money by tricking others, from the most important people to the least important people; even the prophets and the priests are trying to deceive people to get money.
\v 14 They act as though the sins of my people are like small wounds that they can easily treat. They continually comfort people by saying 'I hope things are going well with you,' when things are not going well.
\v 15 They should be ashamed about the disgusting things that they do, but they are not ashamed at all. They do not even know how to blush. So, they also will be among those who will be killed. They will be destroyed when I punish them."

\q
\v 13 for from their smallest to their greatest—each of them is greedy for dishonest gain.
\q From the prophet to the priest—each of them acts deceitfully.
\q
\v 14 But they heal the brokenness of my people only lightly, when they say, 'Peace! Peace!' when there is no peace.
\q
\v 15 Were they ashamed when they committed abominations? They were not ashamed at all; they did not experience any humility.
\q So they will fall with those who fall at the time that I punish them. They will be overthrown," says Yahweh.
