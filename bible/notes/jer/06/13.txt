\q
\v 13 For from their smallest to their greatest—each of them is greedy for dishonest gain.
\q From the prophet to the priest—each of them acts deceitfully.
\q
\v 14 But they heal the brokenness of my people only lightly, when they say, ‘Peace! Peace!’ when there is no peace.
\q
\v 15 Were they ashamed when they committed abominations? They were not ashamed at all; they did not experience any humility.
\q So they will fall with those who fall at the time that I punish them. They will be overthrown,” says Yahweh.
