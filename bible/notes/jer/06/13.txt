<usfm>
\v 13 For from the least of them even to the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even
to the priest every one deals falsely.
\v 14 They have healed also the hurt of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.
\v 15 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush:
therefore they shall fall among them that fall; at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, says Jehovah.
