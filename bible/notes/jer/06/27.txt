<usfm>
\v 27 Then Yahweh said to me,
\q "Jeremiah, I have caused you to become like someone who heats metal very hot to completely burn the impurities. You will examine my people's behavior.
\q
\v 28 You will find out that they are very stubborn rebels: they are always slandering others.
\q Their inner beings are as hard as bronze or iron; they all continually deceive others.
\q
\v 29 A metalworker causes the bellows to blow very hard to make the fire very hot to completely burn up the impurities.
\q But just as a fire does not cause all the waste material to run off, it is impossible to separate the righteous people and punish only the wicked people.
\q
\v 30 I, Yahweh, have rejected them; I say that they are like worthless silver."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 27 I have made you, Jeremiah, a refiner of my people, so you will inspect and test their ways.
\q
\v 28 They are all the most stubborn of people, who go about slandering others.
\q All of them are bronze and iron, acting corruptly.
\q 
\v 29 The bellows are scorched by their fire; the lead is consumed in their flame.
\q They keep on refining themselves in vain, for the evil is not removed.
\q
\v 30 They will be called "rejected silver," for Yahweh has rejected them!’”

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh is speaking.
    * **a refiner of my people**  - "a person who will test my people." Yahweh is comparing Jeremiah to a person who test silver to find out how pure it is. The people are like the silver that Jeremiah is testing and their sins are the impurities in the silver. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
    * **will inspect** - "will discover"
    * **their ways** - AT: "the things that they do." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
    * **who go about slandering others** - "and constantly slander other people"
    * **bronze and iron** - Neither of these metals are the silver that Yahweh wants. Silver represents the righteousness that Yahweh desires. AT: "impure and wicked." 


    * **The bellows... the lead... They keep on refining**  - This is another word picture to show how resistant these people are to the change God desires for them.  
    * **rejected silver**  - AT: "discarded metal" or, "spoiled precious metals"
