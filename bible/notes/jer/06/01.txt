\p
\v 1 Flee for safety, you children of Benjamin, out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and raise up a
signal on Beth-haccherem; for evil looks forth from the north, and a great destruction.
\v 2 The comely and delicate one, the daughter of Zion, will I cut off.
\v 3 Shepherds with their flocks shall come to her; they shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed
every one in his place.
