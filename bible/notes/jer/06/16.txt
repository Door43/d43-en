\v 16 This is also what Yahweh said \add to the Israelite people:\add*
\q1 "Stand at the crossroads and look \add at the people who pass by\add*.
\q2 Ask them what was the good behavior \add that their ancestors had\add* long ago.
\q1 \add And when they tell you\add*, behave that way.
\q2 If you do that, you will find rest for your souls.
\q1 But you replied, 'We do not want to do that!'
\q1
\v 17 I sent \add my prophets who were like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* watchmen.
\q2 They said, 'Listen carefully when we blow the trumpets \add to warn you that your enemies are approaching\add*,'
\q2 but you said, 'No, we do not want to listen.'
\q1
\v 18 Therefore, you people in the other nations, listen to this:
\q2 Pay attention to what is going to happen to the \add Israelite people\add*.
\q1
\v 19 Listen, all of you!
\q2 I am going to cause disasters to happen to the Israelite people.
\q2 That is what will happen to them because they have refused to listen to what I told them.
\q2 They have refused to obey my laws.

\q
\v 16 Thus says Yahweh: Stand upon the roads and look! Then ask for the ancient pathways!
\q ‘Where is this good way?’ Then go on it and find a resting place for your soul!
\q But they say, “We will not go!”
\q
\v 17 So I raised up over you watchmen who listen for the sound of the horn!
\q But they said, “We will not listen!”
\q
\v 18 Therefore, nations, hear! And know, gatherings, what is among them!
\q
\v 19 Hear, earth! Behold! I am sending calamity unto this people—the fruit of their intentions;
\q For They did not pay attention to my word or my Law, but they reject it!
