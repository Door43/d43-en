<usfm>
\q
\v 6 For Yahweh of hosts says this: Cut her trees, and heap up siegeworks against Jerusalem.
\q This is the right city to attack, because it is filled with oppression.
\q
\v 7 Just as a well keeps giving water, so this city keeps producing wickedness.
\q Violence and disorder are heard in her. Suffering and plague are continually before me.
\q
\v 8 Accept discipline, Jerusalem, or else I will turn away from you
\q and make you into a ruin, an uninhabited land.'"
