<usfm>
\v 20 To what purpose comes there to me frankincense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings
are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices pleasing to me.
\v 21 Therefore thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will lay stumbling blocks before this people; and the fathers and the sons
together shall stumble against them; the neighbor and his friend shall perish.
\v 22 Thus says Jehovah, Behold, a people comes from the north country; and a great nation shall be stirred up from the
uttermost parts of the earth.
