\q1 \add Their soldiers will seize the possessions of\add* those who remain in Israel \add after the others have been exiled\add*
\q2 like \f + \ft simile \f* farmers go to the vines again to pick any grapes \add that were left\f + \ft Or: not picked \f*\add*."
\b
\q1
\v 10 \add Then I said, "If I speak to the Israelite people\add* to warn them,
\q2 who will listen to me?\f + \ft Or: No one will listen to me. \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\q1 \add It is as though\add* their ears are closed,
\q2 and as a result they cannot hear \add what I say\add*.
\q1 They scorn Yahweh's messages;
\q2 they do not want to listen to them at all.

\q 
\v 9 Yahweh of hosts says this, "They will certainly glean those who are left in Israel like a vineyard.
\q  Reach out again with your hand to pick grapes from the vines.
\q
\v 10 To whom should I declare and warn so they will listen? 
\q Look! Their ears are uncircumcised; they are not able to pay attention! 
\q Look! The word of Yahweh has come to them to correct them, but they do not want it."

  * **To whom should I** - Jeremiah is speaking.
  * **To whom should I declare and warn so they will listen** - Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that none of the people of Israel would listen to him even after they survived the attack of their enemies.
