<usfm>
\v 9 Yahweh, the commander of the armies of angels in heaven, says this:
\q2 "I will tell \add your enemies\add* to cause your country to become as desolate \f + \ft simile \f* as a vineyard from which all the grapes have been completely stripped from the vines.
\q1 \add Their soldiers will seize the possessions of\add* those who remain in Israel \add after the others have been exiled\add*
\q2 like \f + \ft simile \f* farmers go to the vines again to pick any grapes \add that were left\f + \ft Or: not picked \f*\add*."
\b
\q1
\v 10 \add Then I said, "If I speak to the Israelite people\add* to warn them,
\q2 who will listen to me?\f + \ft Or: No one will listen to me. \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\q1 \add It is as though\add* their ears are closed,
\q2 and as a result they cannot hear \add what I say\add*.
\q1 They scorn Yahweh's messages;
\q2 they do not want to listen to them at all.

\q1
\v 10 Who can I, Jeremiah, speak to? Who would listen to me, even if I spoke to them? 
\q2 The ears of the Israelite people are unable to hear what I have to tell them.
\q1 See! the message Yahweh gave me to tell them is offensive to them. 
\q2 When they hear the message of Yahweh, they hate what I tell them!"

\q
\v 9 Yahweh of hosts says this, "They will certainly glean those who are left in Israel like a vineyard.
\q Reach out again with your hand to pick grapes from the vines.
\q
\v 10 To whom should I declare and warn so they will listen?
\q Look! Their ears are uncircumcised; they are not able to pay attention!
\q Look! The word of Yahweh has come to them to correct them, but they do not want it."
