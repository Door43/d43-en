\v 11 After hearing this I became very angry,
\q2 as Yahweh is angry, and I could not hold myself back any longer.

\q1 So Yahweh said to me,
\q2 "Tell the children in the streets and the young men who gather together.
\q1 Tell the men and their wives;
\q2 tell the very old people, also.
\q1
\v 12 Tell the men that I will give their houses to their enemies,
\q2 and I will give their property and their wives to them, also,
\q1 when I punish the people who live in this land!

<usfm>
\q
\v 11 But I am filled with Yahweh's fury. I am tired of holding it in. He said, to me, "Pour it out on the children in the streets
\q and on the groups of young men. For every man will be taken away with his wife;
\q and every old person heavy with years.
\q
\v 12 Their houses will be turned over to others, both their fields and their wives together.
\q For I will attack the inhabitants of the land with my hand—this is Yahweh's declaration.
