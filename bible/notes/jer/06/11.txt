\v 11 After hearing this I became very angry,
\q2 as Yahweh is angry, and I could not hold myself back any longer.
\q1 So Yahweh said to me,
\q2 "Tell the children in the streets and the young men who gather together.
\q1 Tell the men and their wives;
\q2 tell the very old people, also.
\q1
\v 12 Tell the men that I will give their houses to their enemies,
\q2 and I will give their property and their wives to them, also,
\q1 when I punish the people who live in this land!


\q1

<usfm>
\q
\v 11 But I am filled with Yahweh's fury. I am tired of holding it in. He said, to me, "Pour it out on the children in the streets
\q and on the groups of young men. For every man will be taken away with his wife;
\q and every old person heavy with years.
\q
\v 12 Their houses will be turned over to others, both their fields and their wives together.
\q For I will attack the inhabitants of the land with my hand—this is Yahweh's declaration.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But I am filled with Yahweh's fury** - Jeremiah is speaking. He feels the same anger that Yahweh feels, and he speaks of being extremely angry as if he were filled with anger.  AT: "I am completely angry as Yahweh is" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **I am tired of holding it in** - Jeremiah speaks of not showing Yahweh's anger as if he were holding the anger inside himself. AT: "I am tired from not expressing this anger" or "I am tired of not doing anything about this anger" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Pour it out on the children in the streets and on the groups of young men** - God speaks of punishing the people of Israel as if his anger were a liquid that he wanted Jeremiah to pour out on them.  AT: "In anger punish the children in the streets and the groups of young men" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For every man will be taken away with his wife** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Because enemies will capture every man with his wife" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **and every old person heavy with years** - The words "will be taken" are understood from the previous phrase. AT: "and every old person heavy with years will be taken" or "and they will take every old person heavy with years" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **every old person heavy with years** - The phrase "heavy with years" is an idiom that means "very old." It reinforces the phrase "old person." AT: "every very old person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Their houses will be turned over to others** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Their houses will become the possession of other people" or "There people will take their houses" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **both their fields and their wives together** - The phrase "will be turned over to others" is understood from the previous phrase. AT: "and their their fields and their women will also be turned over to others" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **For I will attack the inhabitants of the land with my hand** - Here "my hand" represents Yahweh's power. Here it shows that when the armies attack Israel, it is because Yahweh caused them to do it. AT: "For by my power I will attack the people living in the land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
