\v 1 This was the word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh after Nebuzaradan, the captain of the king's bodyguard, had sent him away from Ramah. That was where Jeremiah had been taken to, and where he had been bound with chains. He had been among all the exiles of Jerusalem and Judah who were to be exiled to Babylon.
\v 2 The chief guard took Jeremiah and said to him, â€œYahweh your God decreed this disaster against this place.
