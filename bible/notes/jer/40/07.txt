\v 7 The Israelite soldiers \add who had not surrendered to the army of Babylonia\add* were roaming around in the countryside. Then their leaders heard someone say that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah to be the governor of the very poor people who were still in Judah, who had not been taken to Babylon.
\v 8 So they went to talk to Gedaliah at Mizpah. Those who went included Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai from Netophath, and Jezaniah from Maacah, and the soldiers who were with them.

\v 7 Now some commanders of Judean soldiers who were still in the countryside—they and their men—heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, governor over the land. They also heard that he had put him in charge of the men, women, and children who were the poorest people in the land, those who had not been exiled to Babylon.
\v 8 So they went to Gedaliah at Mizpah.  These men were Ishmael, son of Nethaniah; Johanan and Jonathan, sons of Kareah; Seraiah, son of Tanhumeth; the sons of Ephai the Netophathite; and Jaazaniah, son of the Maacathite—they and their men.
