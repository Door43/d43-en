\v 5 Now while he was not yet gone back, Go back then, said
he, to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of
Judah, and dwell with him among the people; or go wherever it seems right to you to go. So the captain of the guard
gave him food and a present, and let him go.
\v 6 Then went Jeremiah to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah, and lived with him among the people that were left in the
land.
