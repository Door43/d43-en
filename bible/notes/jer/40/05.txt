\v 5 He said, "If you decide to stay here, go to Gedaliah. The king of Babylon appointed him to be the governor of Judah. You will be allowed to stay here with the people that he is governing. But you can do whatever you want to."
\p Then Nebuzaradan gave me some food and some money, and he allowed me to go.

\v 6 I returned to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and I stayed in Judah with the people who still remained in the land.

\v 5 When Jeremiah did not reply, Nebuzaradan said, "Go to Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has put in charge of the cities of Judah. Stay with him among the people or go wherever it is good in your eyes to go." The commander of the king's bodyguards  gave him food and a gift, and then sent him away.
\v 6 So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, at Mizpah. He stayed with him among the people who were left behind in the land.
