\v 15 Later Johanan talked with Gedaliah privately. He said, "Allow me to go and murder Ishmael secretly. It would not be good \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* to allow him to come and murder you!

\v 15 So Jonathan son of Kareah spoke privately to Gedaliah in Mitzpah and said, “Allow me to go kill Ishamael te son of Nethaniah. No one will suspect me.
