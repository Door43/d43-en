<usfm>
\v 3 And now he has caused it to happen. He has done just what he said that he would do, because you people sinned against Yahweh and refused to obey him.
\v 4 But today I am going to take the chains off your wrists and release you. If you want to come with me to Babylon, \add that will be fine\add*. I will take care of you. But if you do not want to come with me, do not come. \add Stay here\add*. Look, the entire country is available; you can choose whatever part you want to go to. You can go wherever you wish." \add Then he took the chains off my wrists\add*.

\v 3 So Yahweh brought it about. He did just as he had decreed, since you people sinned against him and did not obey his voice. That is why this thing has happened to you people.
\v 4 But now look! I have released you today from the chains that were on your hands. If it is good in your eyes to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will take care of you. But if it is not good in your eyes to come with me to Bablyon, then do not do so. Look at all the land before you. Go where it is good and right in your eyes to go."
