===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **scatter to every wind**  - "go in all different directions" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Then I will scatter to every wind those who cut the corners of their hair** - AT: "Then I will send in all different directions those who do not obey my commands" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **No one will live there, no human being will stay there**  - The same idea is expressed in two different ways for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
