\q
\v 32 For their camels will become plunder, and the abundance of their property will become war plunder.

===== translationNotes: =====
  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues telling Nebuchadnezzar to attack the people of Kedar and the kingdom of Hazor.

  * **For their camels will become plunder, and the abundance of their property will become war plunder** - Yahweh is still speaking to Nebuchadnezzar as if he were there listening to him. This can be stated in second person. AT: "For your soldiers will take their camels and all of their property" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **Then I will scatter to every wind** - Here "every wind" represents the nations. AT: "Then I will send to nations in all different directions" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **those who cut the corners of their hair** - This probably refers to people who cut their hair short in order to honor a pagan god. Some modern versions interpret this Hebrew expression as "those who live on the edge of the wilderness." See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:09:25|9:26]].
  * **I will bring disaster on them from every side** - The phrase containing the abstract noun "disaster" can be replaced by the verb "destroy". AT: "I will bring their enemies from every side to destroy them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **a lair of jackals** - "a place where jackals live." Jackals are fierce wild dogs. See how you translated "jackals" in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:09:10|9:11]].
  * **No one will live there; no human being will stay there** - These two lines mean basically the same thing and emphasize that Hazor will be completely uninhabited. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
