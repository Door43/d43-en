\q
\v 7 About Edom, Yahweh of hosts says this, "Is there no longer any wisdom to be found in Teman?
\q Has good advice disappeared from those who have understanding? Has their wisdom become corrupted?
\q
\v 8 Flee! Turn back! Stay in holes in the ground, inhabitants of Dedan.
\q For I am bringing the disaster of Esau on him at the time that I punish him.
