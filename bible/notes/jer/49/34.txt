\p
\v 34 This is the word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet about Elam. This happened at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, and he said,
\v 35 "Yahweh of hosts says this: See, I am about to break the bowmen of Elam, the main part of their power.
\q
\v 36 For I will bring the four winds from the four corners of the heavens,
\q and I will scatter the people of Elam to all of those winds. There is no nation
\q to which those scattered from Elam will not go.

  * **This is the word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah** - This idiom is used to introduce a special message from God. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:14:01|14:1]], and make any changes as needed. AT: "This is the message that Yahweh gave to Jeremiah" or "This is the message that Yahweh spoke to Jeremiah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Yahweh of hosts says this** - Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:06:06|6:6]].
