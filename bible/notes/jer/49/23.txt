\q
\v 23 About Damascus: â€œHamath and Arpad will be ashamed, for they have heard news of disaster.
\q They melt away! They become as troubled as the sea, which cannot stay calm.
\q
\v 24 Damascus has become very weak; it turns away to flee; terror seizes it.
\q Distress seizes it, pain like a woman giving birth.
\q
\v 25 Its people say, "How is the famous city, the city over which I have rejoiced, not yet evacuated?"
