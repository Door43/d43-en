\q
\v 1 About the people of Ammon, Yahweh says this,
\q "Does Israel have no children? Is there no one to inherit anything in Israel?
\q Why does Molech occupy Gad, and his people live in its cities?
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa Molech \fqb , some modern versions have \fqa their king \fqb . \f*
\q
\v 2 So look, the days are coming—this is Yahweh's declaration—when I will sound the signal for battle
\q against Rabbah among the people of Ammon, so it will become a deserted heap and its daughters will light fires.
\q For Israel will possess those who possessed him," says Yahweh.
