\q
\v 37 So I will shatter Elam before their enemies and before those who seek their lives.
\q for I will bring disaster against them, the fury of my wrath—this is Yahweh's declaration—
\q and I will send the sword after them until I have annihilated them.
\q
\v 38 Then I will put my throne in Elam and will destroy its king and leaders from there—this is Yahweh's declaration—
\q
\v 39 and it will happen in later days that I will bring back the fortunes of Elam—this is Yahweh's declaration."
