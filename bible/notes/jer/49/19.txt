===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking about what will happen to Edom.

  * **See**  - AT: "Look, listen, pay attention".
  * **like a lion**  - This is another way of saying that the attack will be fierce and unexpected. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **For who is like me, and who will summon me?**  - Yahweh uses the question to point out the smallness of humans. AT:" No one is like me, no one orders me around". (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **summon**  - "order someone to come"
  * **What shepherd is able to resist me?** - Yahweh uses the question to show no one can defeat him. "Shepherd" here is a metaphor for "king," "ruler." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]],  [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
