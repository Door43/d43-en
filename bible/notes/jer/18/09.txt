  * **plant it** - This phrase compares God's blessing to carefully placing a plant in a garden. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **evil in my eyes** - The eyes of Yahweh refer to Yahweh himself. AT: "things that I consider to be evil" or "evil according to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **not listening to my voice** - AT: "not obeying my commands" or "not paying attention to what I said" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
