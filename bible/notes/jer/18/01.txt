\v 3 So I went to that shop, and I saw the man who makes pots. He was working at the wheel \add that he uses to form pots\add*.
\v 4 But when he finished making one jar, it was not as good as he hoped\f + \ft Or: wanted \f* it to be. So, he took the clay and formed it into another jar, shaping it as he desired to.

\c 18
\p
\v 1 The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh and said,
\v 2 “Arise and go out to the potter’s house, for I will make you hear my word there.”
\v 3 So I went out to the potter’s house, and behold! He was doing his work on the potter’s wheels.
\v 4 But the object that he was making of clay was ruined in the potter’s hand, so he turned and made another vessel by a pattern that seemed good in the eyes of the potter to do.
