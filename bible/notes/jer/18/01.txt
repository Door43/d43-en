====== Jeremiah 18:1-4 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Yahweh gave another message to me. He said,
\v 2 "Go to the shop of the man who makes clay pots. I will give you a message there."
\v 3 So I went to that shop, and I saw the man who makes pots. He was working at the wheel \add that he uses to form pots\add*.
\v 4 But when he finished making one jar, it was not as good as he hoped\f + \ft Or: wanted \f* it to be. So, he took the clay and formed it into another jar, shaping it as he desired to.

\p
\v 1 This is the word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah and said,
\v 2 "Arise and go out to the potter's house, for I will have you hear my word there."
\v 3 So I went out to the potter's house, and behold! The potter was working on the potter's wheel.
\v 4 But the object of clay that he was molding was ruined in his hand, so he changed his mind and made another object that seemed good in his eyes to do.
