===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Ask the nations, who has ever heard of such a thing as this?** - Implicit is that the nations will say that nobody has ever heard something like this. AT: "Nowhere on earth has anyone ever heard of such a thing like this!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **The virgin Israel** - Israel is ironically described as a virgin woman. AT: "Israel, who falsely pretends to be fully devoted to God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **Does the snow in Lebanon ever leave the rocky hills in the fields?** - The implicit answer to this question is "no". AT: "The snow of Lebanon clearly never leaves the rocky hills in the fields" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Do the mountain streams coming from far away ever lose their water?** - The implicit answer to this question is also "no". AT: "The moutain streams coming from far away surely never lose their water" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
