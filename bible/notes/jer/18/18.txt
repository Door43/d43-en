<usfm> \p \v 18 So the people said, “Come, let us make plots against Jeremiah, since the Law will never perish from the priests, or advice from the wise men, or words from the prophets. Come, let us attack him with our words and no longer pay attention to anything he proclaims." \q \v 19 Pay attention to me, Yahweh! And listen to my enemy's noise. \q \v 20 Will disaster from them really be my reward for being good to them? For they have dug a pit for my life. \q Remember how I stood before you to speak for their welfare, to cause your fury to turn away from them. </usfm>
