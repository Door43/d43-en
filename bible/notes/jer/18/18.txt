\p
\v 18 So they said, “Come, let us consider plots against Jeremiah, since the Law will not perish from the priest and counsel from the sage, or a word from the prophet! Come, and 
let us attack him with our words and no longer pay attention to anything he declares!’
\q
\v 19 Pay attention to me, Yahweh! And hear the noise of my adversary!
\q
\v 20 Will calamity be made completed after goodness? For they have dug a gorge for my soul!
\q Remember, I stood before you to declare goodness and to cause your fury to turn away from them!
