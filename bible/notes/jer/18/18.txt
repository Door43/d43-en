\v 18 Then the people said, "Come, we should plan to attack Jeremiah. We have many priests who teach us God's laws, wise men who give us good advice, and prophets who tell us what will happen. We do not need Jeremiah! So we should slander him and not pay attention to anything that he says."
\p
\v 19 Then I prayed, "Yahweh, please listen to me!

\p
\v 18 So the people said, "Come, let us make plots against Jeremiah, since the law will never perish from the priests, or advice from the wise men, or words from the prophets. Come, let us attack him with our words and no longer pay attention to anything he proclaims."
\q
\v 19 Pay attention to me, Yahweh! And listen to my enemy's noise.
\q
\v 20 Will disaster from them really be my reward for being good to them? For they have dug a pit for me.
\q Remember how I stood before you to speak for their welfare, to cause your fury to turn away from them.
