<usfm>
\q
\v 21 Therefore hand over their children to famine, and give them to the hands of those who use the sword.
\q So let their women become bereaved and widows, and their men be killed, and their young men killed by the sword in battle.
\q
\v 22 Let a distressed shout be heard from their houses, as you suddenly bring raiders against them.
\q For they have dug a pit to capture me and have hidden traps for my feet.
\q	
\v 23 But you, Yahweh, you know all of their plans against me to kill me.
\q Do not forgive their iniquities and sins. Do not wipe their sins away from you.
\q Instead, let them be overthrown before you. Act against them in the time of your wrath.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **hand over their children to famine** - The idiom "hand over" means to place a person in the power of another person. Jeremiah speaks of "famine" as if it were a person who could have power over others. AT: "cause their children to die from famine" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **give them to the hands of those who use the sword** - Here the word "hands" represents power. AT: "cause those who use the sword to have power over them" or "cause them to die in battle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **let their women become bereaved and widows** - "let the children and husbands of their women die." The word "bereaved" refers to a woman whose children have all died.
  * **and their men be killed** - The verb may be supplied from the previous phrase. This can be stated in active form. AT: "let people kill their men" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **and their young men killed by the sword in battle** - The verb may be supplied from the previous phrase. This can be stated in active form. AT: "and let people kill their young men with swords in battle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Let a distressed shout be heard** - The phrase "a distressed shout" can be translated with a verbal phrase. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Let people hear a distressed shout" or "Let people hear others shout in distress" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **For they have dug a pit to capture me and have hidden traps for my feet** - These two phrases share similar meanings. Jeremiah speaks of his enemies planning to kill him as if they had dug a pit for him to fall into and set traps in which to capture him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **they have dug a pit** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:18:18|18:20]].
  * **have hidden traps for my feet** - Here the word "feet" represents Jeremiah. AT: "have hidden traps for me" or "have hidden traps for me to step on" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Do not wipe their sins away from you** - Jeremiah speaks of Yahweh forgiving his enemies' sins as if someone had written their sins down and Yahweh would erase them. This phrase means the same thing as the previous phrase. AT: "Do not pardon their sins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **let them be overthrown before you** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "let people overthrow them in your presence" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
