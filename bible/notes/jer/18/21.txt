<usfm>
\q
\v 21 Therefore hand over their children to famine, and give them over to the power of the sword.
\q So let their women become bereaved and widows, and their men be killed, and their young men killed by the sword in battle.
\v 22 Let a distressed shout be heard from their houses, as you suddenly bring raiders against them.
\q For they have dug a pit to capture me and have hidden traps for my feet
\q
\v 23 But Yahweh, you yourself know all of their plans against me to kill me.
\q Do not forgive their iniquities and sins. Do not wipe their sins away from you.
\q Instead, let them be overthrown before you. Act against them in the time of your wrath.

  * **give them over to the power of the sword** - "Sword" represents warfare. AT: "cause them to die in battle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

  * **their men be killed, and their young men killed by the sword** - AT: "people kill their men, and kill their young men with swords" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

Jeremiah repeats the same idea twice for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) 
  * **they have dug a pit** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:jer:18:18|18:20]].
