<usfm>
\v 15 But my people are not \add as reliable as those streams\add*:
\q2 They have abandoned me.
\q1 They burn incense to \add honor\f + \ft Or: worship \f*\add* worthless idols.
\q1 \add It is as though\add* they have stumbled as they walked along very old roads that are good roads,
\q2 and now, instead, they are walking on dirt paths.
\q1
\v 16 Therefore, their land will become desolate,
\q2 and people who see it will hiss \add to ridicule it\add*.
\q1 All the people who pass by will be appalled;
\q2 they will shake their heads \add to show that they are shocked\add*.
\q1
\v 17 I will scatter the people when their enemies \add attack them\add*
\q2 like dust is scattered by an east wind.
\q1 And when they experience all these difficulties\f + \ft Or: disasters \f*,
\q2 I will turn my back on them \add and refuse\add* to help them."

\v 15 But my people are not as reliable as those streams:
\q2 They have abandoned me.
\q1 They burn incense to honor worthless idols.
\q1 It is as though they have stumbled as they walked along well known and reliable roads
\q2 and now, instead, they are walking on dirt paths.
\q1
\v 16 Therefore, their land will become desolate,
\q2 and people who see it will hiss to ridicule it from now on.
\q1 All the people who pass by will be appalled;
\q2 they will shake their heads to show that they are shocked.
\q1
\v 17 I will scatter the people when their enemies attack them
\q2 like dust is scattered by an east wind.
\q1 And when they experience all these disasters,
\q2 I will turn my back on them and refuse to help them."

<usfm>
\q
\v 15 Yet my people have forgotten me. They have made offerings to useless idols and been made to stumble in their paths;
\q they have left the ancient paths to walk lesser paths.
\q
\v 16 Their land will become a horror, an object of everlasting hissing.
\q Everyone who passes by her will shudder and shake his head.
\q
\v 17 I will scatter them before their enemies like an eastern wind. I will show them my back, and not my face, on the day of their disaster.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **been made to stumble in their paths** - Yahweh speaks of a person's lifestyle as if it were a path along which he walks, and of living unfaithfully to him as if the person stumbled along the path. This can be stated in active form. AT: "this caused them to stumble in their paths" or "it is like they stumbled while walking on a path" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **they have left the ancient paths to walk lesser paths** - Yahweh speaks of a person's lifestyle as if it were a path along which he walks. Here, "the ancient paths" represents the way that Yahweh had told their ancestors to live and "lesser paths" represents living unfaithfully to Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **will become a horror** - The word "horror" may be translated with a verbal phrase. AT: "will become something that horrifies people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **an object of everlasting hissing** - The word "hissing" refers to a sound that shows strong disapproval and can be translated with a verbal phrase. AT: "an object at which people will always hiss" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **passes by her** - Here the word "her" refers to "Their land."
  * **I will scatter them before their enemies like an eastern wind** - Yahweh speaks of causing the people to flee before their enemies as if he were an eastern wind that scatters dust and debris. AT: "I will be like an eastern wind and scatter them before their enemies" or "I will scatter them before their enemies like an eastern wind scatters dust and debris" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **will scatter them** - Here the word "them" refers to "my people."
  * **I will show them my back, and not my face** - "I will turn my back toward them, and not my face." Turning one's back towards someone is a symbolic action that represents rejection and turning one's face towards someone is a symbolic action that represents favor. AT: "I will reject them and not act favorably towards them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
