<usfm>
\v 15 But my people are not \add as reliable as those streams\add*:
\q2 They have abandoned me.
\q1 They burn incense to \add honor\f + \ft Or: worship \f*\add* worthless idols.
\q1 \add It is as though\add* they have stumbled as they walked along very old roads that are good roads,
\q2 and now, instead, they are walking on dirt paths.
\q1
\v 16 Therefore, their land will become desolate,
\q2 and people who see it will hiss \add to ridicule it\add*.
\q1 All the people who pass by will be appalled;
\q2 they will shake their heads \add to show that they are shocked\add*.
\q1
\v 17 I will scatter the people when their enemies \add attack them\add*
\q2 like dust is scattered by an east wind.
\q1 And when they experience all these difficulties\f + \ft Or: disasters \f*,
\q2 I will turn my back on them \add and refuse\add* to help them."

\v 15 But my people are not as reliable as those streams:
\q2 They have abandoned me.
\q1 They burn incense to honor worthless idols.
\q1 It is as though they have stumbled as they walked along well known and reliable roads
\q2 and now, instead, they are walking on dirt paths.
\q1
\v 16 Therefore, their land will become desolate,
\q2 and people who see it will hiss to ridicule it from now on.
\q1 All the people who pass by will be appalled;
\q2 they will shake their heads to show that they are shocked.
\q1
\v 17 I will scatter the people when their enemies attack them
\q2 like dust is scattered by an east wind.
\q1 And when they experience all these disasters,
\q2 I will turn my back on them and refuse to help them."

<usfm>
\q
\v 15 Yet my people have forgotten me. They have made offerings to useless idols and been made to stumble in their paths;
\q they have left the ancient paths to walk lesser paths.
\q 
\v 16 Their land will become a horror, an object of everlasting hissing.
\q Everyone who passes by her will shudder and shake his head.
\q
\v 17 I will scatter them before their enemies like an eastern wind. I will show them my back, and not my face, on the day of their disaster.'"
