\v 6 "Perhaps the people of Israel \add think that\add* I cannot do to them like this man who makes pots has done \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. \add But what they think is wrong\add*. I \add can control what happens to them like\add* this man \add controls what he does with the clay\add* in his hands.
\v 7 There may be a time when I proclaim that I will get rid of a nation or kingdom, \add like someone\add* pulls up \add a plant with its roots\add*, and smash it, and destroy it.
\v 8 But if the people of that nation repent of doing evil things, I will not send to them the disasters that I planned to send.

\v 5 Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\v 6 O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? says Jehovah. Behold, as the clay in the potter’s hand, so are you
in my hand, O house of Israel.
\v 7 At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy
it;
\v 8 if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do to
them.
