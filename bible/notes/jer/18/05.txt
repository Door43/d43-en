\v 5 Then Yahweh gave me this message:
\v 6 "Perhaps the people of Israel \add think that\add* I cannot do to them like this man who makes pots has done \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. \add But what they think is wrong\add*. I \add can control what happens to them like\add* this man \add controls what he does with the clay\add* in his hands.
\v 7 There may be a time when I proclaim that I will get rid of a nation or kingdom, \add like someone\add* pulls up \add a plant with its roots\add*, and smash it, and destroy it.
\v 8 But if the people of that nation repent of doing evil things, I will not send to them the disasters that I planned to send.

\v 5 Then the word of Yahweh came to me and said, 
\v 6 “Should I not be able to act like this potter with you, house of Israel?"—this is Yahweh’s declaration. "See! Like clay in a potter's hand—that is how you are in my hand, house of Israel.
\v 7 At one moment, I may proclaim something about a nation or a kingdom, that I will drive it out,  tear it down, or destroy it.
\v 8 But if the nation about which I have made that proclamation turns from its evil, then I may relent from the disaster that I had been planning to bring upon on it.
