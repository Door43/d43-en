<usfm>
\v 5 Then Yahweh gave me this message:
\v 6 "Perhaps the people of Israel \add think that\add* I cannot do to them like this man who makes pots has done \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. \add But what they think is wrong\add*. I \add can control what happens to them like\add* this man \add controls what he does with the clay\add* in his hands.
\v 7 There may be a time when I proclaim that I will get rid of a nation or kingdom, \add like someone\add* pulls up \add a plant with its roots\add*, and smash it, and destroy it.
\v 8 But if the people of that nation repent of doing evil things, I will not send to them the disasters that I planned to send.

\v 5 Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
\v 6 "Should I not be able to act like this potter with you, house of Israel?—this is Yahweh's declaration. Behold! Like clay in a potter's hand—that is how you are in my hand, house of Israel.
\v 7 At one moment, I may proclaim something about a nation or a kingdom, that I will drive it out, tear it down, or destroy it.
\v 8 But if the nation about which I have made that proclamation turns from its evil, then I will relent from the disaster that I was planning to bring upon it.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,** - This idiom is used to introduce a special message from God. See how you translated it in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:04|1:4]]. AT: "Yahweh gave me a message. He said," or "Yahweh spoke this message to me:" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Should I not be able to act like this potter with you, house of Israel?** - With this question, Yahweh emphasizes his authority to do as he pleases with Israel. AT: "I am allowed to act toward you, house of Israel, like the potter acts toward the clay." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **house of Israel** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house. In this case it refers to the kingdom of Israel. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:03:17|3:18]]. AT: "Israel" or "kingdom of Israel" or "people of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **Behold!** - "Indeed!" This alerts the reader to pay attention to what follows.
  * **Like clay in a potter's hand—that is how you are in my hand** - Yahweh compares his being able to remake Israel as he see fit to the way that the potter is able to remake a lump of clay as he sees fit. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **tear it down, or destroy it** - These two expressions basically mean the same thing. In the first expression, Yahweh speaks of destroying a kingdom as if the kingdom were a plant or a building that he tears down. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **relent from** - "withhold" or "not bring"
