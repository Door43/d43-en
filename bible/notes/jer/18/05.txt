\v 5 Then Yahweh gave me this message:
\v 6 "Perhaps the people of Israel \add think that\add* I cannot do to them like this man who makes pots has done \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. \add But what they think is wrong\add*. I \add can control what happens to them like\add* this man \add controls what he does with the clay\add* in his hands.
\v 7 There may be a time when I proclaim that I will get rid of a nation or kingdom, \add like someone\add* pulls up \add a plant with its roots\add*, and smash it, and destroy it.
\v 8 But if the people of that nation repent of doing evil things, I will not send to them the disasters that I planned to send.

\v 5 Then the word of Yahweh came to me and said,
\v 6 "Should I not be able to act like this potter with you, house of Israel?x97this is Yahweh's declaration. See! Like clay in a potter's handx97that is how you are in my hand, house of Israel.
\v 7 At one moment, I may proclaim something about a nation or a kingdom, that I will drive it out,  tear it down, or destroy it.
\v 8 But if the nation about which I have made that proclamation turns from its evil, then I will relent from the disaster that I was planning to bring upon it.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the word of Yahweh came to** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:01|1:2]].
  * **Should I not be able to act like this potter with you, house of Israel?** - With this question, Yahweh emphasizes his authority to do as he pleases with Israel. AT: "I am allowed to act toward you, house of Israel, like the potter acts toward the clay" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]].
  * **See!** - The word "see" here adds emphasis to what follows. AT: "Indeed!"
  * **Like clay in a potter's handx97that is how you are in my hand** - This phrase repeats what was implicit in the previous phrase in the form of a simile. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **I may proclaim something** - AT: "perhaps I proclaim something" or "for example, I proclaim something"
  * **tear it down, or destroy it** - These two expressions basically mean the same thing and are repeated to emphasize how destructive God's judgment will be. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **relent from** - "withhold" AT: "not bring"
