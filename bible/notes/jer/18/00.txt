====== Jeremiah 18 General Notes ======

=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 18:13-17, 19-23, which are extended quotations. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===
== Attacking Jeremiah ==
Things were so bad in Israel, they even attacked Jeremiah. To attack Yahweh's prophet was to attack Yahweh himself. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Simile ==

Like a potter can change what he is making from one type of pot to another, God can change his plans to punish people if they repent. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
