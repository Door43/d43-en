\v 11 Therefore, Jeremiah, go and warn all the people in Jerusalem and in other places in Judah. Say to them, 'This is what Yahweh says: I am planning a disaster that I will send to you. So, each of you should turn from your evil behavior and start doing what is right, in order that good things will come to you instead!'
\p
\v 12 But the people will say back to you, 'It's no use for you to say these things to us. We will continue to be stubborn and behave as wickedly as we want to.'"

<usfm>
\v 11 So now, speak to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and say, ‘Yahweh says this: See, I am about to form disaster against you. I am about to devise a plan against you. 
Repent, each person from his wicked path, so your ways and your practices will bring good to you.'
\v 12 But they will say, ‘This is no use. We will act according to our own plans. Each one of us will do what his evil, stubborn heart desires.’
