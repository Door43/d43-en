<usfm>
\q
\v 3 For the customs of the peoples are worthless. For someone cuts a tree down in a forest;
The hands of a craftsman do this with an axe.
\q
\v 4 Then they decorate it with silver and gold. They strengthen it with hammer and nails so it will not fall over.
\q
\v 5 These idols are like scarecrows in a cucumber field, for they can say nothing. They have to be carried, for they cannot take any steps at all.
\q Do not fear them, for they cannot bring about evil, nor are they able to do anything good.
