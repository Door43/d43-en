<usfm>
\q
\v 3 For the dictums of the peoples are worthless; since one cuts a tree from the thicket,
The hands of an artificer do this with an axe—
\q
\v 4 They decorate it with silver and gold, they fortify it with nail and hammers so it will not totter.
\q
\v 5 They are like a scarecrow in a cucumber field, and they cannot declare; they certainly are lifted up, for they cannot stride forth!
\q Do not fear them, for they cannot cause calamity nor is it in them to do good.
