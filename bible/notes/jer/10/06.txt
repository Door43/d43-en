===== Translation Notes: =====

Jeremiah has just been talking about idol worship.

  * **Who does not fear you, king of the nations?**  - Jeremiah does not expect an answer to this question. AT: "Everyone should fear you, king of the nations" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **what you deserve **- "what you have earned"
