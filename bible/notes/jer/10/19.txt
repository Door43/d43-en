\q
\v 19 Woe is me! Because of my fracture, my wound is infected!
\q So I said, ‘Surely this is agony, but I must lift it up!’
\q
\v 20 My tent is devastated, and all of my cords are sundered!
\q They take my children away from me, so they no longer exist! There is no longer anyone spreading out my tent or raising up my tent curtains.
