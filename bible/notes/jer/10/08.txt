\v 8 But as one, they are brutish and stupid. The discipline of false gods that are a tree.
\q
\v 9 They bring hammered silver from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz made by artificers,
\q the hands of refiners! Their clothes are blue and purple cloth! Their skillful men made all of them.
\q

\q The earth quakes at his anger and the nations cannot endure his indignation!
