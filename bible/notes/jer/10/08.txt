\q
\v 8 They are all the same: they are brutish and stupid, disciples of idols that are nothing but wood.
\q
\v 9 They bring hammered silver from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz made by artificers,
\q the hands of refiners. Their clothes are blue and purple cloth. Their skillful men made all of these things.
\q
\v 10 But Yahweh is the true God. He is the living God and eternal king.
\q The earth quakes at his anger, and the nations cannot endure his anger.
