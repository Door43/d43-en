<usfm>
\q
\v 23 I know, Yahweh, that a man's path does not come from himself. No person walking directs his own steps.
\q
\v 24 Discipline me, Yahweh, with justice, but not in your anger, lest you destroy me.
\q
\v 25 Pour your fury on the nations that do not know you and on the families that do not call on your name.
\q For they have devoured Jacob and consumed him so as to completely destroy him and demolish his habitation.
