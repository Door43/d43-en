<usfm>
\q
\v 23 I know, Yahweh,that a man’s way is not from man, it is not the walking man who directs his steps.
\q
\v 24 Discipline me, Yahweh! Surely with justice, not in your anger, lest you eradicate me!
\q
\v 25 Pour your fury upon the nations that do not know you and on the families that do not call upon your name,
\q For they have devoured Jacob and consumed him so to annihilate him and ravaged his habitation!”
