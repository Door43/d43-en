<usfm>
\q
\v 14 Every man has become ignorant, without knowledge. Every refiner is shamed by his own carved figures.
\q For his cast poured figures are deceitful; there is no spirit in them
\q
\v 15 They are empty, workmanship made by mockers. They will perish at the time that has been fixed for them to do so.
\q
\v 16 But God, the portion of Jacob, is not like these, for he is the molder of all things.
\q Israel is the tribe of his inheritance; Yahweh of hosts is his name.
