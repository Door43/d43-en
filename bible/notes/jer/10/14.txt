\q
\v 14 Every man has become brutish, without knowledge. Every refiner is shamed by the idols,
\q For his graven image is deceitful and there is no spirit in them!
\q
\v 15 They are empty, a workmanship of mockers: they will perish in their appointed time!
\q
\v 16 The portion of Jacob is not like these, for he is the molder of all things, and Israel:
\q The tribe of his inheritance, Yahweh of Hosts is his name!
