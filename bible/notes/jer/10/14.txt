<usfm>
\v 14 Every man is become brutish and is without knowledge; every goldsmith is put to shame by his graven image; for
his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
\v 15 They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
\v 16 The portion of Jacob is not like these; for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance:
Jehovah of hosts is his name.
