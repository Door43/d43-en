\v 4 For if you truly do these things, then kings sitting on David's throne will enter the gates of this house riding in a chariot and on horses, he, his servants, and his people!
\v 5 But if you do not listen to these words from me that I have announced—this is Yahweh's declaration—then this royal house will become a ruin."'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **kings sitting on David's throne** - The metonym "throne" refers to kingly authority like David had. AT: "kings, ruling like David before them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the gates of this house** - This refers to the gates to the courtyard of the palace.
  * **riding in a chariot and on horses** - This phrase is a metonym that describes the kings as powerful and wealthy. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **he, his servants, and his people** - This sentence lists all who will be powerful and wealthy. This can be stated clearly. AT: "he, his servants, and his people will ride into the palace on chariots and horses" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **if you do not listen to** - "if you refuse to pay attention to" (UDB) or "if you do not obey"
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **this royal house** - This phrase here appears to refer specifically to the royal palace.
