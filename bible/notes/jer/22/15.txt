\v 15 Is this what makes you a good king, that you wanted to have boards of cedar?
\q Did not your father also eat and drink, yet do justice and righteousness? Then things went well for him.
\q
\v 16 He judged in favor of the poor and needy. It was good then. Is this not what it means to know me?—this is Yahweh's declaration.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Is this what makes you a good king, that you wanted to have boards of cedar?** - Yahweh asks this rhetorical question to rebuke Jehoiakim for his expensive palace. AT: "Having a cedar palace does not make you a good king." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Did not your father also eat and drink, yet do ... righteousness?** - Yahweh asks this rhetorical question to remind Jehoiakim about the example of his father, King Josiah. AT: "Your father King Josiah enjoyed his life, yet did ... righteousness." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **do justice and righteousness** - These abstract nouns have similar meanings, are repeated for emphasis and can be stated as actions. AT: "act justly and fairly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **It was good then** - "Things went well for him"
  * **Is this not what it means to know me?** - Yahweh asks this rhetorical question to rebuke Jehoiakim for not following the example of his father, King Josiah. AT: "This is what it means to know me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]].
