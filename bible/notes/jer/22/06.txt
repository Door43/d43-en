\v 6 For Yahweh says this concerning the house of the king of Judah,
\q 'You are like Gilead, or like the summit of Lebanon to me. Yet I will turn you into a wilderness,
\q into cities with no inhabitants.
\q
\v 7 For I have designated destroyers to come against you! Men with their weapons
\q will cut off the best of your cedars and let them fall into the fire.
