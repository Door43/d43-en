<usfm>
\q
\v 22 The wind will shepherd away all your shepherds, and your friends will go into captivity.
\q Then you will certainly be ashamed and humiliated by all of your evil deeds.
\q
\v 23 You king, you who live in the House of the Forest of Lebanon, you who nest among the cedars,
\q how you will be pitied when the labor pains of anguish come on you like childbirth."
