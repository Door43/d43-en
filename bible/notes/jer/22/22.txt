\q
\v 22 The wind will shepherd away all your shepherds, and your friends will go into captivity.
\q Then you will certainly be ashamed and humiliated by all of your evil deeds.
\q
\v 23 You king, you who live in the House of the Forest of Lebanon, you who nest among the cedars,
\q how you will be pitied when the labor pains of anguish come on you like childbirth."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The wind will shepherd away all your shepherds** - This is a wordplay—Yahweh uses the idea of "shepherd" in two different ways. Here "shepherds" is a metonym for the leaders of Jerusalem, and the wind "leads" them away. The wind represents Yahweh.  AT: "I will take your leaders away if if the wind had blown them away" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **go into captivity** - "be taken away as captives" or "go into exile"
  * **the House of the Forest of Lebanon, you who nest among the cedars** - Yahweh speaks of the royal palace as "Lebanon" and "cedars" because it was constructed with a lot of cedar. AT: "a palace made from the cedars of Lebanon" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **how you will be pitied** - The meaning of the Hebrew is not clear. Possible meanings are 1) "they will greatly pity you" or 2) "you groan greatly."
  * **when the labor pains of anguish come on you like childbirth** - The pain that the king will feel when he is defeated will be as intense as the pain woman feels in childbirth. AT: "when you experience pain as intense as the pain of a woman in childbirth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
