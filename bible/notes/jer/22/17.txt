\q2 They will not say to each other, 'It is very sad; we are so sorry!'
\q1 The people whom he ruled will not mourn for him, saying,
\q2 'We are sad that our king is dead; we are so sorry that the wonderful things \add that happened while he was king are ended\add*.'
\q1
\v 19 \add When he dies, people will do to\add* his corpse what they do to a dead donkey;

<usfm>
\v 17 But there is nothing in your eyes and heart except worry for your unjust profit and for pouring out innocent blood,
\q for producing oppression and crushing of others.
\v 18 Therefore Yahweh says this about Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah: They will not lament for him with “Woe, my brother!” or “Woe, my sister!” They will not lament him with 
“Woe, lord!” or “Woe, majesty!”
\q
\v 19 He will be buried with an donkey's burial,
\q dragged away and thrown out beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
