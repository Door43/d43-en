\v 1 This is what Yahweh says, “Go down to the house of the king of Judah and proclaim this word there.
\v 2 Say, ‘King of Judah, you who sit on David's throne, listen to the word of Yahweh. And listen, you servants of his, and you, his people who come through these gates.
\v 3 Yahweh says this, "Perform justice and righteousness, and anyone who has been robbed—rescue him from the hand of the oppressor. Do not mistreat any foreigner in your land, or any orphan or widow. Do not commit violence or pour out innocent blood in this place.
