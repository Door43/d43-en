\v 25 You are afraid of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and his huge army, because they are wanting to kill you. I will enable them to capture you.
\v 26 I will expel you and your mother \add from this land\add*, and you will be taken to another country. Neither of you were born there, but you will both die there.

\v 24 "As I live—this is Yahweh’s declaration—even if you, Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were the signet on my right hand, I would tear you off.
\v 25 For I have given you to the hand of the ones seeking your life and to those before whom you are afraid, the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and the Chaldeans.
\v 26 I will throw you and your mother, who bore you, into another land where you were not born. There you will die.
