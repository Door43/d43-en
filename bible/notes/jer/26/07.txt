\v 7 The priests, the prophets, and all the people heard Jeremiah announcing these words in Yahweh's house.
\v 8 So it happened that when Jeremiah had finished announcing all that Yahweh commanded him to say to all the people, the priests, prophets, and all the people seized him and said, “You will certainly die!
\v 9 Why have you prophesied in Yahweh's name and said that this house will become like Shiloh and this city will become desolate, with no inhabitant?” For all the people had formed a  mob against Jeremiah in Yahweh's house.
