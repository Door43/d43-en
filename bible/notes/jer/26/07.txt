\v 7 Jeremiah did what Yahweh told him to do. The priests, the false prophets, and many other people listened to him as he told them that message outside the temple.
\v 8 But as soon as Jeremiah finished telling them everything that Yahweh had commanded him to say, they all seized him and said, "You must be executed!
\v 9 Why are you prophesying that this temple will be destroyed like Shiloh was destroyed? Why are you saying that this city will be destroyed, and that no one will live here anymore? All the people surrounded Jeremiah as he stood in front of the temple.

\v 7 The priests, the prophets, and all the people heard Jeremiah announcing these words in Yahweh's house.
\v 8 So it happened that when Jeremiah had finished announcing all that Yahweh commanded him to say to all the people, the priests, prophets, and all the people seized him and said, "You will certainly die!
\v 9 Why have you prophesied in Yahweh's name and said that this house will become like Shiloh and this city will become desolate, with no inhabitant?" For all the people had formed a mob against Jeremiah in Yahweh's house.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Yahweh's house** - "the temple"
  * **all the people seized him and said, "You will certainly die!** - Possible meanings are 1) The people chose to believe the lie of false peace and did not want to be confronted with the truth or 2) the people believed the other prophets proclaiming peace and saw Jeremiah as a false prophet who should be stoned for leading the people astray.
  * **Why have you prophesied in Yahweh's name and said that this house will become like Shiloh and this city will become desolate, with no inhabitant?** - This is a rebuke. AT: "You should not have prophesied in Yahweh's name that his temple would be destroyed." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
