\v 10 Then the princes of Judah heard these words and went up from the house of the king to the house of Yahweh, and they sat in the door of the new gate of Yahweh.
\v 11 And the priests and the prophets spoke to the princes and to all the people, and said, “It is justice for this man to die, for he prophesied against this city just as you heard with your own ears!”
\v 12 So Jeremiah spoke to all the princes and all the people and said, “Yahweh has sent me out to prophesize against this house and this city all the words that you have heard.
