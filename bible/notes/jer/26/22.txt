\v 22 Yet King Jehoiakim sent out men to Egypt—Elnathan the son of Achbor and men with him to Egypt—
\v 23 and they brought Uriah out from Egypt and brought him to King Jehoiakim. Then he struck him with a sword and sent his corpse out to the graves of the sons of the people.
\v 24 Surely the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah so he would not be set into the hand of the people so they would put him to death.
