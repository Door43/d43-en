\v 22 Yet King Jehoiakim sent out men to Egypt—Elnathan son of Achbor and men with him to Egypt.
\v 23 They took Uriah out from Egypt and brought him to King Jehoiakim. Then Jehoiakim killed him with a sword and sent his corpse out to the graves of the ordinary people.
\v 24 But the hand of Ahikam son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so he was not placed into the hands of the people for them to put him to death.
