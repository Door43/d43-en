===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 They said, "Remember\f + \ft Or: Think about \f* what Micah, \add the prophet\add* from Moresheth \add town\add*, prophesied during the years that Hezekiah was the king of Judah. He told the people of Judah this:
\q1 'This is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says:
\q2 \add Some day\add* Zion \add Hill\add* will be plowed like fields \add are plowed\add*;
\q2 Jerusalem will become a heap of ruins.
\q1 There will be a large clump\f + \ft Or: group \f* of trees on top of the hill where the temple is now.'
\m
\v 19 But did \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* King Hezekiah or anyone else in Judah kill Micah \add for saying that\add*? No! Instead, Hezekiah revered Yahweh, and pleaded that he would act mercifully toward\f + \ft Or: not destroy \f* them. So, Yahweh changed his mind about sending to them the terrible disaster that he said he would send. And now \add if we kill Jeremiah\add*, we are going to bring a terrible disaster on ourselves!"

\v 18 They said, "Remember what Micah, the prophet from Moresheth, prophesied during the years that Hezekiah was the king of Judah. He told the people of Judah this:
\q1 'This is what Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies, says:
\q2 Some day Mount Zion will be plowed like fields are plowed;
\q2 Jerusalem will become a heap of ruins.
\q1 There will be a large clump of trees on top of the hill where the temple is now.'
\v 19 But did Hezekiah or anyone else in Judah kill Micah for saying that? No! Instead, Hezekiah revered Yahweh, and pleaded that he would act mercifully toward them. So, Yahweh changed his mind about sending to them the terrible disaster that he said he would send. And now if we kill Jeremiah, we are going to bring even worse disaster on ourselves!"

\v 18 They said, "Micah the Morashite was prophesying in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah. He spoke to all the people of Judah and said, 'Yahweh of hosts says this:
Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble, and the temple mount will become a hill of thickets.'
\v 19 Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all of Judah put him to death? Did he not fear Yahweh and appease the face of Yahweh so that Yahweh would relent concerning the disaster that he proclaimed to them? So will we do greater evil against our own lives?"
