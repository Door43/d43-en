====== Jeremiah 26:13-15 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 But if you change your behavior and stop sinning, and start to obey Yahweh our God, he will change his mind, and not send to you the disasters that he said that he would send.
\v 14 As for me, I am not able to free myself from your grasp. So you can do to me whatever you want to do.
\v 15 But you need to know that if you kill me, you will be killing a man \f + \ft synecdoche \f* who is innocent\f + \ft Or: has not done anything wrong \f*. And you and everyone else in this city will be guilty, because the truth is that it was Yahweh who sent me to speak every word that you have heard me say."

\v 13 So now, improve your ways and your practices, and listen to the voice of Yahweh your God so that he will relent concerning the disaster that he has proclaimed against you.
\v 14 I myself—look at me!—am in your hand. Do to me what is good and right in your eyes.
\v 15 But you must surely know that if you kill me, then you are bringing innocent blood on yourselves and on this city and its inhabitants, for Yahweh has truly sent me to you to proclaim all these words for your ears."
