====== Jeremiah 26:1-3 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Soon after Jehoiakim became the king of Judah, Yahweh gave me this message:
\v 2 "This is what I, Yahweh, am telling you: Stand in the courtyard \add in front\add* of my temple, and speak to all the people from the various towns in Judah who come there to worship me. Tell them everything that I tell you; do not omit anything.
\v 3 If you do tell them everything, perhaps they will pay attention, and each one of them will turn away from his evil behavior. Then I will change my mind, and not bring on them the disaster that I was planning to bring on them because of the evil things that they have done.

\c 26
\p
\v 1 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, came this word from Jehovah, saying,
\v 2 Thus says Jehovah: Stand in the court of Jehovah’s house, and speak to all the cities of Judah, which come to worship
in Jehovah’s house, all the words that I command you to speak to them; diminish not a word.
\v 3 It may be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way; that I may repent me of the evil which I purpose to do
to them because of the evil of their doings.
