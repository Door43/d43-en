====== Jeremiah 26:1-3 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Soon after Jehoiakim became the king of Judah, Yahweh gave me this message:
\v 2 "This is what I, Yahweh, am telling you: Stand in the courtyard \add in front\add* of my temple, and speak to all the people from the various towns in Judah who come there to worship me. Tell them everything that I tell you; do not omit anything.
\v 3 If you do tell them everything, perhaps they will pay attention, and each one of them will turn away from his evil behavior. Then I will change my mind, and not bring on them the disaster that I was planning to bring on them because of the evil things that they have done.

\c 26
\p
\v 1 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came from Yahweh and said,
\v 2 "Yahweh says this: Stand in the courtyard of my house and speak about all the cities of Judah who come to worship at my house. Proclaim all the words that I have commanded 
you to say to them. Do not cut short any word!
\v 3 It may be that they will listen, that each man will turn from his wicked ways, so I will relent concerning the disaster that I am planning to bring on them because of the wickedness of their practices.

  * **cities of Judah**  - AT: "people from the cities of Judah"
  * **Do not cut short any word!** - AT : "Do not leave anything out from what I've told you!"
  * **so I will relent concerning the disaster** - This is conditional destruction. If Judah repents, God will not destroy but heal them.
