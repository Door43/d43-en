===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 4-5 Say to them, 'This is what Yahweh says: I sent to you the prophets who serve me, to tell you what you should do. I sent them to you many times, but you have not paid attention to what they said. If you will not pay attention to what I say and do not obey the message that I have given to you, and if you do not pay attention to what the prophets say,
\v 6 I will destroy this temple like I destroyed Shiloh, \add the place where the Sacred Tent was put\add*. And I will cause Jerusalem to be a place whose name people in every nation on the earth will say when they curse someone.'~"

\v 4 So you must say to them, ‘Yahweh says this: If you do not listen to me so as to walk in my Law that I have placed before you—
\v 5 if you do not listen to the words of my servants the prophets whom I am persistently sending to you—but you have not listened!—
\v 6 then I will make this house like Shiloh; I will turn this city into a curse in the sight of all the nations on earth.’”
