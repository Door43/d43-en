\v 24 And concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite you shall speak, saying,
\v 25 Thus speaks Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because you have sent letters in your own name to all the
people that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, and to all the priests, saying,
\v 26 Jehovah has made you priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that there may be officers in the house of Jehovah,
for every man that is mad, and makes himself a prophet, that you should put him in the stocks and in shackles.
