\v 22 Then a curse will be spoken about these persons by all the captives of Judah in Babylon. The curse will say: May Yahweh make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in fire.
\v 23 This will happen because of the shameful things they did in Israel when they committed adultery with their neighbor's wives and declared false words in my name, things that I never commanded them to say.
For I am the one who knows; I am the witnessx97this is Yahweh's declaration.'"

  * **roasted in fire**  - AT: "burned to death" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **I am the one who knows; I am the witness** - These clauses mean the same thing and Yahweh repeats them for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
