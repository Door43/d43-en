\v 27 So why have you not done anything to stop Jeremiah, the man from Anathoth \add town\add*, who \add pretends that he\add* is a prophet among you?
\v 28 He sent a letter to us who are here in Babylon, saying that \add we will be here for\add* a long time. He said that \add therefore\add* we should build houses and plan to stay here, and plant gardens, and eat the food that is produced in the gardens."
\p
\v 29 But when Zephaniah the priest received the letter from you, he \add brought it to me and\add* read it to me.

\v 27 So now, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who makes himself into a prophet against you?
\v 28 For he has sent out to us in Babylon and said, 'It will be a long time. Build houses and live in them, and plant gardens and eat their fruit."'"
\v 29 Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet.
