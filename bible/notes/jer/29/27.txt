\v 27 So why have you not done anything to stop Jeremiah, the man from Anathoth \add town\add*, who \add pretends that he\add* is a prophet among you?
\v 28 He sent a letter to us who are here in Babylon, saying that \add we will be here for\add* a long time. He said that \add therefore\add* we should build houses and plan to stay here, and plant gardens, and eat the food that is produced in the gardens."

\v 29 But when Zephaniah the priest received the letter from you, he \add brought it to me and\add* read it to me.

\v 27 Now therefore, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who makes himself a prophet to you,
\v 28 forasmuch as he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, The
captivity is long: build you houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them?
\v 29 And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.
