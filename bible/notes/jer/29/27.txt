<usfm>
\v 27 So why have you not done anything to stop Jeremiah, the man from Anathoth \add town\add*, who \add pretends that he\add* is a prophet among you?
\v 28 He sent a letter to us who are here in Babylon, saying that \add we will be here for\add* a long time. He said that \add therefore\add* we should build houses and plan to stay here, and plant gardens, and eat the food that is produced in the gardens."
\p
\v 29 But when Zephaniah the priest received the letter from you, he \add brought it to me and\add* read it to me.

\v 27 So now, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who makes himself into a prophet against you?
\v 28 For he has sent to us in Babylon and said, 'It will be a long time. Build houses and live in them, and plant gardens and eat their fruit."'"
\v 29 Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This finishes the letter by Shemaiah that he sent out to the people in Jerusalem.

  * **why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth ... against you?** - Shemaiah uses a rhetorical question to scold the people of Jerusalem for not rebuking Jeremiah. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "I want you to rebuke Jeremiah of Anathoth ... against you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **he has sent to us** - You may need to make explicit what it was that Jeremiah sent. AT: "he has sent a message to us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Build houses and live in them, and plant gardens and eat their fruit** - See how you translated similar words in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:29:04|29:5]].
  * **in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet** - "so that Jeremiah the prophet could hear him read it." See how you translated similar words in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:02:01|2:2]].
