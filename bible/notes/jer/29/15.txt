\v 15 Because you have said, Jehovah has raised us up prophets in Babylon;
\v 16 thus says Jehovah concerning the king that sits upon the throne of David, and concerning all the people that dwell in
this city, your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity;
\v 17 thus says Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them
like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so bad.
