\v 10 I will say to your enemies,
\pi2 'The people of Judah and Israel are like a vineyard. Go along the rows in their vineyards and get rid of most of the people, but do not kill all of them. These people do not belong to me, so get rid of them, like a gardener lops off branches from a vine.

\v 12 They have lied about me and said,
\pi2 'He is not even real! He will not punish us! He will not send disasters on us! We will not experience wars or famines!
\v 13 What God's prophets say is nothing but wind! They do not have messages from God! And because they have not believed me, all of these things will happen to them!'"

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to speak.
  * **Go up onto her vineyards' terraces**  - "Get up over her walls." Yahweh is comparing the city of Jerusalem to a vineyard that has a wall around it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Go up** - Yahweh is speaking to the enemies of people living in Jerusalem.
  * ** do not bring complete destruction to them** - "do not completely destroy them"
  * **Trim their vines, since those vines do not come from Yahweh** - Yahweh compares how the enemies of Jerusalem will rid of her people to how people cut branches off of a vine. AT: "Get rid of all of the evil people because they do not come from Yahweh." 
  * **For the houses of Israel and Judah** - AT: "For the people of Israel and Judah." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]].
  * **They have denied me** - This could also be translated as, "They have lied about me."
  * **He is not real**  - "Yahweh does not exist." This could also be translated as "He will not do these things" or "He cannot do these things"
  * **Evil will not come on us, nor will we see sword or famine** - These two sentences say the same thing, the second is more specific than the first. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) 
  * **Evil will not come on us**  - This expression means "Bad things will not happen to us."
  * **nor will we see sword or famine**  - AT: "and we will not experience war or famine." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
