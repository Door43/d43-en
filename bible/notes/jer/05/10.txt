<usfm> \v 10 I will say to your enemies, 'The people of Judah and Israel are like a vineyard. \q Go along the rows in their vineyards and get rid of most of the people, but do not kill all of them. \q These people do not belong to me, so get rid of them, like a gardener lops off branches from a vine. \q \v 11 The people of Israel and Judah have turned away from me completely.' \q \v 12 They have lied about me and said, 'He isn't even real! \q He will not punish us! He will not send disasters on us! We will not experience wars or famines! \q \v 13 What God's prophets say is nothing but wind! They do not have messages from God! \q And because they have nor believed me, all of these things will happen to them!

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \p \q \v 10 Go up onto her vineyards' terraces and destroy. But do not bring complete destruction to them. \q Trim their vines, since those vines do not come from Yahweh. \q \v 11 For the houses of Israel and Judah have completely betrayed me—this is Yahweh’s declaration. \q \v 12 They have denied me. They say, ‘He is not real. \q Evil will not come on us, nor will we see sword or famine. \q \v 13 For the prophets have become as useless as the wind and there is no one else to declare Yahweh's messages to us. Let their threats come upon themselves.'" </usfm>
