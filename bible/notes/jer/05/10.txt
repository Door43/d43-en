\v 10 Go you up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her branches; for they are not Jehovah’s.
\v 11 For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, says Jehovah.
\v 12 They have denied Jehovah, and said, It is not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine:
\v 13 and the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them: thus shall it be done to them.
