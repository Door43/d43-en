\q
\v 13 What God's prophets say is nothing but wind! They do not have messages from God!
\q And because they have nor believed me, all of these things will happen to them!

\q
\v 10 Go up upon her terraces and destroy! But do not perform an annihilation!
\q Trim their vines, since they are not of Yahweh!
\q
\v 11 For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have completely betrayed me!—this is Yahweh’s declaration.
\q
\v 12 They have denied Yahweh and say, ‘He is not real!’
\q And ‘Evil will not come upon us, nor will we see the sword or famine!
\q
\v 13 For the prophets have become like wind and there is no one to declare to us!” Therefore it will be done to them.
