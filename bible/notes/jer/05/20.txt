\v 20 Report this in the house of Jacob and let it be heard in Judah, and say,
\q
\v 21 ‘Hear this, foolish people! For there is no determination –
\q There are eyes in them, but they cannot see. There is ears on them but they do not hear!
\q
\v 22 Do you not fear me?—this is Yahweh’s declaration—or tremble before my face?
\q Though I set a border of sand against the sea, a perpetual statute that it will not cross over?
\q Though it rises and falls still it does not prevail! Though its waves roar yet they do not pass over it!
