\v 20 Report this to the house of Jacob and let it be heard in Judah. Say,
\q
\v 21 ‘Hear this, foolish people! For idols have no will;
\q there are eyes in them, but they cannot see. There are ears on them, but they do not hear.
\q
\v 22 Do you not fear me—this is Yahweh’s declaration—or tremble before my face?
\q I have placed a border of sand against the sea, an ongoing decree that it does not violate—
\q even though the sea rises and falls, still it does not violate it. Even though its waves roar, they do not cross it.
