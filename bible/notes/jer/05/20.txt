\p
\v 20 Declare you this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,
\v 21 Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; that have eyes, and see not; that have ears, and hear not:
\v 22 Fear you not me? says Jehovah: will you not tremble at my presence, who have placed the sand for the bound of the sea, by
a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it? and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they
roar, yet can they not pass over it.
