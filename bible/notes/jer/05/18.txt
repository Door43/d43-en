<usfm>
\v 18 But even in those days—this is Yahweh's declaration—I do not intend to destroy you completely.
\v 19 When you, Israel and Judah, say, 'Why has Yahweh our God done all these things to us?' then you, Jeremiah, will say to them, 'Just as you abandoned Yahweh and served foreign gods in your land, so you must also serve strangers in a land that is not your own.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues to speak to the people of Israel and Jeremiah.

  * **in those days** - The phrase "those days" refers to the time when a distant nation will come and attack the people of Israel.
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **do not intend to destroy** - "will not destroy"
  * **done all these things to us** - The phrase "these things" refers to sending armies to attack them. AT: "done all these things to harm us" or "sent foreign armies to attack us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Just as you ... served foreign gods in your land, so you must also serve strangers** - Here "served foreign gods" represents worshiping foreign gods. God would punish them for serving foreign gods by making them serve foreign people. AT: "Because you ... worshiped foreign gods in your land, you will have to serve foreigners" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
