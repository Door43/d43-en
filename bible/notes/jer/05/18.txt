<usfm>
\v 18 But even in those days—this is Yahweh’s declaration—I did not set annihilation upon you!
\v 19 So it will be that when you say, “For what reason has Yahweh our God done all these things to us?” then you will say to them, “Just as you have abandoned me and crossed over to foreign gods in your land, thus you will serve strangers in a land that is not yours!”
