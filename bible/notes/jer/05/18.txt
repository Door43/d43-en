\v 18 But even in those days—this is Yahweh’s declaration—I will not intent to destroy you completely.
\v 19 It will happen when you, Israel and Judah, say, 'Why has Yahweh our God done all these things to us?' that then you, Jeremiah, will say to them, “Just as you abandoned Yahweh and went over to foreign gods in your land, so you will also serve strangers in a land that is not your own.'
