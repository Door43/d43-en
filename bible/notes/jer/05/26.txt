===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 26 Among my people are wicked people who hide along the roads to ambush people like men who hunt birds put nets to catch them.
\v 27 Like a hunter has a cage full of birds that he has captured, their homes are full of things that they have gotten by deceiving others so now they are very rich and powerful.
\v 28 They are big and fat because they eat rich food, and there is no limit to the evil deeds that they have done. In court, they do not help ordinary people get judges to decide fairly for them, and they do not try to defend orphans. They do not even want to listen to them in court.
\v 29 So I will certainly  punish them for doing those things. I will certainly get revenge on their nation.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 26 For wicked men are found with my people. They watch as someone crouches to capture birds;
\q they set a trap and catch people.
\q
\v 27 Like a cage full of birds, their houses are full of deceit.
\q So they grow large and become rich.
\q 
\v 28 They have become fat; they shine with well-being. They crossed over all bounds of wickedness. They do not plead the cause of the people,
\q or the cause of the orphan. They prosper even though they have not given justice to the needy.
\q
\v 29 Should I not punish them for these thingsx97this is Yahweh's declarationx97
\q and will I not take vengeance for myself on a nation like this?

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to speak.
    * **For wicked men are found with my people** - AT: "For I have found wicked men among my people." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
    * **they set a trap and catch people** - AT: "They set things up so that they can take advantage of people." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **grow large and become rich** - "become powerful and rich"
    * **they shine with well-being** - "and sleek" or "and smooth." The people look smooth because their thick fat hides their bones. 
    * **They pass beyond all bounds of wickedness** - "They do things that are even worse than evil."
    * **the cause of the orphan** - This refers to court cases in which orphans ask that justice be done. AT: "they do not support the court cases brought by orphans." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
    * **Should I not punish...that is like this** - See how you translated "So should I not punish...that is like this" in [[en:bible:notes:jer:05:07|5:9]].
