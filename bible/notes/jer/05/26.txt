\v 26 For wicked men are found with my people. They watch as someone crouches to capture birds;
\q they set a trap and catch people.
\q
\v 27 Like a cage full of birds, their houses are full of deceit.
\q So they grow large and become rich.
\q 
\v 28 They have become fat; they shine with wellbeing. They pass beyond all bounds of wickedness. They do not support peole in their pleas,
\q the orphans' pleas. they prosper but do not judge the poor with justice.
