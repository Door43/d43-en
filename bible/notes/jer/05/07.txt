====== Jeremiah 05:7-9 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 Yahweh says, "I cannot \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* forgive these people;
\q2 even their children have abandoned me.
\q1 When they solemnly declare something, they ask their gods \add to show that what they say is true\add*.
\q1 I gave my people everything that they needed,
\q2 but they often went to \add the shrines of their idols\add* and committed adultery there.
\q1
\v 8 Just like \f + \ft metaphor \f* well-fed male horses neigh, wanting sex with female horses,
\q2 each of the men desires to have sex with his neighbor's wife.
\q1
\v 9 Should I not punish them for this \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?
\q2 I will certainly get revenge \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* on this nation whose people behave like that!
\b

\v 7 Yahweh says, "I cannot forgive these people;
\q2 even their children have abandoned me.
\q1 When they solemnly declare something, they ask their gods to show that what they say is true.
\q1 I gave my people everything that they needed,
\q2 but they often went to the high places on the hills, where they worshiped their idols and committed adultery there.
\q1
\v 8 Just like well fed male horses neigh, wanting to mate with female horses,
\q2 each of the men desires to sleep with his neighbor's wife.
\q1
\v 9 Should I not punish them for this?
\q2 I will certainly get revenge on this nation whose people behave like that!

<usfm>
\q
\v 7 Why should I pardon these people?
\q Your sons have abandoned me and have made oaths by what are not gods.
\q I fed them fully, but they committed adultery and walked in great numbers to the houses of prostitutes.
\q
\v 8 They were horses in heat. They roamed about wanting to mate. Each man neighed to his neighbor's wife.
\q
\v 9 So should I not punish them—this is Yahweh's declaration—
\q and should I not avenge myself on a nation that is like this?
</usfm>

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Why should I pardon these people?** - Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that he has no reason to pardon these people. AT: "Because of the things that they do, I cannot pardon these people." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **these people** - the people of Jerusalem
  * **Your sons** - Yahweh is speaking to Jerusalem as though she were a woman who had children. Jerusalem's "sons" represent the people of  Jerusalem. AT: "The people of Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **I fed them fully** - Providing all they needed is spoken of as feeding them. AT: "I gave them everything they needed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **they committed adultery and walked in great numbers to the houses of prostitutes** - This may be a metaphor for being unfaithful to God and worshiping idols, but idol worship also included prostitution. AT: "they were unfaithful to me and went in large numbers to the houses of prostitutes" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **walked in great numbers to the houses of prostitutes** - "went in large groups to the houses of prostitutes" or "large groups of them went to the houses of prostitutes"
  * **They were horses in heat ... neighed to his neighbor's wife** - Because the God speaks of them as if they were horses that wanted to mate with other horses. AT: "They were like horses in heat ... neighed to his neighbor's wife" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in heat** - ready to mate
  * **mate** - when animals breed to reproduce
  * **Each man neighed to his neighbor's wife** - Male horses neigh loudly to female horses when they want to mate with them. AT: "Like horses who mate with more than one horse, these men wanted to sleep with other men's wives" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **So should I not punish them ... and should I not avenge myself on a nation that is like this?** - Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that the things that they are doing are so bad that he will no have mercy but will punish them. AT: "Because they do these things, I will punish them ... I will certainly get revenge for myself against them." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
