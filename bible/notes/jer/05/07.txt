\q2 even their children have abandoned me.
\q1 When they solemnly declare something, they ask their gods \add to show that what they say is true\add*.
\q1 I gave my people everything that they needed,
\q2 but they often went to \add the shrines of their idols\add* and committed adultery there.
\q1
\v 8 Just like \f + \ft metaphor \f* well-fed male horses neigh, wanting sex with female horses,
\q2 each of the men desires to have sex with his neighbor's wife.
\q1
\v 9 Should I not punish them for this \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?

<usfm>
\q
\v 7 Why should I pardon these?
\q Your sons have abandoned me and they have sworn by non-gods!
\q Then I satisfied them, but they committed adultery and marked themselves as a house of prostitution!
\q
\v 8 Horses in heat! They were roaming about while aroused! Each man neighed to the wife of his neighbor!
\q
\v 9 Should I not visit them for these reasons?—this is Yahweh’s declaration.
\q Or should my being not avenge itself on a nation that is like this?
</usfm>
