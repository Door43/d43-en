\v 7 Yahweh says, "I cannot \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* forgive these people;
\q2 even their children have abandoned me.
\q1 When they solemnly declare something, they ask their gods \add to show that what they say is true\add*.
\q1 I gave my people everything that they needed,
\q2 but they often went to \add the shrines of their idols\add* and committed adultery there.
\q1
\v 8 Just like \f + \ft metaphor \f* well-fed male horses neigh, wanting sex with female horses,
\q2 each of the men desires to have sex with his neighbor's wife.
\q1
\v 9 Should I not punish them for this \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?
\q2 I will certainly get revenge \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* on this nation whose people behave like that!

\p
\v 7 How can I pardon thee? your children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods. When I had fed them to the full,
they committed adultery, and assembled themselves in troops at the harlots’ houses;
\v 8 they were as fed horses roaming at large; every one neighed after his neighbor’s wife.
\v 9 Shall I not visit for these things? says Jehovah; and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
