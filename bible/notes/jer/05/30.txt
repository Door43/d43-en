===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to speak.
    * **Atrocities and horrors have occurred**  - "A dreadful and awful thing has occurred"
    * **in the land** - AT: "in the land of Israel." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
    * **prophesy with deceit** - "prophesy lies"
    * **with their own power** - "according to the directions of the prophets"
    * **but what will happen in the end** - "but what will you do at the end of all of this?" Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that the people will regret being wicked when it results in punishment. AT: "but you will be in trouble and regret this wicked behavior when it ends with punishment?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **in the end** - The phrase "the end" refers to the punishment that results from the wicked things that the people have done.
