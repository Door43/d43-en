\v 1 Yahweh said to \add the people of Jerusalem\add*, "Go up and down every street.
\q2 Search in the marketplaces to find people who do what is fair\f + \ft Or: right \f*,
\q2 who try to be faithful to me.
\q1 \add If you find even one person like that\add*,
\q2 I will forgive \add the people of Jerusalem and not destroy\add* their city.
\q1
\v 2 But when people there say, 'I solemnly declare that as surely as Yahweh lives, \add I will do what he says\add*,'
\q2 they are lying."
\b
\q1
\v 3 Yahweh, you are certainly \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* searching for \add people who tell the\add* truth.
\q2 You struck\f + \ft Or: punished \f* your people, but they did not pay any attention.
\q1 You crushed them, but they ignored what you were telling them to do.
\q1 They were extremely stubborn [IDI]
\q2 and refused to return to you.
\q1

<usfm>
\v 1 Yahweh said to the people of Jerusalem,
\pi "Go up and down every street. Search in the marketplaces to find people who do what is fair, who try to be faithful to me. If you find even one person like that, I will forgive the people of Jerusalem and not destroy their city.
\v 2 But when the people there swear an official oath by Yahweh's life, they are lying."
\m
\v 3 So I prayed,
\pi "Yahweh, you are certainly searching for people who are faithful to you. You punished your people, but they did not pay any attention. You crushed them, but they ignored what you were telling them to do. They were extremely stubborn and refused to return to you."

<usfm>
\c 5
\q
\v 1 "Rush about through the streets of Jerusalem; search in her city squares, too.  Then look and think about this:
\q If you can find a man or anyone who is acting justly and trying to act faithfully,
\q then I will forgive Jerusalem.
\q
\v 2 Even if they are saying, 'By the life of Yahweh,' they are making false oaths."
\q
\v 3 Yahweh, do your eyes not look for faithfulness? You struck the people, but they do not feel pain.
\q You have completely defeated them, but they still refuse to receive discipline. They make their faces harder than rock, for they refuse to repent.
