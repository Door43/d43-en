\c 5
\p
\v 1 Run you to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if you can
find a man, if there be any that does justly, that seeks truth; and I will pardon her.
\v 2 And though they say, As Jehovah liveth; surely they swear falsely.
\v 3 O Jehovah, do not your eyes look upon truth? you have stricken them, but they were not grieved; you have consumed them,
but they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.
