===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Yahweh said to \add the people of Jerusalem\add*, "Go up and down every street.
\q2 Search in the marketplaces to find people who do what is fair\f + \ft Or: right \f*,
\q2 who try to be faithful to me.
\q1 \add If you find even one person like that\add*,
\q2 I will forgive \add the people of Jerusalem and not destroy\add* their city.
\q1
\v 2 But when people there say, 'I solemnly declare that as surely as Yahweh lives, \add I will do what he says\add*,'
\q2 they are lying."
\b
\q1
\v 3 Yahweh, you are certainly \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* searching for \add people who tell the\add* truth.
\q2 You struck\f + \ft Or: punished \f* your people, but they did not pay any attention.
\q1 You crushed them, but they ignored what you were telling them to do.
\q1 They were extremely stubborn [IDI]
\q2 and refused to return to you.

\v 1 Yahweh said to the people of Jerusalem, "Go up and down every street.
\q2 Search in the marketplaces to find people who do what is fair,
\q2 who try to be faithful to me.
\q1 If you find even one person like that,
\q2 I will forgive the people of Jerusalem and not destroy their city.
\q1
\v 2 But when the people there swear an official oath by Yahweh's life,
\q1 they are lying."
\q1
\v 3 So I prayed, "Yahweh, you are certainly searching for people who are faithful to you.
\q2 You punished your people, but they did not pay any attention.
\q1 You crushed them, but they ignored what you were telling them to do.
\q1 They were extremely stubborn
\q2 and refused to return to you."

<usfm>
\c 5
\q
\v 1 "Rush about through the streets of Jerusalem; search in her city squares, too. Then look and think about this:
\q If you can find a man or anyone who is acting justly and trying to act faithfully,
\q then I will forgive Jerusalem.
\q
\v 2 Although they say, 'As Yahweh lives,' yet they are swearing falsely."
\q
\v 3 Yahweh, do your eyes not look for faithfulness? You struck the people, but they do not feel pain.
\q You have completely defeated them, but they still refuse to receive discipline. They make their faces harder than rock, for they refuse to repent.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jeremiah often wrote prophecy in the form of poetry. Hebrew poetry uses different kinds of parallelism. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **Rush about through the streets** - "Go quickly through the streets"
  * **Then look and think about this** - "look and find out"
  * **city squares** - broad and open places in a city where people can gather
  * **who is acting justly** - "who does what is just"
  * **Although they say** - The word "they" refers to the people of Jerusalem.
  * **As Yahweh lives** - "as surely as Yahweh is alive." The people use this expression to show that what they say next is certainly true. This is a way of making a solemn promise. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:04:01|4:2]]. AT: "I solemnly swear" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **do your eyes not look for faithfulness?** - Jeremiah uses this question to emphasize that what Yahweh really wants is faithfulness. Wanting people to be faithful is spoken of as looking for faithfulness. AT: "you look for faithfulness." or "you want people to be faithful." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **You struck the people, but they do not feel pain.** - God punished his people in various ways. Here it is spoken of as if he hit them. AT: "You punish the people, but they do not pay attention" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **they still refuse to receive discipline** - Here "to receive discipline" represents learning from discipline to do what is right. AT: "they still refuse to learn their lesson" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **They make their faces harder than rock** - Hard faces represents the expression on their faces that shows that they are stubborn. The simile "harder than rock" shows that the people are extremely stubborn.  AT: "They are extremely stubborn" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
