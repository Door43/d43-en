\v 23 But you people \add are not like the waves that obey me\add*
\q2 You people are very stubborn and rebellious.
\q2 You have constantly turned away from me.
\q1
\v 24 You do not say to yourselves,
\q2 'We should have an awesome respect for Yahweh our God,
\q2 the one who sends us rain at the times than we need it,
\q2 the one who causes the grain to become ripe at the harvest season.'
\q1
\v 25 It is because of the wrong things that you have done, that those good things have not happened;
\q2 it is because of the sins that you have committed that you have been prevented from receiving those blessings.

\q
\v 23 But this people has a stubborn heart and turns away in rebellion and goes!
\q 
\v 24 For they do not say in their hearts, ‘Let us fear Yahweh our God, the one who brings the rain
\q —the early rain and the late rains—in its time, keeping the appointed weeks of the harvest for us!’
\q
\v 25 Your iniquities strike these things and your sins withhold good from you!
