<usfm>
\v 23 But you people \add are not like the waves that obey me\add*
\q2 You people are very stubborn and rebellious.
\q2 You have constantly turned away from me.
\q1
\v 24 You do not say to yourselves,
\q2 'We should have an awesome respect for Yahweh our God,
\q2 the one who sends us rain at the times than we need it,
\q2 the one who causes the grain to become ripe at the harvest season.'
\q1
\v 25 It is because of the wrong things that you have done, that those good things have not happened;
\q2 it is because of the sins that you have committed that you have been prevented from receiving those blessings.

\pi2 'Let us have an awesome respect for Yahweh our God, the one who sends us rain at the times that we need it, the one who causes the grain to become ripe at the harvest season.'
\pi
\v 25 It is because of the wrong things that you have done, that those good things have not happened; It is because of the sins that you have committed that you have been prevented from receiving those blessings.

<usfm>
\q
\v 23 But this people has a stubborn heart. It turns away in rebellion and goes away.
\q 
\v 24 For they do not say in their hearts, "Let us fear Yahweh our God, the one who brings the rain
\q —the early rain and the late rains—in their right time, keeping the fixed weeks of the harvest for us."
\q
\v 25 Your iniquities kept these things from happening. Your sins have stopped good from coming to you.
