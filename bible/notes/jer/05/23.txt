===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 23 But you people \add are not like the waves that obey me\add*
\q2 You people are very stubborn and rebellious.
\q2 You have constantly turned away from me.
\q1
\v 24 You do not say to yourselves,
\q2 'We should have an awesome respect for Yahweh our God,
\q2 the one who sends us rain at the times than we need it,
\q2 the one who causes the grain to become ripe at the harvest season.'
\q1
\v 25 It is because of the wrong things that you have done, that those good things have not happened;
\q2 it is because of the sins that you have committed that you have been prevented from receiving those blessings.

<usfm>
\v 23 But this people has a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.
\v 24 Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear Jehovah our God, that gives rain, both the former and the latter, in
its season; that preserves to us the appointed weeks of the harvest.
\v 25 Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withholden good from you.
