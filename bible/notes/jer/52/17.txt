\v 17 As for the bronze pillars that belonged to the house of Yahweh, and the stands and the bronze sea that were in the house of
Yahweh, the Chaldeans broke them into pieces and carried all the bronze back to Babylon.
\v 18 The pots, shovels, lamp trimmers, bowls, and all the utensils of bronze with which the priests had served in the temple—the Chaldeans took them all away.
\v 19 The basins and the incense burners, the bowls, pots, lampstands, pans, and basins that were made of gold, and those made of silver—the captain of the king's guard took them away as well.
