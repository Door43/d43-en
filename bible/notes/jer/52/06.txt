\v 6 In the fourth month, on the ninth day of that year, the famine was so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land.
\v 7 Then the city was broken into, and all the fighting men fled and went out of the city at night by the way of the gate that was between the two walls, by the king's garden, although the Chaldeans were all around the city. So they went in the direction of the Arabah.
\v 8 But the army of Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of the Jordan river valley near Jericho. All his army was scattered away from him.
