\v 29 Previously the people often said, 'The parents have eaten sour grapes, but it is the children's teeth that ache.' They meant that it was not fair for them to be punished for their ancestors' sins. But when I bring them back to their land, they will no longer say that.
\m
\v 30 But now all people will die because of the sins that they themselves have committed. It will be more like 'The person who eats sour grapes will have his own teeth aching.'
