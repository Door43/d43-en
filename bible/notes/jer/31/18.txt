\v 18 I have heard the people of Israel grieving very much \add and saying to me\add*,
\q2 'You punished us severely,
\q2 like \f + \ft simile \f* calves are beaten \add by their owners to train them for pulling a plow\add*.
\q1 So bring us back \add to obey\f + \ft Or: worship \f* you again\add*,
\q2 because we are ready to return to you,
\q1 because you alone are Yahweh, our God.
\q1
\v 19 We turned away from you,
\q2 but we repented;
\q1 after you caused us to realize \add that we were guilty\add*.
\q2 We beat our breasts to show that we were very ashamed \f + \ft doublet \f* of the sins that we committed when we were young.'
\q1
\v 20 But I, Yahweh, say this:
\q2 The Israelite people certainly are \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* still my dear children \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\q1 It is often necessary for me to threaten \add to punish\add* them,
\q2 but I still love them.
\q1 That is why I have not forgotten them,
\q2 and I will certainly act mercifully toward them.

\v 18 I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus, You have chaveised me, and I was chaveised, as a calf unaccustomed to the yoke: turn you me, and I shall be turned; for you are Jehovah my God.
\v 19 Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I struck upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.
\v 20 Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a darling child? for as often as I speak against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my heart yearneth for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, says Jehovah.
