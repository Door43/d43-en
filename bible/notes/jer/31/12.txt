===== translationNotes: =====

  * **on the heights of Zion** - "on Zion, the high place" or "on Mount Zion." Being on top of a hill is a metaphor for being happy. If your language associates mountain tops with sadness, it would be best to leave out the metaphor. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **like a watered garden** - This means they will be strong and healthy, and they will prosper. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **they will never again feel any more sorrow** - The world "never" is a generalization. The Israelites will almost always feel joy. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
