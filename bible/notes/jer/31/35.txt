\v 35 Yahweh says this—Yahweh, the one who makes the sun to shine by day and arranges the moon and stars to shine by night. He is the one who sets the sea in motion so that its waves roar. Yahweh of hosts is his name. He says this,
\q
\v 36 "Only if these permanent things vanish from my sight—this is Yahweh's declaration—
\q will Israel's descendants ever stop from forever being a nation before me."
