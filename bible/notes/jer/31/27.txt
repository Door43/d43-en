\v 27 "Look, the days are coming"—this is Yahweh’s declaration—"when I will sow the houses of Israel and Judah with the descendants of man and beast.
\v 28 Then it will happen that, just as I kept them under surveillance in order to uproot them and tear them down, to overthrow, destroy, and bring them harm. In this way I will watch over them, in order  
to build them up and to plant them"—this is Yahweh’s declaration.
