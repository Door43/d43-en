\v 27 "Look, the days are coming—this is Yahweh's declaration—when I will sow the houses of Israel and Judah with the descendants of man and beast.
\v 28 In the past, I kept them under surveillance in order to uproot them and to tear them down, to overthrow, destroy, and bring them harm. But in the coming days, I will watch over them, in order to build them up and to plant them—this is Yahweh's declaration.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Look** - "Pay attention" or "Listen"
  * **days are coming ... when I will sow** - Future time is spoken of as if the "days are coming." See how you translated this metaphor in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:07:31|7:32]]. AT: "in the future ... I will sow" or "there will be a time ... when I will sow" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **I will sow the houses of Israel and Judah with the descendants of man and beast** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the people of Israel and the people of Judah. The house in turn is spoken of as if it were a field in which Yahweh would sow seed, and the people and the animals they raise for food, milk, and skins are spoken of as if they are that seed. AT: "I will cause the people of Israel and Judah to become many people with many animals" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I kept them under surveillance in order to uproot them** - "looked for ways to uproot them"
  * **uproot ... tear them down ... overthrow ... destroy** - See how you translated these ideas in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:09|1:9]].
  * **in order to build them up and to plant them** - Yahweh speaks of the Israelites as if they were a house or a food crop. AT: "in order to make them strong and many" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
