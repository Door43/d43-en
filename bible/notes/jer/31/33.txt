====== Jeremiah 31:33-34 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 33 This is what I, Yahweh, say: 'This is the new agreement that I will make with the people of Israel some day: I will put my laws in their minds and write them on their inner beings. I will be their God, and they will be my people.
\v 34 And it will not be necessary for them to teach their neighbors or their relatives and say, "You need to know Yahweh," because everyone, including unimportant people and very important people, will already know me. And I will forgive them for having been very wicked, and I will never think again about the sins that they have committed.'~"

\v 33 But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says Jehovah: I will put my law in
their inward parts, and in their heart will I write it; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
\v 34 And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah; for they shall all
know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, says Jehovah: for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin will
I remember no more.
