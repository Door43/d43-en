====== Jeremiah 31:33-34 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 33 This is what I, Yahweh, say: 'This is the new agreement that I will make with the people of Israel some day: I will put my laws in their minds and write them on their inner beings. I will be their God, and they will be my people.
\v 34 And it will not be necessary for them to teach their neighbors or their relatives and say, "You need to know Yahweh," because everyone, including unimportant people and very important people, will already know me. And I will forgive them for having been very wicked, and I will never think again about the sins that they have committed.'~"

\v 34 And it will not be necessary for them to teach their neighbors or their relatives and say, "You need to know Yahweh," because everyone, including both unimportant people and very important people, will already know me. And I will forgive them for having been very wicked, and I will never think again about the sins that they have committed.'"

\v 33 "But this is the covenant that I will establish with the house of Israel after these days"—this is Yahweh’s declaration: "I will place my law within them and will write it on their heart, 
for I will be their God, and they will be my people.
\v 34 Then each man will no longer teach his neighbor, or a man teach his brother and say, 'Know Yahweh!' For all of them, from the smallest of them to the greatest, will know me"—this is Yahweh’s declaration. "For I will forgive their iniquity and will no longer call their sins to mind."

  * **I will place my law within them and will write it on their heart**  - These two phrases have similar meaning and are combined for emphasis. Here "heart" represents "emotions" or "mind." AT: "My law will be part of their thoughts and emotions."  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **from the smallest of them to the greatest** - The words “smallest" and "greatest” used together refer to all people.(See:[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
