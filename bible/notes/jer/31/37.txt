===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 37 And this is what I say:
\q1 'No one can measure the sky
\q2 and no one can find out what is supporting the earth.
\q1 Similarly, I cannot reject the descendants of Jacob
\q2 because of all the \add evil\add* things that they have done.'
\q1 \add That is certain, because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it!

\q because of all that they have done—this is Yahweh's declaration."

  * **foundation** - the part of a house on which every other part rests. "deepest part"
  * **reject** - throw away or refuse to take
