===== translationNotes: =====

**General Information**: Jeremiah often wrote prophecy in the form of poetry. Hebrew poetry uses different kinds of parallelism. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **At that time** - This refers to the time when God punishes the wicked.
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **who have survived the sword that came to slaughter Israel** - The word "sword" is a metonym for war and Jeremiah speaks of the sword as if it were a person who could move and kill other people because Yahweh sent soldiers with swords to kill the Israelites. AT: "who have survived the war in which soldiers whom I sent to slaughter Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **The people who have survived sword have found favor in the wilderness** - This is an idiom. AT: "While the people who have survived the sword have been in the wilderness, I have had grace on them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **wilderness; I will go out to give rest to Israel** - Another possible meaning is "wilderness when Israel went out to find rest."
  * **Yahweh appeared to me** - Jeremiah speaks of himself as if he were the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
