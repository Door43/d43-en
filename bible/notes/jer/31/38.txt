\v 38 Look, days are coming—this is Yahweh’s declaration—when the city for Yahweh will be built from the tower of Hananel to the corner-gate.
\v 39 Then the measuring line will again go out to measure in front of it, to the hill of Gareb and around Goah.
\v 40 The entire valley of corpses and ashes and all the fields to the river Kidron to the corner of the gate of horses in the east, will be holy to Yahweh. It will not be uprooted 
or overthrown ever again.”
