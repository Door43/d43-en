===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking about how he will bring the Israelite people back from being captives in Babylon.

  * **Hear ... Report** - Yahweh is speaking to the nations, so these verbs are plural. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]])
  * **The one who scattered Israel is gathering her up** - Yahweh speaks of himself as if he were someone else, and he speaks of the people of Israel as if they were a helpless woman. AT: "I caused my people Israel to be scattered among the nations, but now I am bringing them home." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **and keeping her as a shepherd keeps his sheep** - Yahweh speaks of the people of Israel as if they were a helpless woman. A shepherd cares for and protects his sheep, and Yahweh is promising to care for and protect the Israelites.(See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **For Yahweh has ransomed Jacob and has redeemed him from the hand that was too strong for him** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that it is Yahweh who has rescued the people of Israel. AT: "For Yahweh has rescued the people of Israel from their enemy who was too strong for them." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
