\q
\v 8 See, I am about to bring them from the northern lands.  I will gather them from the farthest parts of the earth.
\q The blind and lame will be among them; 
\q pregnant women and those who are about to give birth will be with them.
\q A great assembly will return here.
\q
\v 9 They will come weeping; I will lead them as they make their pleas. I will have them journey to streams of water
\q on a straight road. They will not stumble on it, for I will be a father to Israel,
\q and Ephraim will be my firstborn."
