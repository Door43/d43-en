\v 8 Behold! I am coming with them from the north land and I will gather them from the furthest parts of the earth;
\q the blind and lame will be with them, pregnant women and those who are giving birth to a child will be together! 
\q A great assembly will return here!

\q and Ephraim will be my firstborn!
