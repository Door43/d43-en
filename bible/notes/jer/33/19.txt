\v 19 Then Yahweh gave me this message:
\v 20 "This is what I, Yahweh, say: 'You certainly cannot annul my promise\f + \ft Or: agreement \f* to cause nighttime to follow daytime each day.
\v 21 Similarly, you cannot annul the promise\f + \ft Or: agreement \f* that I made with King David, who served me well, that there will always be descendants of his who will rule \add Judah\add*. The same is true for my agreement with the descendants of Levi who are priests who do work for me.
\v 22 No one can count the stars in the sky, and no one can count the grains of sand at the seashore. Similarly, I will cause there to be a huge number of descendants of David and descendants of Levi who will work for me.'~"

\v 19 The word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah and said,
\v 20 “Yahweh says this: 'If you can break my covenant with day and night so that there will no longer be day or night at their proper times,
\v 21 then you will be able to break my covenant with David my servant, so that he will no longer have a son to sit on his throne, and my covenant with the Levitical priests, my servants.
\v 22 As the hosts of heaven cannot be counted, and as the sand of the seashores cannot be measured, it is like that I will increase the descendants of David my servant and the Levites who serve me.'”

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The word of Yahweh came to** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:01|1:2]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **to sit on his throne **- "to rule the kingdom given to him", (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
  * **As the hosts of heaven cannot be counted, and as the sand of the seashores cannot be measured, it is like that I will increase the descendants of David my servant and the Levites who serve me** - These two statements are saying essentially the same thing and used together for emphasis. AT: "As no one can count the stars in the sky and sand on the seashore, in the same way no one will be able to count the descendants of David and Levi who serve Yahweh"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
