\v 19 Then Yahweh gave me this message:
\v 20 "This is what I, Yahweh, say: 'You certainly cannot annul my promise\f + \ft Or: agreement \f* to cause nighttime to follow daytime each day.
\v 21 Similarly, you cannot annul the promise\f + \ft Or: agreement \f* that I made with King David, who served me well, that there will always be descendants of his who will rule \add Judah\add*. The same is true for my agreement with the descendants of Levi who are priests who do work for me.
\v 22 No one can count the stars in the sky, and no one can count the grains of sand at the seashore. Similarly, I will cause there to be a huge number of descendants of David and descendants of Levi who will work for me.'~"

\v 19 Next the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah and said,
\v 20 “Yahweh says this: If you can break my covenant of day and night where there is no longer day or night in their time,
\v 21 then you can break my covenant my covenant with David my servant from his having a son upon his throne and with the Levitical priests, my ministers.
\v 22 As the hosts of heaven cannot be counted and the sand of the sea cannot be measured, thus I will multiply the seed of David my servant and the Levites who minister to me.”
