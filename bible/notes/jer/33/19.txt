===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 Then Yahweh gave me this message:
\v 20 "This is what I, Yahweh, say: 'You certainly cannot annul my promise\f + \ft Or: agreement \f* to cause nighttime to follow daytime each day.
\v 21 Similarly, you cannot annul the promise\f + \ft Or: agreement \f* that I made with King David, who served me well, that there will always be descendants of his who will rule \add Judah\add*. The same is true for my agreement with the descendants of Levi who are priests who do work for me.
\v 22 No one can count the stars in the sky, and no one can count the grains of sand at the seashore. Similarly, I will cause there to be a huge number of descendants of David and descendants of Levi who will work for me.'~"

\v 19 The word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,
\v 20 "Yahweh says this: 'If you can break my covenant with day and night so that there will no longer be day or night at their proper times,
\v 21 then you will be able to break my covenant with David my servant, so that he will no longer have a son to sit on his throne, and my covenant with the Levitical priests, my servants.
\v 22 As the hosts of heaven cannot be counted, and as the sand of the seashores cannot be measured, so I will increase the descendants of David my servant and the Levites who serve before me.'"

  * **my covenant with day and night ... my covenant with David my servant** - No one can change day and night, and no one can change God's covenant with David.
  * **to sit on his throne** - The throne is a metonym for the king who sits on the throne. AT: "to rule the kingdom I have given to him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **As the hosts of heaven cannot be counted, and as the sand of the seashores cannot be measured, so I will increase the descendants of David my servant and the Levites who serve before me** - No one can count the stars in the sky or the sand on the seashore, and no one will be able to count the descendants of David and Levi who serve Yahweh.
