\v 10 Thus says Yahweh: Again it will be heard in this place where you are saying, ‘It is desolate! There is neither man nor beast in the cities of Judah and it is uninhabited 
in the streets of Jerusalem! There is neither man nor inhabitant nor beast!’
\v 11—a sound of rejoicing and celebration, the sound of a bridegroom and a bride! The sound of people who say, ‘Give thanks to Yahweh of hosts, for Yahweh is good! 
For his covenant faithfulness is unending!’ “Bring an offering of thanksgiving to the house of Yahweh, for I will restore the fortunes of the land as in the beginning,” says Yahweh!
