===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The word of Yahweh came** - This is an idiom that is used to introduce something that God told his prophets or his people. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:01|1:2]]. AT: "Yahweh spoke this message" or "Yahweh spoke these words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Have you not considered what this people has declared when they said, 'The ... them'?** - Yahweh wants Jeremiah to think deeply about what the people have said. AT: "You should have noticed what this people are really saying when they said, 'The ... them.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **In this way they despise my people, saying ... sight** - "What they are really saying is that my people are worthless and that my people will never again be a nation."
  * **my people ... are no longer a nation in their sight** - Sight is a metonym for thinking. AT: "they no longer think of my people as a nation" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
