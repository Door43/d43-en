\v 23 Yahweh gave another message to me. He said,
\v 24 "Surely you know that some people are saying, 'Yahweh chose two groups, the people of Judah and the people of Israel, and later abandoned them.' Thepeople who are saying this are despising my people; they are saying that Israel no longer deserves to be considered a nation.

\v 23 The word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah and said,
\v 24 "Have you not considered what this people has declared when they said, 'The two clans that Yahweh chose, now he has rejected them'? In this way they despise my people, saying that they are no longer a nation in their sight.
