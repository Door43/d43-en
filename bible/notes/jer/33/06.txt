\v 6 However, \add there will be a time when\add* I will cause the people in this city to be healthy and strong again. I will enable them to be prosperous and have peace.
\v 7 I will bring the people of Judah and Israel back from the lands to which they were exiled. I will enable them to rebuild their towns.
\v 8 I will get rid of their guilt for all the sins that they have committed against me, and I will forgive them for their sin of rebelling against me.
\v 9 When that happens, all the nations of the world will rejoice, and they will praise me and honor me. They will hear about all the good things that I have done for this city and, because of that, they will revere me, and they will tremble because I have caused \add the people in this city\add* to have peace and to prosper.'

\v 6 But see, I am about to bring healing and a cure, for I will heal them and will bring to them abundance, peace, and faithfulness.
\v 7 For I will bring back the fortunes of Judah and Israel; I will build them up as in the beginning.
\v 8 Then I will purify them from all the iniquity that they have committed against me. I will pardon all the iniquities that they have done against me, and all the ways that they rebelled against me.
\v 9 For this city will become for me an object of joy, a song of praise and honor for all the nations of the earth who will hear of all the good things that I am going to do for it. 
Then they will tremble because of all the good things and the peace that I will give to it.'"
