\v 14 Then Jeremiah went from Topheth, where Yahweh had sent him to prophesy. He stood in the courtyard of Yahweh's house and he said to all the people,
\v 15 "Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this, 'See, I am about to bring to this city and to all of its towns all the disaster that I have proclaimed against it, since they stiffened their neck and
refused to listen to my words.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **See** - AT: "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you"
  * **stiffened their neck and refused to listen** - The phrase "refused to listen" means basically the same thing as "stiffened their neck" and explains how the people did so. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
