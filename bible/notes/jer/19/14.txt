\v 14 Then came Jeremiah from Topheth, whither Jehovah had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of Jehovah’s house,

\v 15 Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will bring upon this city and upon all its towns all the evil
that I have pronounced against it; because they have made their neck stiff, that they may not hear my words.
