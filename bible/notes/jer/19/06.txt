<usfm>
\v 6 So, beware, because I, Yahweh, say that there will be a time when this garbage dump will no longer be called Topheth or Hinnom Valley; it will be called Slaughter Valley.
\p
\v 7 In this place I will ruin the plans of you people who live in Jerusalem and in other places in Judah. I will allow your enemies who want to kill you to kill many of you with their swords. Then I will allow your corpses to remain on the ground to be food for vultures and wild animals.
\v 8 I will \add completely destroy\add* Jerusalem and cause it to become a heap of ruins that people will despise. All the people who pass by will be appalled, and they will be shocked when they see that the city has been destroyed.
\v 9 I will enable your enemies who want to kill you to surround the city for a long time. \add Then the food will be all gone, and you people will be extremely hungry, with the result that\add* you people in the city will eat the flesh of your own children and your neighbors' children.'

\p
\v 6 Therefore, see, the days are coming—this is Yahweh’s declaration—when this place will no longer be called Topheth, the valley of Ben Hinnom, for it will be the valley of Slaughter.
\v 7 In this place I will make the plans of Judah and Jerusalem useless. I will make them to fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hand of the ones seeking their lives. 
Then I will give their corpses as food to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the earth.
\v 8 Then I will make this city a ruin and the object of hissing, for everyone passing by it will shudder and hiss regarding all of its plagues.
\v 9 I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and daughters; each man will consume the flesh of his neighbor in the siege and in the anguish that their enemies and the ones seeking their lives will bring on them."'
