\v 7 In this place I will ruin the plans of you people who live in Jerusalem and in other places in Judah. I will allow your enemies who want to kill you to kill many of you with their swords. Then I will allow your corpses to remain on the ground to be food for vultures and wild animals.
\v 8 I will \add completely destroy\add* Jerusalem and cause it to become a heap of ruins that people will despise. All the people who pass by will be appalled, and they will be shocked when they see that the city has been destroyed.
\v 9 I will enable your enemies who want to kill you to surround the city for a long time. \add Then the food will be all gone, and you people will be extremely hungry, with the result that\add* you people in the city will eat the flesh of your own children and your neighbors' children.'

\v 7 And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before
their enemies, and by the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies will I give to be food for the birds of the
heavens, and for the beasts of the earth.
\v 8 And I will make this city an astonishment, and a hissing; every one that passes thereby shall be astonished and hiss
because of all the plagues thereof.
\v 9 And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters; and they shall eat every one the
flesh of his friend, in the siege and in the distress, wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their life, shall distress
them.
