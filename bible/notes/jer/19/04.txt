<usfm>
\v 4 \add That will happen\add* because you Israelite people have stopped worshiping me, and have caused this place to be a place where \add you worship\add* foreign gods. You burn sacrifices to gods that neither you nor your ancestors nor even the kings of Judah ever heard about. And you have filled this place with the blood of innocent people \add whom you have killed\add*.
\v 5 You have built shrines to honor your god Baal, and at those shrines you have \add killed\add* your own children and offered them to be sacrifices to Baal. I never commanded you to do that, I never spoke about doing that, I never even thought about anyone doing that.

\v 4 Because they have abandoned me and profane this place, and within it draw near to other gods that they did not know! They, their fathers, and the kings of Judah also have filled this place with innocent blood!
\v 5 And they built high places to Ba’al to burn their sons in the fire as burnt offerings to Ba’al, which I did not command! For I did not declare it nor did it arise in my heart!
