====== Jeremiah 19:4-5 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 \add That will happen\add* because you Israelite people have stopped worshiping me, and have caused this place to be a place where \add you worship\add* foreign gods. You burn sacrifices to gods that neither you nor your ancestors nor even the kings of Judah ever heard about. And you have filled this place with the blood of innocent people \add whom you have killed\add*.
\v 5 You have built shrines to honor your god Baal, and at those shrines you have \add killed\add* your own children and offered them to be sacrifices to Baal. I never commanded you to do that, I never spoke about doing that, I never even thought about anyone doing that.

<usfm>
\v 4 I will do this because they have abandoned me and profaned this place. In this place they offer sacrifices to other gods that they did not know. They, their ancestors, and the kings of Judah have also filled this place with innocent blood.
\v 5 They built shrines for Baal in order to burn their sons in the fire as burnt offerings to himâ€”something that I did not command. I did not tell them to do this, nor did it even come up in my heart.
