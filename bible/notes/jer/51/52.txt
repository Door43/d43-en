===== translationNotes: =====

  * **see** - "pay attention" or "listen carefully"
  * **days are coming ... when I will punish** - Future time is spoken of as if the "days are coming." Translate this metaphor as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:07:31|7:32]]. AT: "in the future ... I will punish" or "there will be a time ... when I will punish" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **I will punish her carved idols** - Removing or destroying idols is spoken of as if Yahweh would punish the idols. AT: "I will destroy her carved idols" or "I will remove her carved idols" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **her carved idols ... her land ... Babylon ... her highest fortresses ... to her** - The people of Babylon are spoken of as if they were the city itself, and the city is spoken of as if it were a woman. AT: "their carved idols ... their land ... the Babylonians ... their highest fortresses ... to them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **groan** - to cry out because of pain or sadness
  * **if Babylon went up ... or fortified ... destroyers would come from me** - This is a hypothetical situation that Yahweh does not expect to happen. AT:  "Babylon will not go up ... or fortify ... destroyers will surely come from me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
