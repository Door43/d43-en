<usfm>
\v 9 We \add foreigners\add* would have tried to heal them,
\q2 but now they cannot be healed.
\q1 So we will not try to help them; we will abandon them,
\q2 and return to our own lands,
\q1 because \add it is as though\add* the punishment they are receiving reaches up to the clouds in sky;
\q2 \add it is very great, with the result that no one can measure it\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 10 Yahweh has vindicated us\f + \ft Or: shown that we were right \f*;

\v 9 'We wished to heal Babylon, but she is not healed. Let us all leave her and go away,
\q to our own land. For her guilt reaches up to the heavens; it is piled up to the clouds.
\q
\v 10 Yahweh has declared our innocence. Come, let us tell in Zion
\q the deeds of Yahweh our God.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh used Babylon to punish Judah and the nation. It is either the people of Judah or the people of the nations who are speaking the words in this quotation.

  * **Babylon ... she is not healed ... leave her ... her guilt** - The name of the city is a metonym for the people who live there, and the city is spoken of as if it were a woman. AT: "the people of Babylon ... they are not healed ... leave them ... their guilt" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **she is not healed** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "we have not been able to heal her" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **For her guilt reaches up to the heavens; it is piled up to the clouds** - Guilt is spoken of as if it were an object that could be made into a pile. The words "to the heavens" and "to the clouds" are an exaggeration for something that is very high. AT: "For Babylon is so very guilty" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]]) 
  * **Yahweh has declared our innocence** - Yahweh had punished the Israelites for their sins, but now has let them return to him.
