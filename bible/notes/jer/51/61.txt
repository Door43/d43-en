\v 61 Jeremiah said to Seraiah, “When you go to Babylon, then make sure you read all these words.
\v 62 And you will say, ‘Yahweh, you!—you yourself have declared that you would destroy this place. It will have no inhabitant, either of people or animals. It will be a permanent wasteland.'

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **It will have no inhabitant, either of people or animals** - These animals are those that are normally with people, because Jeremiah 51:37 stated that Babylon will be inhabited by jackals or wild animals.
