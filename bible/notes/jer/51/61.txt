\v 61 Jeremiah said to Seraiah, “When you go to Babylon, then make sure you read all these words.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **She** - This refers to Babylon.
  * **She will have no inhabitant, either of people or animals** - These animals are those that are normally with people, because Jeremiah 51:37 stated that Babylon will be inhabited by Jackals or wild animals.
