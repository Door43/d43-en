===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The speaker speaks as if he were a woman. The woman is a metaphor for the city of Jerusalem, which in turn is a metonym for the people of Jerusalem. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

  * **he has driven me into confusion** - Possible meanings are 1) "he has caused me to be unable to think clearly" or 2) "he has crushed me."
  * **has made me an empty pot** - Babylon has taken everything from Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Like a monster** - Here Babylon is compared to a monster. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **he has swallowed me** - Jerusalem compares its destruction to being swallowed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he has filled his stomach with my delicious foods** - This continues to speak of Babylon as if it were a monster. This states in another way the previous idea that Babylon has taken everything from Israel. Here "foods" represents all the good things that were there before. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **he has spit me out** - Nebuchadnezzar took what he wanted and spit out what he did not want. AT: "he has vomited me up" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **The one ... to me and my flesh ... my blood** - All of these phrases refer to a woman.
