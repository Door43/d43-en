\v 34 Jerusalem says, 'Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has devoured me. He has drained me dry
\q and has made me into an empty pot. He has swallowed me like a dragon.
\q He filled his stomach with my good food. He has rinsed me out.'
\q
\v 35 The inhabitants of Zion will say, 'May the violence done to me and my flesh be on Babylon.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He has drained me dry and has made me into an empty pot** - Babylon has taken everything from Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **He has swallowed me** - Jerusalem compares its destruction to being swallowed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **like a dragon** - This compares Babylon to a dragon. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **He filled his stomach with my good food.** - This states in another way the previous idea that Babylon has taken everything from Israel. "Food" represents all the good things there before. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **He has rinsed me out.** - What Babylon did not like after taking everything he threw away like rinsing out old food out of a cooking pot. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **inhabitants of Chaldea** - AT: "People who live in Chaldea."
