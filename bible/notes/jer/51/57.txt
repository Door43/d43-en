\q
\v 57 For I will make her princes, her sages, her officials, and her soldiers drunk,
\q and they will sleep in an unending sleep and never wake up
\q —this is the King's declaration: Yahweh of hosts is his name.
\q
\v 58 Yahweh of hosts says this: The thick walls of Babylon will be completely demolished,
\q and her high gates will be burned.
\q Then the peoples coming to her aid will labor uselessly; everything that the nations try to do for her will be burned up."
