\q

\q and they will sleep in an unending sleep and never wake up
\q —this is the King's declaration: Yahweh of hosts is his name.
\q
\v 58 Yahweh of hosts says this: The thick walls of Babylon will be completely demolished,
\q and her high gates will be burned.
\q Then the peoples coming to her aid will labor uselessly; everything that the nations try to do for her will be burned up."
