<usfm>
\q
\v 25 See, I am against you, you mountain, you who destroy other people—this is Yahweh's declaration—destroying all the earth.
\q I will strike you with my hand and roll you down from the cliffs.
\q Then I will make you a mountain burned completely through.
\q
\v 26 So they will not take from you any stone to construct a building's corner or foundation;
\q for you will become an everlasting devastation—this is Yahweh's declaration.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **mountain** - Yahweh talks to Babylon as if it were a mountain which he could address as a person. Since mountains were sometimes the homes of bandits, it is possible that Jeremiah had this idea in mind here. See UDB. AT: "strong nation" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **other** - This refers to all the people Babylon has attacked.
  * **cliff** - This is the edge of a mountain.
