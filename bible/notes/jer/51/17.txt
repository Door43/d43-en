\q
\v 17 Every man becomes like an animal without knowledge; every metalworker is put to shame by his idols.
\q For his cast poured images are frauds; there is no life in them.
\q
\v 18 They are useless, the work of mockers; they will perish at the time of their punishment.
\q
\v 19 But God, the portion of Jacob, is not like these, for he is the molder of all things. Israel is the tribe of his inheritance;
\q Yahweh of hosts is his name.
