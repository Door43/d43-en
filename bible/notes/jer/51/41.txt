===== translationNotes: =====

  * **How Babylon has been captured ... How Babylon has become a ruined place** - The word "how" here shows that something that people thought was impossible has happened. This can be stated in active form. AT: "We never thought that enemies could capture Babylon, but they have captured her ... We never thought that Babylon could become a ruined place, but it has become a ruined place" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the praise of all the earth is seized** - The word "praise" is a metonym for the thing that people praised, and the word "earth" is a metonym for the people living on the earth. This can be translated in active form. AT: "enemies have seized Babylon, the nation that everyone on earth praised" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **The sea ... roaring waves** - Babylon's enemies have overcome her. "Waves" represent many people groups overcoming Babylon. The words "sea" and "water" often represent the nations. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **She is covered with its roaring waves** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "Its roaring waves have covered her" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
