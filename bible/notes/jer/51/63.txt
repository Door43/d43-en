\v 63 Then when you have finished reading this scroll, tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Babylon will sink like this** - The stone and scroll will disappear in the water, the water will destroy the scroll, and Babylon will no longer look like a city or have buildings for people to live in. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **will not arise** - "will never again be a city"
  * **they will fall** - This means the Babylonians will fall because they are exhausted. Many translations do not include these words.
