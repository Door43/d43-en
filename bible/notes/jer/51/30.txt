\q
\v 30 The soldiers in Babylon have stopped fighting; they stay in their strongholds.
\q Their strength has failed; they have become women—her homes are on fire, the bars of her gates are broken.
\q
\v 31 A messenger runs to proclaim to another messenger, and a runner tells another runner 
\q to report to the king of Babylon that his city has been taken from end to end.
\q
\v 32 So the fords over the river are seized; the enemy is burning the reed marshes,
\q and Babylon's fighting men are confused."
