\q2 He will cause the loud noises in the city to cease.
\q1
\v 56 Enemy troops will surge against the city like \f + \ft simile \f* a great wave.
\q2 They will capture the city's mighty soldiers

\q
\v 54 A shout of distress came from Babylon, a great collapse from the land of the Chaldeans.
\q
\v 55 For Yahweh is destroying Babylon. He is causing her loud voice to perish.
\q Their enemies roar like the waves of many waters; their noise becomes very strong.
\q
\v 56 For the destroyers have come against her—against Babylon!—and her warriors have been captured.
\q Their bows are broken, for Yahweh is the God of vengeance; he will surely carry out this repayment.
