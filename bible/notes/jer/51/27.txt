  * **Lift up a banner ... Blow the trumpet ... Call ... to attack** - Lifting a banner and blowing a trumpet are both ways of calling people to attack. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **banner** - "flag." This is large flag for the soldiers to follow in battle.
  * **attack her** - The city of Babylon is a metonym for the people of Babylon, and it is spoken of as if it were a woman. AT: "attack the people of Babylon" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Ararat ... Minni ... Ashkenaz** - These are names of nations or people groups. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
