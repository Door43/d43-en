===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jeremiah often wrote prophecy in the form of poetry. Hebrew poetry uses different kinds of parallelism. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **See** - This draws attention to what is said next. AT: "Listen carefully" or "Pay attention"
  * **a wind of destruction** - Possible meanings are 1) "a wind that destroys" or 2) "the spirit of a destroyer." This would mean that Yahweh would cause or inspire the enemy army to go and attack Babylon.
  * **Leb Kamai** - This is code name for Chaldea, a region of Babylonia. It is not clear why Jeremiah uses this name here, so you may want to translate as "Chaldea" or "Babylonia." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **scatter her and devastate her land ... they will come against her** - The word "her," a metaphor that refers to Babylon as if it were a woman, is also a metonym for the people who live in Babylon. AT: "separate the people who live there from each other, send them in different directions, and make their land empty ... foreigners will attack the people of Babylon" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **on the day of disaster** - The phrase "day of" is a Hebrew idiom for "when." AT: "when I destroy Babylon" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
