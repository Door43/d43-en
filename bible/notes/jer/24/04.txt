\v 5 "This is what I, Yahweh, the God whom the Israelite people \add say that they worship\add*, say: The good figs represent \f + \ft simile \f* the people of Judah whom I exiled to Babylonia.
\v 6 I \f + \ft synecdoche \f* will watch over\f + \ft Or: take care of \f* them well, and some day I will bring them back here \add to Judah\add*. I will establish them and cause them to be strong. I will cause them to be prosperous \f + \ft metaphor \f*, and I will not exile them again.
\v 7 I will enable them to desire to know [IDI] in their inner beings that I am Yahweh. They will be my people, and I will be their God, because they will return to me sincerely.

\v 5 "This is what I, Yahweh, the God whom the Israelite people say that they worship, say: The good figs represent  the people of Judah whom I exiled to Babylonia. I sent them there for their own good.
\v 6 and I will not exile them again, instead I will bring them back to this land and let them build up houses and cities again. They will be like plants that grow and prosper and are never cut down.
\v 7 I will enable them to desire to know in their inner beings that I am Yahweh. They will be my people, and I will be their God, because they will return to me sincerely.

\v 4 Then the word of Yahweh came to me and said,
\v 5 "Yahweh, God of Israel, says this: I will look on the exiles of Judah for their benefit, just like these good figs, the exiles whom I have sent out from this place to the land of Chaldea.
\v 6 I will set my eyes on them for good and restore them to this land. I will build them up, and not tear them down. I will plant them, and not uproot them.
\v 7 Then I will give them a heart to know me, for I am Yahweh. They will be my people and I will be their God, so they will turn to me with all their heart.

===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **the word of Yahweh came to** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:01|1:2]].
  * **just like these good figs**  - The good figs are those Judean exiles sent to the land of Chaldea. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **I will set my eyes on them for good**  - AT: "I will bless them." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **I will build them up, and not tear them down. I will plant them, and not uproot them** - These two sentences have similar meanings. The second one strengthens the thought in the first. (See" [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) AT: "I will help them to prosper in Chaldea."
  * **I will build them up, and not tear them down** - This expression compares the exiles to a building which Yahweh will build and not tear down. AT: "I will help them flourish in the land, and not ruin them." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])    
  * **I will plant them, and not uproot them** - AT: "I will establish them in the land, and not remove them." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])    
  * **they will turn to me with all their heart**  - AT: "they will turn to me with their whole being" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
