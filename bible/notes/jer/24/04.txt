\v 4 And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\v 5 Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so will I regard the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out
of this place into the land of the Chaldeans, for good.
\v 6 For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull
them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.
\v 7 And I will give them a heart to know me, that I am Jehovah: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God; for they
shall return to me with their whole heart.
