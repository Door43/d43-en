\v 5 "This is what I, Yahweh, the God whom the Israelite people say that they worship, say: The good figs represent the people of Judah whom I exiled to Babylonia. I sent them there for their own good.
\v 6 and I will not exile them again, instead I will bring them back to this land and let them build up houses and cities again. They will be like plants that grow and prosper and are never cut down.
\v 7 I will enable them to desire to know in their inner beings that I am Yahweh. They will be my people, and I will be their God, because they will return to me sincerely.

\v 4 Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
\v 5 "Yahweh, God of Israel, says this: I will look on the exiles of Judah for their benefit, just like these good figs, the exiles whom I have sent out from this place to the land of Chaldea.
\v 6 I will set my eyes on them for good and restore them to this land. I will build them up, and not tear them down. I will plant them, and not uproot them.
\v 7 Then I will give them a heart to know me, for I am Yahweh. They will be my people and I will be their God, so they will turn to me with all their heart.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,** - This idiom is used to introduce a special message from God. See how you translated it in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:04|1:4]]. AT: "Yahweh gave me a message. He said," or "Yahweh spoke this message to me:" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **I will look on the exiles of Judah for their benefit** - Here "look on" is an idiom that means Yahweh will take care of them. AT: "I will take good care of the exiles of Judah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **just like these good figs** - The good figs represent those Judean exiles sent to the land of Chaldea. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])

  * **I will build them up, and not tear them down. I will plant them, and not uproot them** - These two metaphors have similar meanings. The second one strengthens the thought in the first. AT: "I will help them to prosper in Chaldea" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **I will build them up, and not tear them down** - Yahweh speak of the exiles as a building which Yahweh will build and not tear down. AT: "I will help them flourish in the land, and not ruin them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **I will plant them, and not uproot them** - Yahweh speak of the exiles as plants which Yahweh will plant in good soil and not pull out. AT: "I will establish them in the land, and not remove them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **I will give them a heart to know me** - Here "a heart" refers to their desires. AT: "I will cause them to desire to know me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **they will turn to me with all their heart** - Here "all their heart is an idiom that means "completely." AT: "they will turn to me completely" or "they will turn to me without reservation" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
