\v 4 Then the word of Yahweh came to me and said,
\v5 “Yahweh, God of Israel, says this: I will regard the exiles of Judah, who I have sent out from this place to the land of Chaldea for their good, just like these good figs.
\v 6 And I will set my eyes upon them for good and restore them to this land. I will build them up, and not tear them down. I will plant them, and not uproot them.
\v 7 Then I will give them a heart to know me, for I am Yahweh and they will be my people and I will be their God, so they will turn to me with all their heart!
