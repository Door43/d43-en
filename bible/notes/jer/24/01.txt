\c 24
\p
\v 1 Yahweh showed me something. Behold, two baskets of figs were placed before Yahweh's temple. (This vision happened after Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, took into exile Jehoiachin, son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, the officials of Judah, the craftsmen and the metalworkers from Jerusalem and brought them to Babylon.)
\v 2 One basket of figs was very good, like first ripe figs, but the other basket of figs was so very bad that they could not be eaten.
\v 3 Yahweh said to me, "What do you see, Jeremiah?" I said, "Figs. Figs that are very good and figs that are so very bad they cannot be eaten."
