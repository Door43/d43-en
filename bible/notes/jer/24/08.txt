\v 8 But like the bad figs that are too bad to be eaten—this is what Yahweh says—I will act in this way with Zedekiah, king of Judah, with his officials, and with the rest of Jerusalem who remain in this land or go to stay in the land of Egypt.
\v 9 I will turn them into a frightening thing, a disaster, in the sight of all the kingdoms on earth, a disgrace and a subject for proverbs, taunts, and curses in every place where I will have driven them.
\v 10 I will send out sword, famine, and plague against them they are finished off from the land that I gave them and their ancestors."

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **But like the bad figs that are too bad to be eaten**  - This expression compares bad figs to bad people. Bad figs are figs which cannot be eaten and are useless, bad people do not follow Yahweh and are also useless. (See : [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
    * **I will turn them into a frightening thing, a disaster** - Yahweh compares the coming judgment on the people of Jerusalem to something that will scare other people when they see it. (See : [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])   
    * **I will send out sword, famine, and plague against them** - AT:"I will kill them with war, famine and sicknesses."  
    * **I will send out sword** - AT: "I will send enemy armies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
