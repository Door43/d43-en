\v 20 For you have dealt deceitfully against your own souls; for you sent me to Jehovah your God, saying, Pray for us to
Jehovah our God; and according to all that Jehovah our God shall say, so declare to us, and we will do it.
\v 21 And I have this day declared it to you; but you have not obeyoud the voice of Jehovah your God in anything for which he
has sent me to you.
\v 22 Now therefore know certainly that you shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither
you desire to go to sojourn there.
