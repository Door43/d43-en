\v 22 You want to go to Egypt and live there. So now, you can be sure of this: All of you will die there. Some of you will be killed by the swords \add of your enemies\add* and others will die from famines or from diseases."

\v 20 I know that you were lying when you requested me to pray to Yahweh our God and claimed to be willing to obey everything he said.
\v 21 So today I have told you exactly what he said, but I know that you will not obey Yahweh our God now, just as you have not obeyed him previously.
\v 22 You want to go to Egypt and live there. So now, you can be sure of this: All of you will die there. Some of you will be killed by the swords of your enemies and others will die from famines or from diseases."

<usfm>
\v 20 For you will pay with your lives since you yourselves sent me, Jeremiah, to Yahweh your God and said, ‘Pray for us to Yahweh our God. Everything that Yahweh our God says, tell us and we will carry it out.'
\v 21 For I have reported to you today, but you have not listened to the voice of Yahweh your God or to anything about which he sent me to you.
\v 22 So now, you should certainly know that you will die by sword, famine, and plague in the place where you desired to go to live.”
