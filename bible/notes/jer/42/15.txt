\v 15 now therefore hear you the word of Jehovah, O remnant of Judah: Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, If you
indeed set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there;
\v 16 then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which you fear, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine,
whereof you are afraid, shall follow hard after you there in Egypt; and there you shall die.
\v 17 So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there: they shall die by the sword, by
the famine, and by the pestilence; and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.
