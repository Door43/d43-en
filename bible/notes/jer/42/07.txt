\v 7 Then it happened that after ten days, the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah.
\v 8 So Jeremiah called to Johanan son of Kareah and all the army commanders with him, and to all the people from the least to the greatest.
\v 9 And he said to them, â€œYahweh the God of Israel, to whom you sent me so I might lay your pleas before him. Yahweh says this,
\v 10 'If you go back and live in this land, then I will build you and not tear you down; I will plant you and not pull you up, for I will turn back the disaster that I have brought on you.
