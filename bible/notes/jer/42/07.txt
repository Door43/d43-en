\v 7 And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah.
\v 8 Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, and all the people from
the least even to the greatest,
\v 9 and said to them, Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your supplication before him:
\v 10 If you will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck
you up; for I repent me of the evil that I have done to you.
