\v 4 So Jeremiah the prophet said to them, "I have heard you. Look, I will pray to Yahweh your God as you have requested. Whatever Yahweh answers, I will tell you. I will keep nothing back from you."
\v 5 They said to Jeremiah, "May Yahweh be a true and faithful witness against us, if we do not do everything that Yahweh your God tells us to do.
\v 6 Whether it is good or if it is bad, we will obey the voice of Yahweh our God, to whom we are sending you, so that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of Yahweh our God."
