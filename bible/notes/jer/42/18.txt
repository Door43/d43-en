\p
\v 18 For Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: Just as my wrath and my fury were poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, in the same way my fury will be poured out on you if you go to Egypt. You will become an object of cursing and a horror, an object for speaking curses, and something dishonorable. And you will not see this place again.’"
\v 19 Then Jeremiah said, "Yahweh has spoken concerning you—the remnant of Judah. Do not go to Egypt! You certainly know that I have been a witness against you today.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **as my wrath and my fury** - Both of these words are used to describe great anger. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **my wrath and my fury were poured out** - Emotions are described as something that can be poured like water.  This description expresses that Yahweh will not hold back from punishing the people of Jerusalem. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **an object of cursing and a horror, an object for speaking curses, and something dishonorable.**  - Yahweh is basically saying the same thing twice for emphasis. The phrase "object of cursing" means others would say they want their enemies to be like the people of Jerusalem because the people of Israel are so miserable.(See [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]])
  * **I have been a witness** - Yahweh has been the one who makes sure the people of Israel are punished if they do not keep their promise to obey Yahweh's command.
