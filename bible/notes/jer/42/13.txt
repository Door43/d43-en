\v 13 But suppose that you say, "We will not stay in this land"—if you do not listen to my voice, the voice of Yahweh your God.
\v 14 Suppose that you say, "No! We will go to the land of Egypt, where we will not see any war, where we will not hear the sound of the trumpet, and we will not go hungry for food. We will live there."

  * **if you do not listen to my voice, the voice of Yahweh your God** - To not obey is like the people did not hear Yahweh's command. AT: "if you do not obey my commands, even though I am Yahweh, your God." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **where we will not see any war, where we will not hear the sound of the trumpet** - Both of these phrases described being at war by the ability to see or hear it. AT: "where we will not experience the hardships of war" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **we will not go hungry for food** - Being hungry for food is used to describe famine. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
