===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **if you do not listen to the voice of me, Yahweh your God.**  - To not obey is like the people did not hear Yahweh's command. AT: "if you do not obey my commands, even though I am Yahweh, your God." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **where we will not see any war, where we will not hear the sound of the trumpet** - Both of these phrases described being at war by the ability to see or hear it. AT: "where we will not experience the hardships of war" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **we will not go hungry for food** - Being hungry for food is used to describe famine. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
