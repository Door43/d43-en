===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Johanan ... Kareah** - See how you translated these men's names in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:40:13|40:13]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Jezaniah ... Hoshaiah** - These are the names of men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **all the people from the least to the greatest** - This is a way to refer to people from every social status. Here "least" and "greatest" represent those who are least important and those who are most important. AT: "all the people from every social status" or "all the people, including the least important and the most important people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **all the people** - Most likely not every individual in the town went. The word "all" is a generalization that means very many people went. AT: "many other people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **Let our pleas come before you** - "Let us present our urgent request to you." The abstract noun "pleas" can be stated as a verb. AT: "Listen to our pleas" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
