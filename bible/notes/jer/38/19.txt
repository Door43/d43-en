  * **I might be given over into their hand** - Here "hand" means "control" or "power." AT: "the Chaldeans may give me to the Judeans"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **for them to treat me badly** - Here the word "them" refers to the Judeans.
