\v 7 Now Ebed Melech the Cushite was one of the eunuchs in the king's house. He heard that they had placed Jeremiah in the cistern. Now the king was sitting at the Benjamin Gate.
\v 8 So Ebed Melech went from the king's house and spoke with the king. He said,
\v 9 â€œMy master the king, these men have done evil with the way they have treated Jeremiah the prophet. They threw him into a cistern for him to die in it from hunger, since there is no more food in the city."
