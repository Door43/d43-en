\v 1 And Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of
Malchijah, heard the words that Jeremiah spoke to all the people, saying,
\v 2 Thus says Jehovah, He that remains in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he that
goes forth to the Chaldeans shall live, and his life shall be to him for a prey, and he shall live.
\v 3 Thus says Jehovah, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he shall take
it.
