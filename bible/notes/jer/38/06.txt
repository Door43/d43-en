\v 6 So those officials took me from my cell and lowered me by ropes into a well in the courtyard. The well belonged to Malkijah, who was a son of the king. There was no water in the well, but there was a lot of mud, so I sank down deep into the mud.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **they ... threw him into the cistern** - They literally "lowered Jeremiah down on ropes," but the word "threw" is an exaggeration to say that they treated him roughly. Your language may have another way of saying this. AT: "they ... roughly pushed him into the cistern" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **cistern** - a deep hole in the ground where people collect and store rain water
  * **the courtyard of the guard** - This was an open area attached to the king's palace that was surrounded by buildings and in which they kept prisoners. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:32:01|32:2]].
  * **They lowered Jeremiah down on ropes** - This tells how "they threw him into the cistern."
