\v 24 Then Zedekiah said to me, "Do not tell anyone what you told me; if you tell anyone, the king's officials may kill you.
\v 25 If my officials find out that I talked to you, perhaps they will come to you and say, 'Tell us what you and the king were talking about. If you do not tell us, we will kill you.'
\v 26 If that happens, just tell them that you pleaded with me not to send you back to the dungeon\f + \ft Or: cell \f* in Jonathan's house, \add because you were afraid that\add* you would die \add if you were put there again\add*."

\v 24 Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "Do not inform anyone about these words, so that you do not die.
\v 25 If the officials hear that I have talked with you, and if they come and say to you, 'Tell us what you said to the king and do not hide it from us, or we will kill you,'
\v 26 then you must say to them, 'I made a humble plea before the king that he would not return me to the house of Jonathan to die there.'"
