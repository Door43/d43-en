\v 14 Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet to him into the third entry that is in the house of Jehovah:
and the king said to Jeremiah, I will ask you a thing; hide nothing from me.
\v 15 Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, If I declare it to you, will you not surely put me to death? and if I give you
counsel, you will not listen to me.
\v 16 So Zedekiah the king sware secretly to Jeremiah, saying, As Jehovah liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put you
to death, neither will I give you into the hand of these men that seek your life.
