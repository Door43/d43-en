\v 14 One day King Zedekiah summoned me, and I was brought to the king, \add who was waiting for me\add* at the entrance of the temple. He said to me, "I want to ask you something. I want you to \add answer me truthfully, and\add* and to not conceal anything."
\p
\v 15 I replied, "If I tell you the truth, you will \add command that I\add* be executed. And if I give you good advice, you will not pay attention to what I say."

\v 16 But King Zedekiah secretly promised me, "\add Tell me the truth\add*! And as surely as Yahweh lives, I will not cause you to be executed, and I will not put you into the hands of those who are wanting to kill you."

\v 14 Then King Zedekiah sent word and brought Jeremiah the prophet to himself, to the third entrance in Yahweh's house. The king said to Jeremiah, "I want to ask you something. Do not keep the answer from me."
\v 15 Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "If I answer you, will you not certainly kill me? And if I give you advice, you will not listen to me."
\v 16 But King Zedekiah swore to Jeremiah in private and said, "As Yahweh lives, the one who made us, I will not kill you or give you into the hand of those men who are seeking your life."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **If I answer you, will you not certainly kill me?** - Jeremiah uses this question to express his belief that the king will kill him if he answers truthfully. AT: "If I tell you the truth, you will certainly kill me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **As Yahweh lives, the one who made us** - The king says this to emphasize that what he is about to say next is true.  AT: "Just as it is true that Yahweh, the one who made us, lives, it is true that"
  * **give you into the hand of those men** - Here the word "hand" refers to the men's control or power. AT: "allow those men to capture you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **are seeking your life** - AT: "are trying to kill you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
