\v 22 All the women who are left in the house of you, the king of Judah, will be brought out to the officials of the king of Babylon. Then look! These women will say to you,
\q 'You have been deceived by your friends; they have ruined you.
\q Your feet are now sunk into the mud, and your friends will run away.
\v 23 For all of your wives and children will be brought out to the Chaldeans, and you yourself will not escape from their hand. You will be captured by the hand of the king of Babylon, and this city will be burned."
