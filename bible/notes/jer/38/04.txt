\v 4 Then the princes said to the king, Let this man, we pray thee, be put to death; forasmuch as he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words to them: for this man seeks not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.
\v 5 And Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand; for the king is not he that can do anything against you.
