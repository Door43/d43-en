===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The word of Yahweh came to** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:01|1:2]].
  * **I see an almond branch**  - Yahweh shows Jeremiah a spiritual vision.
  * **almond** - a nut tree (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **for I am watching over my word**  - The Hebrew words for "almond" and "watch over" sound almost the same (see UDB). God wants Jeremiah to remember that God wants his word to succeed every time he sees an almond branch.
