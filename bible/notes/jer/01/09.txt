===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **placed my word in your mouth**  - AT: "given you my message for you to speak to the people."  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
    * **uproot** - pull a plant all the way out of the ground, the opposite of "plant." AT: "destroy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **break down** - the opposite of "build"
    * **destroy ... overthrow**  - Jeremiah uses these words, which mean almost the same thing, to show that this will certainly happen. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
