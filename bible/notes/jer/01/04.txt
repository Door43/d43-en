===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the word of Yahweh came** - This is an idiom that is used to introduce something that God told his prophets or his people. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:01|1:2]]. AT: "Yahweh spoke this message" or "Yahweh spoke these words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **formed** - "developed" or "shaped"
  * **before you came out from the womb** - This can also be expressed without referring to the womb. AT: "before you were born"
  * **Ah, Lord Yahweh** - Here "Ah" shows Jeremiah's fear of doing what God has said.
  * **I do not know how to speak** - Jeremiah may have been exaggerating to show his fear of speaking in public. AT: "I do not know how to speak in public" or "I do not know how to make announcements to people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
