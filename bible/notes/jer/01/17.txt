\v 17 So, get up and put on your clothes \add to get ready for action\add*! Then go to the people of Judah and tell them everything that I tell you to say. Do not be afraid of them, because \add if you are afraid of them\add*, I will cause you to be truly terrified in front of them!
\v 18 But listen! I will cause you to be \add strong, like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a city that has strong walls around it. You will be \add as strong as\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* an iron pillar or a bronze wall. None of the kings or officials or priests will be able to defeat you.
\v 19 They will oppose you, but they will not be able to defeat you, because I will be with you and will protect you. \add That will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it!"

\v 17 So, get up and put on your clothes to get ready for action! Then go to the people of Judah and tell them everything that I tell you to say. Do not be afraid of them, because if you are afraid of them, I will punish you as an example right in front of them!
\v 18 But listen! I will cause you to be strong, like a city that has strong walls around it. You will be as strong as an iron pillar or a bronze wall. Neither the royal officials or priests nor the general populace will be able to defeat you.
\v 19 They will oppose you, but they will not be able to defeat you, because I will be with you and will protect you. That will surely happen because I, Yahweh, have said it!"

<usfm>
\v 17 Get yourself ready! Stand up and say to them whatever I command you. Do not be shattered before them, or I will shatter you before them!
\v 18 See!—today I have made you a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls against the whole land—against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests, and the people of the land.
\v 19 They will fight against you, but they will not defeat you, for I will be with you to rescue you. This is Yahweh's declaration."
