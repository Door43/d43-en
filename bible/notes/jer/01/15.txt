\v 16 I will punish  my people because of all the evil things that they have done; they have abandoned me and they offer offerings of worship to false gods. They worship idols that they have made with their own hands!

\v 15 For behold! I am summoning all the tribes of the northern kingdoms!—this is Yahweh’s declaration—and they will come and set a man on his throne in the door of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls surrounding it, and all the cities of Judah.
\v 16 And I will declare my judgments upon them for all their wickedness, in which they abandoned me and made offerings to other gods and worshiped the works of their hands.
