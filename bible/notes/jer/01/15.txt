<usfm>
\v 15 For I am calling all the tribes of the northern kingdoms, declares Yahweh. They will come, and everyone will set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, against all the walls that surround it, and against all the cities of Judah.
\v 16 I will pronounce sentence against them for all their evil in forsaking me, in burning incense to other gods, and in worshiping what they made with their own hands.

  * **against all the walls that surround it** - Setting their thrones "against all the walls that surround it" represents commanding their armies to destroy the walls surrounding Jerusalem.

  * **against all the cities of Judah** - Setting their thrones "against all the cities of Judah" represents commanding their armies to destroy all the cities of Judah. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
