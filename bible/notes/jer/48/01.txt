===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jeremiah often wrote prophecy in the form of poetry. Hebrew poetry uses different kinds of parallelism. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **To Moab** - Here "Moab" represents the people. AT: "To the people of Moab" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Yahweh of hosts ... says this** - Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:06:06|6:6]].
  * **Woe to Nebo, for it has been devastated** - Here "Nebo" represents the people. AT: "How terrible it is for the people of Nebo, for their city is devastated" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Nebo** - This is the name of a city near Mount Nebo in Moab. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Kiriathaim has been captured and humiliated** - Here "Kiriathaim has been ... humiliated" represents the people being humiliated. This can be stated in active form. AT: "The enemy has captured the city of Kiriathaim and humiliated the people who live there" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])

  * **The honor of Moab is no more** - "People no longer honor Moab" or "People no longer praise Moab"
  * **Heshbon** - This is the name of a city. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Madmen will also perish** - "Madmen" is a town in Moab. The name of the city has nothing to do with the English word "madmen." AT: "Their enemies will destroy the city of Madmen" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]) 
  * **a sword will go after you** - Here "sword" represents the enemy army carrying weapons. AT: "your enemies will chase after you and kill you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
