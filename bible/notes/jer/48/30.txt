\v 32 You people of the city of Sibmah, you have many vineyards, and I will be sad when they are destroyed.

\v 30 This is Yahweh’s declaration: "I myself know his defiant speech, which amounts to nothing, like his deeds.

\q 
\v 31 So I will howl a lament for Moab, and I will shout in sorrow for all of Moab.
\q I will lament for the people of Kir Heresh."
\q
\v 32 I will weep for you more than I did for Jazer, vine of Sibmah! Your branches passed across the Salt Sea and reached  
\q as far as Jazer. The destroyers have attacked your summer fruit and your wine.
