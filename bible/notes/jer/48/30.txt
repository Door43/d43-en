<usfm>
\v 30 I know his wrath, says Jehovah, that it is nought; his boastings have wrought nothing.
\v 31 Therefore will I wail for Moab; yea, I will cry out for all Moab: for the men of Kir-heres shall they mourn.
\v 32 With more than the weeping of Jazer will I weep for thee, O vine of Sibmah: your branches passed over the sea, they
reached even to the sea of Jazer: upon your summer fruits and upon your vintage the destroyer is fallen.
