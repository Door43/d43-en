<usfm>
\v 30 But Yahweh says, "I know about that,
\q2 but it is useless for them to boast
\q2 because it will accomplish nothing.
\q1
\v 31 So now I will wail for Moab;
\q2 I will cry about all its people.
\q2 I will moan for the men of Kir-Hareseth \add city\add*, \add the old capital of Moab\add*.
\q1
\v 32 You people of Sibmah \add city\add*, you have many vineyards.
\q2 \add It is as though\add* the branches of your vines extend across the Dead Sea to Jazer \add city\add*.

\v 31 So now I will wail for Moab;
\q2 I will cry about all its people that they might receive help to survive.
\q2 I will moan for the men of the city of Kir Hareseth, the old capital of Moab.
\q1
\v 32 You people of the city of Sibmah, you have many vineyards, and I will be sad when they are destroyed.
\q2 It is as though the branches of your vines extend across the Dead Sea to the city of Jazer, but the enemies of Moab will take your grapes and wine from you!

<usfm>
\v 30 This is Yahweh’s declaration—I myself know his defiant speech, which amounts to nothing, like his deeds.

\q 
\v 31 So I will howl a lament for Moab, and I will shout in sorrow for all of Moab.
\q I will lament for the people of Kir Heresh.
\q
\v 32 I will weep for you more than I did for Jazer, vine of Sibmah! Your branches passed across the Salt Sea and reached  
\q as far as Jazer. The destroyers have attacked your summer fruit and your wine.
</usfm>
