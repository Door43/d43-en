<usfm>
\q
\v 8 For the destroyer will come to every city; no city will escape.
\q So the valley will perish and the plain will be devastated, as Yahweh has said.
\q
\v 9 Give wings to Moab, for she must certainly fly away.
\q Her cities will become a wasteland, where there is no one to live in them.
\q
\v 10 May anyone who is lazy in doing Yahweh's work be cursed! May anyone who keeps his sword back from shedding blood be cursed!

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For the destroyer will come to every city** - Here "the destroyer" represents the enemy army. AT: "For the enemy army will come to every city and destroy it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **no city will escape** - Here "city" represents the people. AT: "no people from any city will escape" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **So the valley will perish and the plain will be devastated** - Here "valley" and "plain" represent the cities and the people in those places AT: "So the enemy army will destroy everything in the valleys and on the plains" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Give wings to Moab, for she must certainly fly away** - Helping the people is spoken of as if they would put wings on the people so that could fly away. AT: "Help the people of Moab to escape as if you were giving them wings to fly away" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Give wings to Moab, for she must certainly fly away** - The translation of the original language is uncertain. Some Bibles translate this as "Set up a tombstone for Moab, for the enemy will certainly destroy it." Other Bibles translate it as "Put salt on the cities of Moab, for the enemy will completely destroy it." Enemies through salt on ruins to keep thing from ever growing there again.
  * **from shedding blood** - Here "blood" represents a person's life. And "shedding blood" is an idiom that means to kill. AT: "from killing people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
