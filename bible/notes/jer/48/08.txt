\q
\v 8 For the destroyer will come to every city; no city will escape.
\q So the valley will perish and the plain will be devastated, as Yahweh has said.
\q
\v 9 Give wings to Moab, for she must certainly fly away.
\q Her cities will become a wasteland, where there is no one to live in them.
\v 10 May anyone who is lazy in doing Yahweh's work be cursed! May anyone who keeps his sword back from shedding blood be cursed!

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the valley will perish and the plain will be devastated**  - These two phrases share similar meanings and are combined for emphasis. AT: "Towns in the valleys and on the plains will all be destroyed, (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Give wings to Moab** - This command is an exaggeration, because no one can put wings on people. Also, the idea of flying away represents the idea of rapidly running away. AT: "Help the people of Moab escape," "It would be good if the people of Moab had wings and could fly away." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]], [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])  
  * **shedding blood** - AT: "killing people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
