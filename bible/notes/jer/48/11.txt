\q
\v 11 Moab has felt secure since he was young. He is like his wine
\q that has never been poured from pot to pot. He has never gone into captivity.
\q Therefore he tastes as good as ever; his flavor remains unchanged.
\v 12 So see, the days are coming"—this is Yahweh’s declaration—when I will send him those who will tip him over and pour out all his pots and shatter his jars.
