  * **He is like his wine that has never been poured from pot to pot**- The word "he" is the nation of Moab. The nation of Moab is being compared to wine that has not been exiled from its land. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Therefore he tastes as good as ever; his flavor remains unchanged **- These two phrases mean the same thing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **this is Yahweh's declaration **- See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]].
  * ** tip him over and pour out all his pots and shatter his jars** - These two phrase are saying similar things and are combined for emphasis. Both of them refer to the oncoming destruction of the nation of Moab. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
