\v 11 Moab has been at ease from his youth, and he has settled on his lees, and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither has he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remains in him, and his scent is not changed.
\v 12 Therefore, behold, the days come, says Jehovah, that I will send to him them that pour off, and they shall pour him off; and they shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles in pieces.
