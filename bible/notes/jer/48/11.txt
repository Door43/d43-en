\q
\v 11 Moab has felt secure since he was young. He is like his wine
\q that has never been poured from pot to pot. He has never gone into captivity.
\q Therefore he tastes as good as ever; his flavor remains unchanged.
\v 12 So see, the days are coming"—this is Yahweh’s declaration—when I will send him those who will tip him over and pour out all his pots and shatter his jars.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Moab has felt secure since he was young**  - Here "he" refers to the king of Moab. In turn the king represents the entire nation of Moab. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **He is like his wine **- The word "he" is Moab. Moab is being compared to wine that has not been disturbed. (See: Simile)
  * **never been poured from pot to pot - **  This is a metaphor comparing Moab to wine that has been allowed to stay in its jar. (See: Metaphor)
  * **Therefore he tastes as good as ever; his flavor remains unchanged **- These two phrases mean the same thing. (See: Doublet)
  * **So see - **  The words “So see” here alert us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.
