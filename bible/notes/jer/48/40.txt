    * **the enemy will come flying like an eagle, spreading out his wings**  - These phrases compare how a powerful army will descend on Moab and conquer it to the way an eagle swoops down to capture its prey. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
    * **Kerioth**  - a city in Moab.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
    * **Kerioth has been captured, and its strongholds have been seized**  - "The enemy has captured Kerioth and seized its strongholds" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
    * **in that day the hearts of Moab's soldiers ...women in labor** - This phrase compares the fear that will overwhelm the soldiers of Moab to the fear a woman may feel when she is about to give birth to her child. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
