<usfm>
\v 38 There is funeral mourning everywhere! On every flat roof of Moab and within Moab’s open plazas, for I have destroyed Moab like vesses that have no joy within them—this is Yahweh’s declaration.
\q 39 How it is terrified! How they howl with lament! Moab turns the back of its neck to them in shame! So Moab will be a derision and a terror to all those who surround it.
