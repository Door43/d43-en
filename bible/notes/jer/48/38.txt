\v 38 There is mourning everywhere, on every flat roof of Moab and in Moab's plazas. For I have destroyed Moab like pots that no one wants—this is Yahweh's declaration.
\q
\v 39 How it has been shattered! How they howl in their lamenting! Moab turns it back in shame! So Moab will become an object of derision and a terror to all those who are around him."
