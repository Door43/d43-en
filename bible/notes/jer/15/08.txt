<usfm>
\q
\v 8 I will make their widows number more than the sands of the seashore. Against the mothers of young men I will send
\q the destroyer at noonday. I will make shock and horror suddenly fall on them.
\q
\v 9 The mother who has borne seven children will waste away. She will gasp. Her sun will set while it is still day.
\q She will be ashamed and embarrassed, for I will give those who remain to the sword in the presence of their enemies
\q —this is Yahweh's declaration."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh has just told them no one will care about them and that he will destroy his people since they would not turn from their wicked ways.

  * **widows** - women whose husbands have died
  * **more than the sands of the seashore** - "than the grains of sand on the seashore." This comparison is an exaggeration used to emphasize an uncountable number. AT: "more than you can count" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **Against the mothers of young men I will send the destroyer at noonday** - This means that Yahweh will send an enemy army to kill young men, which will cause their mothers great sorrow. AT: "At noonday I will send an enemy army to destroy young men and cause their mothers to weep" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **fall on them** - This is an idiom. AT: "happen to them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **She will be ashamed and embarrassed** - The words "ashamed" and "embarrassed" mean basically the same thing and emphasize the intensity of shame. AT: "She will be completely ashamed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **will waste away** - This is an idiom. AT: "will grow faint" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Her sun will set while it is still day** - This speaks of a woman becoming sorrowful because her children have died, as if her life were a day in which the sun had set early and turned to darkness. Here the darkness represents her sorrow. AT: "Because of her sorrow, it will be as though the sun has set and her day has turned to darkness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will give those who remain to the sword in the presence of their enemies** - Here the "sword" represents the enemy soldiers. This means that Yahweh will allow the enemy solider to kill any of her children that remain. AT: "I will allow the enemy soldiers to kill those of her children that remain alive" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
