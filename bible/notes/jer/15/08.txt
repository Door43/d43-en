<usfm>
\q
\v 8 I will make their widows number more than the sands of the seashore. Against the mothers of young men I will send
\q the destroyer at noonday. I will make shock and horror suddenly fall on them.
\q
\v 9 The mother who has borne seven children will waste away. She will gasp. Her sun will set while it is still day.
\q She will be ashamed and embarrassed, for I will give those who remain to the sword in the presence of their enemies
\q —this is Yahweh's declaration."
