<usfm>
\q
\v 8 Their widows will be countless before me, the sand of the sea! I will send them against the mother of the vigorous man!
\q The destroyer I will suddenly drop the destroyer upon them at noonday! Shock and horrors!
\q
\v 9 The one bearing seven children will languish! Her soul will gasp. Her sun leaves while it is still day;
\q She will be ashamed and embarrassed, for I will give those of them who remain to the sword before their enemies!
\q—this is Yahweh’s declaration.
