\q1 If you proclaim good\f + \ft Or: valuable \f* messages and not worthless ones,
\q2 you will continue to be the one who speaks what I tell you to say.
\q1 You must cause the people to pay attention to what \bd you\bd* say;

\q1
\v 20 They will fight against you,
\q2 but I will protect you, like \f + \ft simile \f* people are protected from their enemies by a bronze wall.
\q1 They will not defeat you,
\q2 because I will be with you,

\q
\v 19 Therefore thus says Yahweh: If you will repent then I will restore you. Stand before me.
\q For if you bring out the noble from the foolish, you will be like my mouth. They will return to you.
\q But you yourself will not return to them!
\q
\v 20 I will make you like an impenetrable brass wall to this people, and they will wage war against you!
\q But they will not prevail against you, for I am with you to save you and to deliver you!—this is Yahweh’s declaration.
\q
\v 21 For I will deliver you from the hand of the wicked and redeem you from the hand of the tyrant.”
