\v 19 Then Yahweh replied to me saying this:
\q1 "If you begin again to \add trust in\add* me,
\q1 I will restore you,
\q2 in order that you can continue to serve me.
\q1 If you proclaim good\f + \ft Or: valuable \f* messages and not worthless ones,
\q2 you will continue to be the one who speaks what I tell you to say.
\q1 You must cause the people to pay attention to what \bd you\bd* say;
\q2 you must not pay attention to what \bd they\bd* say.
\q1
\v 20 They will fight against you,
\q2 but I will protect you, like \f + \ft simile \f* people are protected from their enemies by a bronze wall.
\q1 They will not defeat you,
\q2 because I will be with you,
\q2 and I will protect and rescue \f + \ft doublet \f* you.
\q1
\v 21 Truly, I will keep you safe from those wicked people,
\q2 I will rescue you when you are seized by cruel people.

\q
\v 19 Therefore Yahweh says this: If you repent, Jeremiah, then I will restore you, and you will stand before me and serve me.
\q For if you separate the foolish things from the precious things, you will be like my mouth. The people will come back to you,
\q but you yourself must not go back to them.
\q
\v 20 I will make you like an impenetrable brass wall to this people, and they will wage war against you.
\q But they will not defeat you, for I am with you to save and rescue you—this is Yahweh’s declaration.
\q
\v 21 For I will rescue you from the hand of the wicked and redeem you from the hand of the tyrant.”
