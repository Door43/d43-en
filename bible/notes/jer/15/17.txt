\v 17 When the people were carousing together,
\q2 I never joined them;
\q1 I sat alone, because you \f + \ft metonymy \f* are the one who controls what I do.
\q2 I was very angry with those people because of their sins.
\q1
\v 18 So, why do you \add allow\add* me to continue to suffer?\f + \ft Or: I do not understand why you allow me to continue to suffer. \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\q2 It seems that \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* my wounds cannot be healed.
\q1 \add Sometimes you help me, sometimes you do not help me\add*.
\q2 It seems that you are as undependable as a brook that has water in it only during certain seasons;
\q2 you are like a spring that has dried up."
