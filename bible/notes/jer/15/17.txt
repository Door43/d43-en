===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 When the people were carousing together,
\q2 I never joined them;
\q1 I sat alone, because you \f + \ft metonymy \f* are the one who controls what I do.
\q2 I was very angry with those people because of their sins.
\q1
\v 18 So, why do you \add allow\add* me to continue to suffer?\f + \ft Or: I do not understand why you allow me to continue to suffer. \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\q2 It seems that \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* my wounds cannot be healed.
\q1 \add Sometimes you help me, sometimes you do not help me\add*.
\q2 It seems that you are as undependable as a brook that has water in it only during certain seasons;
\q2 you are like a spring that has dried up."

<usfm>
\q
\v 17 I did not sit in the circle of those who celebrated or rejoiced.
\q I sat in solitude because of your powerful hand, for you filled me with indignation.
\q
\v 18 Why is my pain ongoing and my wound incurable, refusing to be healed?
\q Will you be like deceitful waters to me, waters that dry up?"
