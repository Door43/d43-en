\v 1 Then Yahweh said to me, “If Moses or Samuel were standing before me, my soul would still not be for this people. Send them out from before me, for they will go out.
\v 2 So it will be that they will say to you, ‘To where shall we go out?’ and you will say to them, ‘Thus says Yahweh:
\q Those for death, to death; and those for the sword, to the sword!
\q And those for famine to famine; and those for captivity, to captivity!’
