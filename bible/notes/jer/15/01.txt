\v 1 Then Yahweh said to me, "Even if Moses or Samuel were standing in front of me, I would still not be in favor of this people. Send them out from before me, for them to go away.
\v 2 It will happen that they will say to you, 'Where should we go?' Then you must say to them, 'Yahweh says this:
\q Those destined for death should go to death; those destined for the sword should go to the sword.
\q Those destined for famine should go to famine; and those destined for captivity should go to captivity.'

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jeremiah has just been praying to Yahweh.

  * **Send them out from before me, for them to go away**  - "Send them away from me! Let them go forth!" He repeats this idea for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Those destined for death**  - AT: "The people whom God said must die" or "the ones certain to die"
