===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh has just told them he will assign them to four groups to kill them—the sword, dogs, birds, and beasts.

  * **For who will have compassion for you, Jerusalem? Who will grieve for you? Who will turn to ask about your welfare?** - Yahweh uses this rhetorical question to emphasize that no one should mourn for Jerusalem. This question can be written as a statement. AT: "No one should have compassion on you, Jerusalem. No one should mourn for your destruction. No one should ask about your well-being." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **for you, Jerusalem** - Here "Jerusalem" refers to the people who live there. AT: "you people who live in Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **You have forsaken me ... you have gone back from me** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that the people have, indeed, forsaken Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **gone back from me** - "left me" or "gone away from me" 
  * **I will strike you with my hand** - Here "hand" represents power. AT: "I will use my power to strike you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **So I will winnow them with a pitchfork at the gates of the land** - Here Yahweh speaks of scattering the people and causing them to leave Jersalem as if they were winnowed chaff being blown away on the wind. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **pitchfork** - a farm tool with a long handle and sharp metal prongs, used especially for lifting and tossing grain in the air for winnowing
  * **I will bereave them** - "I will cause their children to die" or "I will let their enemies kill their children"
