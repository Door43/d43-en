===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 I said to my mother, "I am very sad;
\q1 I wish that you had not given birth to me;
\q2 everyone in this land opposes me and quarrels with me.
\q1 I am not a person who lends \add money to people and threatens to sue\f + \ft Or: harm \f* them if they do not pay me back when they should\add*,
\q2 and I am not a person who borrows \add money from others and then refuses to pay it back\add*,
\q1 but everyone \f + \ft hyperbole \f* curses me."
\p
\v 11 But Yahweh replied to me,
\q1 "Jeremiah, I will take care of you.
\q1 And at times when your enemies have troubles and disasters,
\q2 they will \add come to you and\add* plead for you \add to help them\add*.
\q1
\v 12 And Judah's enemies, who are \add as strong as\add* iron or bronze, \add will attack Judah\add* from the north,
\q2 no one will be able to stop them.

\v 10 I said to my mother, "I am very sad;
\q1 I wish that you had not given birth to me;
\q2 everyone in this land opposes me and quarrels with me.
\q1 I have not made anyone angry by lending or borrow money and then quarreling about it,
\q2 but everyone curses me anyway."
\p
\v 11 But Yahweh replied to me,
\q1 "Jeremiah, I will take care of you.
\q1 And at times when you have the most troubles,
\q2 I will come on your behalf and protect you from your enemy.
\q1
\v 12 But Judah's enemies, who are as strong as iron or bronze, will attack Judah from the north,
\q2 no one will be able to stop them.

<usfm>
\q
\v 10 Woe to me, my mother! For you have borne me, I who am a man of controversy and argument through all the land.
\q I have not lent, nor has anyone lent to me, but they all curse me.
\q
\v 11 Yahweh said: "Will I not rescue you for good?
\q I will certainly make your enemies beg for help in the time of calamity and distress.
\q
\v 12 Can one smash iron? Especially iron from the north that is mixed with bronze?

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh has just announced his punishment for Israel.

  * **Woe to me, my mother** - Jeremiah pretends to speak to his mother as a way to emphasize how sad he is. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
  * **controversy and argument** - The words "controversy" and "argument" mean basically the same thing. They are used together for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **lent** - to give a loan to someone
  * **Will I not rescue you for good?** - The implicit answer to this question is "yes". AT: "I will certainly rescue you for good!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **your enemies** - Those are the enemies of Jeremiah who disagreed with his prophecies.
  * **calamity and distress** - The words "calamity" and "distress" should be understood as basically similar. The idea is repeated to emphasize how bad things will get. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Can one smash iron?** - The implied answer is "no". Also, the iron represents the firmness of God's judgment. AT: "My judgment cannot be broken, just like iron cannot be smashed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Especially iron from the north that is mixed with bronze?** - This second question makes the first even stronger, and uses extra strong iron in the metaphor. AT: "Even more, my judgment is like super strong iron" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
