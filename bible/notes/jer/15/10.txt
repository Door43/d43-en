====== Jeremiah 15:10-12 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 I said to my mother, "I am very sad;
\q1 I wish that you had not given birth to me;
\q2 everyone in this land opposes me and quarrels with me.
\q1 I am not a person who lends \add money to people and threatens to sue\f + \ft Or: harm \f* them if they do not pay me back when they should\add*,
\q2 and I am not a person who borrows \add money from others and then refuses to pay it back\add*,
\q1 but everyone \f + \ft hyperbole \f* curses me."
\p
\v 11 But Yahweh replied to me,
\q1 "Jeremiah, I will take care of you.
\q1 And at times when your enemies have troubles and disasters,
\q2 they will \add come to you and\add* plead for you \add to help them\add*.
\q1
\v 12 And Judah's enemies, who are \add as strong as\add* iron or bronze, \add will attack Judah\add* from the north,
\q2 no one will be able to stop them.
\q1

\v 10 I said to my mother, "I am very sad;
\q1 I wish that you had not given birth to me;
\q2 everyone in this land opposes me and quarrels with me.
\q1 I have not made anyone angry by lending or borrow money and then quarreling about it,
\q2 but everyone curses me anyway."
\p
\v 11 But Yahweh replied to me,
\q1 "Jeremiah, I will take care of you.
\q1 And at times when you have the most troubles,
\q2 I will come on your behalf and protect you from your enemy.
\q1
\v 12 People of Judah, you know how strong iron is when it is mixed with bronze, 
\q2 it is very hard and good for weapons. 
\q1 That iron mixed with bronze metal is just like the strength of your enemies when they attack Judah from the north,
\q2 no one will be able to stop them.

\q
\v 10 Woe to me, my mother! For you have borne me, I who am a man of controversy and argument through all the land.
\q I have not lent, nor has anyone lent to me, but they all curse me.
\q
\v 11 Yahweh said: "Will I not rescue you for good?
\q I will certainly make your enemies beg for help in the time of calamity and distress.
\q
\v 12 Can one smash iron? Especially iron from the north that is mixed with bronze?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In these verse, Jeremiah speaks to Yahweh about his suffering, and Yahweh answers him.

  * **Woe to me, my mother** - Jeremiah pretends to speak to his mother as a way to emphasize how sad he is. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
  * **a man of controversy and argument** - The words "controversy" and "argument" mean basically the same thing. Together they emphasize how much Jeremiah is arguing. AT: "a man with whom everyone argues all the time" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **I have not lent, nor has anyone lent to me** - This refers to lending money to people. Often lending money causes people to fight with one another. AT: "I have not lent money to anyone, nor has anyone lent money to me" or "I have not made anyone angry by lending or borrow money and then quarreling about it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Will I not rescue you for good?** - The implicit answer to this rhetorical question is "yes." This question can be written as a statement. AT: "I will certainly rescue you for good!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **your enemies** - Those are the enemies of Jeremiah who disagreed with his prophecies.
  * **in the time of calamity and distress** - Here the words "calamity" and "distress" mean basically the same thing. They emphasize the amount or intensity of the calamity. AT: "in the time of great calamity" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Can one smash iron? Especially iron from the north that is mixed with bronze?** - In these questions Yahweh speaks of the strength of Judah's enemies as if they were iron mixed with bronze. These rhetorical questions can be written as a statement. AT: "No one can smash iron, especially if it is as strong as the iron from the north that is mixed with bronze." or "But Judah's enemies, who are as strong as iron or bronze, will attack Judah from the north, no one will be able to stop them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
