\v 3 For I will assign them to four groups—this is Yahweh's declaration—the sword to slaughter some, the dogs to drag some away, the birds of the skies and the
beast of the earth to consume and destroy some.

  * **For I will assign them to four groups** - This means that Yahweh will send four groups to work together to get rid of the people. AT: "For I will send four groups to get rid of them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]].

  * **the sword** - Here the "sword" refers to the enemy soldiers. AT: "the enemy soldiers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I will make of them** - Here the word "them" refers to the people of Judah, not to the four groups listed in the previous verse.
  * **because of what Manasseh ... did in Jerusalem** - Manasseh was a very wicked king who did many evil things in Jerusalem. AT: "because of the wicked things that Manasseh ... did in Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
