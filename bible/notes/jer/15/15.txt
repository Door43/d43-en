<usfm>
\q
\v 15 Yahweh, you know! Remember me and help me. Bring vengeance for me against those who persecute me.
\q You are patient, but do not allow them to take me away; know that I suffer reproach for your sake. 
\q
\v 16 Your words have been found, and I consumed them. Your words became to me a joy
\q and the delight of my heart, 
\q for I bear your name, Yahweh, God of hosts.
