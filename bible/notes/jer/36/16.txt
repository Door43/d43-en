\v 16 Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward another, and said to Baruch, We
will surely tell the king of all these words.
\v 17 And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How did you write all these words at his mouth?
\v 18 Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.
\v 19 Then said the princes to Baruch, Go, hide thee, you and Jeremiah; and let no man know where you are.
