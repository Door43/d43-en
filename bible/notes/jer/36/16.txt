\v 16 It happened that when they heard all these words, each man turned in fear to the one next to him and said to Baruch, "We must certainly report all of these words to the king."
\v 17 Then they asked Baruch, "Tell us, how did you come to write all these words at Jeremiah's dictation?"
\v 18 Baruch said to them, "He dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them in ink on this scroll."
\v 19 Then the officials said to Baruch, "Go, hide yourself, and Jeremiah, too. Do not let anyone know where you are."
