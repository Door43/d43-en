\v 4 Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Jehovah, which
he had spoken to him, upon a roll of a book.
\v 5 And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of Jehovah:
\v 6 therefore go you, and read in the roll, which you have written from my mouth, the words of Jehovah in the ears of the people in Jehovah’s house upon the fast-day; and also you shall read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities.
