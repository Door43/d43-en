\v 27 After the king had burned the scroll on which were written the messages that I had dictated to Baruch, Yahweh said this to me:
\v 28 "Get another scroll, and \add tell Baruch to\add* write everything again, the same messages that he had written on the scroll that the king burned.
\v 29 Then go to the king and say to him, 'Yahweh says this: You burned the scroll because \add you did not like\add* what was written on it, that the king of Babylon would surely \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* come \add with his army\add* and destroy this land and get rid of all the people and the animals.

\v 27 Then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah after the king had burned the scroll and the words that Baruch had written at Jeremiah's dictation, saying,
\v 28 "Go back, take another scroll for yourself, and write in it all the words that were on the original scroll, the one that Jehoiakim king of Judah burned.
\v 29 Then you must say this to Jehoiakim king of Judah: 'You burned that scroll, saying, "Why have you written on it, 'The king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, for he will destroy both man and beast in it'?"'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah after ... dictation, saying,** - The idiom "The word of Yahweh came" is used to introduce a special message from God. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:04|1:4]]. AT: "Then Yahweh gave a message to Jeremiah after ... dictation. He said," or "After ... dictation, Yahweh spoke this message to Jeremiah:" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **to Jeremiah ... Jeremiah's dictation** - It is not clear why Jeremiah is referring to himself by name here. You may translate using first person, as the UDB does. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **at Jeremiah's dictation** - See how you translated similar words in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:36:04|36:4]].
  * **Go back, take another scroll for yourself** - "Take another scroll for yourself again"
  * **the original scroll** - "the first scroll"
  * **Why have you written on it ... beast in it'?** - Jehoiakim uses this question to emphasize that Jeremiah should not have written that the king of Babylon would come and attack. AT: "You should not have written ... beast in it!" or "You were wrong to write ... beast in it'!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **for he will destroy** - "and he will destroy"
