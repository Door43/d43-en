\v 1 When Jehoiakim had been the king of Judah for almost four years, Yahweh gave this message to me:
\v 2 "Get a scroll, and write on it the messages that I have given to you regarding Israel, Judah, and the other nations. Write all of the messages, starting from the time that I gave you the first message, when Josiah was the king, up until now.
\v 3 When the people of Judah hear again about all the disasters that I plan to cause them to experience, perhaps each one of them will repent. If they do that, I will be able to forgive them for the wrong\f + \ft Or: evil \f* things that they have done."

\v 1 And so it was in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah the king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh and said,
\v 2 “Take a recording scroll for yourself and inscribe uon it all the words that I have declared to you concerning Israel and Judah, and every nation! From the day I declared to you in the days of Josiah until this day!
\v 3 Perhaps the house of Judah will listen to all the calamities that I am planning to do to them so that each man will turn from his wicked way and I can forgive their iniquity and their sin.”
