===== Translation Notes: =====

Jeremiah continues to give instructions to Baruch.
  * **Perhaps** - "Maybe"
  * **their pleas for mercy** - The word "their" refers to the people in the house of Yahweh and the people of Judah who had come to the house of Yahweh from their cities.
  * **their pleas for mercy will come before Yahweh** - AT: "Yahweh will pay attention to their pleas for mercy." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Perhaps each person will turn from his wicked way** - "Maybe they will repent; each person from his wicked way"
  * **from his wicked way** -  See how you translated "from his wicked path" in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:18:11|18:11]].
  * **the wrath and fury** - "the anger and rage"
