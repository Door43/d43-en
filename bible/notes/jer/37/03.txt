\v 3 So King Zedekiah, Jehucal son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah son of Maaseiah the priest sent a message to Jeremiah the prophet. They said, “Pray on our behalf 
to Yahweh our God.”
\v 4 Now Jeremiah was coming and going among the people, for he had not yet been put in prison.
\v 5 Pharaoh’s army came out from Egypt, and the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard the news about them and left Jerusalem.
