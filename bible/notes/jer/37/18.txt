\v 18 Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, "How have I sinned against you, your servants, or this people so that you have placed me in prison?
\v 19 Where are your prophets, the ones who prophesied for you and said the king of Babylon will not come against you or against this land?
\v 20 But now listen, my master the king! Let my pleas come before you. Do not return me to the house of Jonathan the scribe, or I will die there."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **How have I sinned against you ... prison?** - Jeremiah uses this question to emphasize that he has not done anything wrong. AT: "I have not done anything wrong to you ... prison." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **this people** - the people of the kingdom of Judah
  * **have placed** - "have put"
  * **Where are your prophets, the ones who prophesied ... against this land?** - Jeremiah uses this question to emphasize that the other prophets were lying but that he had done nothing wrong because he had told the truth. AT: "Your prophets who prophesied ... against this land were obviously wrong, but now it is clear that I was telling you the truth." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **your prophets** - The word "your" refers to King Zedekiah and the other people of the kingdom of Judah.
  * **will not come against you or against this land** - "will not attack you or attack this land"
  * **Let my pleas come before you** - "Hear me plead for mercy and do as I ask." See how you translated "their pleas for mercy will come before Yahweh" in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:36:07|36:7]].
  * **the house of Jonathan the scribe** - "the house of Jonathan, who is a scribe." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:37:14|37:15]].
