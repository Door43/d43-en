\v 14 Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I am not falling away to the Chaldeans. But he listened not to him; so Irijah laid hold
on Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.
\v 15 And the princes were angry with Jeremiah, and struck him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe; for
they had made that the prison.
