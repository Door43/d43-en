\v 6 Then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
\v 7 "Yahweh, God of Israel, says this: This is what you will say to the king of Judah, because he has sent you to seek advice from me, 'See, Pharaoh's army, which came to help you, is about to go back to Egypt, its own land.
\v 8 The Chaldeans will return. They will fight against this city, capture it, and burn it.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah the prophet, saying,** - The idiom "the word of Yahweh came to" is used to introduce a special message from God. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:04|1:4]]. AT: "Yahweh gave a message to Jeremiah the prophet. He said," or "Yahweh spoke this message to Jeremiah the prophet:" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **you will say** - The word "you" refers to the two men that king Zedekiah had sent to Jeremiah, Jehukal son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah son of Maaseiah the priest. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **to seek advice from me** - The word "me" refers to Yahweh.
  * **See** - "Listen" or "Pay attention"
  * **They will fight against this city, capture it, and burn it** - Compare how you translated "to wage war against it and take it, and to burn it" in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:34:20|34:22]].
