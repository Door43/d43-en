\v 11 When the army from Babylonia left Jerusalem because the army from Egypt was approaching,

\v 13 But as I was walking out the Benjamin Gate, a guard seized me and said, "You are deserting \add us and going\add* to \add the soldiers from\add* Babylonia!" The man who seized me was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah and grandson of Hananiah.

\v 11 So it was when the Chaldean army had left Jerusalem as Pharaoh's army was coming,
\v 12 then Jeremiah went out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin. He wanted to take possession of a tract of land there among his people.
\v 13 As he was in the Benjamin Gate, a chief guard was there. His name was Irijah son of Shelemiah son of Hananiah. He grabbed hold of Jeremiah the prophet and said, "You are deserting to the Chaldeans."
