\v 11 So it was when the Chaldean army had left Jerusalem as Pharaohs army was coming,
\v 12 then Jeremiah went out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin. He wanted to take possession of a tract of land there among his people.
\v 13 As he was standing at the Benjamin Gate, a chief guard was there. His name was Jeriah son of Shelemiah, son of Hananiah. He grabbed hold of Jeremiah 
the prophet and said, “You are deserting to the Chaldeans.”
