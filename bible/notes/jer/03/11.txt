===== translationNotes: =====


  * **Faithless Israel has been more righteous than faithless Judah!** - By calling Israel "more righteous" than Judah, God emphasizes that Judah is very guilty. AT: "Israel has been unfaithful to me, but Judah is even more guilty than Israel"
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **Go and proclaim these words to the north** - Here the north represents the people of Israel who had been taken north to Assyria. AT: "Go and proclaim these words to the people of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
