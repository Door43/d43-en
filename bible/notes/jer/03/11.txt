\v 11 Then Yahweh said to me, "Faithless Israel has been more righteous than faithless Judah!
\v 12 Go and proclaim these words to the north. Say,
\q 'Return, faithless Israel!—this is Yahweh's declaration—I will not always be angry with you.
\q Since I am faithful—this is Yahweh's declaration—I will not stay angry forever.
