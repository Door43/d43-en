\v 3 That is why I have not sent you any rain at the times of the year when you needed it.
\q1 But you are like prostitutes \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\q2 who are not at all ashamed \add for what they have done\add*.
\q1
\v 4 Now each of you says to me, 'You are my father!
\q2 You have loved me ever since I was young!
\q1
\v 5 So surely you will not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* be angry with me forever!'
\q1 But you will not quit sinning!"

\q
\v 3 So the spring rains were withheld and the late rains did not come.
\q But your face is arrogant, like a promiscuous woman's face. You refuse to feel shame.
\q
\v 4 Have you not just now called to me: 'My father! My closest friend even from my youth!
\q
\v 5 Will he always be angry? Will he always keep his wrath to the end?'
\q Look! This is what you have said, but you do all the evil you can!"
