====== Jeremiah 03:3-5 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 That is why I have not sent you any rain at the times of the year when you needed it.
\q1 But you are like prostitutes \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\q2 who are not at all ashamed \add for what they have done\add*.
\q1
\v 4 Now each of you says to me, 'You are my father!
\q2 You have loved me ever since I was young!
\q1
\v 5 So surely you will not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* be angry with me forever!'
\q1 But you will not quit sinning!"

\v 3 That is why I have not sent you any rain at the times of the year when you needed it.
\q1 But you are like prostitutes
\q2 who are not at all ashamed for what they have done.
\q1
\v 4 Now each of you says to me, 'You are my father!
\q2 You have loved me ever since I was young!
\q1
\v 5 So surely you will not be angry with me forever!'
\q1 You promised you would not obey me, and you did what you said! 
\q2 And you sinned over and over again! 
\q1 But you will not quit sinning!"

<usfm>
\q
\v 3 So the spring rains were withheld and the late rains did not come.
\q But your face is arrogant, like a promiscuous woman's face. You refuse to feel shame.
\q
\v 4 And now will you not call out to me: 'My father! My closest friend even from my youth!
\q
\v 5 Will he be angry with me forever? Will you always keep your anger?'
\q Look! You have proclaimed you would commit evil, and you have committed it. So continue to do it!"
