<usfm>
\q
\v 3 So the spring rains were withheld and the late rains did not come.
\q But your face is arrogant, like a promiscuous woman's face. You refuse to feel shame.
\q
\v 4 Will you not call out to me from this time on, 'My father! You are my closest friend from my youth.
\q
\v 5 Will you be angry forever? Will you always keep your anger?'
\q Look! You have proclaimed you would commit evil, and you have committed it. So continue to do it!‚Äù
