\c 3
\q
\v 1 They say, “A man sends his wife away, so she goes from him and becomes another man’s wife. 
\q Should he return to her again? Is she not completely unclean?” That woman is this land!
\q You have acted like a whore with many allies, and now do you want to return to me? This is Yahweh’s declaration.
\q
\v 2 Lift up your eyes to the barren heights and look! Where have you not been ravished? 
\q By the roadsides you sat waiting for your lovers, like a nomad in the wilderness.
\q You have polluted the land with your prostitution and wickedness.
