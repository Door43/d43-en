\v 1 "I, Yahweh, instructed Moses to write that if a man divorces his wife and then she marries another man, her first husband certainly must not  take her back again to be his wife, because that would certainly  cause the whole nation to become unacceptable to me. But you have more idols than prostitutes have men whom they have slept with! So, why should I accept you if you return to me?—says Yahweh.
\v 2 Look up at the barren hilltops. On every hilltop there are  idols that you have worshiped. It is as though they are all lovers with whom you have slept. It is as though you have sat along the roadsides like an Arab, waiting to attack and steal things from those who pass by. Because of worshiping idols and all the other wicked things that you have done, you have caused the entire land to become unacceptable to me.

\c 3
\q
\v 1 "They say, 'A man sends his wife away, so she goes from him and becomes another man’s wife. 
\q Should he return to her again? Is she not completely unclean?' That woman is this land!
\q You have acted like a whore with many allies, and now do you want to return to me?—this is Yahweh’s declaration.
\q
\v 2 Lift up your eyes to the barren heights and look! Where have you not been ravished? 
\q By the roadsides you sat waiting for your lovers, like a nomad in the wilderness.
\q You have polluted the land with your prostitution and wickedness.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking in the previous chapter, Jeremiah 2


  * **Is she not completely unclean?**  - AT: "She is completely unclean." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **That woman is this the people of this land!** - "This land is like that woman!" That is, Yahweh taking the people of Judah back is like a man taking back the wife he earlier divorced. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **You have acted like a prostitute**  - "You have given your love and trust to idols the way a prostitute gives her body to men not her husband" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **do you want to return to me?** - AT: "I will not accept you when you try to come back to me." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **This is Yahweh's declaration** - See how you translated this idea in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]].
  * **Lift up your eyes** - "Look up" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Where have you not been ravished?** - "You are like a woman who goes everywhere and lets men seize her and sleep with her!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **nomad** - homeless robber
