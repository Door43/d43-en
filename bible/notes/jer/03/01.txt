\q1 because that would certainly \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* cause the whole nation to become unacceptable to me.

\v 1 They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man’s, will he return to her again? will
not that land be greatly polluted? But you have played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, says Jehovah.
\v 2 Lift up your eyes to the bare heights, and see; where have you not been lain with? By the ways have you sat for them,
as an Arabian in the wilderness; and you have polluted the land with your whoredoms and with your wickedness.
