\c 3
\q
\v 1 They say, “A man sends his wife away, so she goes from him and becomes another man’s wife. 
\q Will he return to her again? Is she not completely unclean?” She is this land!
\q You have acted like a whore with many allies, and return to me.—this is Yahweh’s declaration.
\q
\v 2 Lift up your eyes to the plain and look. Where have you not laid? 
\q You have dwelt with them along the ways like an Arabian in the desert and you have defiled the land,
\q With your whoredoms and your wickedness!
