\q
\v 13 Acknowledge your iniquity, for you have transgressed against Yahweh your God;
\q you have shared your ways with strangers under every leafy tree!
\q For you have not listened to my voice!—this is Yahweh's declaration.
\q
\v 14 Return, faithless people!—this is Yawheh's declaration—for I have married you!
\q I will take you, one from a city, two from a clan, and I will bring you to Zion!
\v 15 I will give you shepherds after my heart, and they will shepherd you with knowledge and insight.
