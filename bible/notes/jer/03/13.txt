\q
\v 13 Acknowledge your iniquity, for you have transgressed against Yahweh your God;
\q you have shared your ways with strangers under every leafy tree!
\q For you have not listened to my voice!—this is Yahweh's declaration.
\q
\v 14 Return, faithless people!—this is Yawheh's declaration—I am your husband!
\q I will take you, one from a city and two from a family, and I will bring you to Zion!
\v 15 I will give you shepherds after my heart, and they will shepherd you with knowledge and insight.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Acknowledge your iniquity** - "Admit how you have sinned." God was speaking to Israel. 
  * **you have shared your ways with strangers under every leafy tree!** - The word "strangers" refers to foreign gods. God speaks of Israel worshiping foreign gods as if Israel were a woman who was having sex with strangers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **under every leafy tree** - People would worship idols under trees. The word "every" is a generalization used to show that the people of Israel worshiped many gods under many different trees. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **you have not listened to my voice** - Here "listened" represents obeying, and "my voice" represents what God has said. AT: "you have not obeyed what I have said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **I am your husband** - God speaks of Israel belonging to him as if he were Israel's husband. AT: "you belong to me as a wife belongs to her husband" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will give you shepherds ... they will shepherd you** - Here God speaks of leaders as if they were shepherds and the people they led were sheep. AT: "I will give you leaders ... they will lead you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **shepherds after my heart** - Here "heart" represents Yahweh's desire or will. The phrase "after my heart" is an idiom that describes people who do God's will. AT: "shepherds who do my will" or "shepherds who do what I want" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
