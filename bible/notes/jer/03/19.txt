\q an inheritance more beautiful than what is in any other nation!' I would have said, 'You will call me "my father".'

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **As for me** - the word "me" refers to Yahweh
    * **honor you as my son... like a woman**  - This change from male to female is for great emphasis. 
    * **This is Yahweh's declaration** - See how you translated this idea in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]].
