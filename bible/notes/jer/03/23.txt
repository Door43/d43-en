\v 23 Truly in vain is the help that is looked for from the hills, the tumult on the mountains: truly in Jehovah our
God is the salvation of Israel.
\v 24 But the shameful thing has devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons
and their daughters.
\v 25 Let us lie down in our shame, and let our confusion cover us; for we have sinned against Jehovah our God, we and our
fathers, from our youth even to this day; and we have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God.
