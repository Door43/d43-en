<usfm>
\v 23 We did not get any help from \add the idols that\add* we worshiped on the hilltops,
\q2 we did not get any help from making all that noise up there.
\q1
\v 24 From the time when we were young, the shameful god Baal has taken away from us everything that our ancestors worked hard to acquire.
\q2 He has taken away their flocks \add of sheep\add* and herds \add of cattle\add*, their sons and their daughters.
\q1
\v 25 So, now we should lie down feeling very ashamed \f + \ft doublet \f*,
\q2 because we and our ancestors have sinned against Yahweh our God,
\q1 and we have never obeyed him."

\v 23 We did not get any help from the idols that we worshiped on the hilltops, we did not get any help from making all that noise up there.
\q We now recognize that Yahweh our God is the only way Israel will be saved!

<usfm>
\v 23 Only lies come from the hills, from the many mountains.
\q Certainly the salvation of Israel is only in Yahweh our God.
\q
\v 24 Yet shameful idols have consumed what our ancestors have worked forâ€”
\q their flocks and cattle, their sons and daughters!
\q
\v 25 Let us lie down in shame. May our shame cover us, for we have sinned against Yahweh our God!
\q We ourselves and our ancestors, from the time of our youthfulness to this present day, have not listened to the voice of Yahweh our God!"

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **Only lies come from the hills** - The people, continuing to speak from the previous verse, expect guidance and gain from idol worship but only find lies.  (See:[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
    * **Let us lie down in shame. May our shame cover us** - AT:""We are ready to throw ourselves upon the ground in bitter humiliation." This thought is repeated for emphasis.  (See:[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **the time of our youthfulness** - "the beginning of the nation"
    * **the voice of Yahweh** - AT: "what Yahweh says".  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
