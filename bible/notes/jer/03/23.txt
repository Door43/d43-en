===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 23 We did not get any help from \add the idols that\add* we worshiped on the hilltops,
\q2 we did not get any help from making all that noise up there.
\q1
\v 24 From the time when we were young, the shameful god Baal has taken away from us everything that our ancestors worked hard to acquire.
\q2 He has taken away their flocks \add of sheep\add* and herds \add of cattle\add*, their sons and their daughters.
\q1
\v 25 So, now we should lie down feeling very ashamed \f + \ft doublet \f*,
\q2 because we and our ancestors have sinned against Yahweh our God,
\q1 and we have never obeyed him."
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 23 When we worshiped idols on the mountains, we did not get any help. 
\q2 Even though we shouted very loudly in our worship, every promise we believed turned out to be lies and only lies. 
\q1 We now know that trusting in Yahweh our God is the only way Israel will be rescued!

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 23 Surely lies come from the hills, a confusing noise from the mountains; 
\q surely Yahweh our God is the salvation of Israel.
\q
\v 24 Yet shameful idols have consumed what our ancestors have worked for—
\q their flocks and cattle, their sons and daughters!
\q
\v 25 Let us lie down in shame. May our shame cover us, for we have sinned against Yahweh our God!
\q We ourselves and our ancestors, from the time of our youthfulness to this present day, have not listened to the voice of Yahweh our God!"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Surely lies come from the hills** - Here "the hills" represent the people's worship of false gods on the hills. The people now realize that those false gods could not guide and help them. AT: "The false gods that we worshiped on the hills could not guide us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **a confusing noise from the mountains** - People made a lot of noise on the hills and mountains when they worshiped false gods. AT: "We made a confusing noise on the mountains while we worshiped them, but they did not help us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **surely Yahweh our God is the salvation of Israel** - "surely Yahweh our God is the savior of Israel" or "surely Yahweh our God is the only one who can save Israel"
  * **shameful idols have consumed what our ancestors have worked for** - This represents the people of Israel losing many of their possessions because they offered them to the idols. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **their flocks and cattle, their sons and daughters** - This is a list of animals and people that the people of Israel had killed and offered to the idols.
  * **Let us lie down in shame. May our shame cover us** - These phrases share similar meanings and emphasize that the people are fully aware of their shameful behavior. AT: "Let us be completely humiliated" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **May our shame cover us** - Being fully aware of their shame is spoken of as if shame were covering them like a blanket or a garment. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **from the time of our youthfulness** - Possible meanings are that 1) "the time of our youthfulness" refers to when each person was young. AT: "from when we were young" or 2) "the time of our youthfulness" is a metaphor that refers to when Israel was first becoming a nation. AT: "from when we were first becoming a nation" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **have not listened to the voice of Yahweh our God** - Here "listened" represents obeying, and "the voice of Yahweh" represents what Yahweh has said. AT: "have not obeyed what Yahweh our God has said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
