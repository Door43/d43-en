====== Jeremiah 03:6-7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 \add One day\add* when Josiah was the king of Judah, Yahweh said to me, "Have you seen what the people of Israel have done? They have turned away from me, like a woman who has abandoned her husband and sleeps with other men. They have gone up on every hilltop and under every big tree and worshiped idols there \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 7 I thought that they would return to me, so I said to them, 'Come back to me!' But they refused. So I sent them away \add to other countries, like a man\add* writes a note saying that he is divorcing his wife and then sends his wife away because she has committed adultery \f + \ft metaphor \f*.

\v 6 One day when Josiah was the king of Judah, Yahweh said to me, "Have you seen what the people of Israel have done? They have turned away from me, like a woman who has abandoned her husband and sleeps with other men. They have gone up on every hilltop and under every shady tree and worshiped idols there.
\v 7 I thought that they would return to me, but they did not. And their brothers, the people of Judah, were watching all of this.

\v 6 Then Yahweh said to me in the days of Josiah the king, "Do you see what faithless Israel has done? She has gone up every high hill and under every leafy tree, and there she has acted like a prostitute.
\v 7 I said, 'After she does all these things, she will return to me,' but she did not return. Then her faithless sister Judah saw these things.
