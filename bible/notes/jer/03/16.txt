<usfm>
\v 16 Then it will happen that you will increase and bear fruit in the land in those days—this is Yahweh's declaration-they will no longer say, "The ark of the covenant of Yahweh!" This matter will no longer come up in their hearts or be remembered; it will not be missed, and another one will not be made.'

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **you will increase and bear fruit** - The word "you" refers to the people of Israel. The phrase "bear fruit" is a metaphor for having many descendants. AT: "you will increase greatly in number" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **This matter will no longer come up in their hearts** - Here "come up in their hearts" represents thinking about it. AT: "They will no longer think of this matter" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
