===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 Then it will happen that you will increase and bear fruit in the land in those days—this is Yahweh’s declaration. They will no longer say, "The ark of the covenant of Yahweh!" This matter will no longer come up in their hearts, for they will no longer think about it or pay attention to it. This statement will no longer be made.’

===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **will increase and bear fruit** - The phrase "bear fruit" is an idiomatic way of saying that they will "increase" in number. AT: "will increase greatly in number." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
