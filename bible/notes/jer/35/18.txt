\v 18 Jeremiah said to the family of the Rechabites, “Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: You have listened to the commands of Jonadab your ancestor and have kept them all—you have obeyed all that he commanded you to do—
\v 19 so Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: 'There will always be someone descended from Jonadab son of Rechab to serve me.'”
