\v 18 Then I turned to the Rechab clan and said, "This is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels the God whom we Israelites \add say we belong to\add*, says: 'You have obeyed what your ancestor Jehonadab told you. You have obeyed all his instructions.
\v 19 Therefore, this is what I say: "There will always be descendants of Jehonadab who will do work for me."~'~"

\v 18 Then Jeremiah turned to the Rekab clan and said, "This is what Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, the God whom Israel worships, says: 'You have obeyed what your ancestor Jonadab told you. You have obeyed all his instructions.
\v 19 Therefore, this is what Yahweh says: "There will always be descendants of Jonadab who will do work for me."'"

\v 18 Jeremiah said to the family of the Rekabites, "Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: You have listened to the commands of Jonadab your ancestor and have kept them all—you have obeyed all that he commanded you to do—
\v 19 so Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this, 'There will always be someone descended from Jonadab son of Rekab to serve me.'"
