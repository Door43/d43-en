\v 15 I sent out to you all my servants, the prophets. I was persistent in sending them to say, “Let each person turn from his wicked way and do good deeds; let no one walk any longer walk after other gods and worship them. Instead, come back to the land that I gave to you and your ancestors. Yet you will not listen to me or pay attention to me.”
\v 16 For the descendants of Jonadab son of Rechab have observed the commands of their ancestor that he gave them, but this people refuses to listen to me.'
