\v 12 Then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah and said,
\v 13 “Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: Go and say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, ‘Will you not receive correction and listen to my words?'
—this is Yahweh’s declaration.
\v 14 'The words of Jonadab son of Rechab that he gave to his sons as a command, not to drink any wine, have been observed to this very day. They have obeyed their ancestor's command. But as for me, I myself have been making persistent proclamations to you, but you do not listen to me.
