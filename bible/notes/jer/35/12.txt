\v 12 So the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah and said,
\v 13 “Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel, says this: Go and say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, ‘Will you not receive correction and listen to my words?
—this is Yahweh’s declaration.

their father! But I myself have declared to you being persistent to declare, but you would not listen to me!
