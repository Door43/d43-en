====== Jeremiah 35:5-7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 I set jugs of wine in front of them and urged them to drink some,
\v 6 but they refused. They said, "We do not drink wine, because our ancestor Jehonadab, the son of Rechab, commanded us, saying 'You and your descendants must never drink wine.
\v 7 And you must not build houses or plant vineyards or other crops. Instead, you must always live in tents. If you obey those commands, you all will live for many years in this land.'
</usfm>

\v 5 I set jugs of wine and some cups in front of them and urged them to drink some,
\v 6 but they refused. They said, "We do not drink wine, because our ancestor Jonadab, the son of Rechab, commanded us, saying 'You and your descendants must never drink wine.
\v 7 And you must not build houses or plant vineyards or other crops. Instead, you must always live in tents. If you obey those commands, you all will live for many years in this land.'

<usfm>
\v 5 Then I placed bowls and cups full of wine in front of the Rechabites and said to them, “Drink wine!”
\v 6 But they said, “We will not drink wine, for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us and said, ‘Do not drink wine! Neither you nor your sons, forever!
\v 7 Also, do not build houses, sow seeds, or plant vineyards; this will not be for you. For you will live in tents all of your days so that you might live many days on the face of the land where you sojourn.’
