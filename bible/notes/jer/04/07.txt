<usfm>
\v 7 An army that has destroyed many nations will attack you
\q2 like a lion that comes out of its den to attack other animals.
\q1 The soldiers of that army
\q2 are already marching toward your land.
\q2 They will destroy your cities and leave them without any people still living in them.
\p
\v 8 So, put on rough clothes
\q1 and weep and beat your breasts
\q2 to show that you are very sorry for what you have done,

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 A lion is coming out from his thicket and someone who will destroy nations is setting out.
\q He is leaving his place to bring horror to your land,
\q to turn your cities into ruins, where no one will live.
\v 8 Because of this, wrap yourself in sackcloth, lament and wail. For the force of Yahweh's anger has not turned away from us.
