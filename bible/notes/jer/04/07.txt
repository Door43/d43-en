===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 An army that has destroyed many nations will attack you like  a lion that comes out of its den to attack other animals. The soldiers of that army are already marching toward your land. They will destroy your cities and leave them without any people still living in them.
\v 8 So, put on rough clothes and weep and beat your breasts to show that you are very sorry for what you have done, because Yahweh is still very angry with us.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 A lion goes up from his thicket and one who destroys nations sets out. He goes out from his place to bring horror to your land, your ruined cities where there is none inhabiting them!
\v 8 Because of this, wrap yourself in sackcloth; lament and wail! For the anger of the wrath of Yahweh has not turned away from us!
</usfm>
