\v 27 So thus says Yahweh: All the land will be a devastation, but I will not make an annihilation!
\v 28 For this reason, the land will mourn and the heavens above will darken; because I have declared my intentions and I will not relent, nor will I turn from it.
\v 29 Every city will flee from the noise of the cavalry and the archers with a bow; they will go into forests! Every city will go up into quarries! They will be abandoned, for there will be no man who inhabits them!
</usfm>
