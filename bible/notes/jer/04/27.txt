\v 27 This is what Yahweh says, "All the land will become a devastation, but I will not completely destroy them.
\v 28 For this reason, the land will mourn, and the heavens above will darken. For I have declared my intentions; I will not hold back; I will not turn from carrying them out.
\v 29 Every city will flee from the noise of the cavalry and the archers with a bow; they will run into the forests. Every city will climb up into the rocky places. The cities will be abandoned, for there will be
no one to inhabit them.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **land will mourn, and the heavens above will darken** - Jeremiah emphasizes Yahweh's judgment by saying that the earth itself expresses great sorrow. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **cavalry** - a group of soldiers riding horses
  * **Every city will flee ... Every city will climb up** - This emphasizes that all of the people will be running away. 
  * **The cities will be abandoned, for there will be no one to inhabit them** - These two clauses have similar meanings. The second one strengthens the thought in the first. AT: "There will be no one left in the cities." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
