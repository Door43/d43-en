===== translationNotes: =====

  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **the hearts of the king and his officials will die** - Here "hearts" represent courage. Also "the hearts ... will die" represents losing courage  and being afraid. AT: "the king and his officials will stop being courageous" or "the king and his officials will be terrified" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the sword is striking against their life** - Here enemies being ready to kill people is spoken of as if the sword was a person striking at people. AT: "our enemies are ready to slaughter us with their swords" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
