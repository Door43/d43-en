\v 23 I saw the land, and see! It was formless and empty. For there was no light for the heavens.
\v 24 I looked at the mountains. Behold, they were trembling, and all the hills were shaking about.
\v 25 I looked. Behold, there was no one, and all the birds of the heavens had fled.
\v 26 I looked. Behold, the orchards were a wilderness and all the cities had been pulled down before Yahweh, before the fury of his wrath."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I saw the land, and see!**  - This is an invitation for Jeremiah to look at the vision God is giving him.
  * **formless and empty**  - This vision is a prophecy of what the land of Israel would be like after the people were all taken into captivity.
  * **Behold**  - The word "behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.
