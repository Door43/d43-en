\v 4 Be circumcised to Yahweh and remove the foreskins of your heart, men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, or else my fury will go out like fire and burn, with no one able to quench it. This will happen because of the wickedness of your deeds.
\v 5 Report in Judah and let it be heard in Jerusalem. Say, ‘Blow the trumpet in the land.’ Proclaim, ‘Gather together. Let us to go the fortified cities.’
\v 6 Lift up the signal flag and point it toward Zion, and run for safety. Do not stay, for I am bringing disaster from the north and a great collapse.
