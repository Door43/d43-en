===== translationNotes: =====

  * **If you return, Israel** - Here "return" is a metaphor for changing who they worship, and Israel is a metonym representing the people of Israel. The people had been worshiping idols rather than Yahweh. AT: "If you will come back, people of Israel" or "If you will change who you worship, people of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **then it should be to me that you return** - Possible meanings are that 1) this is a command that emphasizes who they should return to. AT: "then come back to me" or "then worship me" 1) this is a repetition of the first phrase, which expresses a condition. AT: "if you will come back to me" or "if you will start worshiping me again" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **If you remove your detestable things from before me** - Here "detestable things" refers to idols, which God hates. AT: "If you remove your disgusting idols from my presence" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **do not wander from me again** - Here "wander" is a metaphor for being unfaithful. AT: "if you remain faithful to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **As Yahweh lives** - "As surely as Yahweh is alive." The people use this expression to show that what they say next is certainly true. This is a way of making a solemn promise. AT: "I solemnly swear" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **the nations will bless themselves in him** - Here "the nations" is a metonym for people of other nations. The word "him" refers to Yahweh. Since Yahweh is speaking, it can also be translated as "me." AT: "people of other nations will bless themselves in me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **the nations will bless themselves in him** - Here "bless themselves in him" is a metonym for asking Yahweh to bless them. AT: "the people of the nations will ask Yahweh to bless them"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **in him they will glory** - The word "him" refers to Yahweh. Since Yahweh is speaking, "him" can also be translated as "me." AT: "they will boast in me" or "they will praise me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **Plow your own ground, and do not sow among thorns** - Yahweh tells the people to prepare their lives like a farmer prepares the ground for planting. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
