  * **then it should be to me that you return** - Possible meanings are that 1) this is a repetition of the first phrase: "if you will return to me," AT: "then come back to me" or "then start worshiping me again," or 2) this is a command, "then return to me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Yahweh's declaration** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]].
