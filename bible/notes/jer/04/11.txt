\v 11 In that time it will be said of this people and Jerusalem, "A burning wind from the plains of the desert will make its way to the daughter of my people. It will not winnow or cleanse them.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **it will be said** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh will say"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **burning wind from the plains ... wind far stronger** - Here a "burning wind" represents a fierce and merciless enemy. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **will make its way** - "will travel" or "will rush"
  * **the daughter of my people** - Yahweh shows his love for his people by speaking of them as a daughter. AT: "my people, who are like a daughter to me" or "my dear people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **It will not winnow or cleanse them** - The words "winnow" and "cleanse" refer to blowing away the useless skins from grain. Only a light wind was needed for that. AT: "It will not be a light wind for blowing the chaff away from the grain" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **will come at my command** - "will come when I command it to come"
  * **at my command** - This expression in Hebrew is interpreted by some modern versions as "for me" or "from me." 
  * **pass sentence against them** - "announce their punishment"
