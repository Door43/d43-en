\v 16 Make the nations think about this: See, announce to Jerusalem that besiegers are coming from a distant land to shout in battle against the cities of Judah.
\v 17 They will be like the watchmen of a cultivated field against her all around, since she has been rebellious against me. This is Yahweh’s declaration.
\v 18 Your conduct and your deeds have done these things to you. This will be your punishment. How terrible it will be! It will strike your very heart.
