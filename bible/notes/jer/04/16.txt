\v 16 Make the nations think about this. See. Let it be proclaimed against Jerusalem: watchmen are coming from a distant land and raise their voices against the cities of Judah.
\v 17 They are like keepers of a field against her all around, since she has been rebellious against me.—this is Yahweh’s declaration.
\v 18 Your way and your deeds have done these things to you. This is your wickedness, and it is bitter since it will strike your heart.
