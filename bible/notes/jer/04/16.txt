\v 16 Cause the nations to remember! Behold! Let it be heard against Jerusalem: the watchmen come from a distant land and set their voice against the cities of Judah.
\v 17 They are like keepers of a field against her all around, since she has been rebellious against me.—this is Yahweh’s declaration.
\v 18 Your way and your deeds have done these things to you. This is your wickedness, for it is bitter since it will strike your heart.
