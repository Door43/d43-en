\v 19 Then I said to myself, "I am extremely anguished;
\q2 the pain in my inner being is very severe.
\q2 My heart beats wildly!
\q1 But I cannot remain silent
\q2 because I have heard our enemies blowing their trumpets
\q2 to announce that the battle against Judah will start immediately!
\q1
\v 20 Disasters will occur one after another
\q2 until the whole land is ruined.
\q1 Suddenly all our tents will be destroyed;
\q2 even the curtains inside the tents will be ripped apart.

\v 19 My heart! My heart! I am in anguish in my heart. My heart is turbulent within me. I cannot keep quiet for I hear the sound of the horn, an alarm for battle.
\v 20 Disaster follows after disaster; for all the land lies in ruins. Suddenly my tents are destroyed, my curtains in a moment.
