\v 19 Then I said to myself, "I am extremely anguished;
\q2 the pain in my inner being is very severe.
\q2 My heart beats wildly!
\q1 But I cannot remain silent
\q2 because I have heard our enemies blowing their trumpets
\q2 to announce that the battle against Judah will start immediately!
\q1
\v 20 Disasters will occur one after another
\q2 until the whole land is ruined.

\v 19 My heart! My heart! I am in anguish in my heart. My heart is turbulent within me. I cannot keep quiet for I hear the sound of the horn, an alarm for battle.
\v 20 Collapse after collapse is proclaimed, for all the land is suddenly devastated. They devastate my tabernacle and my tent abruptly.
