===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **How long will I see the standard? Will I hear the sound of the horn?** - These two sentences have similar meanings. The second one strengthens the thought in the first. (See: Parallelism and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Retorical questions]]) AT: "I wish this war would end soon."
    * **idiotic people** - "stupid people"
