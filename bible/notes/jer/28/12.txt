\v 14 I have forced the people of all these nations to \add become slaves of\add* King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. That is like \f + \ft metaphor \f* an iron yoke around their necks. I have put everything, even wild animals, under his control.'~"

\v 12 After Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah and said,
\v 13 "Go and speak to Hananiah and say, 'Yahweh says this: you broke a yoke of wood, but I will make instead a yoke of iron.'
\v 14 For Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: I have placed a yoke of iron on the neck of all of these nations to serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and they will serve him. I have also given him the wild beasts in the fields to rule over."
