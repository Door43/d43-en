\v 15 Next Jeremiah the prophet said to Hananiah the prophet, “Listen Hananiah! Yahweh has not sent you, but you yourself have caused this people to believe in lies.
\v 16 So Yahweh says this: 'Look I am about to send you out from the earth. You will die this year, since you proclaimed rebellion against Yahweh.”
