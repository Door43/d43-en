\v 15 Then said the prophet Jeremiah to Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah: Jehovah has not sent thee; but you make
this people to trust in a lie.
\v 16 Therefore thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will send you away from off the face of the earth: this year you shall die,
because you have spoken rebellion against Jehovah.
\v 17 So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.
