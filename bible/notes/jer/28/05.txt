\v 5 So Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Hananiah the prophet in front of the priests and to all the people who stood in Yahweh's house.
\v 6 Jeremiah the prophet said, "May Yahweh do this! May Yahweh confirm the words that you prophesied and  bring back to this place the objects belonging to Yahweh's house, and all the captives from Babylon.
\v 7 However, listen to the word that I am proclaiming in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people.
