\q
\v 9 The heart is more deceitful than anything; it is sick, and who is the man that can know it?
\q
\v 10 I am Yahweh, who searches through the heart! Who examines the innards;
\q To give to each man what he deserves, punishing him for the fruit of his deeds!
\q
\v 11 A partridge hatches an egg but did not bear it! One makes riches, but unjustly!
\q In the midst of his days they abandon him and he will be a fool in his end!
