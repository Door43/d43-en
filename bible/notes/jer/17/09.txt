\v 9 The heart is deceitful above all things, and it is exceedingly corrupt: who can know it?
\v 10 I, Jehovah, search the mind, I try the heart, even to give every man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his
doings.
\v 11 As the partridge that sits on eggs which she has not laid, so is he that gets riches, and not by right;
in the midst of his days they shall leave him, and at his end he shall be a fool.
