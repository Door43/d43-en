\q
\v 9 The heart is more deceitful than anything else. It is sick; who can understand it?
\q
\v 10 I am Yahweh, the one who searches through the mind, who tests the heart.
\q I give to each person what he deserves, punishing him for the fruit of his deeds.
\q
\v 11 A partridge hatches an egg that she did not lay. Someone may become rich unjustly. 
\q But in his prime of life, those riches will abandon him and he will be a fool in the end."
