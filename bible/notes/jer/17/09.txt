\q
\v 9 The heart is more deceitful than anything else. It is sick; who can understand it?
\q
\v 10 I am Yahweh, the one who searches through the mind, who tests the kidneys.
\q I give to each person according to his ways, according to the fruit of his deeds.
\q
\v 11 A partridge hatches an egg that she did not lay. Someone may become rich unjustly,
\q but when half his days are over, those riches will abandon him, and in the end he will be a fool."
