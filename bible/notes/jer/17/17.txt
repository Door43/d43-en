===== translationNotes: =====

  * **You are my refuge** - Jeremiah speaks of Yahweh as a place where enemies cannot attack him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **on the day of calamity** - "in times of calamity" 
  * **May my pursuers be ashamed, but do not let me be ashamed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Bring shame on my pursuers, but do not bring shame on me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **May they be dismayed, but do not let me be dismayed** - This phrase means basically the same thing as the previous one and adds emphasis to Jeremiah's prayer. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Make them very afraid, but do not make me afraid" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **shatter them with a double share of destruction** - Jeremiah speaks of Yahweh destroying his enemies as if they were objects that Yahweh would shatter. The idiom "a double share" means to give twice as much. AT: "shatter them with complete destruction" or "destroy them twice as much" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
