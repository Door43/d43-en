<usfm>
\v 21 He says, "Listen to this warning carefully! Stop \add doing work on Sabbath\f + \ft Or: our rest \f* days\add*! Stop carrying loads through these gates on those days!
\v 22 Do not carry loads out of your houses or do any other work on Sabbath days! Instead, cause Sabbath days to be holy\f + \ft Or: set apart for me \f*. I commanded your ancestors to do that,
\v 23 but they did not listen to me or obey me. When I did things to correct them, they stubbornly [IDI] refused to pay attention to what I said or to accept it.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 21 He says, "Listen to this warning carefully if you want to live! Stop doing work on Sabbath days! Stop carrying loads through these gates on those days!
\v 22 Do not carry loads out of your houses or do any other work on Sabbath days! Instead, cause Sabbath days to be holy. I commanded your ancestors to do that,
\v 23 but they did not listen to me or obey me. When I did things to correct them, they stubbornly refused to pay attention to what I said or to accept it.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 21 Yahweh says this: "Keep your lives and do not carry a burden on the Sabbath day to bring it to the gates of Jerusalem.
\v 22 And do not bring a load out from your house on the Sabbath day. Do not do any work, but sanctify the Sabbath day, just as I commanded your ancestors to do."'
\v 23 They did not listen or pay attention, but stiffened their neck so they would not hear me nor accept discipline.
</usfm>
