\v 26 And people will come \add to Jerusalem\add* bringing offerings to be completely burned \add on the altar\add* and other offerings. They will bring to the temple grain offerings and incense and offerings to thank \add me\add*. People will bring these offerings from the towns in Judah and the villages near Jerusalem and from the land where the tribe of Benjamin lives and from the western foothills and from the desert in the south.
\v 27 But if you do not pay attention to what I say, and if you refuse to dedicate the Sabbath days to me, and if you continue to carry loads through these gates into the city on Sabbath days, I will burn these gates completely. The fire will spread to the palaces, and no one will be able to put out that fire."~'~"

\v 26 And they will come from the cities of Judah and all around Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin and the lowlands, from the mountain and from the Negev, bringing a burnt offering, 
a sacrifice, and a food offering and frankincense! And bringing a thanksgiving offering to the house of Yahweh!
\v 27 But if you will not listen to me, to sanctify the Sabbath day and to lift up a burden and bring it to the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, then I will kindle a fire in its gate and 
it will consume the stronghold of Jerusalem that will not be extinguished!’”
