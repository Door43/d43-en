\v 12 So I spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah and gave him this message, "Place your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him and his people, and you will live.
\v 13 Why will you die—you and your people—by the sword, famine, and plague, just as I have declared about the nation that refuses to serve the king of Babylon?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to speak through Jeremiah to the king of Judah.

  * **Place your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon** - Being the king's slave is spoken of as being an animal onto the shoulders of which the king puts a yoke so it can do heavy work. See how similar words were translated in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:28:08|27:8]].
  * **Place your necks** - The word "your" refers to Zedekiah and the people of Judah and so is plural. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **Why will you die ... king of Babylon?** - Jeremiah uses this question to warn the king that his actions will lead to his death. AT: "You act as if you want to die ... king of Babylon." or "You will surely die ... king." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
