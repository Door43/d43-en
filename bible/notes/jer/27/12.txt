\v 12 So I spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah and gave him this message: “Place your necks into the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him and his people, and you will live.
\v 13 Why will you die—you and your people—by the sword, famine, and plague, just as I have declared about the nation that refuses to serve the king of Babylon?

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to speak through Jeremiah to the king of Judah.

  * **Quit listening to your...** God is telling them to stop listening to all the false prophets that do not speak for Yahweh.
  * **Place your necks into the yoke of the king of Babylon** - God is requiring Judah to submit and serve Babylon as their king.
  * **Why will you die—you and your people—by the sword, famine, and plague, just as I have declared about the nation that refuses to serve the king of Babylon?** -  AT: "You will die, you and your people, by the sword, famine, and plague, just as I have declared, if you do not serve the king of Babylon." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
