===== Translation Notes: =====

  *  **Jehoiakim son of Josiah** - Some translations use Zedekiah instead of Jehoiakim.
  * **fetters** - This is something to keep a person from moving freely.
  * **Then send them out** - Jeremiah was to send a set of fetters and yoke to each king listed.
  * **Give commands to them for their masters** - Jeremiah was instructed to give a set of chains and yoke to each ambassador and a message for each king regarding the chains and yoke.
