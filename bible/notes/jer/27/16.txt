\v 16 Then I spoke to the priests and the other people, and I said, "This is what Yahweh says: 'Do not believe your prophets who tell you that all the gold items \add that were taken\add* from my temple \add by soldiers from Babylon\add* will soon be returned from Babylon, because what they are prophesying is a lie.
\v 17 Do not pay attention to what they say. Surrender to the king of Babylon. If you do that, you will remain alive. \add If you do not do that\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*, this entire city will be destroyed.
\v 18 If they are really prophets who speak messages from me, tell them to plead to me, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, that \add the soldiers from Babylon\add* will not be allowed to take away to Babylon the valuable items that still remain in the temple and in the king's palace and in \add the other palaces in\add* Jerusalem.

\v 16 And I declared this to the priests and all the people and said, “Yahweh says this: do not listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you and say, ‘Look! The vessels of the 
house of Yahweh are being returned from Babylon now! Hurry!’, for they are prophesying deceit to you.
\v 17 Do not listen to them. Serve the king of Babylon and live! Why should this city become a ruin?
\v 18 For if they are prophets and if the word of Yahweh has come to them, let them entreat Yahweh of hosts not to send the vessels that remain in the house of Yahweh, the house of the 
king of Judah, and Jerusalem to Babylon!
