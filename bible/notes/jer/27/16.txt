\v 16 Then I spoke to the priests and the other people, and I said, "This is what Yahweh says: 'Do not believe your prophets who tell you that all the gold items \add that were taken\add* from my temple \add by soldiers from Babylon\add* will soon be returned from Babylon, because what they are prophesying is a lie.
\v 17 Do not pay attention to what they say. Surrender to the king of Babylon. If you do that, you will remain alive. \add If you do not do that\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*, this entire city will be destroyed.
\v 18 If they are really prophets who speak messages from me, tell them to plead to me, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, that \add the soldiers from Babylon\add* will not be allowed to take away to Babylon the valuable items that still remain in the temple and in the king's palace and in \add the other palaces in\add* Jerusalem.

\v 16 Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus says Jehovah: Listen not to the words of your prophets
that prophesy to you, saying, Behold, the vessels of Jehovah’s house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon; for
they prophesy a lie to you.
\v 17 Listen not to them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: wherefore should this city become a desolation?
\v 18 But if they be prophets, and if the word of Jehovah be with them, let them now make intercession to Jehovah of hosts,
that the vessels which are left in the house of Jehovah, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to
Babylon.
