<usfm>
\v 9 So, do not pay attention to your \add false\add* prophets and fortune-tellers and people who predict what will happen by working magic or by talking with spirits of dead people. Those people say that the king of Babylon will not conquer your country.
\v 10 Those people are all liars. \add If you believe what they say\add*, it will result in your being exiled from your land. I will cause you to be taken from your land, and you will die far away.
\v 11 But the people of any country who do what the king of Babylon wants them to do will remain in their own country and be able to plant their crops \f + \ft metonymy \f* as they always have done. \add That will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it."

<usfm>
\v 9 And you! Quit listening to your prophets, your diviners, your seers, soothsayers, and sorcerers who have been speaking to you and saying, 'Do not serve the king of Babylon.'
\v 10 For they are prophesying deceit to you in order to send you far away from your lands, for I will drive you away, and you will die.
\v 11 But the nation that places its neck into the yoke of the king of Babylon and serves him, I will allow it to rest in its land—this is Yahweh's declaration—and they will cultivate it and make their homes in it."'"
