\v 9 And you! Quit listening to your prophets, your diviners, your seers, soothsayers, and sorcerers who have been speaking to you and saying, 'Do not serve the king of Babylon.'
\v 10 For they are prophesying deceit to you in order to send you far away from your lands, for I will drive you away, and you will die.
\v 11 But the nation that places its neck into the yoke of the king of Babylon and serves him, I will allow it to rest in its landx97this is Yahweh's declarationx97and they will cultivate it and make their homes in it.'"
