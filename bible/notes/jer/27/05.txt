\v 5 'I myself made the earth by my great strength and my raised arm. I also made the ground and the beasts on it, and I give it to anyone who is right in my eyes.
\v 6 So now, I myself am giving all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, my servant. Also, I am giving the living things in the fields to him to serve him.
\v 7 For all the nations will serve him, his sons, and his sons’ sons until the time for his land to end comes. Then many nations and great kings will act against him.
