===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jeremiah continues to bring the message of Yahweh.

  * **Yahweh of hosts says this** - Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:06:06|6:6]].
  * **the pillars, the large basin known as "The Sea" and its base** - These were objects that were in the temple. "The Sea" was a large bronze bowl.
  * **Jehoiachin** - The Hebrew text has "Jeconiah," which is a variation of the name "Jehoiachin." Many modern versions have "Jehoiachin" in order to make it clear that the same king is being referred to.
