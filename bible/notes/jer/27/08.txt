\v 8 So the nation and the kingdom that does not serve Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and that does not put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon—I will punish that nation with the sword, with famine, and with the plague—this is Yahweh's declaration—until I have destroyed it by his hand.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **that does not put its neck under the yoke of the king** - Being the king's slave is spoken of as being an animal on to the shoulders of which the king puts a yoke so it can do heavy work. AT: "and whose people do not willingly become slaves of the king" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **I have destroyed them by his hand** - The hand here could be a metonym for Nebuchadnezzar's power, or it could be a metonym for Nebuchadnezzar's armies. AT: "I have used Nebuchadnezzar's power to destroy them" or "I have enabled Nebuchadnezzar's armies to destroy them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
