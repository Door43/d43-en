\v 1 This is the word that Jeremiah the prophet told Baruch son of Neriah. This happened when he wrote in a scroll these words at Jeremiah's dictation—this was in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, and he said,
\v 2 "Yahweh, God of Israel, says this to you, Baruch:
\v 3 You have said, ‘Woe is me, for Yahweh has added agony to my pain. My groaning has wearied me; I find no rest.’
