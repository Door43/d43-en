\v 4 But Baruch, this is what Yahweh says: 'I will destroy this nation that I established. This nation is like a tree that I planted and that I will now pull up with its roots. I will do this everywhere in the world.
\v 5 So, should you desire that people do things to honor you in a special way? Do not desire that. It is true that I will cause all these people to experience a great disaster, but wherever you go, I will protect you, and you will not be killed.'"

\v 4 This is what you must say to him: 'Yahweh says this: See, what I built, I am now tearing down. What I planted, I am now pulling up—I will do this throughout all the earth.
\v 5 But are you hoping for great things for yourself? Do not hope for that. For see, disaster is coming on all humanity—this is Yahweh's declaration—but I am giving you your life as your plunder everywhere you will go.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **This is what you must say to him** - Yahweh is telling Jeremiah what to say to Baruch.
  * **what I built, I am now tearing down. What I planted, I am now pulling up** - Both of these metaphors mean the same thing. Yahweh destroying the people of the nation of Judah is spoken of as if the nation were a building he would tear down or a plant that he will pull up. AT: "this nation is like a building that I built, but I am now tearing down. It is like a plant that I planted, but I am now pulling out of the ground" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **But are you hoping for great things for yourself?** - Yahweh uses a question to state that he knows Baruch is hoping for others to treat him in a special way. AT: "I know you hope for great things for yourself." or "I know you hope others will honor you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **For see** - "For understand" or "Be aware"
  * **disaster is coming on all humanity** - Causing disaster to happen is spoken of as if disaster were something that could travel and arrive at a place. AT: "I will cause all of humanity to experience disaster" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **your life as your plunder everywhere you will go** - Allowing Baruch to escape and remain alive is spoken of as if his life were plunder that he would take after a battle. AT: "but wherever you go, I will protect you and allow you to live" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **plunder** - things stolen from a place by force
