<usfm>
\q
\v 10 So you, my servant Jacob, do not fear'—this is Yahweh’s declaration—'and do not be dismayed, Israel.
\q For see, I am about to bring you back from far away, and your descendants from the land of captivity.
\q Jacob will return and be at peace; he will be secure, and there will be no more terror.
\q
\v 11 For I am with you'—this is Yahweh’s declaration—'to save you. Then I will bring a complete end
\q to all the nations where I have scattered you. But I will certainly not put an end to you,
\q though I discipline you justly and will certainly not leave you unpunished.'
