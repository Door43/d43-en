\q
\v 16 So everyone who consumes you will be consumed, and all of your adversaries will go into captivity.
\q For the ones who have plundered you will become plunder, and I will make all of the ones despoiling you a spoil.
\q
\v 17 For I will bring healing on you; I will heal you of your wounds—this is Yahweh's declaration—
\q I will do this because they called you: Outcast. No one cares for this Zion.'"

  * **have plundered ... plunder** - To plunder is to steal from peaceful people using violence, and plunder is what people steal.
  * **despoiling ... spoil** - To despoil here is to take items from an enemy one has defeated, and the items one takes are the spoil.

  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]].

  * **they called you: Outcast** - An outcast is a person whom other people do not accept or allow to associate with them. AT: "they called you: Rejected" or "they said, 'Nobody wants you'"
