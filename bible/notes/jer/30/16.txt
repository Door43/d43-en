\v 16 Therefore all they that devour you shall be devoured; and all your adversaries, every one of them, shall go into
captivity; and they that despoil you shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon you will I give for a prey.
\v 17 For I will restore health to you, and I will heal you of your wounds, says Jehovah; because they have called you an
outcast, saying, It is Zion, whom no man seeks after.
