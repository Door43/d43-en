\v 18 This is what Yahweh says:

\q2 and enable them to possess their land and their houses again.
\q1 When that happens, Jerusalem will be rebuilt on top of its ruins,
\q2 and the king's palace will be rebuilt to be like it was before.
\q1
\v 19 People will again sing joyfully to thank \add me\add*,
