\v 18 This is what Yahweh says:
\q1 "I will bring the people of Israel back from the lands to which they were taken
\q2 and enable them to possess their land and their houses again.
\q1 When that happens, Jerusalem will be rebuilt on top of its ruins,
\q2 and the king's palace will be rebuilt to be like it was before.
\q1
\v 19 People will again sing joyfully to thank \add me\add*,
\q2 and I will cause there to be more people \add in Jerusalem\add*, not fewer;
\q2 I will cause them to be honored, not despised.
