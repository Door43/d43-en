\v 18 This is what Yahweh says:
\q1 "I will bring the people of Israel back from the lands to which they were taken
\q2 and enable them to possess their land and their houses again.
\q1 When that happens, Jerusalem will be rebuilt on top of its ruins,
\q2 and the king's palace will be rebuilt to be like it was before.
\q1
\v 19 People will again sing joyfully to thank \add me\add*,

\v 18 Thus says Jehovah: Behold, I will turn again the captivity of Jacob’s tents, and have compassion on his dwelling-places;
and the city shall be builded upon its own hill, and the palace shall be inhabited after its own manner.
\v 19 And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they
shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.
