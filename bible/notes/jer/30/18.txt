\v 18 This is what Yahweh says:

\q2 and enable them to possess their land and their houses again.
\q1 When that happens, Jerusalem will be rebuilt on top of its ruins,
\q2 and the king's palace will be rebuilt to be like it was before.
\q1
\v 19 People will again sing joyfully to thank \add me\add*,
\q2 and I will cause there to be more people \add in Jerusalem\add*, not fewer;

\q
\v 18 Yahweh says this, "See, I am about to bring back the fortunes of Jacob's tents and have compassion on his homes.
\q Then a city will be built on the heap of ruins, and a stronghold will exist again where it used to be.
\q
\v 19 Then a song of praise and a sound of merriment will go out from them,
\q for I will increase them and not diminish them; I will honor them so they will not be humbled.
