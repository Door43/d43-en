\v 20 Then their people will be like before, and their assembly will be established before me
\q when I punish all the ones who are now tormenting them.
\q
\v 21 Their leader will come from among them. He will emerge from their midst
\q when I draw him near and when he approaches me.
\q If I do not do this, who would dare come close to me?—this is Yahweh's declaration.
\q
\v 22 Then you will be my people, and I will be your God.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking.

  * **their assembly will be established before me** - AT: "I will establish them as a people before me"
  * **Their leader will come from among them. He will emerge from their midst** - These two sentences have similar meanings. The second one strengthens the thought in the first. AT: "Their leader will be chosen from the people." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **who would dare come close to me?** - Yahweh uses a question to emphasize that no one would have the courage to approach him unless Yahweh invited the person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
