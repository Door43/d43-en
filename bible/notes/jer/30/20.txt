===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking.

  * **their assembly will be established before me**  - AT: "I will establish them as a people before me"
  * **Their leader will come from among them. He will emerge from their midst**  - These two sentences have similar meanings. The second one strengthens the thought in the first. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) AT: "Their leader will be chosen from the people."
  * **who would dare to come close to me?**  - Yahweh uses a question to emphasize that no one would have the courage to approach him unless Yahweh invited the person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
