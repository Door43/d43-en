\v 6 Ask and see if a man bears a child. Why do I see every young man with his hand on his loins?
\q Like a woman bearing a child, why have all their faces become pale?
\q
\v 7 Woe! For that day will be great, with none like it.
\q It will be a time of anxiety for Jacob, but he will be rescued from it.
