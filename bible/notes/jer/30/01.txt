\v 1 This is the word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh and said,
\v 2 "This is what Yahweh, God of Israel, says, 'Write for yourself in a scroll all the words that I have declared to you in a scroll.
\v 3 For look, days are coming—this is Yahweh's declaration—when I will restore the fortunes of my people, Israel and Judah. I, Yahweh, have said it. For I will bring them back to the land
that I gave their ancestors, and they will possess it.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Write for yourself in a scroll all the words that I have declared to you** - "Write in a scroll the message that I spoke to you"
  * **For look** - "For listen carefully." This phrase brings attention to what Yahweh is going say next.
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]].
  * **I will restore the fortunes of my people** - "I will cause things to go well for my people again"
