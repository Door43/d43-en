===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Write for yourself in a scroll all the words that I have declared to you **- "Write in a scroll the message that I spoke to you"
  * **For look**  - "For listen carefully." This phrase brings attention to what Yahweh is going say next.
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration**  - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]].
  * **I will restore the fortunes of my people**  - "I will cause things to go well for my people again"
