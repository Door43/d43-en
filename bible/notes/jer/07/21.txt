\v 23 What I told them was, 'Obey me;
\q2 if you do that, I will be your God and you will be my people.
\q1 If you do the things that I want you to do,
\q2 everything will go well for you.'

\v 21 Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel says this, 'Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices and the meat from them.
\v 22 For when I brought your ancestors out from the land of Egypt, I did not require anything from them. I gave them no command about matters of burnt offerings and sacrifices.
\v 23 I only gave them this command, "Listen to my voice, and I will be your God and you will be my people. So walk in all the ways that I am commanding you, so that it may go well with you."
