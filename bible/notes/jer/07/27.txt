===== translationNotes: =====


  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues giving Jeremiah his message to the people of Judah.
  * **General Information:** - The words "them" and "they" in these verses refer to the people of Judah.

  * **So proclaim all these words to them, but they will not listen to you. Proclaim these things to them, but they will not answer you.** - These two sentences say the same thing, The second emphasizes the message of the first. AT: "Tell them my message, but they will not listen to you or answer you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **the voice of Yahweh its God** - Here "the voice of Yahweh" represents what Yahweh has said. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:03:23|3:25]]. AT: "what Yahweh its God has said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Truth is destroyed and cut off from their mouths** - Yahweh speaks of truth as if it was something the people could destroy and stop saying. This can be stated in active form. AT: "The people destroy truth and cut it off from their mouths" or "The people tell only lies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Truth is destroyed** - The abstract noun "truth" can be translated using the adjective "truthful." AT: "What is truthful is destroyed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
