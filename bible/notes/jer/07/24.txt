<usfm>
\v 24 But they listened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in
their own counsels and in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.
\v 25 Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt to this day, I have sent to you all my servants
the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them:
\v 26 yet they listened not to me, nor inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff: they did worse than their fathers.
