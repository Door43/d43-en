\v 24 But your ancestors would not pay any attention to me. They continued to do the evil things that they wanted to do, everything that in their stubborn inner beings they desired to do. Instead of coming closer to me, they went further away from me.
\v 25 From the day that your ancestors left Egypt until now, I have continued to send my prophets to you repeatedly.
\v 26 But you, my people, have not listened to me or paid attention to what I said; you have been stubborn, and you have done more sinful things than your ancestors did."

\v 24 But they did not listen or incline their ear, but they walked according to the stubborn plans of their wicked heart, so they went backwards not forward.
\v 25 Ever since the day when your fathers went out from the land of Egypt until this day, I sent out every one of my servants, the prophets, to you. Daily persisting and sending out.
\v 26 But they did not listen to me and did not incline their ear but hardened their neck. They were more wicked than their fathers.
