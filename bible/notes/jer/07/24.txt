\v 24 But they did not listen or listen. They lived by their own stubborn plans of their wicked hearts, so they went backwards, not forward.
\v 25 Ever since the day when your ancestors went out from the land of Egypt until this day, I have sent every one of my servants, my prophets, to you. I persisted in sending them.
\v 26 But they did not listen to me; they paid no attention; instead, they hardened their necks. They were more wicked than their ancestors.
