====== Jeremiah 07:31-32 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 31 They have built altars at Topheth in Hinnom Valley \add outside Jerusalem\add*,
\q2 and they sacrifice their sons and daughters on those altars.
\q1 I never commanded them to do that;
\q2 I never even thought that anyone would do that.
\q1
\v 32 So they should beware!
\q2 There will be a time when that place will no longer be called Topheth or the Hinnom Valley;
\q2 instead, it will be called the Valley of Slaughter.
\q1 There will be a huge number of people who will be buried there,
\q2 with the result that there will be no space to bury more bodies.
\q1

\v 31 They have built altars at Topheth in Hinnom Valley outside Jerusalem, and they sacrifice their sons and daughters on those altars. I never commanded them to do that; it was not even in my thoughts!
\v 32 So they should beware! There will be a time when that place will no longer be called Topheth or the Hinnom Valley; instead, it will be called the Valley of Slaughter. There will be a huge number of people who will be buried there, with the result that there will be no space to bury more bodies.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 31 Then they built the high place of Topheth that is in the Valley of Ben Hinnom. They did this to burn their sons and daughters in fire—something that I did not command, nor did it enter my mind.
\v 32 So see, days are coming—this is Yahweh's declaration—when it will no longer be called Topheth or Valley of Ben Hinnom. It will be the Valley of Slaughter; they will bury bodies in Topheth until there is no room left.
