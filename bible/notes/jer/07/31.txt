===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 31 They have built altars at Topheth in Hinnom Valley \add outside Jerusalem\add*,
\q2 and they sacrifice their sons and daughters on those altars.
\q1 I never commanded them to do that;
\q2 I never even thought that anyone would do that.
\q1
\v 32 So they should beware!
\q2 There will be a time when that place will no longer be called Topheth or the Hinnom Valley;
\q2 instead, it will be called the Valley of Slaughter.
\q1 There will be a huge number of people who will be buried there,
\q2 with the result that there will be no space to bury more bodies.

\v 32 So they should beware! There will be a time when that place will no longer be called Topheth or the Hinnom Valley; instead, it will be called the Valley of Slaughter. There will be a huge number of people who will be buried there, with the result that there will be no space to bury more bodies.

<usfm>
\v 31 Then they built the high place of Topheth that is in the vally of Ben-Hinnom to burn their sons and daughters in a fire that I did not command. It did not come up in my heart!
\v 32 Therefore behold! Days are coming—this is Yahweh’s declaration—when it will no longer be called Topheth or Valley of Ben-Hinnom; for it will be the Valley of Slaughter and they will bury in Topheth until there is no place left!
