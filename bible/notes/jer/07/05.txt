<usfm>
\v 5 For if you thoroughly amend your ways and your doings; if you thoroughly execute justice between a man and his neighbor;
\v 6 if you oppress not the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk
after other gods to your own hurt:
\v 7 then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, from of old even for evermore.
