===== Translation Notes: =====

This is the message that Yahweh wants Jeremiah to give to the people of Judah.
  * **Make your ways and practices good**  - "Lead a good life and do good deeds"
  * **this place** - This place probably refers to the temple, which represents rest of the land that Yahweh gave to them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Do not entrust yourself to deceitful words and say** - "Do not let yourselves trust in false words bay saying"
  * **Temple of Yahweh! Temple of Yahweh! Temple of Yahweh!** - This phrase is repeated three times to emphasize the point. It is implied that, since the temple belongs to Yahweh, he will be able to protect it and the people of Judah will be safe. AT: "This is the temple of Yahweh so it is absolutely certain that no one can destroy it and we are safe." (See: )

  * **Temple of Yahweh! Temple of Yahweh! Temple of Yahweh!**  - This triplet means because the temple is here, Yahweh is also here. (See:[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole|Hyperbole]])
