\q1 If you stop doing evil things and start doing what is right,
\q2 I will allow you to remain living in your land.
\q1
\v 4 But some people are repeatedly saying to you,
\q1 'The temple of Yahweh is here,
\q2 so we will be safe;
\q2 \add he will not allow us and the temple to be destroyed\add*.'
\q1 But do not pay attention to what they say,
\q2 because they are deceiving you.
\q1

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 This is what Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, says to you: 'If you improve your ways and start doing what is right, I will allow you to remain living in your land.
\v 4 But some people are repeatedly saying to you, 'The temple of Yahweh is here, so we will be safe; he will not allow us and the temple to be destroyed.' But do not pay attention to what they say, because they are deceiving you.
</usfm>

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues giving Jeremiah his message to the people of Judah.

  * **Yahweh of hosts ... says this** - Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:06:06|6:6]].
  * **Make your ways and practices good, and I will let you continue** - "If you improve your ways and your practices, then I will let you continue"
  * **in this place** - This means in the land of Judah, not in the temple.
  * **Do not entrust yourself to deceitful words and say** - The reflexive pronoun "yourself" emphasizes the personal risk to the Israelites. AT: "Do not trust in deceitful words to protect you, saying" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_rpronouns]])
  * **Temple of Yahweh! Temple of Yahweh! Temple of Yahweh!** - It is implied that, since the temple belongs to Yahweh and represents his presence, he will protect it and the people of Judah will be safe. Possible meanings for why "Temple of Yahweh" is repeated three times are 1) it was repeated for emphasis or 2) it was repeated as part of a temple liturgy. AT: "This is the temple of Yahweh so it is absolutely certain that no one will destroy it and we are safe." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
