\v 12 \add Long ago\add* I put my Sacred Tent at Shiloh \add city\add*, to be a place where people would worship me \f + \ft metonymy \f*.

\q1
\v 13 And while you were continually doing those wicked things,
\q2 I told you about it many times, but you refused to listen.
\q1 I called out to you,
\q2 but you refused to answer me.
\q1
\v 14 Therefore, just like I destroyed Shiloh, I will now destroy this temple
\q2 that was built for people to worship me \f + \ft metonymy \f*,
\q1 this temple that you trust in,
\q2 in this place that I gave to you and your ancestors.
\q1
\v 15 And I will expel you from this land and send you \add to other countries\add* far away from me,

\v 12 But go you now to my place which was in Shiloh, where I caused my name to dwell at the first, and see what I did to it
for the wickedness of my people Israel.
\v 13 And now, because you have done all these works, says Jehovah, and I spoke to you, rising up early and speaking, but you
heard not; and I called you, but you answered not:
\v 14 therefore will I do to the house which is called by my name, wherein you trust, and to the place which I gave to you
and to your fathers, as I did to Shiloh.
\v 15 And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim.
