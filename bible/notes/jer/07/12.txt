\v 13 And while you were continually doing those wicked things,
\q2 I told you about it many times, but you refused to listen.
\q1 I called out to you,
\q2 but you refused to answer me.
\q1
\v 14 Therefore, just like I destroyed Shiloh, I will now destroy this temple
\q2 that was built for people to worship me \f + \ft metonymy \f*,
\q1 this temple that you trust in,
\q2 in this place that I gave to you and your ancestors.

\v 12 Long ago I put my Sacred Tent at Shiloh city, to be a place where people would worship me. Think about how I destroyed it because my people, the Israelite people, did many wicked things there.
\v 13 And while you were continually doing those wicked things, I told you about it many times, but you refused to listen. I called out to you, but you refused to answer me.
\v 14 Therefore, just like I destroyed Shiloh, I will now destroy this temple that was built for people to worship me, this temple that you trust in, in this place that I gave to you and your ancestors.
\v 15 And I will expel you from this land and send you to other countries far away from me, just like I did to your relatives, the people of Israel."

\v 12 So go to my place which was in Shiloh where I allowed my name to abide there in the beginning, and look at what I did to it because of the wickedness of my people, Israel!
\v 13 So Now on account of your doing all of these practices—this is Yahweh’s declaration—I have declared to you! I rose early and declared, but you did not hear. For I summoned you but you did not answer!
\v 14 So I will do to this house where my name is proclaimed that you have trusted in and to this place that I gave to you, and to your fathers the same as I did to Shiloh!
\v 15 For I will send you out from before me just as I had sent out all your brothers, all the seed of Ephraim!’
