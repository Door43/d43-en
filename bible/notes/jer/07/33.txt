===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues to speak of his judgment on the people of Judah.

  * **The corpses** - "The dead bodies"
  * **this people** - "the people of Judah"
  * **the birds of the skies** - See how you translated "the birds of the heavens" in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:04:23|4:25]].
  * **the beasts of the earth** - "the wild animals of the land"
  * **to frighten them away** - "to scare them away"
  * **I will put an end to** - "I will remove from" 
  * **the sound of joy and the sound of gladness** - These two phrases mean almost the same thing and are repeated for emphasis. The abstract nouns "joy" and "gladness" can be translated using the verb "rejoicing" and the adjective "glad." AT: "the sounds of people rejoicing and being glad" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **the sound of the groom and the sound of the bride** - This is a metonym for what happens at marriage ceremonies. AT: "and people celebrating marriage" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
