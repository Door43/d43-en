<usfm>
\v 8 People are repeatedly telling you, 'The temple is here, so we are safe,' and you are trusting that what they are saying is true. But those people are deceiving you; what they say is worthless.
\v 9 You think that you can steal things, murder people, commit adultery, tell lies in court, and worship Baal and all those other gods that you did not know about previously.
\v 10 Then you think you can come here and stand in front of this temple, which is my temple, and say 'Nothing bad will happen to us!', while you continue to do all those disgusting things.
\v 11 Perhaps you do not know that you have made this temple, which is my temple, to become like a cave where thieves hide. But I, Yahweh, am telling you that I have seen all these things!

\v 8 Behold! You are trusting in deceitful words that do not help you.
\v 9 Do you steal, kill, and commit adultery? And do you swear deceitfully and offer incense to Baal and walk after other gods whom you have not known?
\v 10 Then do you come and stand before me in this house where my name is proclaimed and say, "We are saved," so you can do all of these abominations?
\v 11 Is this house, which carries my name, a den of bandits in your eyes? But behold, I have seen itx97this is Yahweh's declaration.'

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to speak to the people of Judah through the prophet Jeremiah.

  * **Behold!** - The word "Behold!" shows that the following questions are very important.
  * **You are trusting in deceitful words that do not help you.** -  AT: "You think that I will save Jerusalem because I will protect my temple. But that is a lie!" 
  *   * **Do you steal, kill, and commit adultery?**  - AT: "You steal, kill, and commit adultery" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]]) 
  * **And do you swear deceitfully and offer incense to Baal and walk after other gods whom you have not known?** - AT: "You lie even in your oaths and worship Baal and other new gods."  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]]) 
  * **Then do you come and stand before me in this house where my name is proclaimed and say, 'We are saved," so you can do all of these abominations?**  - AT: "Then you come to my house and say 'Yahweh will save us" so that you can continue to sin greatly." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **Is not this house ... a den of bandits in your eyes?**  - AT: "This house is ... a den of bandits in your eyes!" or "You act as though you think my house ... should be a place where bandits can go to hide!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]]) 
  * **bandits**  - "robbers" or "people who steal things from others"
