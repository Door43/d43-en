\v 8 Behold! You are entrusting yourselves to deceitful words that do not profit!
\v 9 Will you steal, kill, and commit adultery? And will you swear deceitfully and offer incense to Baal and walk after other gods who you have not known?
\v 10 Then you come and stand before me in this house where my name is proclaimed and say, ‘We are delivered!” because all of these abominations are done!
\v 11 Is this house where my name is proclaimed a cave of bandits in your eyes? Behold! I also have seen!—this is Yahweh’s declaration.
