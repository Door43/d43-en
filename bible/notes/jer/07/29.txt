\q
\v 29 Cut off your hair and shave yourself, and throw away your hair. Sing a funeral song over the open places.
\q For Yahweh has rejected and abandoned this generation in his rage.
\v 30 For the sons of Judah have done evil in my eye—this is Yahweh's declaration—they have set their detestable things in the house that is called by my name, in order to defile it.
