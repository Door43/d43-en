\v 16 So you! Do not pray concerning this people, and do not lift up a lamenting wail or a prayer on their account, and do not entreat me, for I will not hear you.
\v 17 Do you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
\v 18 The children are gathering wood and the fathers kindling the fire! The women are kneading dough to make cakes for the queen of the heavens and pour out drink offerings for other gods so that they provoke me!
