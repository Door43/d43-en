\v 19 Do they provoke me to anger? says Jehovah; do they not
provoke themselves, to the confusion of their own faces?
\v 20 Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, mine anger and my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and
upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.
