===== translationNotes: =====

  * **See, I am against you** - Yahweh speaks this to the people of Babylon. This can be made clear. AT: "See, I am against you, people of Babylon" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **See** - This alerts the reader to pay special attention to what follows.
  * **proud one** - This is Yahweh's description of Babylon.
  * **this is the declaration of the Lord Yahweh of hosts** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:02:18|2:19]]. AT: "this is what the Lord Yahweh of hosts has declared" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh of hosts, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **for your day has come ... the time when I will punish you** - These two phrases mean the same thing. The second phrase defines the "day" that the first phrase mentions. AT: "for the day when I will punish you has come" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **your day** - This refers to the entire span of time during which the horrible judgment will come upon Babylon. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **the proud ones will stumble and fall** - Here "stumble and fall" are idioms that refer to defeat and death. AT: "I will cause enemies to defeat and kill the proud ones" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **it will devour everything around him** - Fire burning the cities of Babylon is spoken of as if the fire were an animal that ate them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **around him** - Here "him" refers to the "proud one" which describes Babylon.
