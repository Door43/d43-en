===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh tells the enemies of Babylon how to conquer.

  * **the one who uses a sickle at the time of harvest** - A "sickle" is farm tool that people use to harvest grain. Together with the previous phrase, Yahweh is saying that all planting and harvesting will stop in Babylon.
  * **Let each person turn back to his own people ... let them flee to their own land** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Together they strengthen the command for foreigners to flee Babylon. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **from the oppressor's sword** - Here the word "sword" refers to the armies that will attack Babylon. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
