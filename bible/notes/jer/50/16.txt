===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh tells the enemies of Babylon how to conquer.

  * **a sickle at the time of harvest**  - This is farm tool used in harvesting grain. Yahweh compares harvesting to destroying Babylon. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Let each person turn back …  to their own land**  - This is the same idea expressed in two different ways. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
