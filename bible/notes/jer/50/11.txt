===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 11 You rejoice, you celebrate the plundering of my inheritance;
\q you jump around like a calf stamping in its pasture;
\q you neigh like a powerful horse.
\q
\v 12 So your mother will be greatly ashamed; the one who bore you will be embarrassed.
\q See, she will be the least of nations, a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.
\q
\v 13 Because of Yahweh's anger, Babylon will not be inhabited, but will be a complete devastation.
\q Everyone who passes by will shudder because of Babylon and will hiss because all of its wounds.

===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **you jump around like a calf stamping in its pasture**  - This compares the people of Babylon to a calf who runs around joyfully in a meadow. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **stamping**  - See how you translated this in Jeremiah [[en:bible:notes:jer:47:03|47:3]].
  * **you neigh like a powerful horse**  - This compares their happiness to the happiness of stallions that are neighing - making loud noises. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **So your mother … the one who bore you will be embarrassed.**  - The same idea is expressed in two different ways for emphasis. This compares the ancestors of the Babylonians to a mother in a family. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert**  - These words have basically the same meaning for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **shudder**  - shake violently due to fear
  * **hiss** - make a sound like a snake that means great disapproval
