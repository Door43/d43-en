<usfm>
\q
\v 11 You rejoice, you celebrate the plundering of my inheritance;
\q you jump around like a calf stamping in its pasture;
\q you neigh like a powerful horse.
\q
\v 12 So your mother will be greatly ashamed; the one who bore you will be embarrassed.
\q See, she will be the least of nations, a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.
\q
\v 13 Because of Yahweh's anger, Babylon will not be inhabited, but will be a complete devastation.
\q Everyone who passes by will shudder because of Babylon and will hiss because all of its wounds.
