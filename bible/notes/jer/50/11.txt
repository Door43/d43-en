\v 11 Because you are glad, because you rejoice, O you that plunder my heritage, because you are wanton as a heifer that treadeth
out the grain, and neigh as strong horses;
\v 12 your mother shall be utterly put to shame; she that bare you shall be confounded: behold, she shall be the hindermost of
the nations, a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.
\v 13 Because of the wrath of Jehovah she shall not be inhabited, but she shall be wholly desolate: every one that goes by
Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.
