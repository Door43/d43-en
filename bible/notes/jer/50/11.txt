<usfm>
\q
\v 11 Since you rejoice, since you exalt the plunder of my inheritance,
\q Since you jump around like a trampling cow,
\q And you neigh like a strong horse;
\q
\v 12 Your mother will be greatly ashamed! The one who bore you will be embarrassed!
\q Behold! She will be the least of nations: a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert!
\q
\v 13 Because the anger of Yahweh she will not be inhabited, but will be a complete wasteland!
\q Everyone who passes by will shudder because of Babylon and hiss concerning all of its wounds.
