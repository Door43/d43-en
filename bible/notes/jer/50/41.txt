\q
\v 41 See, a people is coming from the north, for a great nation and many kings
\q have been stirred up from a distant land.

\q
\v 42 They will pick up bows and spears. They are cruel and have no compassion.
\q Their sound is like the sea roar, and they are riding on horses in formation as fighting men,
\q against you, daughter of Babylon.
\v 43 The king of Babylon has heard their report and his hands have fallen limp in distress.
\q Anguish seizes him like a woman in labor.
