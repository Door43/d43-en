<usfm>
\q
\v 38 A drought is coming on her waters, so they will become dry.
\q For she is a land of worthless idols, and they act like people made insane by their dreadful idols.
\q
\v 39 So desert beasts with the jackals will inhabit there, and the young of ostriches will live in her.
\q For all time, she will no longer be inhabited. From generation to generation, she will not be lived in.
\q
\v 40 Just as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbors—this is Yahweh's declaration—
\q no one will live there; no person will stay in her."
