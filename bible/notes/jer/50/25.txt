===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Yahweh has opened his armory and is bringing out the weapons for carrying out his anger** - Yahweh's anger that causes him to send enemies against Babylon is spoken of as if Yahweh had an armory and weapons. To open an armory is a metonym for preparing for battle. AT: "Yahweh has prepared for war and is sending the nations to attack Babylon in his anger" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **armory** - this is a building or room where weapons of war are stored
  * **Attack her from far away** - Yahweh speaks to the enemies of Babylon. AT: "You enemies of Babylon, attack her from far away"
  * **Open her granaries** - Here "granaries" represent where Babylon stored its treasures. AT: "Raid the places where her treasures are stored" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **granaries** - buildings where grain is stored
  * **pile her up like heaps of grain** - Possible meanings are 1) reduce the city to piles of rubble that look like stacks of grain or 2) stack up the plunder from the city like piles of grain. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Set her apart for destruction** - This idiom means to destroy something completely. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:25:07|25:9]]. AT: "destroy her completely" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Leave no remnant of her** - This is stated in a negative way to emphasize the completeness of the destruction. AT: "Kill every person in her"
