===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I will restore **- The word "I" refers to Yahweh.
  * **he will graze on Carmel and Bashan**  - AT: "Israel will feed on the foods of Carmel and Bashan."
  * **Iniquity will be looked for in Israel, but none will be found **- AT: "Yahweh will look for iniquity in the people of Israel, but will not find any" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **iniquity will be looked for in Israel, …  I will inquire about the sins …**  - The same idea is expressed in two different ways for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
