===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues telling how to destroy the people of Babylon and Chaldea.

  * **Summon the archers against Babylon** - Yahweh is speaking to the enemies of Babylon. This can be made clear. AT: "You enemies of Babylon, summon the archers against her" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the archers ... those who bend their bows** - These phrases refer to the same people and are repeated for poetic effect. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **her ... her ... she** - The words "her" and "she" refer to Babylon.
  * **let no one escape** - This can be stated in positive form. AT: "capture or kill every person"
  * **Do to her by the measure she has used** - The evil things the Babylonians did to Israel are spoken of as if Babylon measured them. AT: "Measure out punishment for her with the same amount she used to punish Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **her young men will fall** - "they will kill her young men"
  * **all her fighting men will be destroyed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "I will destroy all her fighting men" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
