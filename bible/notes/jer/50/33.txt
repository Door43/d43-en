\v 33 Thus says Jehovah of hosts: The people of Israel and the people of Judah are oppressed together; and all that took
them captive hold them fast; they refuse to let them go.
\v 34 Their Redeemer is strong; Jehovah of hosts is his name: he will thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to
the earth, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.
