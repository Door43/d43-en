===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh now speaks through Jeremiah about Israel and Judah.

  * **Yahweh of hosts says this** - Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:06:06|6:6]].
  * **The people of Israel are oppressed, together with the people of Judah** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "The Babylonians are oppressing the people of Israel and Judah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **captured them** - The word "them" refers to the people of Israel and Judah who were captured and taken into exile.
  * **He will truly plead their case** - Yahweh is spoken of as if he were a lawyer who represents the people of Israel in court. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in order to bring rest to the land** - Here "the land" is a metonym for the people who live in the land. AT: "in order that the people who live in Israel might live in peace" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **bring rest ... bring strife** - These two terms represent opposite ideas and bring a strong contrast to how Yahweh will treat Israel and Babylon.
  * **bring rest** - "give peace"
