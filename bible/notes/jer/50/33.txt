\v 33 Thus says Yahweh of hosts: The children of Israel are oppressed, together with the children of Judah,
\q And all the ones who captured them still seize them; they refuse to send them out.
\q
\v 34 Their redeemer is strong! Yahweh of Hosts is his name! He will truly plead their case,
\q So then He will bring rest to the land and bring unrest to the ones inhabiting Babylon!
