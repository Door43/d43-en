\v 45 Therefore hear you the counsel of Jehovah, that he has taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he has purposed
against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely they shall drag them away,
even the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them.
\v 46 At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth trembleth, and the cry is heard among the nations.
