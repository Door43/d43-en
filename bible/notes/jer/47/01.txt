===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **See ** - The word "See" alerts us to pay attention to what is about to be said.
  * **floods of water are rising in the north; they will be like an overflowing river**  - The two phrases have similar meaning and are combined for emphasis. The "waters" and "river" both represent the army coming from the north (probably the Babylonians). (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **they will overflow the land**  - "they" refers to the army from the north.
