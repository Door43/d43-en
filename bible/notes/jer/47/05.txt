\v 5 Baldness will come upon Gaza. As for Ashkelon, the people who are left in their valley will be made silent.
How long will you cut yourself in mourning?

\q Go back to your scabbard! Stop and be silent.
\q
\v 7 How can you be quiet, for Yahweh has commanded you.
\q He has summoned you to attack Ashkelon and against the coastlands along the sea."
