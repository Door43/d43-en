===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking.

  * **doing good to them** - Here "them" refers to the people of Israel.
  * **I will faithfully plant them in this land** - AT: "I will permanently settle the Israelites in this land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **with all my heart and all my life** - Together, these two phrases form an idiomatic expression that refers to a person's entire being. AT: "with all that I am" or "wholeheartedly." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
