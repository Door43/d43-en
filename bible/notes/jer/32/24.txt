<usfm>
\v 24 And now, \add the army\add* of Babylonia has built ramps up against our city walls \add in order to attack our city\add*. Because of our enemies' swords and because of famines and diseases, they will be able to conquer it easily. The things that you said would happen have now happened.
\v 25 And it is evident that the Babylonian army will soon conquer this city. So now, Yahweh my Lord, \add I do not understand\add* why you told me to buy this field with my silver, while others were watching. \add It seems that I have just been wasting my money by doing that\add*!"

\v 24 Look! The siege mounds have reached up to the city to capture it. For because of
sword, famine, and plague, the city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans who are fighting against it. For what you have said would happen is happening, and see, you are watching.
\v 25 Then you yourself said to me, "Purchase a field for yourself with silver and have witnesses witness it, even though this city is being given into the hand of the Chaldeans."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jeremiah continues praying to Yahweh.

  * **The siege mounds have reached up to the city to capture it** - The large piles of dirt and rocks that the enemy built around the city so they could stand on them and attack it are spoken of as if they were the attackers themselves reaching out to capture the city. AT: "The enemy's seige mounds are so close to the city that the enemy will be able to capture the city" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **because of sword** - The word "sword" is a metonym for war, where soldiers use swords. AT: "because soldiers will attack" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **famine, and plague** - These abstract nouns can be translated as verbs. AT: "people have no food to eat, and everyone is weak from being ill" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **the city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans** - Here "hand" means power or control. This can be translated in active form. AT: "you have given Jerusalem to the Chaldean army" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **happening, and see, you are watching** - "happening, as you can see very well"
