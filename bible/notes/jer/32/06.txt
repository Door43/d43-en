===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Jeremiah said, "The word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 'Look, Hanamel son of Shallum your uncle is coming to you and will say, "Buy my field that is in Anathoth for yourself, for the right to buy it belongs to you."'"** - You may translate this as indirect speech. AT: "Jeremiah said that the word of Yahweh had come to him and told him that Hanamel son of Shallum his uncle was coming to him and would tell him to buy his uncle's field that was in Anathoth for himself, for the right to buy it belonged to Jeremiah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **Jeremiah said** - It is not clear why Jeremiah is referring to himself by name here. You may translate using first person, as the UDB does. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,** - This idiom is used to introduce a special message from God. See how you translated it in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:04|1:4]]. AT: "Yahweh gave me a message. He said," or "Yahweh spoke this message to me:" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Hanamel ... Shallum** - These are the names of men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Anathoth** - This is the name of a place. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:01|1:1]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
