\v 36 So now therefore, I, Yahweh, the God of Israel,  say this concerning this city, the city about which you are saying, 'It is given over into the hand of the king of Babylon by sword, famine, and plague.'
\v 37 See, I am about to gather them from every land where I had driven them in my wrath, fury, and great anger. I am about to bring them back to this place and enable them to live in security.

  * **to gather them**  - "to gather my people"
