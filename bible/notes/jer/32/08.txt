\v 8 And just as Yahweh had predicted, my cousin Hanamel came to see me in the courtyard of the palace. He said, "Please buy my field at Anathoth in the area where the descendants of Benjamin live. It is written in our laws that you have the right to buy it before I ask if anyone else wants to buy it." When he said that, I knew that the message that I had received was truly from Yahweh.
\p
\v 9 So, I bought the field at Anathoth. I paid Hanamel seventeen pieces of silver for it.

\v 8 Then, as Yahweh had declared, "Hanamel, the son of my uncle, came to me in the courtyard of the guard, and he said to me, 'Buy my field that is in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin, for the right of inheritance is yours, and the right to buy it belongs to you. Buy it for yourself.' Then I knew that this was Yahweh's word.
\v 9 So I bought the field in Anathoth from Hanamel, the son of my uncle, and I weighed out for him the silver, seventeen shekels.
