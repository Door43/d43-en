\v 26 This is the word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah and said,
\v 27 "Look! I am Yahweh, God of all mankind. Is anything too difficult for me to do?
\v 28 Therefore Yahweh says this, 'See, I am about to give this city over into the hand of the Chaldeans and Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. He will capture it.
