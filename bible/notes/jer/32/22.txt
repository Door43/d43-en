\v 22 You gave to us Israelite people this land that you solemnly promised to give to our ancestors, a land that is very fertile [IDI].
\v 23 Our ancestors came here and conquered this land and started to live in it, but they refused to obey you or to do what you commanded them to do. Because of that, you have caused them to experience all these disasters.

<usfm>
\v 22 Then you gave them this land—which you had sworn to their ancestors to give to them—a land flowing with milk and honey.
\v 23 So they entered and took possession of it. But they did not obey your voice or live in obedience to your law. They did nothing of what you had commanded them to do, so you brought all this disaster on them.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jeremiah continues praying to Yahweh. He ends the introduction to his lament ("Woe," [[:en:bible:notes:jer:32:16|32:17]]) with the words "took possession of it" and begins the lament with "but they did not obey."

  * **gave them** - "gave the people of Israel"
  * **land flowing with milk and honey** - "land where milk and honey flow." God spoke of the land being good for animals and plants as if the milk and honey from those animals and plants were flowing through the land. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:11:03|11:5]]. AT: "land that is excellent for raising livestock and growing crops" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **But they did not obey your voice** - The voice is a metonym for the message the speaker gives. AT: "But they did not obey what you said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
