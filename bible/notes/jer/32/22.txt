<usfm>
\v 22 Then you gave them this land, which you had sworn to their ancestors to give to themâ€”a land flowing with milk and honey.
\v 23 So they entered and took possession of it. But they did not obey your voice or live in obedience to your law. They did nothing of what you had commanded them to do, so you brought all this disaster on them.
