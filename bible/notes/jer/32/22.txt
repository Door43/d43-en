\v 22 You gave to us Israelite people this land that you solemnly promised to give to our ancestors, a land that is very fertile [IDI].

<usfm>
\v 22 Then you gave them this land—which you had sworn to their ancestors to give to them—a land flowing with milk and honey.
\v 23 So they entered and took possession of it. But they did not obey your voice or live in obedience to your law. They did nothing of what you had commanded them to do, so you brought all this disaster on them.

Jeremiah continues praying to Yahweh.

  * **But they did not obey your voice** - AT: "But they did not obey what you said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
