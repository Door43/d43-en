\v 16 After I gave the receipt of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah, I prayed to Yahweh and said,
\v 17 "Woe, Lord Yahweh! Look! You alone have made the heavens and the earth by your great strength and with your raised arm. Nothing you say is too difficult for you to do.
\v 18 You show covenant faithfulness to thousands and pour the guilt of men into the laps of their children after them. You are the great and mighty God; Yahweh of hosts is your name.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jeremiah continues speaking. He begins a long prayer, a lament with a long introduction of praise.

  * **the receipt of purchase** - This means the sealed scroll and the unsealed scroll.
  * **Woe** - "Alas"
  * **by your great strength and with your raised arm** - The phrase "raised arm" is a metonym for the strength of the arm, so the words "your great strength" and "your raised arm" form a doublet. AT: "by your great power" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **You show covenant faithfulness to thousands** - The abstract noun "faithfulness" can be stated as "faithful" or "faithfully." AT: "You are faithful to your covenant towards thousands" or "You keep your promise and faithfully love thousands" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **pour the guilt of men into the laps of their children after them** - The word "guilt" is a metonym for Yahweh punishing people because they are guilty of doing evil things. Yahweh punishing people is spoken of as if he were pouring a large container full of liquid or small objects into people's laps as they sit. AT: "you punish children for the sins of their parents" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
