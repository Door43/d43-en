\v 16 After I gave the receipt of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah, I prayed to Yahweh and said,
\v 17 'Woe, Lord Yahweh! Look! You alone have made the heavens and the earth by your great strength and with your raised arm. Nothing you say is too difficult for you to do.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jeremiah continues speaking.

  * **the receipt of purchase**  - This means the sealed scroll and the unsealed scroll.
  * **Woe**  - "Alas"
  * **great strength and with your raised arm**  - Both of these phrases mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. AT: "your great power" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet|Doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
  * **You show covenant faithfulness**- "You keep your promise and show your faithful love"
  * **and pour the guilt of men into the laps of their children after them**  - "and you punish children for the sin of their parents" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom|Idiom]])
