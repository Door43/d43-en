\v 3 King Zedekiah had put me there. I continued to prophesy there about what would happen. I continued to say, "Yahweh says that he is about to allow the army of the king of Babylon to capture this city .
\v 4 And the soldiers of Babylonia will most definitely capture King Zedekiah and take him to the king of Babylon for a face to face encounter.
\v 5 Then his soldiers will take Zedekiah to Babylon, and he will remain there until I arrange for him to be punished. And if he tries to fight against the soldiers from Babylonia, he will not succeed." King Zedekiah asked me why I continued to say that, but Yahweh had said this would be so.

\v 3 Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him and said, "Why do you prophesy and say, 'Yahweh says this: Look, I am about to give over this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.
\v 4 Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape from the hand of the Chaldeans, for he has indeed been given over into the hand of the king of Babylon. His mouth will speak to the king's mouth, and his eyes will see the king's eyes.
\v 5 For Zekediah will go to Babylon and he will be there until I do something with himx97this is Yahweh's declarationx97since you fought the Chaldeans. You will not be successful.'"

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Why do you prophesy and say** - Zekekiah uses a question to rebuke Jeremiah. AT: "It is wrong for you to continue prophesying and saying" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it** - Here "hand" refers to power or control. AT: "to the king of Babylon, and his army will capture it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **for he has indeed been given** - AT: "for I have indeed given him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **His mouth will speak to the king's mouth, and his eyes will see the king's eyes** - AT: "Zedekiah himself will see and directly speak with Nebuchadnezzar" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]].
  * **you fought** - Here "you" is plural and refers to the people in Jerusalem. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
