\v 3 For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore do you prophesy, and say, Thus says Jehovah, Behold, I
will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;
\v 4 and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand
of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;
\v 5 and he shall bring Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, says Jehovah: though you fight with the
Chaldeans, you shall not prosper?
