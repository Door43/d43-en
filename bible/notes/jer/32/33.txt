====== Jeremiah 32:33-35 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 33 My people have turned away from me and have refused to return to me. Even though I taught them things many times, they would not pay attention to what I taught them, and they would not obey me.
\v 34 They have set up their detestable idols even in my own \f + \ft metonymy \f* temple and defiled it\f + \ft Or: caused it become a place that is unacceptable for people to worship me \f*.
\v 35 They have built shrines to \add honor\add* Baal in Ben-Hinnom Valley \add outside Jerusalem\add*, and there they sacrifice their sons and daughters to their god Molech. I never commanded them to do such horrible deeds. I never even thought that anyone might do such a terrible thing. And by doing it they have caused all the people of Judah to \add be guilty of having\add* sinned."

\v 34 They have set up their detestable idols even in my own temple and defiled it.
\v 35 They have built on the hilltops places to worship Baal in Ben Hinnom Valley outside Jerusalem, and there they sacrifice their sons and daughters to their god Molech. I never commanded them to do such horrible deeds. I never even considered ordering such a terrible thing. And by doing it they have caused all the people of Judah to be guilty of having sinned."

\v 33 They turned their backs to me instead of their faces, though I had eagerly taught them. I tried to teach them, but not one of them listened in order to receive correction.
\v 34 They set up their abominable idols in the house that is called by my name, to defile it.
\v 35 They built high places for Baal in the Valley of Ben Hinnom in order to put their sons and daughters in the fire for Molech. I did not command them. It never entered my mind that they should do this detestable thing and so cause Judah to sin.'
