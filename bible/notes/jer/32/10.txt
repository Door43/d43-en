\v 10 Then I wrote in a scroll and sealed it, and had witnesses witness it. Then I weighed the silver in the scales.
\v 11 Next I took the deed of purchase that was sealed, following the command and the statutes, as well as the unsealed deed.
\v 12 I gave the sealed scroll to Baruch son of Neriah son of Mahseiah in front of Hanamel, the son of my uncle, and the witnesses who had written in the sealed scroll, and in front of all the Judeans who sat in the courtyard of the guard.
