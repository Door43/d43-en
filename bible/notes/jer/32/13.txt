\v 13 Then, while they were all listening, I said to Baruch,
\v 14 "This is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels the God whom we Israelites \add worship\add*, says: 'Take both copies of this paper\f + \ft Or: papyrus \f* and put them in a clay jar, to preserve them for a long time.
\v 15 Do that because this is what I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, the God whom you Israelites \add worship\add*, say: \add Some day people will again own property\add* in this land, and they will buy and sell houses and vineyards and fields.'~"

\v 13 So I gave a command to Baruch before them. I said,
\v 14 'Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: Take these scrolls with the receipt of this purchase that is sealed and this unsealed scroll. Place them in a new jar 
so they will last for a long time.
\v 15 For Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: Houses, fields, and vineyards will be purchased again in this land.'
