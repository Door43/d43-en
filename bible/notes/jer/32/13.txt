\v 13 So I gave a command to Baruch before them. I said,
\v 14 “Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: 'Take these scrolls with the receipt of this purchase that is sealed and this unsealed scroll. Place them in a new jar 
so they will last for a long time.'
\v 15 For Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: 'Houses, fields, and vineyards will be purchased again in this land.'”
