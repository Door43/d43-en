\v 15 Do that because this is what I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, the God whom you Israelites \add worship\add*, say: \add Some day people will again own property\add* in this land, and they will buy and sell houses and vineyards and fields.'~"

\v 13 So I gave a command to Baruch before them. I said,
\v 14 “Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: 'Take these scrolls with the receipt of this purchase that is sealed and this unsealed scroll. Place them in a new jar 
so they will last for a long time.'
\v 15 For Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: 'Houses, fields, and vineyards will be purchased again in this land.'”
