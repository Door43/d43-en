===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh, through the prophet Jeremiah, has just talked about the adultery of the people.

  * **the word of Yahweh that came to**  - AT: "the message that God gave to" (See:[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]]) See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:01|1:2]].
  * **fall apart**  - "fall into pieces"
  * **their cries for Jerusalem are going up**  - "They are calling out loudly in prayer for Jerusalem".
