\v 15 So this is what I say about those prophets who are predicting what will happen, saying that I told them those things: They are saying that we Israelites will not die from wars or famines, but I did not send those prophets. And they themselves will die from wars or from famines.
\v 16 And the people to whom they are predicting these things, they and their wives and their sons and their daughters, will \add also die\add* from wars or from famines. \add Their corpses will\add* be thrown into the streets of Jerusalem, and there will not be anyone to bury them. I will punish them like they deserve to be punished.

\v 15 Therefore thus says Jehovah concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword
and famine shall not be in this land: By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.
\v 16 And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword;
and they shall have none to bury them—them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness
upon them.
