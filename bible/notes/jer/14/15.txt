\v 15 So this is what I say about those prophets who are predicting what will happen, saying that I told them those things: They are saying that we Israelites will not die from wars or famines, but I did not send those prophets. And they themselves will die from wars or from famines.
\v 16 And the people to whom they are predicting these things, they and their wives and their sons and their daughters, will \add also die\add* from wars or from famines. \add Their corpses will\add* be thrown into the streets of Jerusalem, and there will not be anyone to bury them. I will punish them like they deserve to be punished.

\v 15 Therefore thus says Yahweh to the prophets prophesying in my name but who I did not send out, they who say there will be no sword or famine in this land: These prophets will perish by sword and by famine!
\v 16 And the people to whom they prophesied will be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem before the famine and the sword, for there will be no one to bury them—they, their wives, their sons, or their daughters!—for I will pour out their wickedness upon them!
