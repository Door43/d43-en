\q
\v 19 Have you completely rejected Judah? Does your soul loath Zion?
\q Why will you strike us where there is no healing for us? We hoped for peace but there was no good;
\q And for a time of healing, but behold! Dismay!
\q
\v 20 We know, Yahweh, our offenses, the iniquity of our fathers, for we have sinned against you!
