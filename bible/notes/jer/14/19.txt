\q1 We hoped that there would be a time when we would be healed,
\q2 but all that we received were things that terrified us.
\q1
\v 20 Yahweh, we admit\f + \ft Or: know \f* that we are wicked people,

\q
\v 19 Have you completely rejected Judah? Do you hate Zion?
\q Why will you afflict us when there is no healing for us? We hoped for peace, but there was nothing good—
\q and for a time of healing, but see, there is only terror.
\q
\v 20 We admit, Yahweh, our offenses, the iniquity of our ancestors, for we have sinned against you.
