\v 19 Then I prayed this:
\q1 "Yahweh, have you completely rejected \add the people of\add* Judah?
\q2 Do you really despise \add the people of\add* Jerusalem \f + \ft metonymy \f*?
\q1 Why have you \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* wounded us very badly,
\q2 with the result that we will never be healed?
\q1 We hoped that we would have peace,
\q2 but there was no peace.
\q1 We hoped that there would be a time when we would be healed,
\q2 but all that we received were things that terrified us.
\q1
\v 20 Yahweh, we admit\f + \ft Or: know \f* that we are wicked people,
\q2 and that our ancestors also did many wicked things.
\q1 We have all sinned against you.

\q
\v 19 Have you completely rejected Judah? Do you hate Zion?
\q Why will you afflict us when there is no healing for us? We hoped for peace, but there was nothing good—
\q and for a time of healing, but see, there is only terror.
\q
\v 20 We admit, Yahweh, our offenses, the iniquity of our ancestors, for we have sinned against you.
