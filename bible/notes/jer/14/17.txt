\q
\v 17 Say this word to them: Let my eye flow with tears, night and day;
\q And do not let them cease, for there will be a great collapse of virgin daughter of my people—
\q A great and incurable wound!
\q
\v 18 If I go out to the field then behold! Those slain by the sword! And if I come to the city,
\q Behold! Those diseased by famine! Even both the prophet and the priest wander about the land and are without knowledge!
