\v 17 So, Jeremiah, tell this to them about yourself:
\q1 'Day and night my eyes are full of tears.
\q2 I cannot stop crying.
\q1 I cry for my people,
\q2 who are very precious to me, as if they were my daughters.
\q2 I cry for them because they have been severely wounded;
\q2 and they will not recover or heal from this severe wound.
\q1
\v 18 If I go out into the fields,
\q2 I see corpses of people who have been slaughtered by our enemies.
\q1 If I walk along the streets of the city,
\q2 I see corpses of people who died from hunger.

<usfm>
\q
\v 17 Say this word to them: 'Let my eyes flow with tears, night and day.
\q Do not let them stop, for there will be a great collapse of the virgin daughter of my people—
\q a great and incurable wound.
\q
\v 18 If I go out to the field then see! there are those killed by the sword. And if I come to the city,
\q then, see! there are those diseased by famine. Even both the prophet and the priest wander about the land  without knowledge.'"
