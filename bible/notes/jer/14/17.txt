<usfm>
\v 17 And you shall say this word to them, Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease; for the
virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous wound.
\v 18 If I go forth into the field, then, behold, the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then, behold, they
that are sick with famine! for both the prophet and the priest go about in the land, and have no knowledge.
