\v 17 So, Jeremiah, tell this to them about yourself:
\q1 'Day and night my eyes are full of tears.
\q2 I cannot stop crying.
\q1 I cry for my people,
\q2 who are very precious to me, as if they were my daughters.
\q2 I cry for them because they have been severely wounded;
\q2 and they will not recover or heal from this severe wound.
\q1
\v 18 If I go out into the fields,
\q2 I see corpses of people who have been slaughtered by our enemies.
\q1 If I walk along the streets of the city,
\q2 I see corpses of people who died from hunger.
\q1 The prophets and the priests travel through the land, preaching to people,
\q2 but they do not know what they are doing .'"

\q
\v 17 Say this word to them: 'Let my eyes flow with tears, night and day.
\q Do not let them stop, for there will be a great collapse of the virgin daughter of my people—
\q a great and incurable wound.
\q
\v 18 If I go out to the field, there are the ones who were killed by the sword! \q If I come to the city, there are the diseases that are caused by famine. 
\q Both the prophet and the priest wander about the land, and they do not know.'"
