<usfm>
\q
\v 17 Say this word to them: 'Let my eyes flow with tears, night and day.
\q Do not let them stop, for there will be a great collapse of the virgin daughter of my people—
\q a great and incurable wound.
\q
\v 18 If I go out to the field then see! there are those killed by the sword. And if I come to the city,
\q then, see! there are those diseased by famine. Even both the prophet and the priest wander about the land  without knowledge.'
