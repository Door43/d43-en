\v 13 Then I replied to him, "Yahweh my God, their prophets are telling the people that they will not experience wars \f + \ft metonymy \f* or famines. They are telling the people that you will surely allow us to have peace in our land for many years."
\p
\v 14 Yahweh replied to me, "Those prophets say that they are speaking what I tell them to say \f + \ft metonymy \f*, but they are telling lies. I did not send them, so what they are saying is false. They say that they have received visions from me, and that they are telling things that I have revealed to them, but that is not true. They are saying foolish things that they have only thought of themselves.

\v 13 Then I said, "Oh, Lord Yahweh! Behold! The prophets are saying to the people, 'You will not see the sword; there will be no famine for you, for I will give you true security in this place.'"
\v 14 Yahweh said to me, "The prophets prophesy deceit in my name. I did not send them out, nor did I give them any command or speak to them. But deceitful visions and useless, deceitful divination coming from their own minds are what they are prophesying to you."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh has just told Jeremiah not to pray for the people of Judah. 

  * **You will not see the sword** - Here "sword" represents war, and to "see" represents experiencing. AT: "You will not experience any war" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **security** - Here "security" is spoken of as if it were an object that someone could give to another person. AT: "I will allow you to live securely" or "I will allow you to live peacefully" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **prophesy deceit** - The word "deceit" can be expressed as an adjective. AT: "prophesy deceitfully" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **in my name** - This phrase refers to speaking with Yahweh's power and authority or as his representative. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I did not send them out** - This means that Yahweh did not send them out with messages to give to the people. AT: "I did not send them to prophesy to other people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **coming from their own minds** - Here "minds" are spoken of as if they were a place instead of the ability to think of ideas. AT: "that they think up themselves" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
