====== Jeremiah 14:13-14 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 Then I replied to him, "Yahweh my God, their prophets are telling the people that they will not experience wars \f + \ft metonymy \f* or famines. They are telling the people that you will surely allow us to have peace in our land for many years."
\p
\v 14 Yahweh replied to me, "Those prophets say that they are speaking what I tell them to say \f + \ft metonymy \f*, but they are telling lies. I did not send them, so what they are saying is false. They say that they have received visions from me, and that they are telling things that I have revealed to them, but that is not true. They are saying foolish things that they have only thought of themselves.

\v 13 Then said I, Ah, Lord Jehovah! behold, the prophets say to them, You shall not see the sword, neither shall you have
famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.
\v 14 Then Jehovah said to me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name; I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither
spoke I to them: they prophesy to you a lying vision, and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their own
heart.
