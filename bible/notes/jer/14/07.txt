\v 7 ‘If our iniquities testify against us, Yahweh act on account of your name!
\q2 For our apostasies multiply; we have sinned against you!
\q2
\v 8 The Hope of Israel, the one who saves him in the time of distress!
\q2 Why will you be like a stranger in the land? And like a wanderer who stretches out and spends the night?
\q2
\v 9 Why will be you like a confused man, like a warrior who is not able to save?
\q2 For you are in our midst, Yahweh! And your name has been proclaimed over us! Do not cause us to lay quiet.’
