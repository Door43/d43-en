<usfm>
\q2
\v 7 Even though our iniquities testify against us, Yahweh, act for the sake of your name.
\q2 For our faithless actions increase; we have sinned against you.
\q2
\v 8 You are the Hope of Israel, the one who saves him in the time of distress,
\q2 why will you be like a stranger in the land, like a foreign wanderer who stretches out and spends just one night?
\q2
\v 9 Why are you like someone who is astounded, or like a warrior who has no power to rescue?
\q2 You are in our midst, Yahweh, and your name is called over us. Do not leave us!

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh, through the prophet Jeremiah, has just told the people about the drought.

  * **our iniquities testify against us** - Here their "iniquities" are spoken of as if they were people who testified against them about their wrong doing. AT: "our iniquities give evidence of our wrongdoing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **for the sake of your name** - Here Yahweh's "name" refers to his reputation. AT: "for the sake of your reputation" or "in order that everyone can see that you are very great and keep your promises" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Hope of Israel** - This is another name for Yahweh. AT: "You are the hope of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **why will you be like a stranger in the land ... Why are you like someone who is astounded** - These two question have similar meanings. They both ask if Yahweh is unconcerned with his people and unable to help them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **why will you be like a stranger in the land, like a foreign wanderer ... just one night** - This question speaks of the possibility of Yahweh being unconcerned with helping his people as if he were a stranger just travelling though a place unconcerned with those living there. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **who stretches out and spends just one night** - Both of the phrase have the same meaning and may be combined. AT: "who stays for only one night" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Why are you like someone who is astounded, or like a warrior who has no power to rescue** - This speaks of the possibility of Yahweh being unable to help his people as if he were a confused warrior who was unable to rescue anyone. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **astounded** - unable to understand or to think clearly
  * **your name is called over us** - This can be stated in active form. This speaks of the people being Yahweh's people by saying that his name is over them. AT: "we bear your name" or "we are your people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
