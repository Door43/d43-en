\q
\v 10 Thus says Yahweh to this people: As they love to err, they have not held back their feet!
\q So Yahweh will not accept them! Now he remembers their iniquity and has appointed their sins!
\v 11 So Yahweh said to me, ‘Do not pray for good on behalf of this people!
\v 12 For if they fast I will not be listening to their wailing, and if they offer up burnt offerings and food offerings, I will not take pleasure in them. For I am making an end to them by sword, famine, and plague!’
