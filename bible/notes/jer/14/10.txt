\q
\v 10 Yahweh says this to this people: "Since they love to wander, they have not held back their feet from doing so."
\q Yahweh is not pleased with them. Now he calls to mind their iniquity and has punished their sins.
\v 11 Yahweh said to me, "Do not pray for good on behalf of this people.
\v 12 For if they fast, I will not listen to their wailing, and if they offer up burnt offerings and food offerings, I will not take pleasure in them. For I will put an end to them by sword, famine, and plague."
