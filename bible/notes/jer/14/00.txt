== False prophets ==

The false prophets promised there would not be any war or drought. The gave people a false sense of hope, when they needed to repent. Because of this, Yahweh sent a drought and said that the false prophets would die of drought and war. This showed that these were not true prophets of Yahweh.  (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]], [[:en:obe:kt:promise]], [[:en:obe:kt:hope]] and [[:en:obe:kt:repent]])
