===What is Jeremiah about?===

The book of Jeremiah begins about 626 BC. After the death of Josiah, many groups within Israel opposed Jeremiah (some were aligned with Egypt, and also there were the idol worshipers who hated him for denouncing their gods). During the reign of King Jehoiakim, Jeremiah proclaimed his prophecies about “The Temple of Yahweh.” King Jehoiakim received one of these prophecies and burned it. The next king, King Zedekiah, imprisoned Jeremiah because he called for the king to surrender to Babylon. When Nebuchadnezzar (of Babylonia) conquered (beginning at 597 BC and finally conquering Israel in 587 BC), Jeremiah was offered housing and a pension to go to Babylon but Jeremiah remained in Jerusalem to help the few Jews that remained there. Soon, Gedaliah (the governor of Judah for the Babylonians) was murdered, and some Jewish rebels captured Jeremiah, and taken to Egypt. Those rebels chose Egypt for refuge rather than to live under the tyranny of Nebuchadnezzar in Babylonia. Jeremiah may have died soon after being taken to Egypt, but not before he prophesied the Babylonian campaign against Egypt.

===How should the title of this book be translated?=== 
It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). "Jeremiah" may also be called the "The book about Jeremiah" or "The sayings of Jeremiah."

===Who wrote Jeremiah?===

Jeremiah, son of Hilkiah likely wrote the book of Jeremiah. He was a priest and a prophet from Judah. This was not the first edition of the book. Jehoiakim burned the original writing.

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====
===What is the New Covenant?===
Jeremiah 31 introduces a new covenant between Yahweh and Israel. It is promised that the law would be written on the hearts of men who would have a new heart. There were also many other promises.


===Would God give Judah victory because the temple was his dwelling place?===

As a nation, the people of Judah felt indestructible because the presence of Yahweh was with them in the temple. This gave them a false sense of accomplishment. They assumed that they could not be conquered because of this. God used Babylon to punish Judah.

===Is God only concerned about Israel?===
While much of the Old Testament prior to this time is concerned with the nation of Israel, Jeremiah begins to focus on God's judgment on the other nations of the world. Judgment must come upon these other nations because of their sin.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

===How do I translate Jeremiah's illustrations?===

Jeremiah frequently uses illustrations or symbols to explain a lesson. These illustrations are meant to be easy to understand and have a great impact on the reader. The prophet hopes that his words cause the people to repent. In 27:1-15, Jeremiah wore a yoke around his neck to illustrate how Nebuchadnezzar would have a yoke put around his neck. It may be helpful to see these illustrations function as a type of [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|metaphor]].

===Is Jeremiah arranged in chronological order?===

No, Jeremiah has many instances where it is clearly out of chronological order. Instead, it appears to be topically arranged.

===Why does Jeremiah refer to himself by name?==
There are many instances in the book where the author refers to Jeremiah as "Jeremiah" or "he." This is unusual if Jeremiah wrote the book. The reason this occurs is likely because Baruch penned the book. Translators should keep the words "Jeremiah" and "he" and not try to smooth over this issue. In the same way, Jeremiah refers to Israel as both "you" and "they."

===How do I translate a book of prophecy?===
A book of prophecy is considerably different than history or narrative. Jeremiah often convicts his reader of their sin and their need to fear or worship Yahweh. He does this using poetic language and unique vocabulary. Occasionally, he gives a prophecy without mentioning the subject. The reader may or may not immediately understand who the prophecy is about.
