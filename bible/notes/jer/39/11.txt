\v 11 Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had given an order about Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the king's bodyguards. He had said,
\v 12 “Take him and care for him. Do not harm him. Do for him anything he tells you.”
\v 13 So Nebuzaradan captain of the king's bodyguards, Nebushazban the high eunuch, Nergal Sharezer the high official, and all the most important officials of the king of Babylon sent men out.
