===== translationNotes: =====

  * **slaughtered Zedekiah's sons before his own eyes** - The eyes are a synecdoche for the whole person. The reader should also understand that others probably helped the king of Babylon kill Zedekiah's sons. AT: "forced Zedekiah to watch as he slaughtered Zedekiah's sons" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **he put out Zedekiah's eyes** - "the king's men made Zedekiah blind." Use the common words for making a person blind. It is not clear that the king of Babylon took Zedekiah's eyes out of his head. The reader should also understand that others probably helped the king of Babylon make Zedekiah blind.
