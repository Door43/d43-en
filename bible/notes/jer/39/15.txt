\v 16 "Say this to Ebed-Melech, the official from Ethiopia: 'This is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, the God whom we Israelites \add worship\add*, says: I will do to this city everything that I said that I would do. I will not enable the people to prosper; I will cause them to experience disasters. You will see Jerusalem being destroyed,
