\v 15 While I was still being guarded in the palace courtyard, Yahweh gave me this message:
\v 16 "Say this to Ebed-Melech, the official from Ethiopia: 'This is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, the God whom we Israelites \add worship\add*, says: I will do to this city everything that I said that I would do.

\v 15 Now the word of Yahweh had come to Jeremiah while he was under arrest in the courtyard of the guard. It said,
\v 16 “Speak to Ebed Melech the Cushite and say, ‘Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: See, I am about to carry out my words against this city for diasaster and not for good. 
For they will all come true before you on that day.
