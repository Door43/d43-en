\v 16 "Say this to Ebed-Melech, the official from Ethiopia: 'This is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, the God whom we Israelites \add worship\add*, says: I will do to this city everything that I said that I would do. I will not enable the people to prosper; I will cause them to experience disasters. You will see Jerusalem being destroyed,

\v 15 Now the word of Yahweh had come to Jeremiah while he was under arrest in the courtyard of the guard, and he said,
\v 16 "Speak to Ebed Melech the Cushite and say, 'Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: See, I am about to carry out my words against this city for disaster and not for good. For they will all come true before you on that day.
