\v 12 Those teachers of false doctrine are \add as dangerous to you as\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* ◄hidden rocks on a reef\f + \ft Or: rocks underneath the surface of the ocean \f* \add are to a boat\add*. When you gather together \add to eat the meals that\add* help you believers to love each other more and have a closer relationship with each other, they \add join you and\add* carouse shamelessly, caring \add only\add* for themselves \add and not for others. Because they do not do anything to help others\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, they are \add as useless as\add* clouds that are blown along by the wind \f + \ft Or:that the wind blows along \f* but that do not \add produce, Or: give\add* any rain. \add They are as disappointing as\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* trees that do not produce fruit in the autumn \add as we expect them to\add*.

\v 12 These people are like rocks under the water that ships crash against. When they share in your love feasts, they have no shame, because they eat only to please themselves. They are like clouds that give no rain, clouds that the wind pushes along. They do no good deeds, for they are like trees in late autumn that bear no fruit. They are like people who have died two times; they are like trees that have been uprooted.
\v 13 They do not control themselves. They are like the sea's strong waves in a storm, and they pollute others with their shame, just as the waves bring up foam and dirt onto the beaches. They are like stars that do not stay where they should in the sky. God will put them in very great darkness forever.

\v 12 These are the ones who are hidden reefs in your love feasts. They feast shamelessly, feeding only for themselves. They are clouds without water, carried along by winds. They are autumn trees without fruit—twice dead, torn up by the roots.
\v 13 They are violent waves in the sea, foaming out their own shame. They are wandering stars, for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jude uses a series of metaphors to describe the ungodly men. He tells the believers how to recognize these men when they are among them. 

  * **These are the ones** - The word "These" refers to the "ungodly men" of [[:en:bible:notes:jud:01:03|1:4]]. 
  * **hidden reefs** - Reefs are large rocks that are very close to the surface of water in the sea. Because sailors cannot see them, they are very dangerous. Ships can easily be destroyed if they hit these rocks. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **autumn trees without fruit** - Possible meanings are that these people are like 1) trees from which people expect to harvest fruit, but they have none, or 2) trees that never bear fruit. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **fruit** - This is a metaphor for a life that pleases God and helps other people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **twice dead, torn up by the roots** - A tree that someone has uprooted is a metaphor for death. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **torn up by the roots** - Like trees that have been completely pulled out of the ground by their roots, the ungodly people have been separated from God who is the source of life. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **violent waves in the sea** - As the sea's waves are blown by a strong wind, so the ungodly people are easily moved in many directions. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **foaming out their own shame** - As wind causes wild waves to stir up dirty foam - so these men, through their false teaching and actions, shame themselves. AT: "just as waves bring up foam and dirt, these men pollute others with their shame" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **wandering stars** - Those who studied the stars in ancient times noticed that what we call planets do not move the way that stars do. AT: "disorderly stars" or "moving stars" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **stars, for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever** - "stars. For them God has set aside a place of complete darkness, where he will keep them forever"
