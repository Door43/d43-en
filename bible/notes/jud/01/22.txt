===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 Be kind to those who are not certain about what teachings they should believe, and help them.
\v 23 Keep others from going into the fire of everlasting punishment. Be kind to people who sin, but be afraid to join them in those sins. Instead, hate even their clothing, because it is made dirty by their sins.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **those who doubt** - "those who do not yet believe that God is God" 
  * **snatching them out of the fire** - This metaphor compares speaking and doing to others what is needed to keep them from dying apart from Christ with pulling something that has fallen into a fire out before it burns. AT: "treating them the way you would treat valuable things that you needed to pull out of a fire after they had fallen in." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **To others show mercy with fear** - "Be kind to others, but be afraid of sinning the way they did" 
  * **hating even the garment stained by the flesh** - This hyperbole speaks of the sinners' sin as being so evil that people can become diseased by touching their clothes. AT: "treat them as though you could become guilty of sin just by touching their clothes." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
