===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 Be kind to those who are not certain about what teachings they should believe, and help them.
\v 23 Keep others from going into the fire of everlasting punishment. Be kind to people who sin, but be afraid to join them in those sins. Instead, hate even their clothing, because it is made dirty by their sins.

\v 22 And have mercy on some people, who are in doubt;
\v 23 and save some people, snatching them out of the fire; and on some have mercy with fear, as you hate even the garment spotted by the flesh.

  * **and on some have mercy with fear** - "and be kind to others but be afraid of sinning like them."  
  * **as you hate even the garment spotted by the flesh** - "hate even their clothes, because they are made unclean by sin." They are so full of sin that their clothes are even considered unclean.
