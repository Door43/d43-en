\v 14 Enoch, the seventh person in the line of people who descended from Adam, said this about those teachers of false doctrine: "Listen carefully to this: The Lord will certainly come with a countless number of his holy angels.
\v 15 They will judge everyone and will punish all wicked people, and all who dishonor God. The angels will do this, because of all the harsh things that these people have spoken against God."
\v 16 These teachers of false doctrine grumble about the things that God does. They complain about what happens to them. They do the evil things because they wish to do them. They talk boastfully. They praise people in order to get things from them.

\v 14 And about these people also Enoch, the seventh in line from Adam, foretold, saying, "Look, the Lord came with tens  of thousands of his holy ones,
\v 15 to execute judgment upon all people, and to convict all the ungodly of all their works of ungodliness which they have committed in an ungodly manner, and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him."
\v 16 These are grumblers, complainers, who go after their evil desires, loud boasters, who praise certain people in order to gain advantage.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jude continues to speak out against the ungodly people

  * **these people...their works...they have**-  These refer to the ungodly people.
  * **The seventh in line from Adam** - Seventh generation from Adam.  Some translations may say sixth in line depending if Adam is counted as a generation.
  * **Look, the Lord...** - "notice, the Lord", or "behold, the Lord"
  * **all the hard things** - "all the harsh words"
  * **grumblers, complainers** - People who have a disobedient heart. Grumblers tend to do this quietly, complainers do this more openly.
  * **loud boasters** - People who praise themselves so that others can hear.
