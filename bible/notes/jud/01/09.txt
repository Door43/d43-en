====== Jude 01:9-11 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm> \v 9 When the devil\f + \ft Or: Satan \f* argued with the chief angel, Michael, about \add who would take away\add* the body of \add the prophet\add* Moses \add to bury it\add*, Michael did not \add do as these teachers of false doctrine do. Even though Michael has much more authority than they do\add*, he did not disrespectfully revile\f + \ft Or: say evil things to \f* Satan and accuse, Or: condemn him. Instead, he \add only\add* said, "\add I desire that\add* the Lord \add God\add* will rebuke you!" \v 10 But the \add ones in your midst\add* who teach false doctrine revile\f + \ft Or: speak evil against \f* the \add spiritual\add* beings that they do not understand. They also \add do the evil things that they desire\add*, things that they know about naturally\f + \ft Or: without needing to think \f*, things that they just do without considering\add the consequences, Or: results\add*, like animals. So they destroy themselves. \add But they will also be punished by God\add* \f + \ft Or:\add God will also\add* punish them \f*.

\p \v 11 \add God will do\add* terrible things to those who teach false doctrine! They conduct their lives \add wickedly\add* like Cain, \add who murdered his brother because he was\add* \add jealous\f + \ft Or: angry because God accepted his brother's sacrifice and did not accept his\add* \f*. They devote themselves to \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add doing\add* wrong things \add like\add* Balaam, who \add tried to induce God's people to sin in order to get the money that was offered to him\add*. They will perish like Korah, who rebelled \add against the authority that God gave to Moses\add*►. </usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 9 Even when Michael the archangel argued with Satan about who would take possession of Moses' body, he kept from insulting and condemning him; he merely said, "May the Lord punish you!" \v 10 But these people about whom I am writing–they say evil words about everything good that they do not understand. They are just like wild animals that cannot think, bcause all the things that they are naturally able to understand–these things destroy them.

\p \v 11 God will punish very severely those who do these things. They behave like Cain did. They commit the same sin as the sin Balaam committed for money, and they will die like Korah, who rebelled against Moses. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 9 But even Michael the archangel, when he opposed the the devil and argued about the body of Moses, did not dare to bring against him condemnation or insulting words, but instead he said, "May the Lord rebuke you." \v 10 But these people insult all the things that they do not understand; and all the things that they understand naturally, like the creatures without a mind, in these things are they destroyed. \v 11 Woe to them! For they have walked in the way of Cain, and have plunged into in the error of Balaam for wages, and they have perished in Korah's rebellion. </usfm>
