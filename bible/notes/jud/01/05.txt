\v 6 Also, there were many angels to whom God assigned positions of authority in heaven. But they did not continue to rule with authority in those positions. Instead, they abandoned those place. So God has put those angels in chains forever in darkness in hell. They will stay there until the important day in which God will judge and punish them.
