\v 6 Also, there were many angels to whom God assigned positions of authority in heaven. But they did not continue to rule with authority in those positions. Instead, they abandoned those place. So God has put those angels in chains forever in darkness in hell. They will stay there until the important day in which God will judge and punish them.

\p
\v 5 Now I wish to remind you, although you know everything, that the Lord once saved a people out of the land of Egypt, but that afterward he destroyed those who did not believe.
\v 6 And angels who did not keep to their own principality, but left their proper dwelling place--God has kept them in everlasting chains in darkness for the judgment of the great day.
