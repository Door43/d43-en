===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **to keep you from stumbling** - Just as one can trip over a stone when walking, so one can stumble by sinning before God. Alternate translation: "to help to continue trusting him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **and to place you before the presence of his glory** -  His glory is brilliant light that represents his greatness. Alternate translation: "and to allow you to enjoy and worship his glory."
  * **without blemish in exceeding joy** - "without sin and in great joy." or "and you will not have any sin and you will be full of joy" 
  * **to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord,** - "to the only God, who saved us because of what  Jesus Christ did." 
  * **be glory, majesty, dominion and power, before all time, and now, and for evermore. Amen** - God always had, has, and will have glory, absolute leadership and complete control of all things.
