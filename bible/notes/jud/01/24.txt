===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jude closes with a blessing.

  * **without blemish** - Here sin is spoken of as if it were dirt on one's body or a flaw on one's body. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) AT: "where you will be without sin"  
  * **to the only God our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord** - "to the only God, who saved us because of what Jesus Christ did." This emphasizes that God the Father as well as the Son is the Savior. 
  * **be glory, majesty, dominion, and power, before all time, now, and forevermore** - God has always had, now has, and will always have glory, absolute leadership, and complete control of all things.
