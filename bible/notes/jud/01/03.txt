====== Jude 01:3-4 ======

<usfm>
\v 3 You whom I love, I was very eager\f + \ft Or: very much wanted \f* to write to you about that which we all share\f + \ft Or: have in common \f*, which is how \add God\f + \ft Or: Jesus Christ\add* \f* \add has\add* saved \add us\add*. But now I realize that it is necessary \add for me\add* to write to you in order to exhort you to defend the \add truth about Christ\add* that we believe. \add Jesus and his apostles\add* gave that truth once for all to us who belong to God, \add and we must not let it be changed\add* \f + \ft Or:\add anyone revise, Or: change it\add* \f*.
\v 4 Some people falsely \add teach that because\add* God kindly does for us what we do not deserve, it does not matter\f + \ft Or: is all right \f* if we continue to sin. \add Those people show by the way that they conduct their lives\add* that they do not want to admit\f + \ft Or: accept \f* that Jesus Christ \add is\add* our only Master and Lord. \add It was written\add* long ago \f + \ft Or:\add Someone\add* long ago wrote \f* that \add God\add* would condemn such ungodly people\f + \ft Or: people like that whose lives are displeasing to him \f*. But some \add of those\add* people have entered \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add like crawling snakes\add* into your congregations \add and oppose the truth about Christ, so you must resist, Or: oppose them\add*.

\v 3 You whom I love, I tried very hard to write a letter to you about how God has saved us all together. I needed to write to encourage you to do your best to speak for the true things that we believe. These are things that God has taught to all those who trust in Christ. These things will never change.
\v 4 There are men who are creeping into your assemblies; they are like the wicked men the prophets wrote about long agoâ€”they teach false things and they twist the grace of God into giving permission to commit sexual sin. In this way they oppose what is true about Jesus Christ, our only Master and Lord.

\v 3 Beloved, while I was making every effort to write to you about our common salvation, I had to write to you to exhort you to struggle earnestly for the faith that was handed down once for all to the believers.
\v 4 For certain men have slipped in secretly among you. These are men who were marked out for condemnation. They are ungodly men who pervert the grace of our God into sensuality, and who deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jude tells the believers his reason for writing this letter.
  * **General Information:** - The word "our" in this letter includes both Jude and believers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])


  * **our common salvation** - "the salvation we share"
  * **I had to write** - "I felt a great need to write" or "I felt an urgent need to write"
  * **to exhort you to struggle earnestly for the faith** - "to encourage you to defend the true teaching"
  * **once for all** - "finally and completely"
  * **believers** - "saints." Some versions translate this as "holy ones." It gives the idea of Christian believers with no special emphasis on their moral qualities, but rather believers who are made saints by belief in Jesus' death for salvation.
  * **For certain men have slipped in secretly among you** - "For some men have come in among the believers without drawing attention to themselves" 
  * **men who were marked out for condemnation** - This can also be put into the active voice. AT: "men whom God chose to condemn" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **who pervert the grace of our God into sensuality** - God's grace is spoken of as if it were a thing that could be changed into something horrible. AT: "who change the grace of our God into filthy lust" or "who teach that God's grace permits one to continue to live in sexual sin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ** - Possible meanings are 1) they teach that he is not God or 2) these men do not obey Jesus Christ.
