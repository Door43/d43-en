====== Jude 01:3-4 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 You whom I love, I was very eager\f + \ft Or: very much wanted \f* to write to you about that which we all share\f + \ft Or: have in common \f*, which is how \add God\f + \ft Or: Jesus Christ\add* \f* \add has\add* saved \add us\add*. But now I realize that it is necessary \add for me\add* to write to you in order to exhort you to defend the \add truth about Christ\add* that we believe. \add Jesus and his apostles\add* gave that truth once for all to us who belong to God, \add and we must not let it be changed\add* \f + \ft Or:\add anyone revise, Or: change it\add* \f*.
\v 4 Some people falsely \add teach that because\add* God kindly does for us what we do not deserve, it does not matter\f + \ft Or: is all right \f* if we continue to sin. \add Those people show by the way that they conduct their lives\add* that they do not want to admit\f + \ft Or: accept \f* that Jesus Christ \add is\add* our only Master and Lord. \add It was written\add* long ago \f + \ft Or:\add Someone\add* long ago wrote \f* that \add God\add* would condemn such ungodly people\f + \ft Or: people like that whose lives are displeasing to him \f*. But some \add of those\add* people have entered \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add like crawling snakes\add* into your congregations \add and oppose the truth about Christ, so you must resist, Or: oppose them\add*.

\v 3 You whom I love, I tried very hard to write a letter to you about how God has saved us all together. I needed to write to encourage you to do your best to speak for  the true things that we believe. These are things that God has taught all the believers. These things will never change.
\v 4 Some people are like snakes crawling into your assemblies. They teach false things. They say that because God kindly does for us what we do not deserve, it does not matter whether we sin sexually. In this way they oppose what is true about Jesus Christ, our only Master and Lord.

\v 3 Beloved, while I was making every effort to write to you about our common salvation, I had to write to you to exhort you to struggle earnestly for the faith which was once for all handed down to the saints.
\v 4 For certain men have come stealthily, of whose condemnation it was written long ago—ungodly men, who change the grace of our God into sexual immorality, and who deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.
