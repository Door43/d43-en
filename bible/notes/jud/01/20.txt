===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jude tells the believers how they should live and how they should treat others.

  * **But you, beloved, build yourselves up** - Becoming increasingly able to trust in God and obey him is spoken of as if it were the process of constructing a building. "Do not be like them, beloved. Instead, as you build yourselves up" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **wait for** - "eagerly look forward to"
  * **Keep yourselves in God's love** - Remaining able to receive God's love is spoken of as if one were keeping oneself in a certain place. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that brings you eternal life** - Here "mercy" stands for Jesus Christ himself, who will show his mercy to the believers by making them live forever with him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
