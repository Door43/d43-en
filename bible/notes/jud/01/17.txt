<usfm>
\v 17 But you people whom I love need to remember the things that were predicted by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ \f + \ft Or:that the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ said would happen \f*.
\v 18 They told you, "In the final period of time \add in which we are now living\add* there will be people who will laugh at \add the truths that God has revealed\add*. They will do the ungodly things\f + \ft Or: things that are displeasing to God \f* that their \add bodies\add* desire."
\v 19 \add That describes\add* the teachers of false doctrine\add well, because\add* they are the ones who cause \add believers\add* to divide among themselves. They do what their own minds tell them to do. The Spirit \add of God\add* does not live within them.

\v 17 But you people whom I love, remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ said long ago.
\v 18 They told you, "Just before the last day, some people will laugh at the true things that God has told us. They will commit the sins with their bodies that they wish to commit because they dishonor God."
\v 19 These are the people who make believers angry with each other. They do all the wicked things that they want to do. The Spirit of God does not live within them.

\v 17 But you, beloved, remember the words which were spoken in the past by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;
\v 18 they said to you, "In the last time there will be mockers, who go after their own ungodly lusts."
\v 19 These are they who cause divisions; they are sensual. They do not have the Spirit.
