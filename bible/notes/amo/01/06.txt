\v 6 This is what Yahweh says:
\q "For three sins of Gaza,
\q even for four,
\q I will not turn away punishment,
\q because they carried away captive a whole people,
\q to rescue them to Edom.
\q
\v 7 I will send fire on the walls of Gaza,
\q and it will devour her fortresses.

===== Important Terms: =====

  * [[:En:obe:kt:sin]]
  * [[:En:obe:other:edom]] 
  * [[:En:obe:other:gaza]]

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **to rescue them to Edom**  - This is political correctness (see: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]]).  The winner in a battle uses words like "liberate" where the loser uses "enslave".   God was addressing his displeasure to the "winner" of the battle in question.  Compare this with the UDB.
