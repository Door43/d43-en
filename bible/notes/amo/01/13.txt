\q
\v 13 This is what Yahweh says,
\q "For three sins of the people of Ammon,
\q even for four,
\q I will not turn away punishment,
\q because they ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead,
\q that they may enlarge their borders.
</usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **because they ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead, that they may enlarge their borders**  - This is not a cause-and-effect.  Enlarging the borders was not a direct result of ripping open pregnant women.    See the UDB for clarification.
