\v 11 Yahweh also said this to me:
\q1 "\add I will punish the people of\add* Edom because of the many sins that \add their people\add* have committed;
\q2 I will not change my mind about punishing them,

\q
\v 11 This is what Yahweh says,
\q "For three sins of Edom,
\q even for four,
\q I will not turn away punishment,
\q because he pursued his brother with the sword
\q and cast off all pity.
\q His anger raged continually,
\q and his wrath lasted forever.
\q
\v 12 I will send fire on Teman,
\q and it will devour the palaces of Bozrah."
