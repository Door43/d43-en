\v 11 Yahweh also said this to me:
\q1 "\add I will punish the people of\add* Edom because of the many sins that \add their people\add* have committed;
\q2 I will not change my mind about punishing them,
\q1 because they pursued the people of Israel, who descended from Esau's \add brother Jacob, and killed them\add* with swords;
\q2 they did not act mercifully toward them at all.
\q1 They were extremely angry \add with the people of Israel\add*,
\q2 and they continued to be angry with them.
\q1
\v 12 I will cause a fire to burn Teman \add district in Edom\add*
\q2 and completely burn the fortresses of Bozrah, \add the biggest city in Edom\add*."

\v 11 This is what Yahweh says,
\q "For three sins of Edom,
\q even for four,
\q I will not turn away punishment,
\q because he pursued his brother with the sword
\q and cast off all pity.
\q His anger raged continually,
\q and his wrath lasted forever.
\q
\v 12 I will send fire on Teman,
\q and it will devour the palaces of Bozrah."
