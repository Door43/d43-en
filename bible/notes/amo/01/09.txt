\v 9 This is what Yahweh says:
\q "For three sins of Tyre,
\q even for four,

\q
\v 10 I will send fire on the walls of Tyre,
\q and it will devour her fortresses."

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **and it will devour her fortresses**  - The "devour" means to "destroy", not to "eat" as an animal would eat.  See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]],  See the UDB translation also for clarification.
