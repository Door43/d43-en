\v 1 This is the message that \add Yahweh\add* gave to me, Amos. I am a shepherd\f + \ft Or: man who takes care of sheep \f* near Tekoa \add town south of Jerusalem\add*. I received this message about Israel in a vision two years before the \add big\add* earthquake. It was when Uzziah was the king of Judah and Jeroboam, the son of \add King\add* Jehoash, was the king of Israel.
\p
\v 2 This is what Yahweh said:
\q1 "I will roar \add like a lion\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*;
\q2 when I speak from Zion \add Hill in\add* Jerusalem \f + \ft doublet \f*, my voice will \add resemble the sound of\add* thunder.
\q1 \add When that happens\add*, the pastures where you shepherds \add take care of\add* your sheep will dry up
\q2 and \add the grass\add* on top of Carmel \add Mountain\add* will wither\f + \ft Or: become brown \f*
\q2 \add because I will cause that no rain will fall\add*."

\v 1 This is the message that Yahweh gave to Amos, a shepherd near the town of Tekoa south of Jerusalem. He received this message about Israel in a vision two years before the big earthquake. It was when Uzziah was the king of Judah and Jeroboam son of King Jehoash, was the king of Israel.
\p
\v 2 This is what Amos said:
\q1 "Yahweh will shout very loudly;
\q2 when he speaks from Mount Zion in Jerusalem, his voice will sound like thunder.
\q1 When that happens, the pastures where you shepherds take care of your sheep will dry up,
\q2 and the grass on top of Mount Carmel will wither
\q2 because Yahweh will order the rain not to fall."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the things ... that Amos ... received in revelation** - Everything that God made Amos understand through what Amos saw or heard.
  * **Yahweh roars from Zion; he raises his voice from Jerusalem.** - These two lines share similar meanings. Together they emphasize that Yahweh shouts loudly as he prepares to judge the nation. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Yahweh roars** - like 1) a lion or 2) thunder (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
