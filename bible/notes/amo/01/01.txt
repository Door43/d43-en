\v 1 This is the message that \add Yahweh\add* gave to me, Amos. I am a shepherd\f + \ft Or: man who takes care of sheep \f* near Tekoa \add town south of Jerusalem\add*. I received this message about Israel in a vision two years before the \add big\add* earthquake. It was when Uzziah was the king of Judah and Jeroboam, the son of \add King\add* Jehoash, was the king of Israel.

\v 2 This is what Yahweh said:
\q1 "I will roar \add like a lion\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*;
\q2 when I speak from Zion \add Hill in\add* Jerusalem \f + \ft doublet \f*, my voice will \add resemble the sound of\add* thunder.
\q1 \add When that happens\add*, the pastures where you shepherds \add take care of\add* your sheep will dry up
\q2 and \add the grass\add* on top of Carmel \add Mountain\add* will wither\f + \ft Or: become brown \f*

\q2 when I speak from Mount Zion in Jerusalem, my voice will sound like thunder.
\q1 When that happens, the pastures where you shepherds take care of your sheep will dry up,
\q2 and the grass on top of Mount Carmel will wither
\q2 because I will order the rain not to fall."

\v 1 These are the things concerning Israel that Amos, one of the shepherds in Tekoa, received in revelation. He received these things in the days of Uzziah king of
Judah, and also in the days of Jeroboam son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.
\v 2 He said,
\q "Yahweh roars from Zion;
\q he raises his voice from Jerusalem.
\q The pastures of the shepherds mourn,
\q the top of Carmel withers."
