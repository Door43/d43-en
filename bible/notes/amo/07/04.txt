\v 4 This is what the Lord Yahweh showed me: Look, the Lord Yahweh called on fire to judge. It dried the vast, deep water under the earth and would have devoured the land, also.
\v 5 But I said, "Lord Yahweh, please stop; how will Jacob survive? For he is so small."
\v 6 Yahweh relented concerning this, "This also will not happen," said the Lord Yahweh.
