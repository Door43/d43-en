\v 16 Now therefore hear you the word of Jehovah: You sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not
your word against the house of Isaac;
\v 17 therefore thus says Jehovah: Your wife shall be a harlot in the city, and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the
sword, and your land shall be divided by line; and you yourself shall die in a land that is unclean, and Israel shall surely be
led away captive out of his land.
