\v 16 You said to me, 'Do not prophesy and say that terrible things will happen to the people of Israel;
\q2 stop saying those things!'
\p
\v 17 So listen to what Yahweh says about you:
\q1 'Your wife will become a prostitute in this very city;
\q2 your sons and daughters will die because their enemies will kill them.
\q1 Others will measure your land
\q2 and divide it up among themselves;
\q1 and you yourself will die in a foreign country.
\q1 And the people of Israel will certainly have to leave their country and go into exile.'~"

\v 16 Now hear the word of Yahweh. You say, 'Do not prophesy against Israel, and do not
speak against the house of Isaac.'
\v 17 Therefore this is what Yahweh says:
\q 'Your wife will be a prostitute in the city;
\q Your sons and your daughters will fall by the sword;
\q Your land will be measured and divided up;
\q You will die in an unclean land,
\q And Israel will surely go into exile from his land.'"
