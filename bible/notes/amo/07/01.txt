\c 7
\p
\v 1 Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me: and, behold, he formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth;
and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king’s mowings.
\v 2 And it came to pass that, when they made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord Jehovah, forgive, I
beseech thee: how shall Jacob stand? for he is small.
\v 3 Jehovah repented concerning this: It shall not be, says Jehovah.
