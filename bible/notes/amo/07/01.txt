\c 7
\p
\v 1 This is what the Lord Yahweh showed me. Look, he formed a locust swarm when the spring crop began to come up,
and, look, it was the late crop after the kingâ€™s harvest.
\v 2 When they finished eating the vegetation of the land, then I said, "Lord Yahweh, please forgive; how will Jacob survive? For he is so small."
\v 3 Yahweh relented concerning this. "It will not happen," he said.
