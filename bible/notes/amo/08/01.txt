\p
\v 1 This is what the Lord Yahweh showed me. Look, a basket of summer fruit!
\v 2  He said, "What do you see, Amos?" I said, "A basket of summer fruit." Then Yahweh said to me,
\q "The end has come for my people Israel;
\q I will spare them no longer.
\q
\v 3 The songs of the temple will become wailings.
\q In that day"—this is the declaration of the Lord Yahweh—
\q "The corpses will be many,
\q in every place they will throw them out in silence!"
