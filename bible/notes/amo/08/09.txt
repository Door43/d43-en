\v 9 "It will come in that day"
\q —this is the declaration of the Lord Yahweh—
\q "that I will make the sun set at noon,
\q and I will darken the earth at daylight.
\q
\v 10 I will turn your festivals into mourning
\q and all your songs into lamentation.
\q I will make all of you wear sackcloth
\q and have baldness on every head.
\q I will make it like mourning for an only son,
\q and a bitter day to its end.
