\v 13 At that time,
\q1 even beautiful young women and strong young men will faint
\q2 because of being very thirsty.
\q1
\v 14 Those who make oaths\f + \ft Or: solemnly promise to do something \f* using the names of their shameful gods of Samaria,
\q2 and those who solemnly promise to do something \add using the name of\add* the god of Dan,
\q2 and those who solemnly promise to do something \add using the name of\add* the god of Beersheba,
\q1 will all die;
\q2 and they will never get up again."

\v 14 Those who make oaths using the name of their shameful god of Samaria,
\q2 and those who solemnly promise to do something using the name of the god of Dan,
\q2 and those who swear using the name of the god of Beersheba—
\q1 they will all die;
\q2 they will never get up again."

<usfm>
\q
\v 13 In that day the beautiful virgins
\q and the young men will faint from thirst.
\q
\v 14 Those who swear by the sin of Samaria
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa the sin of Samaria \fqa* , some versions have \fqa Ashimah of Samaria. Ashimah was the name of a pagan goddess worshiped in some parts of Syria \f* 
\q and say, 'As your god lives, Dan,'
\q and, 'As the way to Beersheba exists'—
\f + \ft The Hebrew text has \fqa As the way to Beersheba exists \fqa* , where this might refer to what people going to worship Beersheba's idols might have said. However, some versions want to change the Hebrew text to read \fqa As the loved one of Beersheba lives. \fqa* Here "loved one" stands for an idol worshiped in Beersheba. \f* 
\q they will fall and never rise again."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **In that day** - "At that time" 
  * **faint** - to lose all strength
  * **by the sin of Samaria** - Here "sin" represents the false god the people worship in Samaria. AT: "by the false god of Samaria" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **As your god lives, Dan** - This is a way of making a solemn oath. The people declare that they believe the god of Dan is certainly alive to emphasize that they will certainly do what they promise to do.
  * **As the way to Beersheba exists** - This is probably a reference to the roads that pilgrims would take to Beersheba in order to worship idols there. Again, this is a way of making a solemn oath. They state that the way to Beersheba certainly exists in order to emphasize that they will certainly do what they promise to do.
  * **they will fall** - This is an idiom. AT: "they will die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
