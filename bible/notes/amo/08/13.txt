\v 14 Those who make oaths\f + \ft Or: solemnly promise to do something \f* using the names of their shameful gods of Samaria,
\q2 and those who solemnly promise to do something \add using the name of\add* the god of Dan,
\q2 and those who solemnly promise to do something \add using the name of\add* the god of Beersheba,
\q1 will all die;
\q2 and they will never get up again."

\v 14 Those who make oaths using the name of their shameful god of Samaria,
\q2 and those who solemnly promise to do something using the name of the god of Dan,
\q2 and those who swear using the name of the god of Beersheba—
\q1 they will all die;

<usfm>
\q
\v 13 In that day the beautiful virgins
\q and the young men will faint from thirst.
\q
\v 14 Those who swear by the sin of Samaria
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa the sin of Samaria \fqa* , some versions have \fqa Ashimah of Samaria \fqa* . Ashimah was the name of a pagan goddess worshiped in some parts of Syria.
\q and say, 'As your god lives, Dan'
\q and, 'As the way to Beersheba exists'—
\f + \ft The Hebrew text has \fqa As the way to Beersheba exists \fqa* , where this might refer to what people going to worship Beersheba's idols might have said. However, some versions want to change the Hebrew text to read \fqa As the loved one of Beersheba lives \fqa* . Here "loved one" stands for an idol worshiped in Beersheba. \f*
\q they will fall and never rise again."
