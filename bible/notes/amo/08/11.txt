\v 11 Look, the days are coming
\q —this is the declaration of the Lord Yahweh—
\q when I will send a famine in the land,
\q not a famine for bread,
\q nor of thirst for water,
\q but for hearing the words of Yahweh.
\q
\v 12 They will stagger from sea to sea;
\q they will run from the north to the east
\q to seek the word of Yahweh,
\q but they will not find it.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the days are coming** - This speaks of a future time as if "days are coming." AT: "there will be a time" or "in the future" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **this is the declaration of the Lord Yahweh** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:amo:04:04|4:5]]. AT: "this is what the Lord Yahweh declares" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **when I will send a famine in the land ... but for hearing the words of Yahweh** - Yahweh refusing to give messages when the people want to hear from him is spoken of as if there would be a famine of his words. AT: "when I will cause something like a famine in the land ... but for hearing the words of Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the words of Yahweh** - This can be stated in first person. AT: "words from me, Yahweh" or "my messages" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **They will stagger from sea to sea; they will run from the north to the east to seek the word of Yahweh** - Here "sea to sea" and "the north to the east" represent all of the land of Israel. AT: "They will wander here and there and search all over for the word of Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **from sea to sea** - This implies the Dead Sea in the south and the Mediterranean Sea in the west. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
