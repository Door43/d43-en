\v 11 Look, the days are coming"—this is the declaration of the Lord Yahweh—
\q "when I will send a famine in the land,
\q not a famine for bread,
\q nor of thirst for water,
\q but for hearing the words of Yahweh.
\q
\v 12 They will stagger from sea to sea;
\q they will run from the north to the east
\q to seek the word of Yahweh, 
\q but they will not find it.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **declaration of the Lord Yahweh** - Translate this as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:amo:03:13|3:13]]. 
    * **They will stagger ... they will run** - Some will walk slowly and fall down easily, like a person who is starving, and others will here and there quickly. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
    * **from sea to sea, they will run from the north to the east, to seek the word** - Possible meanings: 1) see UDB, or 2) "from sea to sea and from the north to the east. They will be running to seek the word."
    * **from sea to sea ... from the north to the east** - For a person standing at Bethel, this could be a circle: Dead Sea (south) to the Mediterranean (west) to north to east. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
