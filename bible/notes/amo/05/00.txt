====== Amos 05 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter continues to be written in a poetic format and foretells the destruction of the kingdom of Israel.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Place Names ==
This chapter refers to various places in land of Israel (i.e. Gilgal, Bethel, Beersheba). Normally these places have good connotations, but here they are referred to negatively. This is most likely because these cities became known for their idol worship. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]) 

== City gate ==
The "city gate" is mentioned several times. This was a place where people would go with legal and financial issues. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
