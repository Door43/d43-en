\v 18 Woe to you who desire the day of Yahweh!
\q Why do you long for the day of Yahweh?
\q It will be darkness and not light.
\q
\v 19 As when a man flees from a lion
\q and a bear meets him,
\q or he goes in a house and puts his hand on the wall
\q and a snake bites him.
\q
\v 20 Will not the day of Yahweh be darkness and not light?
\q Gloom and no brightness?
