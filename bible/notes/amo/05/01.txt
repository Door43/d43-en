  * **The virgin Israel has fallen ... no one to raise her up** - The phrase "The virgin Israel" represents the nation of Israel. The nation of Israel being destroyed and having no other nation to help them become strong again is spoken of as if it were a young woman who has fallen and has no one to raise her up.

  * **she is forsaken on her land** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "People have forsaken her" or "they have abandoned her" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
