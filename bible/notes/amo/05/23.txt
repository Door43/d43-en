    * **the noise of your songs** - "noise" is used because it has a negative connotation to exaggerate and emphasize God's disdain for hypocritical worship (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
    * **let justice flow like water, and righteousness like a constantly flowing stream**  - Continue in abundance of justice and righteousness.  See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]]
