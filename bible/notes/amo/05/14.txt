\v 14 In order to remain alive,

\q1 If you do that, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, will be with you
\q2 like you claim \add that he always is\add*.
\q1
\v 15 Love what is good, and hate what is evil!
\q2 Try to cause \add judges\add* in your courts to make decisions that are right\f + \ft Or: fair \f*!
\q1 If you do those things, perhaps the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels,
\q2 will act mercifully toward \add you descendants of\add* Joseph who are still alive.
