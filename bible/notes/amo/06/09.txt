\v 10 When a man’s relative comes to take their bodies up—the one who is to cremate them after bringing the corpses out of the house—if he says to the person in the house, "Is there anyone with you?" And if that person says, "No," then he will say, "Be quiet, for we must not mention Yahweh's name."

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **a man’s relative comes to take their bodies up—the one who is to cremate them after bringing the corpses out of the house—if he says to the person in the house, "Is ...?"**  - The meaning of these words is not clear. Possible meanings: 1) The "man's relative" is the one who will "take their bodies up" and cremate ... the corpses," and he speaks to a person who hid in the house after the ten family members died (see UDB). 2) The "man's relative" who "comes to take their bodies up" is a different person from "the one who is to cremate ... the corpses," and they talk to each other in the house: "a man’s relative comes to take their bodies up with the one who will burn the corpses after they have been brought out of the house—if while they are in the house the relative says to the burner of the corpses, 'Is ...?'"
    * **cremate** - burn a dead body
    * **corpse** - dead body
