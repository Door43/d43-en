\v 12 Horses certainly do not run on big rocks,
\q2 and certainly people cannot plow the rocks with oxen.
\q1 But you have done things that no one should do:
\q1 You have distorted what is fair;
\q2 you have changed what is right and consider it to be like things that are bitter.
\q1
\v 13 You are proud because you have captured the town of Lo Debar,

\q
\v 12 Do horses run on the rocky cliffs?
\q Does one plow there with oxen?
\q Yet you have turned justice into poison
\q and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness.
\q
\v 13 You who rejoice over Lo Debar,
\q who say, "Have we not taken Karnaim by our own strength?"
</usfm>

  * **General Information:** - Amos uses two rhetorical questions to draw attention to the rebuke that follows.

  * **Do horses run on the rocky cliffs?** - It is impossible for a horse to run on rocky cliffs without getting hurt.  Amos uses this rhetorical question to rebuke them for their actions. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Does one plow there with oxen?** - One does not plow on rocky ground. Amos uses this rhetorical question to rebuke them for their actions. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Yet you have turned justice into poison** - "But you make laws that hurt innocent people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness** - "and you punish those who do what is right" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Lo Debar ... Karnaim** - No one knows where these towns were. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
