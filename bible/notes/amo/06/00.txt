====== Amos 06 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter continues to be written in poetic style except for verses 9-10, which are in prose. These two verses contain many interested features. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

Verses 9-10 will probably be difficult to translate because the situation is vague and details don't appear to align easily. It is appropriate to translate these verses with some ambiguity remaining. It may be helpful to read many different versions prior to translating these verses.
