===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **look**  - AT: "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you."
  * **the big house will be smashed to pieces, and the little house to bits** - Possible meanings: 1) Yahweh will command others to destroy every house or 2) Yahweh himself will destroy every house himself simply by giving a command.
  * **big house ... and ... little house**  - all houses (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **pieces ... and ... bits**  - You can use the same word for both if you need to. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
