\v 1 Terrible things will happen to you people in Jerusalem who are not worried about anything,
\q2 and also to you leaders who live on the hill of the city of Samaria, you who think that you are safe.
\q1 You call yourselves the most important people in the world,
\q2 and you are the leaders to whom Israelites go for help.
\q1
\v 2 You tell them, "Just go to the city of Calneh and look at it.
\q2 Then go to see the great city Hamath
\q2 and to Gath in Philistia and look at it. They are all prosperous.
\q1 Now your lands are better than those places, and your two countries—Judah and Samaria—are bigger. So you are safe."

\c 6

\q
\v 1 Woe to those who are at ease in Zion,
\q and to those who are secure in the hill country of Samaria,
\q the notable men of the best of the nations,
\q to whom the house of Israel comes for help!
\q
\v 2 Your leaders say, "Go to Calneh and look;
\q from there go to Hamath, the great city;
\q then go down to Gath of the Philistines.
\q Are they better than your two kingdoms?
\q Is their border larger than your border?"
