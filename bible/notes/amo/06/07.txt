===== translationNotes: =====

  * **they will now go into exile with the first exiles** - "they will be among the first ones to go into exile" or "I will send them into exile first"
  * **the feasts of those who lounge about will pass away** - "there will be no more feasts for people to lie around at ease"
  * **this is the declaration of the Lord Yahweh, the God of hosts** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:amo:03:13|3:13]]. AT: "this is what the Lord Yahweh, the God of hosts, has declared" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, the God of hosts, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **I detest the pride of Jacob** - Here "Jacob" represents his descendants. AT: "I hate the descendants of Jacob because they have become arrogant" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I hate his fortresses** - It is implied that Yahweh hates the fortresses because the people believed the fortresses would keep them safe. AT: "I hate the people of Israel because they trust in their fortresses, not in me, to protect them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
