\q
\v 10 "I sent a plague on you as on Egypt.
\q I killed your young men with the sword,
\q carried away your horses,
\q and made the stench of your camp come up
\q to your nostrils.
\q Yet you have not returned to me
\q —this is the declaration of Yahweh."
\q
\v 11 "I overthrew cities among you,
\q as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.
\q You were like a burning stick snatched out of the fire.
\q Yet you have not returned to me
\q —this is the declaration of Yahweh."
