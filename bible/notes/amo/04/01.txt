===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **take you away with hooks, the last of you with fishhooks**  - "completely defeat all of you and force you to go away with them" or "put you on hooks like fish and take you away" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **hooks ... fishhooks** - The difference in meaning between these words is not clear, so it may be best to treat them as the same. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and UDB)
