  * **Connecting Statement:** - God continues to speak to the people of Israel.

  * **breaks in the city wall** - places where the enemy had broken down the city wall to enter
  * **you will be thrown out toward Harmon** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "they will throw you out toward Harmon" or "your enemies will force you to leave the city and go toward Harmon" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Harmon** - This is either the name of a place that we do not know, or it refers to Mount Hermon. Some modern versions interpret it in that way. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated these words in [[:en:bible:notes:amo:02:11|2:11]].
