\v 5 The Lord Yahweh of hosts
\q touches the land and it melts;
\q all who live in it mourn;

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **all of it will rise up like the River, and sink again like the river of Egypt** - Here "the River" and "river of Egypt" both refer to the Nile river. Yahweh causing the land to shake violently is compared to the waters of the Nile river rising and sinking. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **he who builds his steps in the heavens** - These are probably the steps that ancient people imagined led up to God's palace in the heavens. However, some modern versions wish to read a different Hebrew word meaning "palace" or "rooms." Here "his steps" probably is a metonym for God's palace. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **has established his vault over the earth** - Here "vault" refers to the sky which biblical writers described as being a dome over the earth. AT: "he sets the sky over the earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **He calls for the waters of the sea ... on the surface of the earth** - This represents God causing the sea water to fall on the earth as rain. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:amo:05:08|5:8]]. AT: "He takes the waters of the sea and makes them rain down on the surface of the earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Yahweh is his name** - By declaring his name, Yahweh is declaring his power and authority to do these things. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:amo:05:08|5:8]].
