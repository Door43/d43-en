\v 5 The Lord, Yahweh of hosts
\q touches the land and it melts;
\q all who live in it mourn;
\q all of it will rise up like the River,
\q and sink again like the River of Egypt.

\v 6 It is he who builds his chambers in the heavens,
\q and has established his vault on the earth.
\q He calls for the waters of the sea,
\q and pours them out on the face of the earth,
\q Yahweh is his name.
