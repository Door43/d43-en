\v 7 "Are you not like the people of Ethiopia to me,
\q people of Israel?
\q —this is the declaration of Yahweh.
\q Did I not bring up Israel out of the land of Egypt,
\q the Philistines from Crete,
\q and the Arameans from Kir?
\q
\v 8 Look, the eyes of the Lord Yahweh are on the sinful kingdom,
\q and I will destroy it from the face of the earth,
\q except that I will not totally destroy the house of Jacob
\q —this is the declaration of Yahweh."
