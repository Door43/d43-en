\v 13 There will be a time when your crops will grow very well;
\q1 very soon after the crops are harvested,
\q2 farmers will plow the ground to plant more crops in it again,
\q1 and soon after the vineyards are planted,
\q2 farmers will harvest grapes and tread on them to make wine.
\q1 And because there will be very much wine,
\q2 it will seem as though wine is flowing down from the hills.

\q
\v 13 Look, the days will come—this is Yahweh's declaration—
\q when the plowman will overtake the reaper,
\q and the treader of grapes will overtake him who plants seed.
\q The mountains will drip sweet wine,
\q and all the hills will flow with it.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Look** - The writer is telling the reader that he is going to say something surprising. Your language may have a way of doing this.
  * **the days will come ... when the plowman** - A future time is spoken of as if "days will come." AT: "there will be a time ... when the plowman" or "in the future ... the plowman" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **when the plowman ... him who plants seed** - These are two images of Yahweh restoring prosperity in Israel. This means grain will grow faster than the people can harvest it, and there will be so many grapes, those crushing the grapes will still be working when farmers start planting more vineyards.
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:amo:02:11|2:11]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **The mountains will drip sweet wine, and all the hills will flow with it** - These two lines mean basically the same thing. The huge amount of grapes and wine in Israel is spoken of as if wine flows down the hills and mountains. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
