===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Look** - The writer is telling the reader that he is going to say something surprising. Your language may have a way of doing this.
  * **The mountains will drip sweet wine, and all the hills will flow with it.** - These two lines mean basically the same thing and emphasize that the land will be very productive. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
