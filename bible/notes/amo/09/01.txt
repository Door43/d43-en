\c 9
\p
\v 1 I saw the Lord standing beside the altar, and he said, "Strike the tops of the pillars so that the foundations will shake.
\q Break them in pieces on all of their heads,
\q and I will kill the last of them with the sword.
\q Not one of them will get away,
\q not one of them will escape.
\q
\v 2 Though they dig into sheol,
\q there my hand will take them.
\q Though they climb up to heaven,
\q there I will bring them down.
