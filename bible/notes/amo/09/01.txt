\c 9
\p
\v 1 I saw the Lord standing beside the altar: and he said, Strike the capitals, that the thresholds may shake; and break them
in pieces on the head of all of them; and I will kill the last of them with the sword: there shall not one of them flee away,
and there shall not one of them escape.
\v 2 Though they dig into Sheol, thence shall my hand take them; and though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them
down.
