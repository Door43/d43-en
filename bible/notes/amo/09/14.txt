===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I will plant them upon their land, and they will never again be uprooted from the land** - Bringing the people back to their land and keeping them safe from enemies is spoken of as if Israel were a plant that Yahweh would put in the ground and not let anyone pull the plant up from the ground. AT: "I will cause them to live in the land forever like a plant that is never uprooted" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **they will never again be uprooted from the land** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "no one will ever again uproot them from the land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) 
  * **uprooted** - for a plant and its roots to be pulled out of the ground
