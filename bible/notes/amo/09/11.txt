    * **tent ... breaches ... ruins** - After Yahweh destroys the kingdom of Israel, it will be like a tent whose wooden poles have collapsed, a wall that has been broken down in some places, and a house that has been torn down. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **breaches** - parts of a wall that have fallen down
    * **ruins** - what is left when a building is destroyed
