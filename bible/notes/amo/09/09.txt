\v 9 When I command it, it will be as though I will shake you Israelite people who are living in various nations,
\q2 as farmer shakes a sieve to separate the stone pebbles from the grain
\q2 in order that they do not fall on the ground with the grain.

\v 10 From among my people,
\q2 all you sinful people who say, 'We will not experience disasters; nothing evil will happen to us,'
\q1 your enemies will kill you with their swords."

\q
\v 9 "Look, I will give a command,
\q and I will shake the house of Israel among all the nations,
\q as one shakes grain in a sieve,
\q so that not the smallest stone will fall to the ground.
\q
\v 10 All the sinners of my people will die by the sword,
\q those who say, 'Disaster will not overtake or meet us.'"

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **one shakes grain in a sieve, so that not the smallest stone will fall to the ground** - The picture here is of grain falling through the sieve and stones being kept out. Some versions understand "not the smallest stone will fall" to mean the good grain will not fall through the sieve with the unwanted material.
    * **sieve** - a surface with many small holes that allow small things to pass through and keep larger things from passing through
