\v 4 This is what Yahweh says:
\q "For three sins of Judah,
\q even for four,
\q I will not turn away punishment,
\q because they rejected the law of Yahweh
\q and did not kept his statutes.
\q Their lies caused them to err,
\q the same way their fathers went.
\q
\v 5 I will send fire on Judah,
\q and it will devour the fortresses of Jerusalem."
