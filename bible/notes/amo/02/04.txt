\v 4 Yahweh also said this:
\q1 "\add I will punish the people of\add* Judah because of the many sins \add that they have committed\add*;
\q2 I will not change my mind about punishing them,
\q1 because they have rejected what I taught them
\q2 and they have not obeyed my commands.
\q1 They have been deceived \add and persuaded to worship\add* false gods,
\q2 the same gods that their ancestors \add worshiped\add*.
\q1

\v 4 This is what Yahweh says:
\q "For three sins of Judah,
\q even for four,
\q I will not turn away punishment,
\q because they rejected the law of Yahweh
\q and did not kept his statutes.
\q Their lies caused them to err,
\q the same way their fathers went.
\q
\v 5 I will send fire on Judah,
\q and it will devour the fortresses of Jerusalem."
