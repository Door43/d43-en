\v 9 Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them,
\q Whose height was like the height of cedars;
\q He was strong as the oaks.
\q Yet I destroyed his fruit above
\q And his roots below.
\q
\v 10 Also, I brought you up out of the land of Egypt
\q And led you forty years in the wilderness
\q To possess the land of the Amorites.
