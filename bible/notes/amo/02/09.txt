\v 9 Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them,
\q whose height was like the height of cedars;
\q he was strong as the oaks.
\q Yet I destroyed his fruit above
\q and his roots below.
\q
\v 10 Also, I brought you up out of the land of Egypt
\q and led you forty years in the wilderness
\q to possess the land of the Amorites.
