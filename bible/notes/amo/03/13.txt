===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the house of Jacob** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house. In this case it refers to Jacob's descendants. They were the people of Israel. AT: "the descendants of Jacob" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **this is the declaration of the Lord Yahweh, the God of hosts** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated the similar phrase "this is Yahweh's declaration" in [[:en:bible:notes:amo:02:11|2:11]]. AT: "this is what the Lord Yahweh, the God of hosts, has declared" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, the God of hosts, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **in the day that I punish the sins of Israel** - "when I punish the sins of Israel"
  * **I will also punish the altars of Bethel** - People sinned against God by worshiping false gods at their altars. Here "punish the altars" represents punishing the people by destroying their altars. AT: "I will also destroy the altars at Bethel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **The horns of the altar will be cut off and fall to the ground** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Your enemies will cut off the horns of the altars, and the horns will fall to the ground" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **horns of the altar** - People worshiped false gods at their altars. At the top corners of the altars there were pieces of metal shaped like bull horns. These horns were a symbol of the strength of their gods.
