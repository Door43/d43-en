===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the winter house with the summer house** - Some of the wealthy people had two houses: one that they lived in during the winter and one that they lived in during the summer. This refers to any winter and summer houses. AT: "the houses they live in during the winter and the houses they live in during the summer" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_genericnoun]])
  * **The houses of ivory will perish** - God speaks of the houses being destroyed as if they were alive and would die. AT: "The houses of ivory will be destroyed" or "The houses of ivory will collapse" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **The houses of ivory** - "the houses that are decorated with ivory." This refers to houses that had decorations made of ivory on the walls and furniture. Ivory was very expensive, so only the wealthy people had things decorated with ivory.
  * **ivory** - the teeth and horns of large animals
  * **and the large houses will vanish** - "and the large houses will exist no more." Here "vanish" represents being destroyed. AT: "and the large houses will be destroyed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:amo:02:11|2:11]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
