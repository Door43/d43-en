===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **fortresses at Ashdod** and **fortresses in the land of Egypt** - Here "fortresses" is referring to the leaders or those who are responsible for fortifying or defending their jurisdictions as evidenced by the command to "Assemble yourselves" [buildings cannot assemble themselves].   See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]
    * **'They store up violence and destruction in their fortresses**  - By storing up the spoils of the violence and destruction they are actually storing up the evil deeds in God's eyes.  See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]].
