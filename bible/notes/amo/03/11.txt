\q
\v 11 Therefore, this is what the Lord Yahweh says:
\q "An enemy will surround the land.
\q He will pull down your strongholds
\q And plunder your fortresses."
\p
\q
\v 12 This is that Yahweh says:
\q As the shepherd rescues out of the mouth of the lion
\q Two legs only,
\q Or a piece of an ear,
\q So will the people of Israel be rescued who live in Samaria,
\q With only the corner of a couch,
\q Or just a piece of a bed covering."
