\q
\v 11 Therefore, this is what the Lord Yahweh says:
\q "An enemy will surround the land.
\q He will pull down your strongholds
\q and plunder your fortresses."
\p
\q
\v 12 This is that Yahweh says:
\q As the shepherd rescues out of the mouth of the lion
\q two legs only,
\q or a piece of an ear,
\q so will the people of Israel be rescued who live in Samaria,
\q with only the corner of a couch,
\q or just a piece of a bed covering."
