<usfm>
\v 16 Aaron and his sons may eat the remaining part of the grain offering. But they must eat it in a holy place, in the courtyard of the Sacred Tent.
\v 17 It must not have yeast mixed with it. Like the offerings for sin and the offerings to cause people to no longer be guilty of sin, that offering is very holy.
\v 18 Any male descendants of Aaron are permitted to eat it, because it is forever their regular share of the offerings given to Yahweh and burned in the fire \add on the altar\add*. Anyone else who touches those offerings made from grain will be punished by God."

\v 16 Aaron and his sons may eat the remaining part of the grain offering. But they must eat it in a place that is set apart for God, in the courtyard of the sacred tent.
\v 17 It must not have yeast mixed with it. Like the offerings for sin and the offerings to cause people to no longer be guilty of sin, that offering is very special, reserved for me.
\v 18 Any male descendants of Aaron are permitted to eat it, because it is their permanent regular share of the offerings given to me and burned in the fire on the altar. Whoever touches them will be considered to be set apart for the honor of Yahweh."

\v 16 Aaron and his sons will eat whatever is left of the offering. It must be eaten without yeast in a holy place. They will eat it in the courtyard of the tent of meeting 
\v 17 It must not be baked with yeast. I have given it as their part of my offerings made by fire. It is most holy, as the sin offering and the guilt offering.
\v 18 For all time to come throughout your people's generations, any male descended from Aaron may eat it as his share, taken from the offerings of Yahweh made by fire. Whoever touches them will become holy.' "
