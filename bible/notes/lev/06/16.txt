\v 16 Aaron and his sons may eat the remaining part of the grain offering. But they must eat it in a holy place, in the courtyard of the Sacred Tent.
\v 17 It must not have yeast mixed with it. Like the offerings for sin and the offerings to cause people to no longer be guilty of sin, that offering is very holy.
\v 18 Any male descendants of Aaron are permitted to eat it, because it is forever their regular share of the offerings given to Yahweh and burned in the fire \add on the altar\add*. Anyone else who touches those offerings made from grain will be punished by God."

\v 16 Whatever is left of the offering Aaron and his sons will eat. It must be eaten without yeast in a place set apart for Yahweh. In the court of the tent of meeting they will eat it.
\v 17 It must not be baked with yeast. I have given it as their part of my offerings made by fire. It is most holy, as the sin offering and the guilt offering.
\v 18 Any male descended from Aaron may eat it as his share forever throughout your generations, from the offerings of Yahweh made by fire. Whatever touches them will be considered set apart for God.' "
