\v 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 2 "If anyone sins and acts unfaithfully against Yahweh by deceiving his neighbor regarding something held in trust, or was left in his care, or about something that was stolen, or if he has oppressed his neighbor,
\v 3 or he has found something that his neighbor lost and lies about it, or if he swears falsely, or in any matters like these by which people sin,
\v 4 and if he has sinned and is found to be guilty, he must restore whatever he took by robbery or oppression, or that which was entrusted to him, or that which was lost but that he had found.

\v 5 In addition, in any matter in which he swore falsely, he must restore it in full and he must add one-fifth of the value of it and pay it all to the owner on the day that he is found guilty.
