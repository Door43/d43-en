\p
\v 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 2 "If anyone sins and breaks a command against Yahweh, such as dealing  falsely with his neighbor regarding something entrusted to him, or if he cheats or robs him, or has oppressed his neighbor,
\v 3 or has found something that his neighbor lost and lies about it, and swears to the lie, or in matters like these in which people sin,
\v 4 then it will come about, if he has sinned and is guilty, that he must restore whatever he took by robbery or oppression or taking what was entrusted to him or the lost thing that he found.
