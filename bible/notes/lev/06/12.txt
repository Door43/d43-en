===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The fire on the altar will be kept burning** - Yahweh commanded that the priests keep the fire continually burning. This can be translated in active form. AT: "The priest will keep the fire on the altar burning" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **as required on it** - The requirements for the altar fire were received directly from God. Translate this so it is clear that God is the one who demands the fire on the altar. AT: "on it as God demands" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
