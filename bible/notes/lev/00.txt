** Who wrote Leviticus?**\\

The Bible tells us that Moses composed the book of Exodus. The writers of both the Old and New Testament confirm his part in the composition of the book of Leviticus. Though Moses was the main author, it is likely that priests later continued adding laws to Leviticus based on older traditions.  Ultimately, one can say that God is the author of Genesis because he inspired Moses’s writings. The word “Leviticus” means “pertaining to the Levites” in the Greek language.


**What are the different parts of Leviticus?**\\
On 17 occasions, the phrase “The LORD said to Moses” (and Aaron), and it is often used for paragraph breaks. Leviticus is filled with God or Moses speaking to others. The verb “speak” is used 38 times. The setting where these instructions were given is the “Tent of Meeting” also called “the Tabernacle.”

**What is the literary genre of Leviticus?**\\

While the book contains long lists of laws, it is not written as a legal document. These laws are contained within a narrative. This narrative feature of the book should remain.



===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

**Why did the Israelites need such an elaborate sacrificial system?**\\
Leviticus shows that God is [[:en:obe:kt:holy|holy]].  This means that God is very different than man.  He is free from [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]] and defilement. Because of this, he can only be approached after the defilement of sin is removed from man.  In order for Israel to remain [[:en:obe:kt:purify|pure]], a system of sacrifices performed by priests was required. 

**What is the relationship between the sacrificial system and the sacrifice of Christ?**\\
The sacrifice of Christ is a fulfillment of the sacrificial system.  Jesus offered his life as the perfect and complete sacrifice for sin.  


**How was the Israelite sacrificial system different than the rituals performed by other ancient near east nations?**\\

The Israelites were prohibited from offering human sacrifice and lacked any sexual component. Both of these were common in the Ancient Near East where there were prostitutes in the temples used to make their gods give them fertile land.  The Law of Moses also saw that a sacrifice was necessary for human sin.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====


**What important symbols are introduced in Leviticus?**\\
Oil represents the setting apart of someone or something, also called sanctification. Water is used to clean or make something pure. Blood was also used for cleansing and purification because it represented life which needed to be shed for sin. Because of this, [[:en:obe:kt:atonement|atonement]] plays an important part in Leviticus.  

**Why do many sections begin with the phrase "Yahweh said to Moses?"**\\

This phrase shows the reader that these rules ultimately come from God and must be obeyed.  You could also translate this as "God told Moses."
