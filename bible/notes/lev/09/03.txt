\v 3 Then say to the Israelite people, 'Take a male goat to offer it for your sins. Also take a calf and a lamb that have no defects, so that you can burn them whole on the altar.
\v 4 Also take an ox and a ram to offer them, so you may promise friendship with Yahweh, along with an offering of flour mixed with olive oil. Do this because today Yahweh is going to appear to you.'"
\p
\v 5 After Moses gave these instructions to the Israelites, some of them brought these things and went to the courtyard in front of the sacred tent. Then all the people came near and stood in front of Yahweh.

\v 3 You must speak to the people of Israel and say, 'Take a male goat for a sin offering and a calf and a lamb, both a year old and without blemish, for a burnt offering;
\v 4 also take an ox and a ram for peace offerings to sacrifice before Yahweh,  and a grain offering mixed with oil, because today Yahweh will appear to you.' "
\v 5 So they brought all that Moses commanded to the tent of meeting, and all the assembly of Israel drew near and stood before Yahweh.
