\v 15 Aaron presented the people’s sacrifice—a goat, then took it as the sacrifice for their sin and killed it; he sacrificed it for sin, as he had done with the first goat.
\v 16 He presented the burnt offering and offered it as Yahweh had commanded.
\v 17 He presented the grain offering; he filled his hand with it and burned it on the altar, along with the morning's burnt offering.
