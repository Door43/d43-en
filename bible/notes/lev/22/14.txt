====== Leviticus 22:14-16 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 If anyone who is not permitted to eat a sacred offering eats it without realizing that it is sacred, he must pay the priest for the offering, and pay him an extra one-fifth of its value.
\v 15 When the priests bring offerings to me, the sacred offerings that the Israelite people bring to them, they must not treat those offerings as though they are not sacred
\v 16 by allowing those who are not priests to eat any of those offerings. If they did that, they would become guilty and must make a payment. I am Yahweh, the one who causes those offerings to be sacred."

\v 14 If anyone who is not permitted to eat a sacred offering eats it without realizing that it is sacred, he must pay the priest for the food and add an extra one fifth to it.
\v 15 When the priests bring offerings to me, the sacred offerings that the Israelite people bring to them, they must not treat those offerings as though they were not special to me;
\v 16 the people must not allow anyone who is not a priest to eat any of those offerings. If they did that, they would become guilty. I am Yahweh, the one who sets the Israelite people apart from other people and makes them holy for my honor."

\v 14 If a man eats a holy food without knowing it, then he must repay the priest for it; he must add one fifth to it and give it back to the priest.
\p
\v 15 The people of Israel must not dishonor the things that they have raised high and presented to Yahweh, 
\v 16 and cause themselves to carry the sin that would make them guilty of eating the holy food, for I am Yahweh, who sanctifies them.' "
