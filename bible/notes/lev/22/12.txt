\v 12 If a priest's daughter marries a man who is not a priest, she no longer is permitted to eat the sacred food.
\v 13 But if a priest's daughter who has no children becomes a widow or becomes divorced, if she returns to her father's house to live there like she did when she was young, she may eat the same food that her father eats. But no other person is permitted to eat any of it.

<usfm>
\v 12 If a priest's daughter marries a man who is not a priest, she no longer is permitted to eat the sacred food that were given to Yahweh as gifts or offerings.
\v 13 But suppose that a priest's daughter who has no children becomes a widow or becomes divorced, and suppose also that she returns to her father's house to live there as she did when she was young. In that case, she may eat the same food that her father eats. But no other person is permitted to eat any of it.

\v 13 But if a priest’s daughter is a widow, or divorced, and if she has no child, and if she returns to live in her father’s house as in her youth, she may eat from her father’s food. But no one who is not in the priestly family may  eat from the priest's food.
