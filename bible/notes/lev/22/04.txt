<usfm>
\v 4 If any descendant of Aaron has a contagious skin disease or a discharge from his sexual organs, he is not allowed to eat any of the sacred offerings until he is cured. He will also be unfit for his work if he touches anything which has become unacceptable to me because it has touched a corpse, or if he touches anyone who as an emission of semen,
\v 5 or if he touches anything that crawls on the ground, or if he touches any person who causes him to be unfit for his work.
\v 6 Any priest who touches such things must bathe, and he must not touch anyone else until that evening.

\v 4 Any man among Aaron's descendants who has an infectious skin disease, or a flow of infected fluid from his body—that man must not eat any of the sacrifices made to Yahweh until he is clean. Whoever touches anything  unclean through contact with something dead, or by contact with a man who has emitted semen,
\v 5 or whoever touches any creeping animal by which he may be made unclean, or any unclean person by whom he may be made unclean, whatever kind of uncleanness it may be— 
\v 6 then the priest who touches anything unclean will be unclean until evening; he must not eat any of the holy things, unless after he bathes his body in water.
