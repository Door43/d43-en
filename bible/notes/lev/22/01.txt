===== translationNotes: =====

  * **tell them to keep away from the holy things** - "tell them when they should keep away from the holy things." Yahweh is about to describe situations where a priest is unclean and not allowed to touch holy things.
  * **profane my holy name** - The word "profane" is a metonym that means dishonor. AT: "dishonor my reputation" or "dishonor me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **throughout your people's generations** - This can be made explicit. AT: "from now on" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **that person must be cut off** - See how you translated this idea in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:07:19|7:20]].
