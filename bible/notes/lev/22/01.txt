===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **tell them to keep away from the holy things** - "tell them when they should keep away from the holy things." Yahweh is about to describe situations where a priest is unclean and not allowed to touch holy things.
  * **profane my holy name** - AT: "dishonor my reputation" or "dishonor me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **throughout your people's generations** - AT: "from now on"
  * **that person must be cut off** - AT: "you must remove that person from the community" (See:[[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
