\v 25 If a woman has a flow of blood for many days that is not in the time of her menstruation, or if she has a flow  beyond the time of her menstruation, during all the days of the flow of her uncleanness, she will be as if she were in the days of her period. She is unclean.
\v 26 Every bed on which she lies all during her flow of blood will be to her just like the bed on which she lies during her menstruation, and everything on which she sits will be unclean, just like the uncleanness of her menstruation.
\v 27 And whoever touches any of those things will be unclean; he must  wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and he will be unclean until evening.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **she will be as if she were in the days of her period** - This means that if the woman bleeds from her womb at any time other than her regular menstruation time, she is still unclean just like during her menstruation.
