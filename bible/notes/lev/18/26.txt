\v 26 You must all obey my laws and decrees. That includes you people who were born here and the foreigners who live among you.
\v 27 All those detestable things were done by the people who lived in this land before you came here, and they caused the land to become defiled.
\v 28 So if you defile the land, I will get rid of \f + \ft metaphor \f* you like I got rid of the people of those nations that were here before you came.

\v 26 You must all obey my laws and decrees. That includes you people who were born here and the foreigners who live among you.
\v 27 All those detestable things—the people who lived in this land before you came did all those things, and they defiled the land.
\v 28 So if you also defile the land, I will get rid of you as I got rid of the people of those nations that were here before you came.

<usfm>
\v 26 You, therefore, must keep my commandments and decrees, and you must not do any of these detestable things, neither the native born Israelite nor the foreigner who lives among you.
\v 27 For this is the wickedness that the people in the land have committed, those who lived here before you, and now the land is defiled.
\v 28 Therefore careful, so that the land does not vomit you up also, after you have defiled it, as it vomited out the people who were before you.
