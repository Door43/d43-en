===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must not do that would defile them.

  * **You must not give any of your children to pass through the fire** - Translate this so it is clear that children were not to be offered as burnt sacrifices. AT: "You must not burn your children alive" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **you must not profane the name of your God** - Translate this so "profane" means dishonor or shame. AT: "you must not dishonor my reputation" or "you must not bring shame on me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
