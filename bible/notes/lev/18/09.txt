===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **whether she is the daughter of your father or the daughter of your mother** - This means a man cannot sleep with his sister if they have the same parents or even if she has a different mother or father.
  * **whether she was raised at your home or distant from you**  - AT: "whether she grew up at your home or far away from you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Do not have sexual relations with your father's wife's daughter** - Possible meanings are 1) "Do not sleep with your half-sister (UDB) or 2) "Do not sleep with your step-sister." Here the man would not have the same father or mother as the woman. They became brother and sister when their parents married.
