\v 17 If he dedicates the land during the Year of Celebration, its value will be the full amount.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 If the man sets apart for the honor of Yahweh the land during the year of the jubilee celebration, its value will be the full amount.
\v 18 But if he sets apart his field to Yahweh after the year of the jubilee celebration, the priest will count the number of years until the next year of the jubilee celebration, and if there are not many years that remain, the price will be much lower than the full price.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 If he set apart his field during the year of jubilee, the estimated value will stand.
\v 18 But if he set apart his field after the jubilee, then the priest must calculate the value of the field by the number of years that remain until the next year of jubilee, and the estimated value must be reduced.
