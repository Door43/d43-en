\v 14 \add Similarly\add*, if someone dedicates his house to be a sacred gift to belong to me, the priest will decide how much it is worth, which will depend on whether the house is in good condition. Whatever the priest says that it is worth, that will be its value \add and that is the price that the priest must pay for it\add*.
\v 15 If the man who dedicated his house to me later wants to buy it back, he must pay that price plus an added one-fifth, and then the house will belong to him again.

\v 14 Similarly, if someone dedicates his house, and to set it apart for the honor of Yahweh, the priest will decide how much it is worth, which will depend on the house's condition. Whatever the priest says that it is worth, that will be its value.
\v 15 If a man set apart his house for the honor of Yahweh, but later he wants to buy it back, he must pay that price plus an added one fifth, and then the house will belong to him again.

\v 14 When a man sets apart his house as a holy gift to Yahweh, then the priest will set its value as either good or bad. Whatever the priest values it, so it will be.
\v 15 But if the owner who set apart his home and later wishes to redeem it, he must add a fifth of its value to its redemption price, and it will belong to him.

  * **he must add a fifth of its value to its redemption price** - A "fifth" is a part of something that is divided into five equal parts. AT: "he must divide the value of the house into five equal parts, add the amount equal to one of those parts, and pay all of it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_fraction]])
