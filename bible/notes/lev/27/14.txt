\v 14 \add Similarly\add*, if someone dedicates his house to be a sacred gift to belong to me, the priest will decide how much it is worth, which will depend on whether the house is in good condition. Whatever the priest says that it is worth, that will be its value \add and that is the price that the priest must pay for it\add*.
\v 15 If the man who dedicated his house to me later wants to buy it back, he must pay that price plus an added one-fifth, and then the house will belong to him again.

\v 14 When a man desires to sanctify his house to Yahweh, then the priest will estimate it's value. Whatever the priest values it at, that will be its value.
\v 15 But if the owner who sanctified his home wishes to redeem it, then a fifth of its value is to be added to its redemption price, and then the house will be his again.
