\v 19 If the man who sanctified the field wishes to redeem it, then he must add a fifth to the estimated value, and it will be become his again.
\v 20 If he does not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it cannot be redeemed any more. 
\v 21 Instead, the field, when it is released in the jubilee, will be a holy gift to Yahweh, like the field that has been completely given to Yahweh. It will belong to the priest.
