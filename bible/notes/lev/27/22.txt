\v 22 If someone sets apart for the honor of Yahweh some land that he has bought, land which is not part of the land that his family has always owned,
\v 23 the priest must count the number of years until the next year of the celebration of Jubilee to determine how much it is worth, and the man must pay that amount to the priest on that day, and then that land will belong to him again, and his payment becomes a holy gift to Yahweh.

\v 22 If a man sets apart a field that he has bought, but that field is not part of his family's land, 
\v 23 then the priest will figure the valuation of it up to the year of jubilee, and the man must pay its value on that day as a holy gift to Yahweh.
