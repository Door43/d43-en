<usfm>
\v 11 If the animal that he wishes to dedicate to me is a kind that is unacceptable to be an offering to me, he must take the animal to the priest.
\v 12 The priest then will decide what its value is, according to the animal's good and bad points. Whatever value the priests sets will be the value of the animal, \add and that is the price that the priest must pay for the animal\add*.
\v 13 If the man who gave the animal later decides that he wants to buy it back, he must pay \add to the priest\add* that price plus an added one-fifth.

\v 11 However, if what the person has vowed to give Yahweh is in fact unclean, so that Yahweh will not accept it, then the person must bring the animal to a priest. 
\v 12 The priest will value it, by the market value of the animal. Whatever value the priest places on the animal, that will be its value.
\v 13 And if the owner wishes to redeem it, then a fifth of its value is to be added to its redemption price.
