===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 If the animal that he wishes to dedicate to me is a kind that is unacceptable to be an offering to me, he must take the animal to the priest.
\v 12 The priest then will decide what its value is, according to the animal's good and bad points. Whatever value the priests sets will be the value of the animal, \add and that is the price that the priest must pay for the animal\add*.
\v 13 If the man who gave the animal later decides that he wants to buy it back, he must pay \add to the priest\add* that price plus an added one-fifth.

\v 11 And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer an oblation to Jehovah, then he shall set the beast before the priest;
\v 12 and the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as you the priest valuest it, so shall it be.
\v 13 But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part thereof to your estimation.
