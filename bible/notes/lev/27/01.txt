  * **If anyone makes a special vow to Yahweh** - In this case the vow would involve giving oneself or another person to God. This can be stated clearly AT: "If anyone vows to give someone to the Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **use the following valuations** - Instead of giving the person, he would give the Lord a certain amount of silver. AT "use the following values as your gift to the Lord in place of the person" or "give the Lord the following amounts of silver instead of the person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
