<usfm>
\v 9 If someone solemnly promises to give an animal that is acceptable to be an offering to me, that animal becomes sacred \add and belongs to me\add*.
\v 10 The person who promised to give it must not give another animal instead of the one that he promised; he must not substitute a bad one for a good one or even a better one than the one offered. If he would substitute one for the other, both animals would belong to me.

<usfm>
\v 9 If someone solemnly promises Yahweh to give him an animal that is acceptable to him, that animal becomes very special to Yahweh; it belongs to him alone.
\v 10 The person who promised to give it must not give another animal instead of the one that he promised. He must not substitute a bad one for a good one or even a better one than the one offered. If he tries to do that, both animals will become dedicated to Yahweh.

\v 9 If someone wants to sacrifice an animal to Yahweh, and if Yahweh accepts it, then that animal will belong fully to him.
\v 10 The person must not alter or change such an animal, a good one for a bad one or a bad for a good. If he does at all change one animal for another, then both it and the one for which it is exchanged become holy.
