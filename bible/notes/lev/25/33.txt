\v 33 If one of the Levites does not redeem a house he sold, then the house that was sold in the city where it is located must be returned in the jubilee, for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their property among the people of Israel.
\v 34 But the fields around their cities may not be sold because they are the permanent property of the Levites.
