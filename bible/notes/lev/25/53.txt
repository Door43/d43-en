\v 53 During those years that he is working for the man who bought him, the man who bought him must treat him like he would treat a hired worker, and all of you must make sure that his owner does not treat him cruelly.
\p
\v 54 And even if a fellow Israelite who has sold himself to a rich man is not able to pay for himself to be freed by any of these ways, he and his children must be freed in the Year of Celebration,
\v 55 because \add it is as though\add* you Israelites are my slaves\f + \ft Or: servants \f*, whom I, Yahweh your God, freed from \add being slaves\add* in Egypt."

\v 53 He is to be treated like a man hired year by year. You must make sure he is not treated with harshness.
\v 54 If he is not redeemed by these means, then he must serve until the year of jubilee, he and his children with him.
\v 55 To me the people of Israel are servants. They are my servants whom I brought out of the land of Egypt. I am Yahweh your God.' "
