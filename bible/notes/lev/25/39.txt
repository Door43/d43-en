\v 39 If your fellow countryman has become poor and sells himself to you, you must not make him work like a slave.
\v 40 Treat him as a hired servant. He must be like someone living temporarily with you. He will serve with you until the year of jubilee. 
\v 41 Then he will go away from you, he and his children with him, and he will return to his own family and to his fathers' property.
