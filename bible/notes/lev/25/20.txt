\v 20 And if you shall say, What shall we eat the seventh youar? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase;
\v 21 then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for the three years.
\v 22 And you shall sow the eighth youar, and eat of the fruits, the old store; until the ninth youar, until its fruits come in, you shall eat the old store.
