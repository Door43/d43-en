\v 20 But you may ask, "If we do not plant or harvest our crops during the seventh year, what will we have to eat?"
\v 21 Yahweh answers you that he will bless you very much during the sixth year, with the result that during that year there will be enough crops to provide food for you for three years.
\v 22 Then, after you plant seed during the eighth year and wait for the crops to grow, you will eat the food grown in the sixth year; you will continue to eat it until you harvest your crops in the ninth year.

\v 20 You might say, "What will we eat during the seventh year? Look, we cannot plant or gather our produce." 
\v 21 I will command my blessing to come upon you in the sixth year, and it will produce harvest enough for three years.
\v 22 You will plant in the eighth year and continue to eat from the previous years' produce and the stored food. Until the harvest of the ninth year comes in, you will be able to eat from the provisions stored in the previous years.
