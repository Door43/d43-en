\v 29 If a man sells a house in a walled city, then he may buy it back within a whole year after it was sold. For a full year he will have the right of redemption.
\v 30 If the house is not redeemed within a full year, then the house in the walled city will become the permanent property of the man who bought it, throughout his descendants' generations. That house is not to be returned in the jubilee.
