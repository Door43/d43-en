<usfm>
\v 11 The fiftieth year will be a jubilee to you. You must not plant or conduct an organized harvest. Eat whatever grows by itself, and gather the grapes that grow on the unpruned  vines.
\v 12 For it is a jubilee which must be holy to you. You must eat the produce which grows by itself out of the fields.
