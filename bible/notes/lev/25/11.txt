<usfm>
\v 11 This year, the fiftieth year, will be a year in which you must rejoice and obey Yahweh's special instructions. During that year do not plant anything, and do not harvest in your usual manner the crops or grapes that have grown by themselves.
\v 12 It will be a year for you to rejoice in. You will treat it as special, and eat only what has grown by itself.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 The fiftieth year will be a jubilee for you. You must not plant or conduct an organized harvest. Eat whatever grows by itself, and gather the grapes that grow on the unpruned vines.
\v 12 For it is a jubilee, which will be holy for you. You must eat the produce that grows by itself out of the fields.

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **a jubilee for you** - "a year of restoration" or "a year for you to return land the land." It can be stated here who they were returning it to. AT: "a year for you to return the land to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **You must eat the produce that grows by itself out of the fields** - Yahweh did not allow the land owner to organize his workers and harvest the land like he did the other six years. However, he did allow individuals to go through the fields and eat what they find.
