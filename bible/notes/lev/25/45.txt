\v 45 You may also buy slaves from the foreigners who are living among you, that is, from their families who are with you, children who have been born in your land. They may become your property.
\v 46 You may provide such slaves as an inheritance for your children after you, to hold as property. From them you may always buy your slaves, but you must not rule over your brothers among the people of Israel with harshness.
