\v 26 However, if a man has no one to buy the land for him, and he himself prospers again and saves enough money to buy that land back,
\v 27 he must calculate how many years there will be until the next Year of Celebration. Then he must pay to the man who bought the land the money that he would have earned by continuing to grow crops on that land for those years.
\v 28 But if the original owner does not have any money to buy the land that he sold, it will continue to belong to the man who bought it, until the next Year of Celebration. In that year it must be returned to its original owner, and he will be able to live on it again.

\v 26 And if a man have no one to redeem it, and he be waxed rich and find sufficient to redeem it;
\v 27 then let him reckon the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus to the man to whom he sold it; and he shall return to his possession.
\v 28 But if he be not able to get it back for himself, then that which he has sold shall remain in the hand of him that has bought it until the year of jubilee: and in the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return to his possession.
