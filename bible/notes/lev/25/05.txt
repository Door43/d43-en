====== Leviticus 25:5-7 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Do not reap \add the grain\add* that grows in your fields without having been planted, or harvest the grapes that grow; you must allow the land to rest for that one year.
\v 6 But you are permitted to eat whatever crops grow by themselves during that year without having been planted. You and your male and female servants, and workers whom you have hired, and people who are living among you temporarily are permitted to eat it.
\v 7 Also, \add during that year\add* your livestock and the wild animals in you land are permitted to eat it.'~"

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 In the seventh year, you must not bring workers together to harvest whatever grain has grown in your fields; you must not bring workers together to harvest whatever grapes have grown on the vines that you did not cut back. You must allow the land to rest for that one year.
\v 6 But you are permitted to eat whatever crops have grown by themselves during that year. You and your male and female servants, and workers whom you have hired, and any foreigners who are living among youâ€”you may all eat those things.
\v 7 And your livestock and the wild animals in your land are permitted to eat them during that year as well.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 You must not conduct an organized harvest of whatever grows by itself, and you must not conduct an organized harvest of whatever grapes grow on your unpruned vines. This will be a year of solemn rest for the land.
\v 6 Whatever the unworked land grows during the Sabbath year will be food for you. You, your male and female servants, your hired servants and the foreigners who live with you may gather food. 
\v 7 And your livestock and also wild animals may eat whatever the land produces.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **You must not conduct...who live with you may gather food** - In 25:5-6 Yahweh means he will not allow the owner of a field to organize his workers and harvest the land as he does the other six years. However, Yahweh will allow individuals to go through the fields to pick and eat the fruit they find.
  * **your unpruned vines** - This means that no one has taken care of the vines as they do during the other six years.
