\v 49 It might be the person's uncle, or his uncle’s son, who redeems him, or anyone who is his close relative from his family. Or, if he has become prosperous, he may redeem himself.
\v 50 He must bargain with the man who bought him; they must count the years from the year he sold himself to his purchaser until the year of jubilee. The price of his redemption must be figured in keeping with the rate paid to a hired servant, for the  number of years he might continue to work for the one who bought him.
