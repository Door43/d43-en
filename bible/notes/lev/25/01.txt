===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the land must be made to keep a Sabbath for Yahweh** - The land is spoken of as if it were a person that could obey the Sabbath by resting. Just as the people had to rest every seventh day, people were to honor God by not farming the land every seventh year. AT: "you must obey the Sabbath law by letting the land rest every seventh year for Yahweh" or "you must obey Yahweh's Sabbath by not farming the land every seventh year" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
