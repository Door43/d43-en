<usfm>
\v 17 If a man marries his sister, the daughter of either his mother or his father, and they have sex together, that is disgraceful. They must not be allowed to continue to associate with my people. And because he has disgraced his sister, he must be punished.
\p
\v 18 If a man has sex with \f + \ft euphemism, doublet \f* a woman during her monthly menstrual period, they have both revealed why she was bleeding, so both of them must not be allowed to associate with my people anymore.

\v 17 If a man sleeps with his sister, the daughter of either his mother or his father—if they have slept together, that is disgraceful. They will no longer be with my people. Because he has slept with his sister, he is guilty.
\p
\v 18 If a man sleeps with a woman during her menstrual period, they have both revealed her flowing blood, so neither of them must be with my people anymore.

\v 17 If a man sleeps with his sister, either his father's daughter or his mother's daughter—if he sleeps with her and she with him, it is a shameful thing. They must be cut off from the presence of their people, because he has slept with his sister. He must carry his guilt.
\p
\v 18 If a man sleeps with a woman during her menstrual period and has slept with her, he has uncovered the flow of her blood, the source of her blood. Both the man and woman must be cut off from among their people.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **a man sleeps with** - This is a polite way of saying that he had sex with his sister. Some languages use more direct phrases such as "a man had sex with." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **either his father's daughter or his mother's daughter** - This means a man cannot sleep with his sister, even if she has a different mother or father.  The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. AT: "whether it is his full sister or half-sister" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) 
  * **must be cut off from** - A person being excluded from his community is spoken of as if he had been cut off from his people, as one would cut a piece of cloth or cut a branch from a tree. This can be translated in active form. See how you translated this idea in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:07:19|7:20]]. AT: "that person may no longer live among his people" or "you must separate that person from his people"
  * **He must carry his guilt** - This phrase means the man is responsibile for his sin. AT: "He is responsible for his sin" or "You must punish him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **menstrual period** - the time when a woman bleeds from her womb
  * **he has uncovered the flow of her blood, the source of her blood** - This phrase compares having sex with a woman during her menstrual period to removing the cover off of something that should remain hidden. The fact that this was a shameful thing to do can be stated clearly. AT: "he has done a shameful thing by by uncovering the flow of her blood"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Both the man and woman must be cut off** - It can be stated clearly why this must be done. AT: "Because they have done this shameful thing, both the man and woman must be cut off" (See:  [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
