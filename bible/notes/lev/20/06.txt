===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 I will reject those who go to those who consult the spirits of dead people, or who go to fortune tellers who ask spirits to advise them. I will reject such people; they will no longer be with my own people.
\p
\v 7 Set yourselves apart for my honor, so that you may belong to me, because I am Yahweh your God.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 6 The person who turns to those who talk with the dead, or to those who talk with spirits so as to prostitute themselves with them, I will set my face against that person; I will cut him off from among his people.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **so as to prostitute themselves with them** - Here "prostitute" means the people are unfaithful to Yahweh. AT: "so as to seek advise from them rather than from me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **set my face against** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:lev:20:03|20:3]].
