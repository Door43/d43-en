===== translationNotes: =====

  * **so as to prostitute themselves with them** - This phrase compares the unfaithful people to prostitutes. AT: "by doing that, they seek advice from the spirits rather than from me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will set my face against that person** - Yahweh speaks of being opposed to a person as if he were to set his face against that person. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:20:03|20:3]]. AT: "I will be against that person" or "I will oppose that person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **set my face** - Here "face" is a metonym for attention or gaze, and "set my face" refers to staring. AT: "stare" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
