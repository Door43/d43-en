\p
\v 24 I said to you, You will inherit their land; I will give it to you to possess,  a land flowing with milk and honey. I am Yahweh your God, who has separated you from the other peoples.
\v 25 You must therefore distinguish between the clean animals and the unclean, and between the unclean birds and the clean. You must not defile yourselves with unclean animals or birds or with any creature that crawls along the ground, which I have separated as unclean from you.
