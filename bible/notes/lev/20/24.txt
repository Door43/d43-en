\v 24 But I said to you, "You will take their land from them; I will give it to you to be yours, a land that is very fertile [IDI]. I am Yahweh your God, who has set you apart from the people of other nations."
\p
\v 25 So you must distinguish between birds and animals that are unacceptable to me and those that are acceptable to me. Do not defile yourselves by \add eating\add* birds or animals, or anything that crawls along on the ground, that I have said are unacceptable for you.

\v 24 I said to you, "You will inherit their land; I will give it to you to possess,  a land flowing with milk and honey. I am Yahweh your God, who has separated you from the other peoples.
\v 25 You must therefore distinguish between the clean animals and the unclean, and between the unclean birds and the clean. You must not defile yourselves with unclean animals or birds or with any creature that crawls along the ground, which I have separated as unclean from you.
