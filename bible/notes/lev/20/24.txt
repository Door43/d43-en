\v 24 But I have said to you, You shall inherit their land, and I will give it to you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey: I am Jehovah your God, who has separated you from the peoples.
\v 25 You shall therefore make a distinction between the clean beast and the unclean, and between the unclean fowl and the clean: and you shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by bird, or by anything wherewith the ground teemeth, which I have separated from you as unclean.
