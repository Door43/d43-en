===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **he must surely be put to death **- AT: "you must surely put him to death" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **you must kill the woman and the animal. They must certainly be put to death** - Both clauses mean the same thing. They emphasize that the woman and animal must die. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
