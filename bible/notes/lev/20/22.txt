  * **the land into which I am bringing you to live will not vomit you up** - This can be translated to clarify that the land itself does not perform the action, but Yahweh Himself does. AT: "the land to which I am bringing you will not reject you" or "I do not expel you from the land to which I am bringing you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
