====== Leviticus 20:3-5 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 I will reject [IDI] such people and cause that they are no longer to be considered to belong to my people.
\v 4 If the people of that man's town ignore it when he kills one of his children to offer him as a sacrifice to Molech, and if they do not execute that person,
\v 5 I myself will punish that person and his family, and I will command that he no longer be able to associate with my people. And I will do the same thing to any others who do the same thing that he did to worship Molech.

\v 3 I also will set my face against that man and will cut him off from among his people because he has given his child to Molech, so as to defile my sanctuary and profane my holy name.
\v 4 If the people of the land close their eyes to that man when he gives any of his children to Molech, if they do not put him to death, 
\v 5 then I myself will set my face against that man and his clan, and I will cut him off and everyone else who prostitutes himself in order to play the harlot with Molech.

  * **profane my holy name** - AT: "dishonor my reputation" or "dishonor me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
