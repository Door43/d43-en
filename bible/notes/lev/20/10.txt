\v 11 If a man has sex with \f + \ft euphemism \f* one of his father's other wives, he has disgraced his father. So both that man and that woman must be executed, they will be responsible for their own deaths \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\p
\v 12 If a man has sex with \f + \ft euphemism \f* his daughter-in-law, both of them must be executed. What they have done is very perverse; and they will be responsible for their own deaths \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
