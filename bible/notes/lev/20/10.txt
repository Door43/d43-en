====== Leviticus 20:10-12 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 If a man commits adultery with some other man's wife, both of them, the man and the woman, must be executed.
\p
\v 11 If a man has sex with \f + \ft euphemism \f* one of his father's other wives, he has disgraced his father. So both that man and that woman must be executed, they will be responsible for their own deaths \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\p
\v 12 If a man has sex with \f + \ft euphemism \f* his daughter-in-law, both of them must be executed. What they have done is very perverse; and they will be responsible for their own deaths \f + \ft metonymy \f*.

\v 10 If a man commits adultery with some other man's wife, then you must execute both of them, the man and the woman.
\p
\v 11 If a man sleeps with one of his father's wives, he has dishonored his father. So you must execute both that man and woman; they will be responsible for their own deaths.
\p
\v 12 If a man sleeps with his daughter-in-law, you must execute them both. They have exchanged good for evil; they both deserve to die.

<usfm>
\p
\v 10 The man who commits adultery with another man's wife, that is, anyone who commits adultery with his neighbor's wifeâ€”the adulterer and the adulteress must both certainly be put to death.
\p
\v 11 If a man lies with his father's wife, he uncovers his father's nakedness. Both the son and his father's wife must certainly be put to death. Their blood is upon them.
\p
\v 12 If a man sleeps with his daughter-in-law, both of them must certainly be put to death. They have committed perversion. They are guilty and deserve to die.

  * **The man who commits adultery with another man's wife, that is, anyone who commits adultery with his neighbor's wife** - The full meaning of this can be made explicit. AT: "The man who commits adultery with someone else's wife" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **certainly be put to death** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "you must certainly put both of them to death" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **lies down with his father's wife to sleep with her** - This is a polite way of saying that he had sex with his father's wife. Some languages use more direct phrases such as "has sex with his father's wife." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **They have committed perversion** - Here God calls a man having sex with his son's wife a "perversion", a serious sin. See how you translated "perversion" in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:18:22|18:23]].
