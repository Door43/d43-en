===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He placed the breastpiece on him** - "Moses placed the breastpiece on Aaron"
  * **the breastpiece ... the turban ... the golden plate, the holy crown** - These are all special garments that Yahweh commanded the people to make for the priests. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the Urim and the Thummim** - It is not clear what these are. They were objects that the priest somehow used to determine the will of God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **turban** - a man's head covering that is a long piece of cloth wrapped around the head
  * **the golden plate, the holy crown** - These two phrases refer to the same thing. It was a plate of pure gold attached to the turban.
