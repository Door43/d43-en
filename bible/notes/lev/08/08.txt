===== Translation Notes: =====



  * **He placed the breastpiece on him** - "Moses placed the breastpiece on Aaron"
  * **the Urim and the Thummim** - It not clear what these are. They were objects that the priest somehow used to determine the will of God. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **turban** - a head covering
  * **the golden plate, the holy crown** - These refer to the same thing. It was a plate of pure gold attached to the turban. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
