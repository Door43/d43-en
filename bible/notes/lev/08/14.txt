===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **laid their hands on** - This is a sign of dedicating the animal to God so the animal will die for their sin instead of them.
  * **horns of the altar** - See how this was translated in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:04:06|4:7]]. This refers to the corners of the altar which are shaped like the horns of an ox.
  * **set it apart for God** - "set the altar apart for God"
