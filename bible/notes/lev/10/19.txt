\v 19 Aaron replied to Moses, "Today the people brought to Yahweh their offering for him to forgive their sins, and also the offering we burned completely to please Yahweh. But think about the terrible thing that happened to my other two sons! Would Yahweh have been pleased if I had eaten some of the people's sin offering today?"
\v 20 When Moses heard that, he was satisfied and said nothing more.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **this thing has happened** - Aaron is referring to the death of his two sons.
  * **would it have been pleasing in the sight of Yahweh?** - These sacrifices were to be eaten with joy and happiness. Aaron uses a question to emphasize that Yahweh would not be pleased for him to eat the sacrifices since he is sad because of his sons' deaths. AT: "certainly, Yahweh would not have been pleased."
