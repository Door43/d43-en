\v 14 The breast that is raised as an offering and the thigh that is presented to Yahweh—these you must eat in a clean place acceptable to God. You and your sons and daughters with you should eat those portions, for they are given as your share  and your sons’ share out of the sacrifices of the fellowship offerings of the people of Israel.
\v 15 The thigh that is an offering presented to Yahweh and the breast that is raised as an offering—they must bring those together with the offerings of fat made by fire, to raise them high and present them as an offering to Yahweh. They will be yours and your sons’ with you as a share forever, as Yahweh has commanded."
