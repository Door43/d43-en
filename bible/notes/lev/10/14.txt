\v 14 But you and your sons and daughters are permitted to eat the breast and the thigh that were lifted up in front of Yahweh. Eat them in any place that is holy. They have been given to you and your descendants as your share of the offerings when the Israelites promise friendship with Yahweh.
\v 15 The thigh and the breast that were lifted up in front of Yahweh must be brought with the portions of fat to be burned, to be lifted up and offered in his presence. They will be the regular share for you and your descendants, as Yahweh has commanded."

\v 14 The breast that is raised as an offering and the thigh that is presented to Yahweh—these you must eat in a clean place acceptable to God. You and your sons and daughters with you should eat those portions, for they are given as your share and your sons' share out of the sacrifices of the fellowship offerings of the people of Israel.
\v 15 The thigh that is an offering presented to Yahweh and the breast that is raised as an offering—they must bring those together with the offerings of fat made by fire, to raise them high and present them as an offering to Yahweh. They will be yours and your sons' with you as a share forever, as Yahweh has commanded."
