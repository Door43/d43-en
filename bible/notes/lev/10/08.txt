\v 8 Yahweh spoke to Aaron, saying,
\v 9 "Do not drink wine or strong drink, you, nor your sons who remain with you, when you go into the tent of meeting, so you will not die. This will be a permanent statute throughout your people's generations,
\v 10 to distinguish between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean,
\v 11 so that you may teach the people of Israel all the statutes that Yahweh has commanded through Moses."
