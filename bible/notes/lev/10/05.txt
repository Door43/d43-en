\v 5 So they carried the corpses, which still were wearing their special tunics\f + \ft Or: shirts \f*, outside the camp, \add and buried them\add*.
\p
\v 6 Then Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* said to Aaron and his \add other two\add* sons Eleazar and Ithamar, "\add You are sad because Nadab and Abihu died, but you must act like you always do\add*. Do not allow the hair on your \add heads\add* to remain uncombed, and do not tear your clothes. But your relatives and all your fellow Israelites are allowed to mourn for those whom Yahweh destroyed by fire.
\v 7 But you must not leave the entrance of the Sacred Tent \add to join those who are mourning\add*, because if you do that, you also will die, and Yahweh will punish \f + \ft metonymy \f* all the people of Israel. Do not forget that Yahweh has set you apart \f + \ft metonymy \f* to work for him there, \add and he does not want you to become defiled by touching a corpse\add*." So they did what Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* told them to do.

\v 5 So they carried the corpses, on which were still the special tunics, outside the camp, and buried them.
\p
\v 6 Then Moses said to Aaron and his other two sons Eleazar and Ithamar, "You are sad because Nadab and Abihu died, but you must act like you always do. Do not allow the hair on your heads to remain uncombed, and do not tear your clothes. If you do, Yahweh will be angry with all the people. But you must let your relatives and all your fellow Israelites engage in mourning ceremonies for those whom Yahweh has destroyed by fire.
\v 7 But you must not leave the entrance of the sacred tent to join those who are mourning, because if you do that, you also will die. Do not forget that Yahweh has set you apart to work for him here, and he does not want you to become defiled by touching a corpse." So they obeyed Moses; they did not join the rest of the people in mourning for their cousins' death.

\v 5 So they came near and carried them, still wearing their priestly tunics, out of the camp, as Moses had instructed.
\v 6 Then Moses said to Aaron and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, "Do not let your hair on your heads hang loosely, and do not tear your clothes, so that you may not die, and so that Yahweh may not be angry with all the assembly. But allow your relatives, the entire house of Israel, to mourn for those whom the fire of Yahweh has set ablaze.
\v 7 You must not go out from the entrance of the tent of meeting, or you will die, for the anointing oil of Yahweh is on you." So they acted according to Moses' instructions.
