\v 16 Then Moses inquired about the goat of the sin offering, and found that it was burned up. So he was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who were left, saying,
\v 17 "Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the area of the tabernacle, since it is most holy, and Yahweh has given it to you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before Yahweh?
\v 18 Look, its blood was not brought inside the tabernacle. You should certainly have eaten it in the tabernacle area, as I commanded."
