\v 5 You priests must not shave your heads or the edges of your beards; you must not cut your bodies to show that you are mourning for someone who has died.
\v 6 You must act in ways that I, your God, consider to be suitable for you, my priests; you must not disgrace me. You are the ones who present to me the offerings that are burned. It is as though those offerings were food for me, your God. So you must act in ways that are suitable for you, because you honor me.
