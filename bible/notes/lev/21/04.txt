\v 4 You priests must not cause yourselves to become unfit to do my work by touching the dead bodies of other relatives of yours.

\v 5 You priests must not shave your heads or the edges of your beards; you must not cut your bodies to show that you are mourning for someone who has died.
\v 6 You must act in ways that I, your God, consider to be suitable for you, my priests; you must not disgrace me. You are the ones who present to me the offerings that are burned. It is as though those offerings were food for me, your God. So you must act in ways that are suitable for you, because you honor me.

\v 5 Priests must not shave their heads or shave off the corners of their beards, nor cut their bodies.
\v 6 They must be separate for their God, and not disgrace the name of their God, because the priests offer the sacrifices to Yahweh by fire, the "food" of their God. Therefore they must be separate.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **they must be separate** - "they must be holy" or "they must be set apart"
  * **not disgrace the name of their God** - AT: "not disgrace God's reputation" or "not disgrace their God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the "food" of their God** - "the food offering to their God." Yahweh does not actually eat these offerings. It means the priests burnt these offering on Yahweh's altar.
