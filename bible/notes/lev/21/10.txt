===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues telling Moses what the priests must do.
  * **on whose head the anointing oil has been poured, and who has been consecrated** - AT: "on whose head they poured anointing oil and consecrated him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **must not wear his hair loose or tear his clothes** - These are signs of mourning. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **must not leave the sanctuary area** - This does not mean he could never leave. God did not allow him to leave in order to grieve over someone who has died.
