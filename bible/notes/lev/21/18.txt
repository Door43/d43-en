\v 19 a man with a crippled hand or foot,
\v 20 hunchbacked or dwarfed man, or a man with a defect in his eyes, or with a disease, sore, scabs, or damaged private parts.
\v 21 No man among the descendants of Aaron the priest with a bodily defect may come near to perform the offerings made by fire for Yahweh. Such a man has a bodily defect; he must not come near to offer the 'food' of his God.
