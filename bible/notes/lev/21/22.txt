\v 22 He may eat the 'food' of his God, whether some of the most holy or some of the holy.
\v 23 However, he must not enter inside the curtain or come near the altar, because he has a bodily defect, so  that he does not defile my sanctuary, for I am Yahweh, who sanctifies them.' "
\v 24 So Moses spoke these words to Aaron, to his sons, and to all the people of Israel.
