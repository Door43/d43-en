\v 13 The high priest must marry a virgin as his wife.
\v 14 He must not marry a widow, a divorced woman, or a woman who is a prostitute. He will not marry these kinds of women. He may only marry a virgin from his own people,
\v 15 so he will not defile his children among his people, for I am Yahweh, who makes him holy.'"
