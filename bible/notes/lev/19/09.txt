<usfm>
\v 9 When you harvest your grain, leave the grain at the very edge of the field, and do not pick up the grain that has fallen on the ground.
\v 10 And when you harvest your grapes, do not go back a second time to try to harvest some more, and do not pick up the grapes that have fallen on the ground.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **When you reap the harvest of your lands, you must not completely reap the corner of your fields**- Having so many of the words in this chunk to be looked up on the Important Words List seems unncecesarily complicated. It would be more clear and simple and have the same meaning if the word gather is used in this phrase instead of reap. AT: "When you gather the harvest of your land, you must not completely gather the corners of your fields."
  * **neither will you gather all the produce of your harvest **- Although produce is on the common word list, it has multiple meanings. AT:"neither will you gather all of the fruit of your harvest"
