\v 12 On the day when you raise the sheaf and present it to me, you must offer a male lamb one year old and without blemish as a burnt offering to Yahweh.
\v 13 The grain offering must be two tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, an offering made by fire to Yahweh, to produce a sweet aroma, and with it a drink offering of wine, a fourth of a hin.
