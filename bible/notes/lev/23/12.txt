\v 12 On the day when you raise the sheaf and present it to me, you must offer a male lamb one year old and without blemish as a burnt offering to Yahweh.
\v 13 The grain offering must be two tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, an offering made by fire to Yahweh, to produce a sweet aroma, and with it a drink offering of wine, a fourth of a hin.
\v 14 You must eat no bread, nor roasted or fresh grain, until the same day you have brought this offering to your God. This will be a permanent statute throughout your people's generations, in every place that you live.
