\v 19 You must offer one male goat for a sin offering, and two male lambs a year old for a sacrifice, as fellowship offerings.
\v 20 The priest must raise them up before Yahweh, together with the bread of the firstfruits, and present them to him as an offering with the two lambs. They will be holy offerings to Yahweh for the priest.
\v 21 You must make a proclamation on that same day. There will be a holy assemby, and you must do no ordinary work. This will be a permanent command throughout your people's generations in all the places where you live.
