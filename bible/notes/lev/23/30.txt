  * **on that day** - "on the Day of Atonement"
  * **This will be a permanent command throughout your people's generations** - See how you translated a similar phrase in [[en:bible:notes:lev:03:15|3:17]].
  * **a Sabbath of solemn rest** - This is not the same as the Sabbath they observed every week on the seventh day. This was a special Sabbath on the day of atonement.
  * **the ninth day of the month** - AT: "the ninth day of the seventh month" (See: [[en:obe:other:biblicaltime]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **from evening to evening** - "from sunset to sunset on the next day"
