<usfm> \v 1 If you bring to Yahweh an offering of flour, it must consist of finely ground flour. You must pour olive oil on it, as well as some incense, \v 2 and take it to one of the priests. The priest will take a handful of it and burn it on the altar. That part will symbolize that all of the offering truly belongs to Yahweh. And the good odor will be pleasing to Yahweh. \v 3 The part of that flour offering that is not burned will belong to Aaron and his sons. It is something set apart for God from the offerings that you will give to Yahweh by burning them.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \c 2 \p \v 1 When anyone brings a grain offering to Yahweh, his offering must be fine flour, and he will pour oil on it and put incense on it. \v 2 He is to take the offering to Aaron’s sons the priests, and there the priest will take out a handful of the fine flour with the oil and the incense on it. Then the priest will burn the offering on the altar to gratefully think about Yahweh's goodness. It will produce a sweet aroma for Yahweh; it will be an offering made to him by fire.

\v 3 Whatever is left of the grain offering will belong to Aaron and his sons. It is something most holy for God from the offerings to Yahweh made by fire. </usfm>
