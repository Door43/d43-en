\c 2
\p
\v 1 And when any one offers an oblation of a  grain offering to Jehovah, his oblation shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon:
\v 2 and he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests; and he shall take thereout his handful of the fine flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof. And the priest shall burn it as the memorial thereof upon the altar, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Jehovah:
\v 3 and that which is left of the grain offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’: it is a thing most holy of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire.
