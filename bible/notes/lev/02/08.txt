\v 10 The part that is not burned will belong to Aaron and his sons. It is a very holy part of the offerings given to Yahweh by \add burning them\add* in a fire.

\v 8 You must bring the grain offering made from these things to Yahweh, and it will be presented to the priest, who will bring it to the altar.
\v 9 Then the priest will take some from the grain offering to gratefully think about Yahweh's goodness, and he will burn it on the altar. It will be an offering made by fire, and it will produce a sweet aroma for Yahweh.
\v 10 What is left of the grain offering will belong to Aaron and his sons. This is something most holy for Yahweh from the offerings to Yahweh made by fire.
