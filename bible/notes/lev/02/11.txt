\v 11 No grain offering that you offer to Yahweh is to be made with yeast, for you must burn no leaven, nor any honey, as an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
\v 12 You will offer them to Yahweh as an offering of firstfruits, but they will not be used to produce a sweet aroma on the altar.
\v 13 You must season each of your grain offerings with salt. You must never allow the salt of the covenant of your God to be missing from your grain offering. With all your offerings you must offer salt.
