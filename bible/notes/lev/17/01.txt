  * **ox, lamb, or goat** - These are the main animals the Israelites used for sacrifices.
  * **that man is guilty of bloodshed** - "that man will be guilty as if he murdered someone"
  * **that man must be cut off from among his people** - See how you translated this idea in [[en:bible:notes:lev:07:19|7:20]].
