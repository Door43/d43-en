  * **I will set my face against that person** - The word "face" represents the person. This idiom means to reject someone or something. AT: "I will set myself against that person" or "I will reject that person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **I will cut him off from among his people** - A person being excluded from his community is spoken of as if he had been cut off from his people, as one would cut a piece of cloth or cut a branch from a tree.

  * **For the life of an animal is in its blood ... that atones for the life** - This means God uses the blood to atone for the sins of the people because the blood is life. The people should not consume the blood because it has this special purpose.
