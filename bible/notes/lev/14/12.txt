====== Leviticus 14:12-13 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 Then the priest must take one of the male lambs and lift it up, along with the olive oil, in front of Yahweh, to be a guilt offering—an offering for his being guilty for not giving to Yahweh the things that he was required to give him.
\v 13 Then the priest must slaughter the lamb in the sacred place where the other sacrifices are offered. Like the offering to cause people to become acceptable to God, this guilt offering is holy, and belongs to the priest.
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 Then the priest must take one of the male lambs and lift it high, along with the olive oil, to show that he is giving this to Yahweh as a guilt offering—because the sick person was not able to give to Yahweh the things that he was required to give him.
\v 13 Then the priest must slaughter the lamb in the special place where the priests kill the other sacrifices as well. Like the offering to enable people to be forgiven, God considers this guilt offering to be very special, and so the meat from it belongs to the priest.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 The priest will take one of the male lambs and offer it as a guilt offering, together with the log of oil; he will raise them up as an offering before Yahweh and present them to him.
\v 13 He must kill the male lamb in the place where they kill the sin offerings and the burnt offerings, in the area of the tabernacle, for the sin offering belongs to the priest, as does the guilt offering, because it is most holy.
