<usfm> \v 30 Then the priest must sacrifice the doves or the pigeons, whichever that person has brought. \v 31 One will be a sin offering and the other will be completely burned on the altar, along with the offering made from grain. By doing that, the priest will declare that the person is no longer guilty for having sinned. \p \v 32 Those are the regulations for anyone who has a contagious skin disease and who is poor and cannot afford the usual offerings, in order that he can be with people again."
