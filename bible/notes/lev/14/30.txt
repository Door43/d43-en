\v 30 Then the priest must sacrifice the doves or the pigeons, whichever that person has brought.

\v 30 He must offer one of the doves or young pigeons, such as the person has been able to get—
\v 31 one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, along with the grain offering. Then the priest will make atonement for the one who is to be cleansed before Yahweh.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He must offer** - "The priest must offer"
  * **the one who is to be cleansed** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "the one he is cleansing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **infectious skin disease** - See how you translated these words in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:13:03|13:3]].
  * **who is not able to afford** - Translate this so it is clear that the person does not have enough money to purchase a standard offering. AT: "who does not have enough money to buy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
