===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **nothing in the house will be made unclean** - AT: "he does not need to declare anything left in the house as unclean" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **in the depressions in the walls' surface** - This means the priest is to determine whether mildew has gone deeper that just the surface of the wall.
