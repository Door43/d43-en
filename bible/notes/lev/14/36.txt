\v 36 Then the priest will command that they empty the house before he goes in to see the evidence of mildew, so that nothing in the house will be made unclean. Afterward the priest must go in to see the house.
\v 37 He must examine the mildew to see if it is in the house walls, and to see whether it appears greenish or reddish in the depressions in the wall's surface.
\v 38 If the house does have mildew, then the priest will go out of the house and shut the door to the house for seven days.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **so that nothing in the house will be made unclean** - Once the priest declared the house to be unclean, everything in the house became unclean, as well. This can be translated in active form. AT: "so that he does not need to declare anything left in the house to be unclean" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the house will be made unclean** - The house that Yahweh has stated is unfit for people to touch or live in is spoken of as if it were physically unclean. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in the depressions in the wall's surface** - This means the priest is to determine whether mildew has gone deeper that just the surface of the walls.
