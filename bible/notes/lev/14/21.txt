\v 21 But if the person has gotten well is poor and cannot afford to bring all those animals, he must bring to the priest one male lamb for the priest to lift it up and offer it to Yahweh. This will be a sacrifice because the sick person was not able to give to Yahweh the things that he was required to give him. He must also bring about two liters of flour offering mixed with about one third liter of olive oil; this will be an offering made from flour. He must also bring about one third liter of olive oil.
\v 22 He must also bring doves or two pigeons, one for Yahweh to as to offer for his sins, and one for the priest to burn completely on the altar.
\p
\v 23 On that same day, the eighth day, that person must take those things to the priest at the entrance to the sacred tent, to offer them to Yahweh.

\v 21 However, if the person is poor and cannot afford these sacrifices, then he may take one male lamb as a guilt offering to be raised and presented to Yahweh to make atonement for himself, and one tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, and a log of oil, 
\v 22 together with two doves or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get; one bird will be a sin offering and the other a burnt offering.
\v 23 On the eighth day he must bring them for his cleansing to the priest, to the entrance to the tent of meeting, before Yahweh.
