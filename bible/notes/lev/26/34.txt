\v 36 As for you people who will remain alive in the countries to which your enemies \add will have taken you\add*, I will cause you to become extremely afraid, with the result that when you hear the sounds of leaves being blown by the wind, you will run away.

\v 34 After that happens, as long as you are living in your enemies' countries, I will allow your land to rest, as you should have done every seven years.
\v 35 During all the time that no one is in your land, it will be able to rest. This will be unlike you, who never allowed it to rest while you were there.
\p
\v 36 As for you people who will remain alive in the countries to which your enemies will have taken you, I will make you very afraid, so when you hear the wind blowing leaves, you will run away. You will run as if a man with a sword were chasing you, and you will fall down, even though no one is coming behind you.

\v 34 Then the land will enjoy its Sabbaths for as long as it lies abandoned and you are in your enemies’ lands. During that time the land will rest and enjoy its Sabbaths.
\v 35 As long as it lies abandoned, it will have rest, which will be the rest that it did not have with your Sabbaths, when you lived in it.
\v 36 As for those of you who are left in your enemies' lands, I will send  fear into your hearts so that even the sound of a leaf blowing in the wind will startle them, and you will flee as though you were fleeing from the sword. You will fall, even when no one is chasing you.

  * [[:en:obe:kt:rest]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:fear]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:heart]]
 

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Then the land will enjoy its Sabbaths** - Yahweh speaks about the land as if it were a person enjoying a rest. This means that while the people are in exile no one will plant seed and grow crops. This allows the land to rest. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **so that even the sound of a leaf blowing in the wind will startle them** - This is an exaggeration that emphasizes that the people will be very afraid. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
