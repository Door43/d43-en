  * **they will fall before you by the sword** - Here "falling" represents dying, and "the sword" represents either attacking people with sword or battle in general.  AT: "they will die when you attack them with the sword" or "you will kill them in battle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Five of you will chase away a hundred, and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand** - This means the Israelites will have victory against larger armies.
