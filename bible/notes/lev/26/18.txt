====== Leviticus 26:18-20 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 If you still will not heed me after all those things happen to you, I will continue to punish you again and again for the sins that you have committed.
\v 19 I will cause you to no longer be stubborn and proud; I will cause \add no rain to fall; it will be as though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* the sky is made of iron, and the ground will be \add as hard as\add* brass \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 20 You will uselessly work very hard \add to plant seeds\add*, because crops will not grow in the hard soil in your fields, and fruit will not grow on your trees.

\v 18 But after all these things happen to you, if you still refuse to obey me, I will continue to punish you again and again for the sins that you have committed.
\v 19 I will punish you so much that you will no longer be stubborn or proud. I will not let any rain fall in your land. It will be as though the sky were made of iron, and the ground were as hard as bronze.
\v 20 You will uselessly work very hard to plant seeds, because crops will not grow in the hard soil in your fields, and fruit will not grow on your trees.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 If you do not listen to my commands, then I will punish you seven times as severely for your sins.
\v 19 I will break your pride in your power. I will make the sky over you like iron and your land like bronze.
\v 20 Your strength will be used up for nothing, because your land will not produce its harvest, and your trees in the land will not produce their fruit.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **seven times** - Here, "seven times" is not literal. It means Yahweh will multiply how severely he will punish them.
  * **I will break your pride in your power** - "I will punish you so that you no longer take pride in your own power"
  * **I will make the sky over you like iron and your land like bronze** - This means Yahweh will stop the rain from falling from the sky. This will make the ground hard so that people cannot plant seed or grow crops. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Your strength will be used up for nothing** - AT: "Your hard work will be for nothing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
