====== Leviticus 26:18-20 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 If you still will not heed me after all those things happen to you, I will continue to punish you again and again for the sins that you have committed.
\v 19 I will cause you to no longer be stubborn and proud; I will cause \add no rain to fall; it will be as though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* the sky is made of iron, and the ground will be \add as hard as\add* brass \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 20 You will uselessly work very hard \add to plant seeds\add*, because crops will not grow in the hard soil in your fields, and fruit will not grow on your trees.

\v 18 But after all these things happen to you, if you still refuse to obey me, I will continue to punish you again and again for the sins that you have committed.
\v 19 I will punish you so much that you will no longer be stubborn or proud. I will not let any rain fall in your land. It will be as though the sky were made of iron, and the ground were as hard as bronze.
\v 20 You will uselessly work very hard to plant seeds, because crops will not grow in the hard soil in your fields, and fruit will not grow on your trees.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 If you do not listen to my commands, then I will punish you seven times as severely for your sins.
\v 19 I will break your pride in your power. I will make the sky over you like iron and your land like bronze.
\v 20 Your strength will be used up for nothing, because your land will not produce its harvest, and your trees in the land will not produce their fruit.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **seven times** - Here "seven times" is not literal. It means Yahweh will increase the severity of his punishment.
  * **I will break your pride in your power** - Using force to cause them not to be proud is spoken of as if he were to break their pride. AT: "I will punish you and so end the pride that you feel about your power" and "I will punish you so that you will no longer be proud of your power" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will make the sky over you like iron and your land like bronze** - This means God will stop the rain from falling from the sky. This will make the ground hard so that people cannot plant seed or grow crops. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Your strength will be used up for nothing** - Working very hard is spoken of as if they were to use all their strength until they had no more strength. The phrase "for nothing" means that they would get nothing from working so hard.  AT: "You will use work very hard in vain" or "You will work very hard, but you will not receive anything good from working so hard" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
