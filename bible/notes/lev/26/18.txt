\v 18 But after all these things happen to you, if you still refuse to obey me, I will continue to punish you again and again for the sins that you have committed.
\v 19 I will punish you so much that you will no longer be stubborn or proud. I will not let any rain fall in your land. It will be as though the sky were made of iron, and the ground were as hard as bronze.
\v 20 You will uselessly work very hard to plant seeds, because crops will not grow in the hard soil in your fields, and fruit will not grow on your trees.

  * **I will break your pride in your power** - "I will punish you so that you no longer take pride in your own power"
  * **I will make the sky over you like iron and your land like bronze** - This means Yahweh will stop the rain from falling from the sky. This will make the ground hard so that people cannot plant seed or grow crops. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Your strength will be used up for nothing** - AT: "Your hard work will be for nothing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
