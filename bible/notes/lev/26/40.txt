<usfm>
\v 40-41 But your descendants must confess their sins and the sins that their ancestors committed. Their ancestors acted unfaithfully toward me and were hostile to me, with the result that I forced them to go to the countries that belonged to their enemies. But when your descendants humble themselves \f + \ft synecdoche \f* and stop being very stubborn [IDI] and accept being punished for their sins,
\v 42 I will keep in mind the agreement that I made with \add your ancestors\add* Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, and \add what I promised to them about Canaan\add* land.

\v 40 Yet if they confess their sins and their fathers' sin, and their treason by which they were unfaithful to me, and also their walking against me—
\v 41 which caused me to turn against them and give them over into their enemies' land—if their uncircumcised hearts become humbled, and if they accept the punishment for their sins, 
\v 42 then will I call to mind my covenant with Jacob, my covenant with Isaac, and my covenant with Abraham; also, I will call the land to mind.
