===== Translation Notes: =====

In these verses, Yahweh transitions from presenting the blessings that he promises to his people if they obey and follow him (listed in verses 3-13).  Yahweh now begins to tell the people what will happen if they are disobedient and unfaithful to him (verses 16-39)..
