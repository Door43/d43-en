\v 15 You must explain to the people of Israel and say, 'Whoever curses his God must carry his own guilt.
\v 16 He who blasphemes the name of Yahweh must surely be put to death. All the assembly must certainly stone him, whether he is a foreigner or a native-born Israelite. If anyone blasphemes the name of Yahweh, he must be put to death.
