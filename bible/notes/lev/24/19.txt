\v 19 If a man injures his neighbor, it must be done to him as he did to his neighbor:
\v 20 fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. As he has caused an injury to a person, so must it also be done to him.
\v 21 Anyone who kills an animal must pay it back, and anyone who kills a person must be put to death.
