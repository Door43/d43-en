\v 7 Along each row, place in some gold cups some pure incense to be burned as an offering to me instead of the bread.
\v 8 The priests must put new loaves of bread on the table each Sabbath day, to signify the covenant that will never end, which I have made with you Israelites.
\v 9 When the loaves are removed from the table, they will belong to Aaron and his sons. They must eat them in a place set aside for this purpose, because they are part of the offerings—the offerings that belong only to me—that are given to me by being burned."

\v 7 You must put pure incense along each row of loaves as a symbol of the loaves. This incense will be burnt for Yahweh.
\v 8 Every Sabbath day the high priest must regularly set out the bread before Yahweh on behalf of the people of Israel, as a sign of an everlasting covenant.
