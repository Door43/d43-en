===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Outside the curtain before the covenant decrees** - Here "covenant decrees" refers to the ark of the covenant, which contained the 10 commandments. The ark was located in the most holy place. This can be made explicit. AT: "Outside of the curtain that separates the holy place from the most holy place" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **from evening to morning** - "from sunset to sunrise"
  * **This will be a permanent statute throughout your people's generations** - See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:03:15|3:17]].
