\v 31 Of all the animals that creep, these are the animals which will be unclean for you. Whoever touches them when they are dead will be unclean until evening.
\v 32 And if any of them dies and falls on anything, that thing will be unclean, whether it is made of wood, cloth, leather, or sackcloth. Whatever it is and whatever it is used for, it must be put into water; it  will be unclean until evening. Then it will be clean.
\v 33 For every clay pot into or onto which any unclean animal falls, whatever is in the pot will become unclean, and you must destroy that pot.
