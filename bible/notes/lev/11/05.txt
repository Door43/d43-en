\v 5 Also the rock badger, because it chews the cud but does not have a split hoof, it is also unclean to you.
\v 6 The rabbit, because it chews the cud, but does not have a split hoof, is unclean to you.
\v 7 The pig, although it has a split hoof, does not chew the cud, is unclean to you.
\v 8 You must not eat any of their meat, nor touch their carcasses. They are unclean to you.
