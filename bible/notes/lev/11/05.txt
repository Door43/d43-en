===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Also the rock badger: because it chews the cud but does not have a split hoof, it is also unclean for you.
\v 6 And the rabbit: because it chews the cud but does not have a split hoof, it is unclean for you.
\v 7 And the pig: although it has a split hoof, it does not chew the cud, so it is unclean for you.
\v 8 You must not eat any of their meat, nor touch their carcasses. They are unclean for you.
