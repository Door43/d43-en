\v 43 Do not defile yourselves by eating any of those creatures. Be very careful about this.
\v 44 I am Yahweh your God, and I am holy, so you must set yourselves apart for my honor, and you must be holy. You must avoid eating things that cause you to be unacceptable to me. Do not cause yourselves to become unacceptable to me by eating creatures that crawl along on the ground.

\v 43 You must not make yourselves unclean with any living creatures that creep; you must not make yourselves unclean with them, that you should be made impure by them.
\v 44 For I am Yahweh your God. You are to keep yourselves holy, therefore, and be holy, because I am holy. You must not defile yourselves with any kind of animal that moves about on the ground.
\v 45 For I am Yahweh, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God. You must therefore be holy, for I am holy.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues telling Moses and Aaron which animals the people are to consider unclean.

  * **You must not make yourselves unclean ... you should be made impure by them** - Yahweh repeats the same idea twice in order to strengthen the command that they are not to eat any unclean animal. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **You must not make yourselves unclean** - A person who is unacceptable for God's purposes is spoken of as if he were physically unclean. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **that you should be made impure by them** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "so that you are no longer pure because of them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
