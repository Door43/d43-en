\v 43 You must not make yourselves unclean with any living creatures that creep; you must not  make yourselves unclean with them, that you should be made impure by them.
\v 44 For I am Yahweh your God. Therefore sanctify yourselves and be holy because I am holy. You must not defile yourselves with any kind of animal that moves on the ground.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues telling Moses and Aaron what the people can eat and must avoid eating.

  * **You must not make yourselves unclean...you should be made impure by them** - In 11:43 Yahweh says the same thing in three different ways for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **that you should be made impure by them** - AT: "that they should make you impure" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
