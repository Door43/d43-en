===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 You may eat any animal that has a split hoof and that also chews the cud.
\v 4 However, some animals either chew the cud or have a split hoof, and you must not eat them, animals such as the camel, because it chews the cud but does not have a split hoof. So the camel is unclean for you.
