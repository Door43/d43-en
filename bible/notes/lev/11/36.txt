\v 36 If one of their carcasses falls into a spring or a pit for storing water, the water may still be drunk, but anyone who touches one of those carcasses becomes defiled.
\v 37 If one of those carcasses falls on seeds that are to be planted, those seeds are still acceptable to be planted.
\v 38 But if water has been put on the seeds and then a carcass falls on it, the seeds must be thrown away.

<usfm>
\v 36 A spring or cistern where drinking water is collected will stay clean if such a creature falls into it. But if anyone touches the carcass of an unclean animal in the water, he will be unclean.
\v 37 If any part of an unclean carcass falls upon any seeds for planting, those seeds will still be clean.
\v 38 But if water is put on the seeds, and if any part of an unclean carcass falls on them, then they will be unclean for you.
