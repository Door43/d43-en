\v 50 The priest must examine the item for mildew; he must isolate anything that has mildew for seven days.
\v 51 He must examine the mildew again on the seventh day. If it has spread in the garment or anything woven or knitted from wool or linen material, or leather or anything in which leather is used, then it is harmful mildew, and the item is unclean.
\v 52 He must burn the garment, or anything woven or knitted from wool or linen material, or leather or anything made with leather, anything in which the harmful mildew is found, for it can lead to disease. The item must be completely burned up.
