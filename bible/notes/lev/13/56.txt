\v 56 And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be dim after the washing thereof, then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:
\v 57 and if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin, it is breaking out: you shall burn that wherein the plague is with fire.
\v 58 And the garment, either the warp, or the woof, or whatever thing of skin it be, which you shall wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.
