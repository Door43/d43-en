\v 24 When the skin has a burn and the raw flesh of the burn has  become a reddish-white or white spot,
\v 25 then the priest will examine it to see if the hair in that spot has turned white, and if it appears to be deeper than the skin. If it has, then it is an infectious disease. It has broken out in the burn, and the priest must pronounce him unclean. It is an infectious disease.
