\v 3 The priest must examine that part of the person's skin. If the hair in that area has become white and it appears that the sore is deeper than just on the skin, it is a contagious skin disease. When the priest sees that, he must declare that the person must stay away from other people \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 4 If the spot on the person's skin is white but it does not appear that the sore is deeper than just on the skin, the priest must tell him to stay away from other people for seven days.

\v 3 The priest must examine that part of the person's skin. If the hair in that area has become white and it appears that the sore is deeper than just on the skin, then it is a skin disease that other people are in danger of receiving from him. If that is what the priest sees, he must declare that this sick person is not fit to be with other people.
\v 4 If the spot on the person's skin is white but it does not appear that the sore is deeper than the surface of the skin, the priest must keep him away from all other people for seven days.

\v 3 Then the priest will examine the disease in the skin of his body. If the hair in the diseased area has turned white, and if the disease appears to be deeper than just on the skin, then it is an infectious disease. After the priest examines him, he must pronounce him unclean.
\v 4 If the bright spot in his skin is white, and the appearance of it is  no deeper than the skin, and if the hair in the diseased area has not turned white, then the priest must isolate the one with the disease for seven days.
