====== Leviticus 13:53-55 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 53 But when the priest examines it, if the mildew has not spread,
\v 54 he will tell the person \add who owns it\add* to wash it. Then he must put it in a separate place for another seven days.
\v 55 Then the priest will examine it again. If the color of the mildew has not changed, even though it has not spread, that item must not be worn again. It does not matter if the mildew is on the inside of the clothing or on the outside; it must be burned.

\v 53 And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin;
\v 54 then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:
\v 55 and the priest shall look, after that the plague is washed; and, behold, if the plague have not changed its color, and the plague be not spread, it is unclean; you shall burn it in the fire: it is a fret, whether the bareness be within or without.
