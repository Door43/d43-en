\v 53 But when the priest examines it, if the mildew has not spread,
\v 54 he will tell the person \add who owns it\add* to wash it. Then he must put it in a separate place for another seven days.
\v 55 Then the priest will examine it again. If the color of the mildew has not changed, even though it has not spread, that item must not be worn again. It does not matter if the mildew is on the inside of the clothing or on the outside; it must be burned.

\v 53 If the priest examines the item and sees that the mildew has not spread in the garment or material woven or knitted from wool or linen, or leather goods, 
\v 54 then he will command them to wash the item in which the mildew was found, and he must isolate it for seven more days.
\v 55 Then the priest will examine the item after the mildewed item was washed. If the mildew has not changed its color, even though it has not spread, it is unclean. You must burn the item, no matter where the mildew has contaminated it.
