\v 26 But when the priest examines it and sees that there is no white hair in that spot and it is only on the surface of the skin, and has faded, the priest will declare that the person must stay away from people for seven days.
\v 27 On the seventh day, the priest will examine him again. If the sore is spreading, it is a contagious skin disease, and the priest will declare that the person must stay away from other people.
\v 28 However, if the spot is not changed and has not spread but has faded, it is only a scar from the burn, and the priest will declare that the person is permitted to be with other people.

\v 26 But if the priest examines it and sees that there is no white hair in that spot and it is only on the surface of the skin, and that the spot has faded, the priest must keep the person away from other people for seven days.
\v 27 After seven days, the priest will examine him again. If the sore is spreading, it is a contagious skin disease, and the priest will declare that the person is unfit to be with other people.
\v 28 However, if the spot is not changed and has not spread but has faded, then it is only a scar from the burn; the priest must declare that the person is fit to be with other people.

\v 26 But if the priest examines it and finds that there is no white hair in the spot, and it is not under the skin but has faded, then the priest must isolate him for seven days.
\v 27 Then the priest must examine  him on the seventh day. If it has  spread widely in the skin, then the priest must pronounce him unclean. It is an infectious disease.
\v 28 If the spot stays in its place and has not spread in the skin but has faded, then it is a swelling from the burn, and the priest must pronounce him clean, for it is nothing more than the scar of the burn.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues telling Moses and Aaron what the people must do when someone has a skin disease.

  * **examines it** - Here "it" refers to the burn on the person's skin.
  * **infectious disease** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:lev:13:03|13:3]].
