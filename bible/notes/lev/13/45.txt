\v 45 The person who has an infectious disease must wear torn clothes, his hair must hang loosely, and he must cover his lower lip and cry out, 'Unclean, unclean.'
\v 46 All the days that he has the infectious disease he will be unclean. Because he is unclean with a disease that can spread, he must live alone. Outside the camp must be where he lives.
