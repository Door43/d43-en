\v 35 But if the sore later spreads,
\v 36 the priest must examine him again. If the itch\f + \ft Or: sore \f* has spread, the priest does not need to look for yellow hair, because it is clear that the person has a contagious skin disease.
\v 37 However, if the priest thinks that the spot has not changed, and healthy hair is growing in that area, it is clear that the itch has healed, and the priest will declare that the person is permitted to be with other people again.

\v 35 But if the itching disease has spread widely in the skin after the priest said he was clean,
\v 36 then the priest must examine him again. If the disease has spread in the skin, the priest does not need to seek for yellow hair. The person is unclean.
\v 37 But if in the priest's view the itching disease has stopped spreading and black hair has grown in the area, then the disease has healed. He is clean, and the priest must pronounce him clean.
