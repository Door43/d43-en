\v 35 But if the sore later spreads,

\v 37 However, if the priest thinks that the spot has not changed, and healthy hair is growing in that area, it is clear that the itch has healed, and the priest will declare that the person is permitted to be with other people again.

\v 35 But if the itching disease has spread widely in the skin after his cleansing,
\v 36 then the priest will examine him. If the disease has spread in the skin, the priest does not need to seek for yellow hair. He is unclean.
\v 37 But if in the priest's view the itching disease has stopped spreading and black hair has grown in the area, then the disease has  healed. He is clean, and the priest will pronounce him clean.
