\v 15 The priest must look at the raw flesh and pronounce him unclean because the raw flesh is unclean. It is an infectious disease.
\v 16 But if the raw flesh turns white again, then the person must go to the priest.
\v 17 The priest will examine him to see if the flesh has turned white. If it has then the priest will pronounce that person to be clean.
