\v 21 But if the priest examines it and sees that there is no white hair in it, and that it is not under the skin but has faded, then the priest must isolate him for seven days. 
\v 22 If it spreads widely in the skin, then the priest must pronounce him unclean. It is an infectious disease.
\v 23 But if the bright spot stays in its place and has not spread, then it is the scar of the boil, and the priest must pronounce him clean.
