\v 9 When anyone has a contagious skin disease, he must be brought to the priest.
\v 10 The priest must examine him. And if there is a white swelling in the skin that has caused the hair in that swelling to become white, and if the flesh in that area is painful\f + \ft Or: sensitive \f*,
\v 11 it is a permanent skin disease, and the priest will declare that he must stay away from other people. The priest does not need to tell that person that he must avoid other people, because other people already are wanting to stay away from him.

\v 9 When anyone has a contagious skin disease, someone must bring him to the priest.
\v 10 The priest must examine him. If there is a white swelling in the skin that has caused the hair there to become white, and if the flesh in that area is painful,
\v 11 then it is a permanent skin disease; the priest will declare that the person is not fit to be with other people. The priest does not need to keep that person away from others for seven days in order to examine him again, because he already knows that the person is unfit to be with others.

\v 9 When an infectious skin disease is in someone, then he must be brought to the priest.
\v 10 The priest will examine him to see if there is a white swelling in the skin, if the hair has turned white, or if there is raw flesh in the swelling.
\v 11 If there is, then it is a chronic skin disease, and the priest must pronounce him unclean. He will not isolate him, because he is already unclean.

  * [[:en:obe:kt:flesh]]

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **he must be brought to the priest** - The priests determined if a disease was spreading. This can be translated in active form. AT: "someone must bring him to the priest" or "he must go to the priest" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **if there is raw flesh in the swelling** - Here "raw flesh" could refer to open sores on the skin or it could refer to new skin that has grown, but the area around it is still diseased. Either one indicates that the skin disease is not healing properly.
  * **chronic skin disease** - This is a disease that continues or reoccurs over a long period of time.
  * **the priest must pronounce him unclean ... he is already unclean** - The man whom other people must not touch is spoken of as if he were physically unclean. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
