===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **and take off the linen garments**- These were the special garments Aaron wore only when he entered the most holy place.
  * **He must bathe his body in water in a holy place** - Here "holy place" does not refer to the tent of meeting. This was a different place set aside for him to bathe himself.
  * **put on his normal garments** - These are the clothes that Aaron wore for his ordinary duties.
