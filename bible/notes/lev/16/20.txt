\v 20 When he has finished atoning for the most holy place, the tent of meeting, the altar, he must present the live goat.
\v 21 Aaron must lay both his hands on the head of the live goat and confess over him all the wickedness of the people of Israel, all their rebellion, and all their sins. Then he must put that sinfulness on the head of the goat and send the goat away in the care of a man who is ready to lead the goat into the wilderness.
\v 22 The goat must carry on himself all the people's wickedness to a solitary place. There in the wilderness, the man must let the goat go free.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **he must present the live goat** - This is the same as the scapegoat mentioned in 16:10.
  * **Aaron must lay both of his hands on the head of the live goat** - This shows that Aaron is placing sins of the people from the past year on the goat who will take them away.
  * **wickedness...rebellion...sins** - These all mean basically the same thing. Aaron is confessing every kind of sin that the people committed.
  * **the wilderness** - A place where no one could live for long. Many people thought of such a place as belonging to evil spirits.
  * **Then he must put that sinfulness on the head of the goat...let the goat go free** - The goat now represents all the sins of the people. By setting it free into the wilderness, it represents God removing the guilt of the people.
