\v 12 Then he must take some burning coals from the bronze altar and put them into the incense burner. Then he must fill his hands with fragrant, finely-ground incense. Then he must take the incense and the incense burner inside the curtain into the very holy place, in the sacred tent.
\v 13 There he must put the incense on the burning coals, and a cloud of burning incense will rise up over the lid of the sacred chest. If he obeys these instructions, he will not die as Korah did, who had offered incense incorrectly.

\v 12 Aaron must take a censer full of coals of fire from off the altar before Yahweh, with his hands full of finely ground sweet incense, and bring these things inside the curtain. 
\v 13 There he must put the incense on the fire before Yahweh so that the cloud from the incense may cover the atonement lid on the ark of the testimony. He must do this so he will not die.
