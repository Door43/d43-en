\v 12 Then he must take some burning coals from the \add bronze\add* altar and put them in the incense burner. Then he must fill his hands with fragrant finely-ground incense. Then he must take the incense and the incense burner inside the curtain into the Very Holy Place \add of the Sacred Tent\add*.
\v 13 There he must put the incense on the burning coals, with the result that a cloud of burning incense will rise up over the lid of the sacred chest. If he obeys these instructions, he will not die \add like Korah did because of offering incense incorrectly\add* \f + \ft Or: \add because of being in God's presence\add* \f*.

\v 12 Then he must take some burning coals from the bronze altar and put them into the incense burner. Then he must fill his hands with fragrant, finely ground incense. Then he must take the incense and the incense burner inside the curtain into the very holy place, in the sacred tent.
\v 13 There he must put the incense on the burning coals, and a cloud of burning incense will rise up over the lid of the sacred chest. If he obeys these instructions, he will not die as Korah did, who had offered incense incorrectly.

\v 12 Aaron must take a censer full of coals of fire from off the altar before Yahweh, with his hands full of finely ground sweet incense, and bring these things inside the curtain. 
\v 13 There he must put the incense on the fire before Yahweh so that the cloud from the incense may cover the atonement lid over the covenant decrees. He must do this so he will not die.
