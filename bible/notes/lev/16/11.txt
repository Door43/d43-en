===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues telling Moses what Aaron must do on the Day of Atonement.

  * **He must make atonement for himself and for his family, so he must kill the bull as a sin offering for himself** - "He must kill the bull as a sin offering to make atonement for himself and his family"
  * **he must kill the bull** - Aaron would catch the blood of the bull in a bowl so he could later sprinkle it on the atonement lid. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
