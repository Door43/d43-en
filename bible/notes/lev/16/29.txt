\v 29 It will always be a statute for you that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you must fast and keep from doing any kind of work, whether the native born or a foreigner who is living you. 
\v 30 This is because on this day atonement will be made for you, to cleanse you from all your sins so you will be clean before Yahweh.
\v 31 It is a solemn Sabbath of rest for you, and you must fast and keep from doing any work. This will always be a statute among you.
