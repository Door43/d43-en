\v 29 On the tenth day of the seventh month, on the day that I have appointed, you all must fast and not do any work. This is a rule that you must always obey—all you native born Israelites and all the foreigners living among you.
\v 30 On that day, Aaron will perform rituals to enable me to forgive you all, and then I will free you all from the guilt of all your sins.
\v 31 That will be a day for you to rest and not do any work, like the Sabbath days, and you must fast all that day. That is a permanent command for you all to obey.

\v 29 It will always be a statute for you that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you must humble yourselves and do no work, whether the native born or a foreigner who is living among you. 
\v 30 This is because on this day atonement will be made for you, to cleanse you from all your sins so you will be clean before Yahweh.
\v 31 It is a solemn Sabbath of rest for you, and you must humble yourselves and do no work. This will always be a statute among you.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **It will always be a statute for you...you must humble yourselves and do no work** - Yahweh repeats this in 16:31 for emphasis.
  * **for you** - Yahweh is speaking to the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **atonement will be made for you** - AT: "Aaron will make atonement for you" or "Aaron will atone for your sins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **It is a solemn Sabbath of rest for you** - This is not the same as the Sabbath they observed every week on the seventh day. This was a special Sabbath on the day of atonement.
