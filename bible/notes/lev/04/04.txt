===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to tell Moses what the people must do.

  * **He must bring the bull** - "The high priest must bring the bull"
  * **lay his hand on its head** - This is a symbolic action that identifies the person with the animal he is offering. In this way the person is offering himself to Yahweh through the animal. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:01:03|1:4]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **The anointed priest will take some of the blood** - It is implied that the priest catches the blood in a bowl as it drains from the animal. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
