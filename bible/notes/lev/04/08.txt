====== Leviticus 04:8-10 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm> \v 8 From that offering the Supreme Priest must separate these things from the bull that is to be burned: The fat that covers the inner parts of the bull or which is attached to them— \v 9 the kidneys and the fat that is attached to them near the lower back muscle, and the fat that covers the liver. \v 10 Then the Supreme Priest must completely burn those things on the altar. That will be just like when the fat is removed from an animal that is sacrificed to maintain good fellowship \add with Yahweh\add*. </usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 8 From that offering the high priest must separate these things from the bull that is to be burned: The fat that covers the inner parts of the bull or which is attached to them— \v 9 the kidneys and the fat that is attached to them near the lower back muscle, and the fat that covers the liver. \v 10 Then the high priest must completely burn those things on the altar. That will be just like when the fat is removed from an animal that is sacrificed to promised friendship with Yahweh. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 8 He will cut away all the fat of the bull of the sin offering; the fat that covers the inner parts, all the fat that is attached to the inner parts, \v 9 the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the lobe of the liver, with the kidneys—he will cut away all this. \v 10 He will cut it all away, just as he cuts it off from the bull of the sacrifice of peace offerings. Then the priest will burn these parts on the altar for burnt offerings. </usfm>
