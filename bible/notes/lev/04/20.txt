<usfm>
\v 20 That is what he must do with the bull. Just as he did with the bull of the sin offering, so will he also do with this bull, and the priest will make atonement for the people, and they will be forgiven.
\v 21 He will carry the bull outside the camp and burn it as he burned the first bull. This is the sin offering for the assembly.
