\v 13 If all the Israelite people sin without intending to sin, doing something that is forbidden in any of Yahweh's commands, they will be guilty, even if they do not realize that they have sinned.
\v 14 When they realize that they have committed a sin, together they must bring a young bull to be an offering for their sin, to the front of the Sacred Tent.
\v 15 The elders must lay their hands on the bull's head in the presence of Yahweh and slaughter it \add and catch some of the blood in a bowl\add*.

\v 13 If the whole assembly of Israel sins without wanting to sin, and the assembly is unaware that they have sinned and done any of the things which Yahweh has commanded not to be done, and if they are guilty,
\v 14 then, when the sin they have committed becomes known, then the assembly must offer a young bull for a sin offering and bring it before the tent of meeting.
\v 15 The elders of the assembly will lay their hands on the head of the bull before Yahweh, and the bull will be killed before Yahweh.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **is unaware** - "does not know"
  * **commanded not to be done** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "commanded them not to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **if they are guilty** - "they are guilty" or "they deserve for God to punish them"
  * **when the sin they have committed becomes known** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "when they realize that they have sinned" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **will lay their hands on the head** - This is a symbolic action that identifies the people with the animal they are offering. In this way the people are offering themselves to Yahweh through the animal. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:01:03|1:4]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **the bull will be killed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "and they will kill the bull" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
