===== translationNotes: =====


  * **offer it before Yahweh** - "offer it in the presence of Yahweh" or "offer it to Yahweh"
  * **lay his hand on the head** - This is a symbolic action that identifies the person with the animal he is offering. In this way the person is offering himself to Yahweh through the animal. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **Aaron's sons will sprinkle its blood** - It is implied that before they sprinkle the blood, they catch the blood in a bowl as it drains from the animal. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
