\v 9 From that offering you must separate these things to be a sacrifice to Yahweh that is burned: Its fat, the fat tail that you must cut off close to the backbone, and all the fat that covers the inner parts of the lamb or which is attached to them—
\v 10 the kidneys with the fat that is on them near the lower back muscle, and the fat that covers the liver.
\v 11 One of the priests will burn those things on the altar to be an offering to Yahweh; \add it will be as though\add* they are food \add given to Yahweh\add*.

\v 9 The man will offer the sacrifice of fellowship offerings as an offering made by fire to Yahweh. The fat, the entire fat tail cut away close to the backbone, and the fat that covers the inner parts and all the fat that is near the inner parts,
\v 10 and the two kidneys and the fat that is with them, which is by the loins, and the lobe of the liver, with the kidneys—he will remove all of this.
\v 11 And the priest will burn it all on the altar as a food offering made by fire to Yahweh.
