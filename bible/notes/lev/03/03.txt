\v 3 From that offering you must bring to Yahweh a sacrifice that will be burned in the fire. That will consist of all the fat that covers the inner parts of the animal, or which is attached to them—
\v 4 the kidneys and the fat that is attached to them near the lower back muscle, and the fat that covers the liver.
\v 5 Then one of the priests will burn those things on the altar, along with the other parts of the animal that will be completely burned to be an offering \add to Yahweh\add*. And the aroma while it burns will be pleasing to Yahweh.

\v 3 The man will offer the sacrifice of a fellowship offering by fire to Yahweh. The fat that covers or is connected to the inner parts, 
\v 4 and the two kidneys and the fat that is on them by the loins, and the lobe of  the liver, with the kidneys—he will remove all of this.
\v 5 Aaron's sons will burn that on the altar with the burnt offering, which is on the wood that is on the fire. This will produce a sweet aroma for Yahweh; it will be an offering made to him by fire.
