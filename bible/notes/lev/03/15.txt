===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He will also** - Here "He" refers to the person offering the sacrifice.
  * **will burn all that on the altar as a food offering made by fire** - Translate this in a way that it does not seem like Yahweh actually eats the food. AT: "will burn those things on the altar to be an offering to Yahweh. It will be as though they are food given to Yahweh" (UDB)
  * **to produce a sweet aroma** - Yahweh being pleased with the sincere worshiper who offered the sacrifice is spoken of as if God were pleased with the aroma of the burning sacrifice. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:01:07|1:9]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **It will be a permanent statute throughout your people's generations** - This means that they and their descendants must obey this command forever. 
  * **or blood** - "or consume blood"
