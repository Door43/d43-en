===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He will also** - Here "He" refers to the person offering the sacrifice.
  * **will burn all that on the altar as a burnt offering of food** - Translate this in a way that it does not seem like Yahweh actually eats the food. AT: "will burn those things on the altar to be an offering to Yahweh. It will be as though they are food given to Yahweh" 
  * **to produce a sweet aroma** - Yahweh is pleased with the aroma of burning meat when he is pleased with the worshiper's sincerity. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:01:07|1:9]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **It will be a permanent statute throughout your people's generations** - This means that they and their descendants must obey this command forever. 
  * **or blood** - "or consume blood"
