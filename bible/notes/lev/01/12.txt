\v 12 You must cut the animal into pieces. You must wash the inner parts and the legs of the animal. Then the priests will arrange the pieces, including the head and the fat, on the burning wood.
\v 13 Then one of the priests will take all of it and completely burn all of it on the altar. And the aroma as it burns will be pleasing to Yahweh.

\v 12 Then he must cut it into pieces, with its head and its fat, and the priest will lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire, which is on the altar,
\v 13 but the inner parts and the legs he must wash with water. Then the priest will offer the whole, and burn it on the altar. It is a burnt offering, and it will produce a sweet aroma for Yahweh; it will be an offering made to him by fire.

===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do.
  * **Then he must cut...made to him by fire** - For 1:12-13 see how you translated many of these words in [[en:bible:notes:lev:01:07|1:7-9]].
  * **it will be an offering made to him by fire** - "it will be a burnt offering to me" or "it will be a burnt offering to Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
