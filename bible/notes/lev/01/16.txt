\v 16 He must remove its crop with its contents, and throw it beside the altar on the east side, in the place for the ashes.
\v 17 He must tear it open by its wings, but he must not divide it into two parts. Then the priest will burn it on the altar, on the wood that is on the fire. It is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire and a sweet aroma for Yahweh.
