\v 16 Then he will remove the bird's craw and what is inside it, and throw it on the east side of the altar, where they also throw the ashes.
\v 17 Then he will grasp the bird's wings and tear the bird open partially, but never all the way. Then he will burn it completely in the fire on the altar. And the good odor will be pleasing to Yahweh.

<usfm>
\v 16 He must remove its crop with its contents, and throw it beside the altar on the east side, in the place for the ashes.
\v 17 He must tear it open by its wings, but he must not divide it into two parts. Then the priest will burn it on the altar, on the wood that is on the fire. It will be a burnt offering, and it will produce a sweet aroma for Yahweh; it will be an offering made to him by fire.
