\v 7 The priest will offer them to Yahweh in order that she may be forgiven for any sins she has committed. Then she will be purified from her flow of blood \add when the baby was born\add*.
\p Those are the regulations for women who give birth to a son or daughter.
\v 8 If a woman who gives birth to a child cannot afford a lamb, she must bring two doves or two young pigeons. One will be burned completely \add on the altar\add*, and one will be an offering to enable her to become acceptable to God again. By doing that, the priest will cause that she will be forgiven for any sins she has committed, and she no longer will need to be avoided."
