====== Leviticus 12:7-8 ======

<usfm>
\v 7 The priest will offer them to Yahweh in order that she may be forgiven for any sins she has committed. Then she will be purified from her flow of blood \add when the baby was born\add*.
\p Those are the regulations for women who give birth to a son or daughter.
\v 8 If a woman who gives birth to a child cannot afford a lamb, she must bring two doves or two young pigeons. One will be burned completely \add on the altar\add*, and one will be an offering to enable her to become acceptable to God again. By doing that, the priest will cause that she will be forgiven for any sins she has committed, and she no longer will need to be avoided."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **she will be cleansed from the flow of her blood** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "this will cleanse her from her bleeding occurring during childbirth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **If she is not able to afford a lamb** - Translate this so it clarifies the woman's inability to purchase a sacrificial animal. AT: "If she does not have enough money to buy a lamb" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **then she will be clean** - A woman whom other people may touch is spoken of as if she were physically clean. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
