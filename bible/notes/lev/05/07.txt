\v 7 If he cannot afford to buy a lamb, then he can bring as his guilt offering for his sin two turtle-doves or two young pigeons to Yahweh, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering.
\v 8 He must bring them to the priest, who will offer the one for the sin offering first, and wring off its head from its neck but not remove it from the body completely.
\v 9 Then he will sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar, and the rest of the blood will be drained out at the base of the altar. This is a sin offering.
