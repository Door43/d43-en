<usfm>
\v 17 If you sin by doing something that is forbidden in any of Yahweh's commands, even if you do not know that you have disobeyed one of Yahweh's commands, you are guilty and must pay a penalty \add to Yahweh\add*.
\v 18 \add When you realize what you have done\add*, you must bring a ram to the priest to be an offering in order that you will no longer be guilty. You must bring one that has no defects. The priest \add will offer the ram to be a sacrifice to me\add*, and as a result you will no longer be guilty for the sin that you have committed, and you will be forgiven.
\v 19 It is an offering to cause you to no longer be guilty for sinning against Yahweh."

\v 17 If you sin by doing something that is forbidden in any of my commands, even if you do not know that you have disobeyed one of my commands, you are still guilty; you must pay a penalty to me.
\v 18 When you realize what you have done, you must bring a ram to the priest as an offering in order that you will no longer be guilty. You must bring one that has no defects. The priest will offer the ram to be a sacrifice to me, and as a result you will no longer be guilty for the sin that you have committed, and I will forgive you.
\v 19 It is an offering to cause you to no longer be guilty for sinning against me."

\v 17 If anyone sins and does anything that Yahweh has commanded not to be done, even if he was unaware of it, he is still guilty  and must carry his own guilt.
\v 18 He must bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, worth the current value, as a guilt offering  to the priest. Then the priest will make atonement for him concerning the sin he has committed, of which he was unaware, and he will be forgiven.
\v 19 It is a guilt offering, and he is certainly guilty before Yahweh."
