\v 18 \add When you realize what you have done\add*, you must bring a ram to the priest to be an offering in order that you will no longer be guilty. You must bring one that has no defects. The priest \add will offer the ram to be a sacrifice to me\add*, and as a result you will no longer be guilty for the sin that you have committed, and you will be forgiven.
\v 19 It is an offering to cause you to no longer be guilty for sinning against Yahweh."

\p
\v 17 And if any one sin, and do any of the things which Jehovah has commanded not to be done; though he knew it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.
\v 18 And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to your estimation, for a trespass-offering, to the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him concerning the thing wherein he erred unwittingly and knew it not, and he shall be forgiven.
\v 19 It is a trespass-offering: he is certainly guilty before Jehovah.
