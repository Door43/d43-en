====== Leviticus 07:7-8 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 The regulation is the same for the offerings to cause people to become acceptable to God again and the offerings for when they are guilty of not giving to Yahweh the things that are required to be given to him. The meat of those offerings belongs to the priest who offers them in order that the people will no longer be guilty for having sinned.
\v 8 The priest who slaughters an animal that will be completely burned on the altar is permitted to keep the animal's hide for himself.

\v 7 The sin offering is like the guilt offering. The same law applies to both of them. They belong to the priest who makes atonement with them.
\v 8 The priest who offers anyone's burnt offering may have for himself the hide of that offering.
