  * **or of some unclean and disgusting thing** - "or of some unclean thing that disgusts Yahweh"
  * **that person must be cut off from his people** - A person being excluded from his community is spoken of as if he had been cut off from his people, as one would cut a piece of cloth or cut a branch from a tree.
