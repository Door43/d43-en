\v 17 But any meat that is left until the third day must be completely burned.
\v 18 If any meat from the offering to maintain fellowship with Yahweh is eaten on the third day, Yahweh will not accept that offering; it will be useless to offer it, because Yahweh will consider that it is worthless. Anyone who eats some of it will have to pay a penalty \add to Yahweh\add*.

\v 17 However, whatever meat of the sacrifice remains on the third day must be burned.
\v 18 If any of the meat of the sacrifice of one's peace offering is eaten on the third day, it will not be accepted, neither will it be credited to the one who offered it. It will be a disgusting thing, and the person who eats it will carry the guilt of his sin.
