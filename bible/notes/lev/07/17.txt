\v 17 However, whatever meat of the sacrifice remains on the third day must be burned.
\v 18 If any of the meat of the sacrifice of one's peace offering is eaten on the third day, it will not be accepted, neither will it be credited to the one  who offered it. It will be a disgusting thing, and the person who eats it will carry the guilt of his sin.
