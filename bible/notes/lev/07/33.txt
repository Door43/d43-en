\v 33 The priest, one of Aaron's descendants, who offers the blood of the peace offerings and the fat—he will have the right thigh as his share of the offering.
\v 34 For I have taken the offering of the breast and thigh that was raised and presented to me, and I have given them to Aaron, the high priest and to his descendants; this will always be their share from the sacrifices of peace offerings made by the people of Israel.
