\v 19 Jesus perceived that they were desirous to ask him, and he said to them, Do you inquire among yourselves concerning
this, that I said, A little while, and you behold me not, and again a little while, and you shall see me?
\v 20 Verily, verily, I say to you, that you shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: you shall be sorrowful, but
your sorrow shall be turned into joy.
\v 21 A woman when she is in travail has sorrow, because her hour is come: but when she is delivered of the child, she
remembers no more the anguish, for the joy that a man is born into the world.
