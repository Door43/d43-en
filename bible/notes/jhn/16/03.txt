\v 3 They will do this because they have not known the Father or me.
\v 4 I have told you these things so that at the time when these hardships come, you will remember that I warned you. I did not tell you these things at the beginning because I was with you then.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **They will do these things because they have not known the Father or me.** - Some believers may be killed because those who do not know God the Father also do not know or understand God the Son, Jesus Christ.
  * **Father** - This is an important title for God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **in the beginning** - See how you translated "from the beginning" in [[:en:bible:notes:jhn:15:26|15:27]].
