\v 17 Some of his disciples then said one to another, "What is this that he says to us, "A little while, and you will see me no more,' and again, 'A little while again, and you will see me,' and, 'Because I go to the Father'?"
\v 18 They said therefore, "What is this that he says, 'A little while'? We do not know what he is saying."
