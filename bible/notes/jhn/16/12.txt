\v 12 I have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.
\v 13 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he shall guide you into all the truth: for he shall not speak from
himself; but what things soever he shall hear, these shall he speak: and he shall declare to you the things that
are to come.
\v 14 He shall glorify me: for he shall take of mine, and shall declare
it to you.
