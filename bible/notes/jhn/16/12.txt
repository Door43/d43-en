\v 12 I have many more things that\add I would like\add* to tell you, but you are not able to accept them now.
\v 13 But \add God's\add* Spirit is the one who will teach you \add God's\add* truth. When he comes, he will guide you so that you \add understand\add* all \add spiritual\add* truth. He will not speak from his own \add authority\add*. Instead, it is the things that he hears \add my Father say\add* that he will tell you. He will also tell you about things that will happen \add later\add*.
\v 14 He will honor me by taking my \add truth\add* and revealing it to you.

\v 12 I have many more things I want to tell you. However, if I tell you now, you will not be able to live well knowing these things.
\v 13 When the Spirit of truth comes, he will lead you into all the truth you need to know. He will not speak from his own authority, but whatever he hears he will tell you, and he will tell you ahead of time about things that will happen.
\v 14 The Spirit will honor me by telling you who I am and showing you what I have done. He will explain to you everything he heard from me.

<usfm>
\v 12 I have many things to say to you, but you would not understand them now.
\v 13 However, when he, the Spirit of Truth, has come, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak from himself; but whatever things he hears, he will say those things; and he will declare to you the things that are to come.
\v 14 He will glorify me, for he will take things of mine and will declare them to you.
