\v 5 "Now I am going back to the Father. He is the one who sent me. Yet none of you dares to ask me, 'Where are you going?'
\v 6 Because I have said these things to you, now sorrow has filled up your hearts.
\v 7 But I tell you the truth, it is good for you that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Helper who comforts you will not come. But if I go away, I will send him to you.

\v 5 But now I go to him who sent me; yet none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’
\v 6 But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.
\v 7 Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is better for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not
come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.
