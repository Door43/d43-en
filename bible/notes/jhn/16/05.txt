\v 5 "Now I am \add about to\add* return to the one who sent me. But \add I am disappointed that\add* none of you is asking me, 'Where are you going?'
\v 6 Instead, because I have told you these things, you are very sad.
\v 7 But the truth is that it is good for you that I am going away, because if I do not go away, the \add Holy Spirit\add*, who will encourage\f + \ft Or: be like a legal counsel for \f* you will not come to you. But when I go, I will send him to you.

<usfm>
\v 5 "Now I am going back to the Father. He is the one who sent me. Yet none of you dares to ask me, 'Where are you going?'
\v 6 Because I have said these things to you, now sorrow has filled up your hearts.
\v 7 I tell you the truth, it is good for you that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Helper who comforts you will not come. If I go away, I will send him to you.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 However, now I go to him who sent me; yet none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’
\v 6 Because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.
\v 7 Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: it is better for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.
