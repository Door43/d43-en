<usfm>
\v 5 "Now I am going back to the Father. He is the one who sent me. Yet none of you dares to ask me, 'Where are you going?'
\v 6 Because I have said these things to you, now sorrow has filled up your hearts.
\v 7 I tell you the truth, it is good for you that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Helper who comforts you will not come. If I go away, I will send him to you.

<usfm>
\v 5 But now I go to him who sent me, yet none of you asks me, 'Where are you going?'
\v 6 But because I have said these things to you, sadness has filled your heart.
\v 7 But I tell you the truth: it is better for you that I go away. For if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you, but if I go, I will send him to you.
