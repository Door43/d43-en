\v 25 I have been speaking these things using language of parables and riddles, but there will soon be a time when I will no longer use that kind of language. Instead, I will tell you all about my Father in language that you can clearly understand.

\v 25 I have spoken these things to you in obscure language, but the hour is coming when I will no more speak to you in obscure language but will instead tell you plainly about the Father.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **in obscure language** - "in language that is hard to understand"
  * **I will...tell you plainly about the Father** - Humanity learns about God the Father through the Son of God, Jesus. To know the Son is to also know the Father. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
