\v 32 But listen! There will soon be a time, and that time is already here, when you will all run away! Each of you will run away to your own home. You will leave me, and I will be alone. But I will not \add really\add* be alone \add at that time\add*, because \add my\add* Father is always with me.
\v 33 I have told you these things in order that you may have \add inner\add* peace because of your relationship with me. In this world you will have trouble. But be courageous! I have defeated those who are opposed to me \f + \ft metonymy \f*, and \add you can defeat them, too\add*!"

\v 32 Look! The time is coming when others will scatter you everywhere! Each one will go toward his own home, and you will leave me. However, I will not be alone because the Father is always with me.
\v 33 I have told you these things so you may have peace in me. In the world you have trials and sorrows, but be brave! I have conquered the world!"

<usfm>
\v 32 See, the hour is coming, yes, and has indeed come, when you will be scattered, everyone to his own possessions, and you will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone because the Father is with me.
\v 33 I have spoken these things to you so that in me you may have peace. In the world you have troubles, but be encouraged: I have overcome the world.‚Äù
