\v 33 I have told you these things in order that you may have \add inner\add* peace because of your relationship with me. In this world you will have trouble. But be courageous! I have defeated those who are opposed to me \f + \ft metonymy \f*, and \add you can defeat them, too\add*!"

\v 32 Look! The time is coming when others will scatter you everywhere! Each one will go toward his own home, and you will leave me. However, I will not be alone because the Father is always with me.
\v 33 I have told you these things so you may have peace in me. In the world you have trials and sorrows, but be brave! I have conquered the world!"

\v 32 See, the hour is coming, yes, and has indeed come, when you will be scattered, everyone to his own home, and you will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone because the Father is with me.
\v 33 I have spoken these things to you so that you will have peace in me. In the world you have troubles, but have courage, I have conquered the world."
