===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 When the Helper comes, he will convict them of the sins they have committed; he will show them that they do not reach God's standard of goodness; and he promises them that God will judge them because they did what God commanded them not to do.
\v 9 Their guilt from sin comes because they could not put their trust in me.
\v 10 Their failure to measure up to God's standard of goodness is confirmed because I am going back to my Father, and you will no longer see me.
\v 11 Their final accounting will come when God brings his punishment against them for their sin. This is shown by the punishment that Satan, the prince of this world, will receive because he fought against God.

\v 8 When he comes, the Comforter will convict the world regarding sin, regarding righteousness, and regarding judgmentâ€”
\v 9 regarding sin, because they do not believe in me;
\v 10 regarding righteousness, because I am going to the Father, and you will see me no more;
\v 11 and regarding judgment, because the prince of this world has been judged.

    * **the prince of this world** - Satan, the ruler of the corrupt things in the world. You should translate "the prince of this world" in the same manner as you did in [[en:bible:notes:jhn:12:30]])
