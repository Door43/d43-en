\v 26 At that time you will make your requests to God in my name and according to God's purposes. I will not have to ask the Father to meet your needs,
\v 27 for the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have put your trust in me and because you know that I came from God.
\v 28 I came from the Father, and I entered this world. Now I am leaving this world, and I am going back to the Father."

\v 26 On that day you will ask in my name and I do not say to you that I will pray to the Father for you,
