\p
\v 53 f + John 7:53-8:11 is not found in the most ancient and reliable manuscripts of the Greek New Testament. Many and various witnesses confirm the omission of this section. Many of the later manuscripts that include it, place it at different locations in the Gospels, making the case for including it here in John 7:53-8:11 doubtful. This section is familiar to readers of older English translations which may have included it, and it is included for reference. \f* [Then every man went to his own house.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **7:53 - 8:11** - Some early texts do not have these verses. The ULB has set them apart in square brackets ([ ]) to show that John probably did not write them.  Translators are encouraged to translate them, to set them apart with square brackets, and to include a footnote at the end like the one written on [[en:bible:notes:jhn:08:09|8:11]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_textvariants]]) 
  * **every man** - This refers to all the men mentioned in [[en:bible:notes:jhn:07:45|7:45]].
