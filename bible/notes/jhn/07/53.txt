===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **7:53 - 8:11** - Some early texts do not have these verses. The ULB has set them apart in square brackets ([ ]) to show that John probably did not write them.  Translators are encouraged to translate them, to set them apart with square brackets, and to include a footnote at the end like the one written on [[:en:bible:notes:jhn:08:09|8:11]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_textvariants]])
