====== John 07 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This whole chapter revolves around the concept of believing Jesus to be the Messiah. Some people believe this to be true while others rejected it. Some were willing to recognize his power and even the possibility that he was a prophet, but most are unwilling to believe that he was the Messiah. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:christ]] and [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])

Translators may wish to include a note at verse 53 to explain to the reader why they have chosen or chosen not to translate verses 7:53-8:11.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "My time has not yet come" ==
This phrase and "his hour had not yet come" are used in this chapter to indicate that Jesus is in control of the events unfolding in his life. 

== "Living water" ==
This is an important image used in the New Testament. It is a metaphor. Because this metaphor is given in a desert environment, it probably emphasizes that Jesus is able to give life sustaining nourishment. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Prophecy ==
Jesus gives a prophecy about his life without an explicit statement in John [[:en:bible:notes:jhn:07:33|7:33-34]]. 

== Irony ==
Nicodemus explains to the other Pharisees that the Law requires him to hear directly from a person before making a judgment about them. The Pharisees in turn made a judgment about Jesus without speaking to Jesus. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "Did not believe in him" ==
Jesus' brothers did not believe Jesus was the Messiah. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:believe]])

== "The Jews" ==
This term is used in two different ways in this passage. It is used specifically in reference to the opposition of the Jewish leaders who were trying kill him ([[:en:bible:notes:jhn:07:01|7:1]]). It is also used in reference to the people of Judea in general who had a positive opinion of Jesus ([[:en:bible:notes:jhn:07:12|7:13]]). The translator may wish to use the terms "Jewish leaders" and "Jewish people" or "Jews (leaders)" and "Jews (in general)."
