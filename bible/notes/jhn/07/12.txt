\v 12 Among the crowds, many people were quietly speaking with each other about Jesus. Some were saying, "He is a good man!" Others were saying instead, "No! He is deceiving and misleading the crowds!"
\v 13 Because they were afraid of the Jewish enemies of Jesus, no one spoke of him in a public place where other people could overhear what they were saying.
