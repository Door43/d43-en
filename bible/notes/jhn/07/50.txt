\v 50 Then Nicodemus spoke. He was the one who had gone to see Jesus at night to speak with him. He was one of the Pharisees, and he said to them,
\v 51 "It is not permitted in our Jewish law to condemn a man before we have listened to him. First, we give him a hearing, and we must learn about what he has done."
\v 52 They replied to him, "Are you also from Galilee? Search carefully and read what is written in the Scriptures! You will find that no prophet comes from Galilee."

\v 52 They answered and said to him, "Are you also from Galilee? Search and see that no prophet comes from Galilee."
