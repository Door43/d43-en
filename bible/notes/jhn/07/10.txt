===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **he also went up** - Jerusalem is at a higher elevation from where they were.
  * **not publicly but in private** - These two phrases mean the same thing, repeated for emphasis. Some languages emphasize in a different way. AT: "very privately." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
