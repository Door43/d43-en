\v 23 You sometimes circumcise boys on the Sabbath so that you will not violate the law of Moses. So why are you angry with me, saying I worked on the Sabbath when I was healing a man! Healing someone is more wonderful, and it is a greater work than circumcising a baby!
\v 24 Stop deciding whether healing this man was right or wrong according to a false application of God's law, and that without any thought! Instead, decide what a person should do and how he should be judged by the principle of what is right and what is just according to God, not man."

<usfm>
\v 23 If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses is not broken, why are you angry with me because I
made a man completely well on the Sabbath?
\v 24 Do not judge according to appearance, but judge righteously."
