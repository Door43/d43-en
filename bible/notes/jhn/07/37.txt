\v 37 \add On each of the seven days of the celebration, the high priest poured out some water on the altar in the Temple to remember how God provided water for the people in the desolate area long ago. But the water he poured did not help anyone who was thirsty. So\add* on the last day of the festival, which was the most important day, Jesus stood up \add in the Temple courtyard\add* and said with a loud voice, "Those who are thirsty should come to me to drink \add what I will give them\add*.
\v 38 Just like the Scriptures teach, streams of water shall flow out from the inner beings of those who believe in me, and that water will cause them to live \add eternally\add*."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Now** - The word "now" is used here to mark a break in the main storyline.
  * **great day**  - It is "great" because it is the last, or most-important day of the festival.
  * **If anyone is thirsty**  - desire for the things of God, just as one desires or "thirsts" for water. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **let him come to me and drink**  - The word "him" refers to "anyone." The word "drink" here represents finding spiritual fulfillment in Christ. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the Scripture**  -  "Scripture" stands for the Messianic prophecies concerning Christ. This is not a direct quote from any one Old Testament passage. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **flow rivers of living water** - Christ will provide relief for spiritually "thirsty" people in a great amount that flows out helping everyone around. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **living water** - This means 1) "water that gives life" or "water that causes people to live" (UDB) or 2) natural water that flows from a spring, as opposed to water that needs to be taken from a well (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]).
