\v 25 Some of the people from Jerusalem were saying, "Is this not the man they are trying to put to death?
\v 26 He is saying these things publicly, but the authorities are not saying anything to oppose him. Is that because they know he is the Messiah?
\v 27 But this cannot be the Messiah! We know where this man came from, but when the Messiah comes, no one will know where he is from."

\v 25 Some of them from Jerusalem said, "Is not this the one they seek to kill?
\v 26 And see, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. It cannot be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ, can it?
\v 27 Yet we know where this one is from. But when the Christ comes, no one will know where he is from."

  * **they say nothing to him** - This implies that the Jewish leaders are not opposing Jesus. AT: "they say nothing to oppose him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **It cannot be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ, can it?** - This remark appears in the form of a question to add emphasis. AT: "Maybe they have decided that he is truly the Messiah!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
