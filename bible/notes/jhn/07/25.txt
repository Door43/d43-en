\v 26 He is saying these things publicly\f + \ft Or: in front of many people \f*, but our \add Jewish\add* rulers are not saying anything to \add oppose\add* him. Is that because they have decided that he is truly the Messiah\f + \ft Or: God's chosen king \f*?

\v 25 Some of the people from Jerusalem were saying, "Isn't this the man they are trying to put to death?
\v 26 He is saying these things publicly, but the authorities are not saying anything to oppose him. Is that because they know he is the Christ?
\v 27 But this cannot be the Christ because we know where this man came from. When the Christ comes, no one will know where he is from."

\v 25 Some of them from Jerusalem said, "Is not this he whom they seek to kill?
\v 26 And see, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. It cannot be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ, can it?
\v 27 But we know where this man comes from, but when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from."
