====== John 07:17-18 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 Those who choose to do what God wants will find out whether what I teach comes from God or whether I am speaking with \add only\add* my own \add authority\add*.
\v 18 Those who speak with \add only\add* their own \add authority\add* do that \add only\add* so that others will honor them. But I am \add doing things so that others\add* will honor the one who sent me, and I am someone who speaks the truth. I never lie.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 If anyone chooses to do what God wants, he will find out if what I teach comes from God or if I speak only by my own authority.
\v 18 Anyone who speaks on his own authority speaks so others will honor only him. However, if a servant works hard to honor the person who sent him, to give him a good reputation as a man of integrity, there is no fault in that kind of a servant.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 If anyone wishes to do the will of that person, he will know about this teaching, whether it comes from God, or whether I speak from myself.
\v 18 Whoever speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but whoever seeks the glory of him who sent him, that person is true, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
