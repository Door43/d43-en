===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Here the storyline shifts back to Jesus.

  * **The high priest** - This was Caiphas. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:jhn:18:12|18:13]])
  * **about his disciples and his teaching** - Here "his teaching" refers to what Jesus had been teaching the people. AT: "about his disciples and what he had been teaching the people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) 
  * **I have spoken openly to the world** - The "world" is a metonym for those people who had heard Jesus teach. Here the exaggeration "the world" emphasizes that Jesus has spoken openly. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **where all the Jews come together** - Here "all the Jews" is an exaggeration that emphasizes that Jesus spoke where anyone who wanted to hear him could hear him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]]) 
  * **Why did you ask me?** - This remark appears in the form of a question to add emphasis to what Jesus is saying. AT: "You should not be asking me these questions!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
