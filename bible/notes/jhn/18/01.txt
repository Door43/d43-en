\v 1 When Jesus finished his prayer, he went with his disciples and crossed the Kidron Valley. On the other side there was a grove of olive trees, and they entered it.
\p
\v 2 Judas, the one who was about to hand Jesus over to his enemies, knew where the place was because Jesus often went there with his disciples.
\v 3 Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had ordered some soldiers and officers to go there with Judas. So they went to the garden with lanterns, torches, and weapons.
