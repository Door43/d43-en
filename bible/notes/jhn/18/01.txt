\v 1 When Jesus finished his prayer, he went with his disciples and crossed the Kidron Valley. On the other side there was a grove of olive trees, and they entered it.
\p
\v 2 Judas, the one who was about to hand Jesus over to his enemies, knew where the place was because Jesus often went there with his disciples.
\v 3 Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had ordered some soldiers and officers to go there with Judas. So they went to the garden with lanterns, torches, and weapons.

\v 1 After Jesus spoke these words, he went out with his disciples over the Kidron Valley, where there was a garden into which he entered, he and his disciples.
\v 2 Now Judas, who was going to betray him, also knew the place, for Jesus often went there with his disciples.
\v 3 Then Judas, having received the group of soldiers and the officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.
