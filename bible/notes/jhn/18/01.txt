\v 1 When Jesus finished his prayer, he went with his disciples and crossed the Kidron Valley, where there was grove of olive trees, a garden into which they entered.
\p
\v 2 But Judas, the one who would hand him over to his enemies, knew where the place was, because Jesus often went there with his disciples.
\v 3 So Judas gathered a group of soldiers along with some of the chief priests and the Pharisees, and they went to the garden with lanterns, torches, and weapons.
