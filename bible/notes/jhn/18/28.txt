\v 28 Then the soldiers led Jesus from Caiaphas' house to the headquarters of Pilate, the Roman governor. It was early morning. Pilate was not a Jew, so Jesus' accusers thought that if they entered his headquarters, they would defile themselves and be unable to celebrate the Passover Festival. So they did not go in.
\v 29 So Pilate came out to talk to them. He said, "Of what are you accusing this man?"
\v 30 "If this man were not a criminal, we would not have brought him to you!" they replied.

\v 28 Then they lead Jesus from Caiaphas into the Praetorium. It was early in the morning, and they themselves did not enter the Praetorium so that they might not be defiled and so that they might eat the Passover.
\v 29 So Pilate went out to them and said, “What accusation are you bringing against this man?”
\v 30 They answered and said to him, “If this man were not an evil doer, we would not have delivered him up to you.”
