\v 12 So the band and the chief captain, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him,
\v 13 and led him to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.
\v 14 Now Caiaphas was he that gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.
