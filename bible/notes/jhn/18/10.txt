===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **name was Malchus** - (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **into its sheath** - the cover for a sharp knife or sword so it would not cut the owner
  * **cup** - This can refer to 1) the amount suffering that Jesus must accept (see UDB) or 2) the wrath of God that Jesus must endure in order to redeem his people. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **should I not drink it?** - Jesus asks this question to emphasize that he must indeed suffer. Alternate translation: "I must drink it." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
