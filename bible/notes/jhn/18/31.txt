\v 31 Pilate therefore said to them, "Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law." The Jews said to him, "It is not lawful for us to put any man to death."
\v 32 They said this so that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, the word that he had said that indicated by what kind of death he would die.
