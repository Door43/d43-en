\v 38 Pilate asked him, "What is truth?"
\p After he said that, he went outside and talked to the Jewish leaders again. He said to them, "I find he has broken no law.
\v 39 But you Jews have a custom where every year during the Passover Festival, you ask me to release one man who is in prison. So would you like for me to release to you the King of the Jews?"
\v 40 They shouted again, "No, not this man, but Barabbas!" Now Barabbas was a revolutionary.

\v 38 Pilate says to him, What is truth?
 And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and says to them, I find no crime in him.
\v 39 But you have a custom, that I should release to you one at the Passover: will you therefore that I release to you the
King of the Jews?
\v 40 They cried out therefore again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.
