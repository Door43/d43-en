\p After he said that, he went outside and talked to the Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* again. He said to them, "I do not find that he has done anything at all for which I should punish him.
\v 39 But you \add Jews\add* customarily, \add every year\add* during the Passover \add celebration\add*, ask me to release for you \add someone who is in prison\add*. So would you like for me to release for you the \add man who you\add* Jews \add say is your\add* king?"

\v 38 Pilate asked him, "What is true?"
\p After Pilate asked that question, he went outside and talked to the Jewish leaders again. He said to them, "I find he has broken no law.
\v 39 However, you Jews have a custom where every year during the Passover Festival, you ask me to release one man who is in prison. So would you like for me to release to you the King of the Jews?"
\v 40 They shouted again, "No, do not release this man, but release Barabbas!" Now Barabbas was a revolutionary.

\v 38 Pilate said to him, “What is truth?”  When he had said this, he went out again to the Jews and said to them, “I find no crime in this man.
\v 39 You have the custom that I should release to you one man at the Passover. So do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?”
\v 40 Then they cried out again and said, “Not this man, but Barabbas.” Now Barabbas was a robber.
