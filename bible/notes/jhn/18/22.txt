\v 22 When Jesus said these things, one of the temple guards standing near him struck him  hard with his hand. He said, "That is not the right way to answer the high priest."
\v 23 Jesus replied to him, "If I had said something wrong, tell me what it was. However, if what I said was right, you should not slap me!"
\v 24 Then Annas sent Jesus, who was still tied up, to Caiaphas the high priest.

\v 22 When Jesus had said this, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand and said, "Is that how you should answer the high priest?"
\v 23 Jesus answered him, "If I have said anything bad, bear witness to the evil. However, if I have answered well, why do you strike me?"
\v 24 Annas then sent Jesus bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
