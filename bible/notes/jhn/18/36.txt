\v 36 Jesus replied, "My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have been fighting to keep me from being handed over to my Jewish opponents, but my kingdom is not of this world."
\v 37 Then Pilate said to him, "So you are a king?" Jesus replied, "Yes. The reason I was born and came into this world was to tell people the truth about God. Everyone who loves the truth listens to me."

\v 36 Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not part of this world. If my kingdom were part of this world, then my servants would fight so that I should not be delivered to the Jews. Actually my kingdom does not come from here.”
\v 37 Pilate then said to him, “Are you a king then?” Jesus answered, “You say that I am a king. For this purpose I have been born, and for this purpose I have come into the world so that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.”
