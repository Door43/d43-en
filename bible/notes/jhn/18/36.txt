\v 36 Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I
should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.
\v 37 Pilate therefore said to him, Are you a king then? Jesus answered, You say that I am a king. To this end have I
been born, and to this end am I come into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Every one that is of the truth
hears my voice.
