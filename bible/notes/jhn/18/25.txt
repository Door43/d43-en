\v 25 Simon Peter was still standing and warming himself. Another person said to him, "You are one of the disciples of the man whom they have arrested, are you not?" He said, "No, I am not."
\v 26 One of the high priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said to him, "Surely I saw you in the olive tree grove with the man they have arrested, did I not?"
\v 27 Peter again denied it, and immediately a rooster crowed.

\v 25 Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. The people then said to him, “Are you not also one of his disciples?” He denied it and said, “I am not.”
\v 26 One of the servants of the high priest, who was a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, “Did I not I see you in the garden with him?”
\v 27 Peter then denied again, and immediately the rooster crowed.
