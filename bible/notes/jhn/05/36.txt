\v 36 But there is something else that tells you about me. \add It should prove who I am\add* more than what John \add said about me\add*. The miracles \f + \ft personification \f* that \add my\add* Father told me to do, the miracles that I am performing, show \f + \ft Or: prove \f* to people that my Father sent me.
\v 37 Furthermore, \add my\add* Father, who sent me, tells people about me. You have never heard his voice or seen him.
\v 38 Furthermore, you have not believed in \add me\add*, the one he sent. So you have not \add believed\add* his message in your inner beings.

\v 36 However, the witness I give about myself is even greater than the witness John gave about me. All the things that the Father has allowed me to do—I do those things every day, and you see me doing them—those things tell much about who I am; they explain my purpose for coming here. They are proof that the Father has sent me.
\v 37 My Father, who sent me, has given testimony about me. You have never heard his voice and you have never seen him physically.
\v 38 The proof that you do not have his word living in you is that you do not trust me, the one he sent.

\v 36 Yet the testimony that I have is greater than that of John, for the works that the Father has given me to accomplish, the very works that I do, testify concerning me that the Father has sent me.
\v 37 The Father who sent me, he has testified concerning me. You have neither heard his voice nor seen his form at any time. 
\v 38 You do not have his word remaining in you, for you are not believing in the one whom he has sent.

    * **remaining in you** - "staying with you"
