\v 36 But there is something else that tells you about me. \add It should prove who I am\add* more than what John \add said about me\add*. The miracles \f + \ft personification \f* that \add my\add* Father told me to do, the miracles that I am performing, show \f + \ft Or: prove \f* to people that my Father sent me.
\v 37 Furthermore, \add my\add* Father, who sent me, tells people about me. You have never heard his voice or seen him.
\v 38 Furthermore, you have not believed in \add me\add*, the one he sent. So you have not \add believed\add* his message in your inner beings.

\v 36 But the witness I give about myself is even greater that the witness that John brings to me. For the works that the Father gave me to do, those works I do every day and you see me completing them, those are the works that tell so much about who I am and what I am doing, and they are the proof that the Father sent me.
\v 37 My Father who sent me, he has borne witness of me. You have never heard his voice and you have never seen him.
\v 38 You do not have his word living in you, for you do not trust the one he sent.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 36 But the witness which I have is greater than that of John; for the works which the Father has given me to
accomplish, the very works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me.
\v 37 And the Father that sent me, he has borne witness of me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.
\v 38 And you have not his word living in you: for whom he sent, him you believe not.
