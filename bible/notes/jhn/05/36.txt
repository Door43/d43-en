\v 36 But the witness which I have is greater than that of John; for the works which the Father has given me to
accomplish, the very works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me.
\v 37 And the Father that sent me, he has borne witness of me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.
\v 38 And you have not his word living in you: for whom he sent, him you believe not.
