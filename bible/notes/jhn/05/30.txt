====== John 05:30-32 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 30 I do not do anything \add like that\add* by my own authority. I judge people only according to what I hear \add my Father tell me\add*. I will judge people fairly, because I do not want to please only myself. Instead, I want to please \add my Father\add*, who sent me.
\p
\v 31 If I were the \add only\add* one to tell people about myself, \add people could rightly say that\add* what I say is not true.
\v 32 But there is someone else who tells people about me. And I know that what he tells people about me is true.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 30 I can do nothing on my own. Whatever I hear, that is how I judge, and my judgment is just because I do not seek my own will but the will of my Father who sent me. 
\p
\v 31 If I alone were the only one to give a witness about myself, my witness would not be received as true or reliable.
\v 32 But there is someone else who bears witness about me. And I know that his testimony about me is true.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 30 I can of myself do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is righteous; because I seek not mine own will, but the
will of him that sent me.
\v 31 If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.
\v 32 It is another that bears witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.
