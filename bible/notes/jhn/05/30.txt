====== John 05:30-32 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 30 I do not do anything \add like that\add* by my own authority. I judge people only according to what I hear \add my Father tell me\add*. I will judge people fairly, because I do not want to please only myself. Instead, I want to please \add my Father\add*, who sent me.
\p
\v 31 If I were the \add only\add* one to tell people about myself, \add people could rightly say that\add* what I say is not true.
\v 32 But there is someone else who tells people about me. And I know that what he tells people about me is true.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 30 I can do nothing on my own. Whatever I hear from the Father, that is how I judge, and I judge in a just manner. I judge justly because I do not try to do what I want, but what the Father wants, he who sent me here.
\p
\v 31 If I alone were the only one to be a witness about myself, no one would believe my witness to be true or reliable.
\v 32 Nevertheless, there is someone else who bears witness about me, and I know that his testimony about me is true.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 30 I can do nothing from myself.  As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous because I am not seeking my own will but the will of him who sent me.
\v 31 If I should testify about myself alone, my testimony would not be true.
\v 32 There is another who testifies concerning me, and I know that the testimony that he gives about me is true.

Jesus continues speaking to the Jewish leaders ([[:en:bible:notes:jhn:05:16|5:16]]).

  * **can do nothing from** - Translate this the same way you translated it in [[:en:bible:notes:jhn:05:19|5:19]].
