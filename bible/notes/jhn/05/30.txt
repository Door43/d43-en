====== John 05:30-32 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 30 I do not do anything \add like that\add* by my own authority. I judge people only according to what I hear \add my Father tell me\add*. I will judge people fairly, because I do not want to please only myself. Instead, I want to please \add my Father\add*, who sent me.
\p
\v 31 If I were the \add only\add* one to tell people about myself, \add people could rightly say that\add* what I say is not true.
\v 32 But there is someone else who tells people about me. And I know that what he tells people about me is true.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 30 I can do nothing on my own. Whatever I hear, that is how I judge, and my judgment is just. It is just because I do not seek my own will but the will of my Father who sent me. 
\p
\v 31 If I alone were the only one to give a witness about myself, my witness should not be received as true or reliable.
\v 32 But there is someone else who bears witness about me. And I know that his testimony about me is true.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 30 I can do nothing from myself.   As I hear, I judge,  and my judgment is righteous, because I am not seeking  my own will but the will of him that sent me.
\v 31 If I should testify about myself alone, my testimony is not necessarily true.
\v 32 There  is another who testifies concerning  me, and I know that his testimony which he testifies about me is true.
