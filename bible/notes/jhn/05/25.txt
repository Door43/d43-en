===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues speaking to the Jewish leaders ([[:en:bible:notes:jhn:05:16|5:16]]).

  * **Truly, truly** - This is a way of marking emphasis. Translate it however you would add emphasis to an important phrase in your language. 
  * **the dead will hear the voice of me, the Son of God, and they who hear will live** - The voice of Jesus, the Son of God, will raise dead people from the grave. Maintain Jesus' title "Son of God" in your translation, seeking to translate it as literally as possible in your language. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
