\v 20 \add My\add* Father loves me, and he shows me everything that he is doing. He will show me \add the miracles\add* that \add he wants me to do\add* that will be greater than the ones that \add you have already seen me do\add*, so that you may be amazed.

\v 19 Jesus replied to them, "I am telling you the truth: I, the Son of Man, can do nothing on my own authority. I can do only what I see the Father doing. Whatever the Father does, that is what I, the Son, do.
\v 20 The Father loves me, the Son, and shows me everything he is doing. Even greater works than these the Father will show me, so that you may see what I can do and be amazed.
