===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues speaking to the Jewish leaders ([[:en:bible:notes:jhn:05:16|5:16]]).

  * **the testimony that I receive is not from man** - "I do not need people's testimony"
  * **saved** - This means to be "saved" in a spiritual sense. If a person has been ?saved,? it means that God has forgiven him and rescued him from being punished in hell for his sin.
  * **John was a lamp that was burning and shining** - John displayed God's holiness in the way that a lamp shines light. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
