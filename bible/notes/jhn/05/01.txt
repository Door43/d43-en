\v 1 The time came for another Jewish festival, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem for it.
\v 2 There is in Jerusalem beside one of the gates going into the city, a place called the Sheep Gate. At that gate there is a pool called Bethesda (as it said in Aramaic). Next to the pool are five roofed porches or colonnades.
\v 3-4 There was a great number of people there who were sick, blind, and could not walk. Many people who could not walk were lying on the porch.
