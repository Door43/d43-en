\v 1 The time came for another Jewish festival, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem for it.
\v 2 There is in Jerusalem beside one of the gates going into the city, a place called the Sheep Gate. At that gate there is a pool called Bethesda (as it said in Aramaic). Next to the pool are five roofed porches or colonnades.
\v 3-4 There was a great number of people there who were sick, blind, and could not walk. Many people who could not walk were lying on the porch.

\v 1 After this there was a festival of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
\v 2 Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep gate a pool, which is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five roofed porticos.
\v 3 A great number of people who were sick, blind, lame, or paralyzed were lying in these porticos. 
\v 4 \f + Verses 3 and 4. Some later manuscripts add to John 5:3 the phrase, "waiting for the moving of the water," and to John 5:4, "For an angel of the Lord went down and stirred up the water at certain times and whoever stepped in while the water was stirring was healed from whatever disease he suffered from." The best and most accurate Greek manuscripts do not have the addition to verse 3, and they do not have verse 4. For these reasons, the additions to verse 3 and the whole of verse 4 not be included in the Biblical text. \f*

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **After this** - After he had healed the official's son ([[en:bible:notes:jhn:04:46|4:46-54]])
  * **went up to Jerusalem** - Jerusalem is located on the top of a hill. Roads to Jerusalem went up and down smaller hills, but if your language has a different word for going up a hill than for walking on level ground, use it here.
  * **pool** - a hole in the ground filled with water
  * **Bethesda** - "Bethesda" means house of mercy (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **roofed porticos** - roofed structures with at least one wall missing attached to buildings
  * **a great number** - "many"
  * **verse 4** - Some early texts have this verse, but others do not. We suggest you combine verses 3 and 4 with a verse bridge (3-4) as in the ULB and UDB rather than leave and empty verse.
