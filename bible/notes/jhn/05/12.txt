\v 12 They asked him, "Who was that man?"
\v 13 Now although Jesus had healed the man, the man did not know his name. After healing him, Jesus had left the man and disappeared into the crowd.

\v 12 They asked him, "Who is the man that said to you, 'Pick it up and walk'?"
\v 13 However, the one who was healed did not know who it was because Jesus had gone away secretly, for there was a crowd in the place.
