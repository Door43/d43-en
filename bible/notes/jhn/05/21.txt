====== John 05:21-23 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 21 \add For example\add*, just like \add my\add* Father causes people who have died to rise up and be alive again, I will give \add eternal\add* life to everyone that I want to.
\v 22 Furthermore, \add my\add* Father is not the one who judges people \add concerning their sins\add*. Instead, he has given to me the work of judging people,
\v 23 in order that all people may honor me, just like they honor \add my\add* Father. \add My\add* Father\add considers that\add* anyone who does not honor me is not honoring \add him\add*, the one who sent me.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 21 As the Father raises up those who have died and gives them life again, so I, the Son, give life to anyone I wants.
\v 22  The Father judges no one, but has given over all judgment to me,
\v 23 so that all people may honor the me, the Son, in the same way that they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the me cannot honor the Father.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 21 For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whomever he wishes.
\v 22 For neither does the Father judge anyone, but he has given all judgment to the Son
\v 23 so that all may honor the Son even as they honor the Father. The one who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father that sent him.
