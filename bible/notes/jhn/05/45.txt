====== John 05:45-47 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 45 But do not think that I am the one who will accuse you while \add my\add* Father is listening! No, it is Moses who will accuse you! You thought that he would \add defend you\add*.
\v 46 Moses wrote about me, so if you had believed what he \add wrote\add*, you would have believed what I \add said\add*!
\v 47 But because you did not believe what he wrote \add about me\add*, you will certainly not believe what I say!\f + \ft Or: how will you believe what I say? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*"

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 45 Do not think that I am the one who accuses you before my Father. You thought Moses would defend you, so on him you have set your hopes. However, it is Moses who accuses you.
\v 46 If you had accepted what Moses said, you would have received what I said as the truth.
\v 47 Since you did not even believe in what Moses wrote, how could you possibly trust what I have said to you!"
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 45 Do not think that I myself will accuse you before the Father. The one who accuses you is Moses, in whom you have put your hopes.
\v 46 If you believed Moses, you would believe me because he wrote about me.
\v 47 If you do not believe his writings, how are you going to believe my words?"

===== translationNotes: =====

Jesus finishes speaking to the Jewish leaders.

  * **The one who accuses you is Moses ... your hopes** - "Moses" is a metonym here that stands for the law itself. AT: "Moses accuses you in the Law, the very Law in which you have put your hopes" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **your hopes** - "your confidence" or "your trust"
  * **If you do not believe his writings, how are you going to believe my words?** - This remark appears in the form of a question to provide emphasis. AT: "You do not believe his writings, so you will never believe my words!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **my words** - "what I say"
