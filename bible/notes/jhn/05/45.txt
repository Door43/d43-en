<usfm>
\v 45 But do not think that I am the one who will accuse you while \add my\add* Father is listening! No, it is Moses who will accuse you! You thought that he would \add defend you\add*.
\v 46 Moses wrote about me, so if you had believed what he \add wrote\add*, you would have believed what I \add said\add*!
\v 47 But because you did not believe what he wrote \add about me\add*, you will certainly not believe what I say!\f + \ft Or: how will you believe what I say? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*"

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 45 Do not think that I am the one who accuses you before my Father. You thought Moses would defend you, so on him you have set your hopes. However, it is Moses who accuses you.
\v 46 If you had accepted what Moses said, you would have received what I said as the truth.
\v 47 Since you did not even believe in what Moses wrote, how could you possibly trust what I have said to you!"
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 45 Do not think that I myself will accuse you before the Father. There is another one who accuses you, that is Moses on whom you have put your hopes.
\v 46 If you were believing Moses, you would be believing me because he wrote concerning me.
\v 47 If you do not believe his writings, how are you going to believe my words?"
