===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues speaking to the Jewish leaders ([[:en:bible:notes:jhn:05:16|5:16]]).

  * **receive** - "accept"
  * **you do not have the love of God in yourselves** - This can mean 1) "you really do not love God" (see UDB) or 2) "you have really not received God's love."
