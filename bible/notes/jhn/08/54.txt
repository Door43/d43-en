\v 54 Jesus replied, "If I were honoring myself, that would be worthless. My Father is the one who you say is your God. He is the one who honors me.
\v 55 Although you do not know him, I know him \add and have a close relationship with him\add*. If I said that I did not know him, I would be a liar like you are. But I know him, and I obey what he says.
\v 56 Your ancestor Abraham was happy when he thought about what I would \add do during\add* my life \f + \ft metonymy \f*. \add It was as though\add* he saw that, and was happy."

\v 54 Jesus replied, "If I tried to get people to praise me, that would be worthless. It is my Father who praises me, my character and goodness, and yet he is the one of whom you say, 'He is our God.'
\v 55 Although you do not know him, I do know him. If I said that I did not know him, I would be a liar like you. I know him and I always obey what he says.
\v 56 Your father Abraham was happy when, as a prophet, he looked forward and saw what I could do."

\v 54 Jesus answered, "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing; it is my Father who glorifies meâ€”about whom you say that he is your God.
\v 55 You have not known him, but I know him. If I should say, 'I do not know him,' I would be like you, a liar. However, I know him and keep his word.
\v 56 Your father Abraham rejoiced at seeing my day; he saw it and was glad."
