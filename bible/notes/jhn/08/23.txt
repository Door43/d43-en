\v 23 Jesus continued saying to them, "You are from this earth below, but I am from heaven above. You belong to this world. I do not belong to this world.
\v 24 I told you that you will die and that God will condemn you for your sins. This will certainly happen unless you trust that I am God, as I say I am."

\v 24 Therefore, I said to you that you will die in your sins. For unless you believe that I AM, you will die in your sins."
