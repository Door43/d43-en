    * **you are ... you heard** - In vv 37-38, every use of the word "you" refers to the Jewish leaders who do not believe in Jesus. (See: [[en:ta:translate:formsofyou-plural]])
    * **my Father** - Here Jesus refers to God as "my Father."
    * **your father** - By using the phrase "your father," Jesus is referring to the Devil as the father of the Jewish leaders because they are doing the work of the Devil.
