===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues speaking to the Jews.
  * **my word has no place in you** - Here "word" is a metonym for the "teachings" or "message" of Jesus, which the Jewish leaders do not accept. AT: "you do not accept my teachings" or "you do not allow my message to change your life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
  * **I say what I have seen with my Father** - "I am telling you about the things I saw when I was with my Father"
  * **you also do what you heard from your father** - The Jewish leaders do not understand that by "your father" Jesus is referring to the devil. AT: "you also continue doing what your father has told you to do."
