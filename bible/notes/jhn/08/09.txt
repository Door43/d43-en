\v 9 After they heard what he said, those who were questioning him started walking away, one by one, the older ones first and then the younger ones. They knew they were all sinners. Finally only Jesus was there with the woman.
\v 10 Jesus stood up and asked her, "Woman, where are those who accuse you? Has no one brought a charge against you that you must be punished?"
\v 11 She said, "No, sir, no one." Then Jesus said, "I do not condemn you either. Go home now, and from now on, do not sin like this anymore!"

\v 9 When they heard it, they went out one by one, beginning from the eldest and ending with the last. Jesus was left alone, and the woman, where she had been in the midst of them all.
\v 10 Jesus lifted up himself and said to her, "Woman, where are your accusers? Did no one condemn you?"
\v 11 She said, "No one, Lord." Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you. Go your way; from now on sin no more."
