<usfm>
\v 9 After they heard what he said, those \add who were questioning him\add* went away, one by one, the older ones first \add and then the younger ones, knowing they were all sinners\add*. Finally only Jesus was there, along with the woman.
\v 10 Jesus stood up and asked her, "Woman, where are they? Has no one said you must die for your sin?"
\v 11 She said, "No, sir, no one." Then Jesus said, "I do not condemn you either. Go \add home\add* now, and do not continue your sinful \add life\add* any longer!"]

\v 9 After they heard what he said, those who were questioning him started walking away, one by one, the older ones first and then the younger ones. They knew they were all sinners. Finally only Jesus was there with the woman.
\v 10 Jesus stood up and asked her, "Woman, where are those who accuse you? Has no one brought a charge against you that you must be punished?"
\v 11 She said, "No, sir, no one." Then Jesus said, "I do not condemn you either. Go home now, and from now on, do not sin like this anymore!"]
\f + \ft The best ancient copies do not have John 7:35-8:11 \f*

\v 9 \f + \ft See the note about John 7:53-8:11 above \f* When they heard it, they left one by one, beginning with the oldest. Finally Jesus was left alone, with the woman who had been in the middle.
\v 10 Jesus stood up and said to her, "Woman, where are your accusers? Did no one condemn you?"
\v 11 She said, "No one, Lord." Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you. Go and sin no more."]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - While some texts have 7:53 - 8:11, the best and earliest texts do not include them.
  * 
  * **one by one** - "one after another"
  * **Woman, where are your accusers** - When Jesus called her "woman," he was not trying to make her feel insignificant. If people in your language group would think that he was doing that, this can be translated without the word "Woman."
