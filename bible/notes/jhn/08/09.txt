\v 9 And they, when they heard it, went out one by one, beginning from the eldest,
even to the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman, where she was, in the midst.
\v 10 And Jesus lifted up himself, and said to her, Woman, where are they? did no man condemn thee?
\v 11 And she said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said, Neither do I condemn thee: go your way; from henceforth sin no more.]
