====== John 08:50-51 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 50 I am not trying to honor myself. There is someone else who desires \add to honor me\add*, and he is the one who will judge \add whether it is I who am telling the truth or whether it is you who are telling the truth\add*.
\v 51 But the truth is that anyone who obeys what I say will never die!"

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 50 I do not try to persuade people to praise me. There is someone else who desires to give me what I deserve, and he is the one who will judge everything that I say and do.
\v 51 I am telling you the truth: if anyone holds firm to my word and trusts in it as I gave it, that person will never die!"

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 50 I do not seek my own glory; there is one who seeks and judges.

</usfm>
