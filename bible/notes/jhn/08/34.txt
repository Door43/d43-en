====== John 08:34-36 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 34 Jesus replied, "Listen carefully to what I am going to tell you. All those who continue to sin are \add forced to obey\add* their sinful desires \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add just like\add* a slave \add is forced to obey his master\add*.
\v 35 A slave is not a permanent member of a family. But a son is a member of a family forever. \add Similarly, you say you are members of God's family because you are descendants of Abraham, but really, because you are like slaves of your sinful desires, you are no longer permanent members of God's family\add*.
\v 36 So if you allow me to free you, you will truly be free.

\v 34 Jesus replied, "I am telling you the truth: All who sin obey their sinful desires just as a slave is forced to obey his master.
\v 35 Slaves will not remain as permanent members of a family but may be set free to return home or sold. However, a son is a member of the family forever.
\v 36 So if the Son sets you free, you will be absolutely free.

\v 34 Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin.
\v 35 The slave does not remain in the house forever; the son remains forever.
\v 36 Therefore, if the Son sets you free, you will be truly free.
