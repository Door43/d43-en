\v 57 Then the Jewish leaders said to him, "You are not fifty years old yet! You have seen Abraham?"
\v 58 Jesus said to them, "I am telling you the truth, before Abraham was, I AM."
\v 59 So they picked up stones to put him to death. However, Jesus hid himself, left the temple, and went somewhere else.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - This is the end of the part of the story about Jesus speaking with the Jews in the temple, which began in [[:en:bible:notes:jhn:08:12|8:12]].
 
  * **The Jews said to him** - Here the "Jews" is a synecdoche for the "Jewish leaders" who opposed Jesus. AT: "The Jewish leaders said to him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **You are not yet fifty years old, and you have seen Abraham?** - The Jewish leaders use this question to express their shock that Jesus claims to have seen Abraham. AT: "You are less than fifty years old. You could not have seen Abraham!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Truly, truly** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jhn:01:49|1:51]].
  * **before Abraham was, I AM** - As God the Son, Jesus knows God the Father unlike anyone else. Possible meanings are 1) Jesus was identifying himself as Yahweh by saying, "I am God" or 2) Jesus was saying, "before Abraham existed, I existed." 
  * **Then they picked up stones to throw at him** - The Jewish leaders are outraged at what Jesus has said. Here it is implied that they wanted to kill him because he had made himself equal to God. AT: "Then they picked up stones to kill him because he claimed to be equal with God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
