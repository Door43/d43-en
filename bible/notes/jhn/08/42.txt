\v 42 Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you would love me because I came from God and now I have come here to this world. I did not come because I myself decided to come but because he sent me.
\v 43 I will tell you why you do not understand what I say. It is because you do not accept my message or my teachings.
\v 44 You belong to your father, the devil, and you desire to do what he wants. He was a murderer from the time people first sinned. He has abandoned God's truth; it is not in him. Whenever he lies, he is speaking according to his character because he is a liar; everyone who lies does what the devil wants him to do.

\v 42 Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you would love me, for I proceeded and have come from God; for neither have I come of myself, but he sent me.
\v 43 Why do you not understand my words? It is because you cannot bear to hear my words.
\v 44 You are of your father, the devil, and you wish to do the lusts of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature because he is a liar and the father of lies.
