\v 39 That was the reason why they were unable to believe. \add It was like\add* Isaiah wrote somewhere else that God said:
\q
\v 40 They have \add refused to understand; they acted as though they were\add* blind people!
\q They were insensible in their inner beings!
\q As a result, they have not perceived \add my truth\add*!
\q1 They have not understood it in their inner beings!
\q1 They have not turned \add from their sinful lives\add*,
\q2 and because of that I cannot help them!

\v 39 Therefore they could not give him their trust. For Isaiah wrote: :
\q
\v 40 
\q"The Lord has made them so they cannot see, 
\q1 he has made their hearts hard --
\q even their eyes cannot see, 
\q1 and their hearts cannot understand, 
\q and they have not turned to me in repentance, 
\q1 and because of that I cannot heal them!"

\v 39 For this reason they could not believe, for that Isaiah said again,
\q
\v 40 "He has blinded their eyes, and he has  hardened their heart;
\q Otherwise they would see with their eyes and perceive with their heart,
\q And would turn,
\q And I would heal them."
