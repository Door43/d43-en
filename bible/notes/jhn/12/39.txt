\v 39 That was the reason why they were unable to believe. \add It was like\add* Isaiah wrote somewhere else that God said:
\q
\v 40 They have \add refused to understand; they acted as though they were\add* blind people!
\q They were insensible in their inner beings!
\q As a result, they have not perceived \add my truth\add*!
\q1 They have not understood it in their inner beings!
\q1 They have not turned \add from their sinful lives\add*,
\q2 and because of that I cannot help them!

\v 39 Yet, they could not trust in him for the reason that Isaiah had written:
\q
\v 40 
\q "The Lord has made them so they cannot see, 
\q and he has made them stubborn;
\q they cannot even see with their eyes,
\q If they could, they would understand;
\q they would repent and pray for me to forgive them. 
\q For this reason, I cannot heal them!"

\v 39 For this reason they could not believe, for Isaiah said again,
\q
\v 40 "He has blinded their eyes, and he has hardened their hearts;
\q otherwise they would see with their eyes and would perceive with their hearts,
\q and would turn,
\q and I would heal them."
