\v 27 Now my soul is greatly troubled. Should I say, ‘Father, save me from this time when I will suffer and die!’? No, for this is the very reason I came into this world.
\v 28 My Father, show how powerful you are in all you have said, in all you have done, and in all you are!"


\p Then God spoke from heaven, "I have already displayed my nature, my words, and my works; and I will do it again!"
\v 29 The crowd that was there heard the voice of God, but some said it was just thunder. Others said an angel had spoken to Jesus.

\v 27 My soul is troubled now: what should I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'? But for this reason I came to this hour.
\v 28 Father, glorify your name." Then a voice came out of heaven and said, "I have both glorified it and will glorify it again."
\v 29 Then the crowd that stood by and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said, "An angel has spoken to him."
