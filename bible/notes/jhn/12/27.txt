\v 27 Now my soul is greatly troubled. Should I say, 'Father, save me from this time when I will suffer and die!'? No, for this is the very reason I came into this world.
\v 28 My Father, show how powerful you are in all you have said, in all you have done, and in all you are!"


\p Then God spoke from heaven, "I have already displayed my nature, my words, and my works; and I will do it again!"
\v 29 The crowd that was there heard the voice of God, but some said it was just thunder. Others said an angel had spoken to Jesus.

\v 27 Now my soul is troubled: what should I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'? But for this reason I came to this hour.
\v 28 Father, glorify your name." Then a voice came from heaven and said, "I have glorified it and I will glorify it again."
\v 29 Then the crowd that stood by and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said, "An angel has spoken to him."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **what should I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'?** - This remark appears in the form of a rhetorical question. Although Jesus desires to avoid crucifixion, he chooses to be obedient to God and to be killed. AT: "I will not pray, 'Father, save me from this hour!'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Father** - This is an important title for God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **this hour** - Here "this hour" is a metonym that represents when Jesus would suffer and die on the cross. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **glorify your name** - Here the word "name" is a metonym that refers to God. AT: "make your glory known" or "reveal your glory" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **a voice came from heaven** - This refers to the voice of God, which some people thought was thunder or the voice of an angel. AT: "Then God spoke from heaven" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
