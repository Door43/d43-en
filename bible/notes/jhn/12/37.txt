\v 37 Although Jesus had done many miracles, most of the people did not believe what he had told them.
\v 38 This was to make come true what Isaiah the prophet had written long ago:
\q "Lord, who has believed anything that they have heard from us?
\q The Lord has shown us how he can powerfully rescue us!"
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 37 Although Jesus had done so many signs before them, yet they did not believe in him
\v 38 so that the word of Isaiah the prophet would be fulfilled, in which he said:
\q "Lord, who has believed our report,
\q and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This is a break in the main storyline as the John begins to explain about the fulfillment of prophesies that had been spoken by the prophet Isaiah.

  * **so that the word of Isaiah the prophet would be fulfilled** - You can translate this in an active form. AT: "in order to fulfill the message of Isaiah the prophet" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **Lord, who has believed our report, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?** - This appears in the form of two rhetorical questions to express the prophet's dismay that the people do not believe his message.They may be stated as a single rhetorical question, AT: "Lord, hardly anyone has believed our message, even though they have seen that you are powerfully able to save them!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **the arm of the Lord** - This is a metonym that refers to the Lord's ability to rescue with power. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
