\v 37 Although Jesus had done many miracles, most of the people did not believe what he had told them.
\v 38 This was to make come true what Isaiah the prophet had written long ago:
\q "Lord, who has believed anything that they have heard from us?
\q The Lord has shown us how he can powerfully rescue us!"
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 37 Although Jesus had done so many signs in front of them, yet they did not believe in him
\v 38 so that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he said:
\q "Lord, who has believed our report?
\q And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"
