<usfm>
\v 41 Isaiah wrote that because \add it was as though\add* he saw \add ahead of time\add* how great Jesus would be, and he prophesied \add those things\add* about him.
\p
\v 42 Although most of the Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* did not believe that Jesus is \add the Messiah\f + \ft Or: from God\add* \f*, some of them believed in him. But they would not tell anyone that they believed in him, because \add they were afraid that if they said that\add*, the Pharisees would not let them worship in the synagogues.
\v 43 They wanted people to praise them more than they wanted God to praise them.

\v 41 Isaiah wrote those words long ago because he understood that Christ would serve God powerfully.
\p
\v 42 Although this was true, many of the leaders of the Jewish people put their trust in Jesus. Nevertheless, they greatly feared that the Pharisees would ban them from the synagogues, so they did not speak out about trusting in Jesus.
\v 43 They preferred that other people praise and respect them rather than that God would praise them.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 41 Isaiah said these things because he saw Jesus' glory and spoke of him.
\v 42 Nevertheless, even many of the rulers believed in Jesus; but because of the Pharisees, they did not admit it so that they would not be banned from the synagogue.
\v 43 They loved the praise that comes from people more than the praise that comes from God.
