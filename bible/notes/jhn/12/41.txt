\v 41 Isaiah wrote those words because he saw Christ in his work, long ago, shining brilliantly, before Jesus was born, and he wrote those wonderful descriptions of him.
\p
\v 42 Many of the leaders of the Jewish people put their trust in Jesus, yet, they greatly feared that the Pharisees would put them out of the synagogues. So they did not speak out about their faith.
