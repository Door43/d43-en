But they would not tell anyone that they believed in him, because \add they were afraid that if they said that\add*, the Pharisees would not let them worship in the synagogues.

\v 41 Isaiah wrote those words long ago because he understood that Christ would serve God powerfully.
\p
\v 42 Although this was true, many of the leaders of the Jewish people put their trust in Jesus. Nevertheless, they greatly feared that the Pharisees would ban them the synagogues, so they did not speak out about trusting in Jesus.
\v 43 They preferred that other people praise and respect them rather than that God would praise them.

\v 41 Isaiah said these things because he saw Jesus' glory and spoke of him.
\v 42 Nevertheless, even many of the rulers believed in Jesus; but because of the Pharisees, they did not admit it so that they would not be banned from the synagogue.
\v 43 They loved the praise that comes from people more than the praise that comes from God.
