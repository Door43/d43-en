\v 4 But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, \f + \ft Or: Judas, the man from Kerioth village \f* objected. He was the one who later enabled Jesus' enemies to seize him.
\v 5 He said, "We should have sold this perfume and given \add the money\add* to poor people!\f + \ft Or: Why did \add we\add* not sell this perfume and give \add the money for it\add* to the poor people? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* We could have gotten three hundred days' wages for it!"
\v 6 He said that, not because he cared about the poor people, but instead, because he was a thief. He was the one who kept the bag \add of funds that people gave to help Jesus and us his disciples\add*, and he often stole some of the money that was \f + \ft Or:that \add people\add* \f* put into it.

\v 4 However, one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, (he was the one who broke the trust Jesus had in him, and soon he would give Jesus up to his enemies)—he objected and said,
\v 5 "We should have sold this perfume for three hundred days' wages and given the money to the poor."
\v 6 He said this, not because he cared about the poor people, but because he was a thief. He kept charge of the bag that held their money, but he would take money for his own use whenever he wanted.

\v 4 Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, the one who would betray him, said,
\v 5 "Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?"
\v 6 Now he said this, not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief. He had the moneybag and would steal from what was put in it.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the one who would betray him** - "the one who later enabled Jesus' enemies to seize him"
  * **Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?** - This is a rhetorical question. You can translate it as a strong statement. AT: "This perfume could have been sold for three hundred denarii and the money could have been given to the poor!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **three hundred denarii** - You can translate this as a numeral. AT: "300 denarii" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **denarii** - A denarius was the amount of silver that a common laborer could earn in one day of work. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bmoney]])
  * **Now he said this ... would steal from what was put in it** - John explains why Judas asked the question about the poor. If your language has a way of indicating background information, you can use it here. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **he said this, not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief** - "he said this because he was a thief. He did not care about the poor"
