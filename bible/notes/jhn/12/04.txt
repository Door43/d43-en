\v 4 But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, (he was the one who broke the trust Jesus had in him, and soon he would give Jesus up to his enemies)—he objected and said,
\v 5 "We should have sold this perfume for three hundred days' wages and given the money to the poor."
\v 6 He said this, not because he cared about the poor people, but because he was a thief. He kept charge of the bag that held their money, but he would take money for his own use whenever he wanted.

\v 4 But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, the one who would betray Jesus, said,
\v 5 "Why was not this perfume sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?"
\v 6 Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief: he had charge of the moneybag and would take some of what was in it for himself.
