====== John 12:48-50 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 48 There is something that will judge those who reject me and do not accept my message. On the judgment day \add God\add* will condemn them\add because they rejected\add* the message that I have told them.
\v 49 I have not said things from my own \add authority\add*. Instead, \add my\add* Father, the one who sent me, instructed me what to say and how I should say it.
\v 50 I know that \add paying attention to\add* what he has instructed us \add leads to\add* eternal life. So whatever I say is exactly \f + \ft Or: only \f* what \add my\add* Father has told me to say."

\v 48 Yet, there is something that will condemn those who reject me and do not follow my message. They are condemned by the message I have spoken to them.
\v 49 When I taught about God, I was not merely saying what I thought. The Father, who sent me, gave me clear instructions on what I should say and how I should say it.
\v 50 I know that the Father's most important instructions are the ones that teach people how to live forever, and I have said exactly what my Father has told me to say."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 48 The one who rejects me and who does not receive my words has one who judges him: it is the word that I have spoken which will judge him on the last day.
\v 49 For I did not speak of my own accord. Instead, it is the Father who sent me, who has given me the command about what I should say and what I should speak.
\v 50 I know that his command is life everlasting; so that thing that I say—just as the Father has said them to me, so I say to them."
