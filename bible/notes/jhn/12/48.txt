\v 49 I have not said things from my own \add authority\add*. Instead, \add my\add* Father, the one who sent me, instructed me what to say and how I should say it.
\v 50 I know that \add paying attention to\add* what he has instructed us \add leads to\add* eternal life. So whatever I say is exactly \f + \ft Or: only \f* what \add my\add* Father has told me to say."

<usfm>
\v 48 He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my sayings, has one that judges him: the word that I spake, the same shall
judge him in the last day.
\v 49 For I spoke not from myself; but the Father that sent me, he has given me a commandment, what I should say, and what I
should speak.
\v 50 And I know that his commandment is life eternal; the things therefore which I speak, even as the Father has said to
me, so I speak.
