===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 48 There is something that will judge those who reject me and do not accept my message. On the judgment day \add God\add* will condemn them\add because they rejected\add* the message that I have told them.
\v 49 I have not said things from my own \add authority\add*. Instead, \add my\add* Father, the one who sent me, instructed me what to say and how I should say it.
\v 50 I know that \add paying attention to\add* what he has instructed us \add leads to\add* eternal life. So whatever I say is exactly \f + \ft Or: only \f* what \add my\add* Father has told me to say."

\v 48 But there is something that will condemn those who rejecs me and do not follow my message. That thing is the message I have spoken to them.
\v 49 When I have taught about God, I was not merely saying what I think. The Father, who sent me, gave me clear instructions on what I should say and how I should say it.
\v 50 I know that his most important instructions are the ones that teach people how to live forever. And I have said exactly what my Father has told me to say."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 48 The one who rejects me and who does receive my words has one who judges him: it is the word that I have spoken which will judge him on the last day.
\v 49 For I did not speak of my own accord. Instead, it is the Father who sent me, who has given me the command about what I should say, and what I should speak.
\v 50 I know that his command is life everlasting; so that thing that I say—just as the Father has said them to me, so I say them."
