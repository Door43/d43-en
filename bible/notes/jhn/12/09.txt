\v 9 A large crowd of Jews in Jerusalem heard that Jesus was in Bethany, so they went there. They came not only because Jesus was there, but also to see Lazarus, whom Jesus had made alive.
\v 10 Then the chief priests decided it was necessary to put Lazarus to death, as well,
\v 11 for it was because of him that many of the Jews were no longer believing in what they were teaching; instead, they were putting their trust in Jesus.

\v 9 Now  large crowd of the Jews learned that Jesus was there, and they came, not for Jesus’ sake only, but so that they
might also see Lazarus, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.
\v 10 But the chief priests took counsel so that they might put Lazarus also to death;
\v 11 for it was because of him that many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.
