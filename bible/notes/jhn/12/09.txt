\v 9 A large crowd of Jews in Jerusalem heard that Jesus was in Bethany, so they went there. They came not only because Jesus was there, but also to see Lazarus, whom Jesus had made alive.
\v 10 Then the chief priests decided it was necessary to put Lazarus to death, as well,
\v 11 for it was because of him that many of the Jews were no longer believing in what the chief priests were teaching; instead, they were putting their trust in Jesus.

\v 9 Now a large crowd of the Jews learned that Jesus was there, and they came, not only for Jesus, but also so to see Lazarus, whom Jesus had raised from the dead ones.
\v 10 The chief priests conspired together so that they might also put Lazarus to death;
\v 11 for it was because of him that many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus.
