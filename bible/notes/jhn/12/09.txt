\v 9 A large crowd of Jews in Jerusalem heard that Jesus was in Bethany, so they went there. They came not only because Jesus was there, but also to see Lazarus, whom Jesus had made alive.
\v 10 Then the chief priests decided it was necessary to put Lazarus to death, as well,
\v 11 for it was because of him that many of the Jews were no longer believing in what the chief priests were teaching; instead, they were putting their trust in Jesus.

\v 9 Now a large crowd of the Jews learned that Jesus was there, and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but so that they might also see Lazarus, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.
\v 10 The chief priests conspired together so that they might also put Lazarus to death;
\v 11 for it was because of him that many of the Jews went away and believed on Jesus.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus was at dinner in Bethany.

  * **Now**  - This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Here John tells about a new group of people in the story.
  * **because of him**  - The fact that Lazarus was alive caused many Jews to believe in Jesus.
