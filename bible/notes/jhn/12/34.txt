\v 34 \add Someone in\add* the crowd answered him, "We understand from the Scriptures that the Messiah will live forever. So why do you say that the one who came from heaven, \add who is the Messiah\add*, will be lifted up \f + \ft Or:that \add men\add* will lift up the one who came from heaven, \add who is the Messiah\add*, \f* on a cross? What kind of man who came from heaven are you\add talking about\add*? \f + \ft Or: That's not the \add kind\add* of Messiah \add we are expecting\add*! \f*"
\v 35 Then Jesus said to them, "\add My message is like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a light for you. \add I\add* will be with you for only a little while longer. Live and act \add as you should\add* while I am still with you\add , because suddenly you will have no more opportunity to hear my message! You do not want to be like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add someone\add* who cannot see where he is going anymore\add when it suddenly\add* becomes dark!
\v 36 Believe in my message \f + \ft metaphor \f* while you still have an opportunity to do it, in order that you may become people who have my truth \f + \ft metaphor \f* within you!"


\p After he said those things, Jesus left them and hid from them.

\v 34 Someone in the crowd answered him, "We understand from the Scriptures that the Messiah will live forever. So why do you say that the Son of Man will die? Who is this 'Son of Man'?"
\v 35 Jesus answered, "My light will shine on you for just a little longer. Walk in the light while you have my light, or the darkness will overtake you. Those who walk in the darkness cannot see where they are going!
\v 36 Trust in that light while you have the light; then you will belong to the light.


\p After he said those things, Jesus left them and hid from them.

\v 34 The crowd answered him, "We have heard from the Law that the Christ will forever. How can you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this Son of Man?"
\v 35 Jesus then said to them, "Yet a little while longer is the light among you. Walk while you have the light, so that darkness does not overtake you. He who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.
\v 36 While you have the light, believe in the light so that you may become sons of light."
\p Jesus said these things and then departed and hid from them.

I will not be with you much longer. You need to follow my instructions while I am still with you. If you reject my words, it will be as if darkness suddenly falls on you and you can't see where you are going.'"
