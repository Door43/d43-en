===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He who loves his life will lose it; but he who hates his life in this world will keep it for everlasting life** - Here "loves his life" means to consider one's own physical life to be more valuable than the lives of others. The one who "hates his life" refers to one who loves his own life less than he loves the lives of others. AT: "whoever values his own life more than others will not receive eternal life, but whoever considers the lives of others as more important than his own life will live with God forever." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **and where I am, there will my servant be also** - Jesus implies that those who serve him will be with him in heaven. AT: "and when I am in heaven, my servant will also be there with me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the Father will honor him** - Here "Father" is an important title for God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
