====== John 04:43-45 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 43-44 Jesus had said \add previously\add* that people did not honor prophets \add like himself when they tried to teach people\add* in their own home area. So, two days later, Jesus and \add we\add* disciples left that area and went to \add his own area in\add* Galilee \add district, because he knew that people there would not think very highly of him, and as a result the Jewish leaders would not be jealous\add*.
\v 45 However, when we arrived in Galilee \add district, many\add* of the people there welcomed him, because they had been in Jerusalem during the \add Passover\add* celebration and had seen all the things he did there.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 43 After those two days in Samaria, Jesus and his disciples left and went to the region of Galilee.
\v 44 (Jesus himself confirmed that a prophet receives honor in many places but never in the place where he grew up.)
\v 45 However, when he arrived in Galilee, many of the people there welcomed him. They knew who he was because they saw all the things he had done in Jerusalem during the recent Passover Festival that was held there.

===== ULB: =====

\p
\v 43 After those two days, he departed from there for Galilee.
\v 44 For Jesus himself declared that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
\v 45 When he came into Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all the things that he had done in Jerusalem at the
festival, for they also had gone to the festival.
