===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 43-44 Jesus had said \add previously\add* that people did not honor prophets \add like himself when they tried to teach people\add* in their own home area. So, two days later, Jesus and \add we\add* disciples left that area and went to \add his own area in\add* Galilee \add district, because he knew that people there would not think very highly of him, and as a result the Jewish leaders would not be jealous\add*.
\v 45 However, when we arrived in Galilee \add district, many\add* of the people there welcomed him, because they had been in Jerusalem during the \add Passover\add* celebration and had seen all the things he did there.

\v 43 After those two days in Samaria, he left and traveled to Galilee.
\v 44 (Jesus himself had stated it was true and with a solemn oath that 'a prophet has honored in many places, but it is always true that a prophet never has honor in the place where he grew up.')
\v 45 However, when he arrived in Galilee, many of the people there welcomed him, because they had recently  gone to Jerusalem for the Passover celebration, and when they were there, they saw all the things Jesus had done.

\v 43 And after the two days he went forth from thence into Galilee.
\v 44 For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
\v 45 So when he came into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the
feast: for they also went to the feast.
