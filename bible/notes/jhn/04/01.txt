<usfm>
\v 1-2 \add At that time, many people were asking\add* Jesus to baptize them. He did not baptize people; it was \add we\add* his disciples who were doing the baptizing. But when some of the Pharisee \add religious group\add* heard \add people say that\add* Jesus was making more disciples than John \add the Baptizer\add* and was baptizing them, \add they became very jealous\add*.
\v 3 When the Lord \add Jesus\add* heard about that, \add so that the Pharisees would not cause trouble for him\add*, he left Judea \add district\add*, and went again \add with us disciples\add* to Galilee district.

<usfm>
\v 1 Jesus got a report about the Pharisees. They found out that Jesus was gaining more followers than John the Baptizer and that he was baptizing more people than John was.
\v 2 But Jesus himself was not personally doing the work of baptizing; his disciples were doing that.
\v 3 So Jesus and his disciples left the region of Judea and returned once more to Galilee.

\p
\v 1 Now when Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard that he was making and baptizing more disciples than John
\v 2 (although Jesus himself was not baptizing, but his disciples were),
\v 3 he left Judea and departed for Galilee.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Now when Jesus knew** - Here the word "now" is used to mark a change of topic in the story; the story changes from John the Baptist's words in the previous verses to Jesus' actions here.   
  * **Jesus himself was not baptizing** - "It was not actually Jesus who was baptizing people." The word "himself" is added to emphasize Jesus. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_rpronouns]])
