\v 38 I am sending you \add to enable people to accept my message, but you will not be the first ones who tell them God's message\add*. Others \add previously\add* worked hard \add to tell people God's message\add*, and now you will be harvesting the results of their work."

<usfm>
\v 37 This statement is true: one person plants the seeds, and another person harvests the crops.
\v 38 I sent you to gather the harvest from a crop you did not plant. Others have worked very hard, but you are now joining in their work."

\v 37 For in this is the saying true, 'One sows, and another harvests.'

  * [[:en:obe:kt:true]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:harvest]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:labor]] 

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues speaking to his disciples.

  * **One sows, and another harvests** - The words "sows" and "harvests" are metaphors. The one who "sows" shares the message of Jesus. The one who "harvests" helps the people to receive the message of Jesus. AT: "One person plants the seeds, and another person harvests the crops." (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you yourselves have entered into their labor** - The reflexive pronoun "yourselves" emphasizes the word "you." Translate this in the way that your language emphasizes a person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_rpronouns]])
