===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Come, see a man who told me everything that I have ever done** - The Samaritan woman exaggerates to show that she is impressed by how much Jesus knows about her. AT: "Come see a man who knows very much about me, even though I have never met him before!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **This could not be the Christ, could it?** - The woman is not sure that Jesus is the Christ, so she asks a question that expects "no" for an answer, but she also asks a question instead of making a statement because she wants the people to decide for themselves.
