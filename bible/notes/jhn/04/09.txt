\v 9 Then the Samaritan woman said to him, "How is it that you, a Jew, are asking me, a Samaritan woman, for something to drink?" For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.
\v 10 Jesus answered her, "If you had known the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, 'Give me a drink,' you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water."
