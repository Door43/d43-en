\v 34 Jesus said to us, "Doing what \add my Father\add* who sent me wants \add me to do\add* and finishing the work he \add gave me to do\add* is \add what sustains me\f + \ft Or: like\add* my food \f* \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 35 \add At this time of the year\add* you are saying \f + \ft Or: your ancestors used to say \f*, 'There are four months left before we harvest \add the crops\add*.' But I say to you, look carefully \add at the non-Jewish people around here. God says, 'They are ready to accept my message\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add like crops in\add* fields that are ready for people to harvest.
\v 36 \add If you enable them to accept my message\add*, I will reward you \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add as an owner of a field\add* pays those who harvest the crops. Because of your work, people will gain eternal life.' \add I have been telling people God's message. That is like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a man who plants seeds. \add You will help people to accept my message. That will be like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* harvesting crops. \add When that happens\add*, both you and I will rejoice.

\v 34 Jesus said, "I will tell what I am most hungry for: it is to do what my Father who sent me wants and to complete all his work."
\v 35 At this time of the year you usually say, ‘There are four months left, and then we will harvest the crops.’ But look! All around you, the fields are ready for harvest at this moment. The non-Jews are now wanting God to rule over them; it is like the fields are now ready to be harvested.
\v 36 The one who believes this and is ready to work in kind of harvest, is already receiving his payment and is gathering much fruit for eternal life. Those who sow the seed and those who reap the harvest will be glad together.

\v 34 Jesus said to them, "My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to complete his work.
\v 35 Do you not say, 'There are yet four months and then the harvest will come.'  I am saying to you, look up
and see the fields, for they are already ripe for harvest!
\v 36 He who is harvesting receives wages and gathers fruit for everlasting life, so that he who sows and he who harvests may
rejoice together.
