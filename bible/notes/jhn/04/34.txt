<usfm>
\v 34 Jesus said to us, "Doing what \add my Father\add* who sent me wants \add me to do\add* and finishing the work he \add gave me to do\add* is \add what sustains me\f + \ft Or: like\add* my food \f* \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 35 \add At this time of the year\add* you are saying \f + \ft Or: your ancestors used to say \f*, 'There are four months left before we harvest \add the crops\add*.' But I say to you, look carefully \add at the non-Jewish people around here. God says, 'They are ready to accept my message\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add like crops in\add* fields that are ready for people to harvest.
\v 36 \add If you enable them to accept my message\add*, I will reward you \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add as an owner of a field\add* pays those who harvest the crops. Because of your work, people will gain eternal life.' \add I have been telling people God's message. That is like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a man who plants seeds. \add You will help people to accept my message. That will be like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* harvesting crops. \add When that happens\add*, both you and I will rejoice.

\v 34 Jesus said, "I will tell what I am most hungry for: It is to do what my Father who sent me wants and to complete all his work.
\v 35 At this time of the year you usually say, 'There are four months left, and then we will harvest the crops.' Yet look all around you! The fields are ready for harvest at this moment. The non-Jews are now wanting God to rule over them; they are like the fields that are now ready to be harvested.
\v 36 The one who believes this and is ready to work in this kind of harvest is already receiving his payment and is gathering much fruit for eternal life. Those who sow the seed and those who reap the harvest will be glad together.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 34 Jesus said to them, "My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to complete his work.
\v 35 Do you not say, 'There are four more months and then the harvest comes'? I am saying to you, look up and see the fields, for they are already ripe for harvest!
\v 36 He who is harvesting receives wages and gathers fruit for everlasting life, so that he who sows and he who harvests may rejoice together.

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to complete his work** - Here "food" is a metaphor that represents "obeying God's will." AT: "Just as food satisfies a hungry person, obeying God's will is what satisfies me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Do you not say** - "Is this not one of your popular sayings"
  * **look up and see the fields, for they are already ripe for harvest** - The words "fields" and "ripe for harvest" are metaphors. The "fields" represent the non-Jewish people or Gentiles. The words "ripe for harvest" mean that the Gentiles are ready to receive the message of Jesus, just as fields are ready to be harvested. AT: "look up and see these non-Jewish people! They are ready to accept my message, just like crops in the fields are ready for people to harvest them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **He who is harvesting receives wages and gathers fruit for everlasting life** - Jesus indicates that there is a reward for those "work in his fields" and share his message. The ones who receive his message will also receive the eternal life that God offers.
