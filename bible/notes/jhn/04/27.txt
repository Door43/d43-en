\v 27 Just then \add we\add* disciples returned \add from town\add*. \add Since it was contrary to our custom for Jewish religious teachers to converse with a woman they did not know\add*, we were surprised that he was talking to a woman. However, none of us asked her, "What do you want?" and none of us asked him, "Why are you talking with her?"

\v 27 Just then, the disciples came back from town. They were amazed that Jesus was talking with a woman who was not a member of his family. (That was against the Jewish custom.) Nevertheless, no one was brave enough to ask him, "What were you doing talking to a woman by yourself?" or "Why are you talking with her at all?"

\v 27 At that very moment his disciples returned.  Now they were wondering why he was speaking with a woman, yet no one said, "What do you want?" or "Why are you speaking with her?"
