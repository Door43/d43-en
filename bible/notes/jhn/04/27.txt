\v 27 Just then \add we\add* disciples returned \add from town\add*. \add Since it was contrary to our custom for Jewish religious teachers to converse with a woman they did not know\add*, we were surprised that he was talking to a woman. However, none of us asked her, "What do you want?" and none of us asked him, "Why are you talking with her?"

\v 27 Just then, the disciples came back from town. They were amazed that Jesus was talking with a woman who was not a member of his family. (That was against the Jewish custom.) Nevertheless, no one was brave enough to ask him, "What were you doing talking to a woman by yourself?" or "Why are you talking with her at all?"

\v 27 At that moment his disciples returned. Now they were wondering why he was speaking with a woman, but no one said, "What do you want?" or "Why are you speaking with her?"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **At that moment his disciples returned** - "Just as Jesus was saying this, his disciples returned from town" 
  * **Now they were wondering why he was speaking with a woman** - It was very unusual for a Jew to speak with a woman he did not know, especially if that woman was a Samaritan.
  * **no one said, "What ... want?" or "Why ... her?"** - Possible meanings are 1) the disciples asked both questions to Jesus or 2) "no one asked the woman, 'What ... want?' or asked Jesus, 'Why ... her?'"
