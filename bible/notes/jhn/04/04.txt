===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **it was necessary for him to pass through Samaria** - Jews usually went around Samaria to avoid it, so if your language has a way to show that Jesus was going against what people would expect, use it.
    * **he came to a town** - "he" refers to Jesus.
    * **plot of ground** - "piece of land"
    * **Sychar** - (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
