\v 11 She \add thought he was talking about\add* ordinary \add water. So she\add* said to him, "Sir, you do not have a bucket \add or a rope with which to get water from the well\add*, and the well is deep. So\add since you cannot get water from this well\add*, where can you get that life-giving water?
\v 12 Our ancestor Jacob left us this well. He drank water from it, and there was \add enough good water\add* so that his sons and his flocks \add of sheep\add* and goats drank from it also. \add Do you claim that\add* you are greater than Jacob, \add and because of that you can give us life-giving water\add*?"

\v 11 "Sir, you do not have a bucket or a rope with which to draw the water up out of the well, and this well is deep. Where would you get this living water?
\v 12 You cannot be greater than our father Jacob. He dug this well that we use today, and he drank from it himself, as did his children and his animals."
