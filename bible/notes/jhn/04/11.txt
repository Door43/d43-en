\v 11 She \add thought he was talking about\add* ordinary \add water. So she\add* said to him, "Sir, you do not have a bucket \add or a rope with which to get water from the well\add*, and the well is deep. So\add since you cannot get water from this well\add*, where can you get that life-giving water?
\v 12 Our ancestor Jacob left us this well. He drank water from it, and there was \add enough good water\add* so that his sons and his flocks \add of sheep\add* and goats drank from it also. \add Do you claim that\add* you are greater than Jacob, \add and because of that you can give us life-giving water\add*?"

\v 12 You cannot be greater than our father Jacob. He dug this well that we use today, and he drank from it himself, as did his children and his animals."
