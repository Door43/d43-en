====== John 15:23-25 ======

<usfm>
\v 23 All those who hate me, \add it is as though\add* they hate my Father as well.
\v 24 If I had not done among them the \add miracles\add* that no one else ever did, they would not be guilty of the sin \add of rejecting me\add*. But now, \add although\add* they have seen \add those miracles\add*, they have hated both me and my Father.
\v 25 But this has happened in order that these words that have been written in their Scriptures might be fulfilled \f + \ft Or:to fulfill this that \add someone\f + \ft Or: the Psalmist\add* \f* wrote in their Scriptures \f*: 'They hated me for no reason.'

<usfm>
\v 23 Whoever hates me also hates my Father.
\v 24 If I had not done those things among them, those things in which I showed my power, things that no one else has ever done, they would not have been guilty of sin. Yet now that they have seen me, they hate me, and they hate my Father, too.
\v 25 These words were written in their law and have now come true: 'They hated me for no reason.'

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 23 He who hates me hates my Father also.
\v 24 If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not have had sin; but now they have both seen and hated me and my Father.
\v 25 This is happening so that the word may be fulfilled that is written in their law: ‘They hated me without a cause.’
