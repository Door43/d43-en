====== John 15:3-4 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 You are already \add like\add* the branches \add that a gardener\add* trims because \add you have believed\add* the message that I have told you.
\v 4 Remain having a close relationship with me. \add If you do that\add*, I will remain having a close relationship with you. A branch \add of a vine\add* cannot bear fruit \add if it is cut off and left\add* by itself. To bear fruit, it must remain attached to the vine. Similarly, you cannot \add live the way that God wants you to\add* if you do not remain united to me \f + \ft metaphor \f*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 You are already pure because of the message I spoke to you.
\v 4 If you remain joined to me, and I will remain joined to you. As the branch cannot bear any fruit on its own, neither can you unless you stay joined to me and depend upon me for everything.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Already you are clean because of the message that I have spoken to you.
\v 4 Remain in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you, unless you remain in me.
