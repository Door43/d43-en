===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues speaking to the disciples.

  * **I am the true vine** - Jesus compares himself to a vine or a vine stem. He means that he is the source of life that causes people to live in a way that pleases God. AT: "I am like a trustworthy vine that will produce good fruit" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and my Father is the vine grower** -  A "vine grower" is a person who takes care of the vine to ensure it is as fruitful as possible. God the Father takes care of Jesus and makes sure those who follow him live in a pleasing manner. AT: "my Father is like a gardener" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **He takes away every branch in me that bears no fruit, and he cleans every branch that bears fruit so that it may bear more fruit.** - People are like the branches connected to the vine. God cares for them so that those who belong to Jesus will be able to live in a way that is pleasing to him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **takes away** - Most version understand this to mean "cut off and take away" (UDB). There is also a minority view that it means to lift of the branches from the ground so they will begin to produce fruit. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
