====== John 15:18-19 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 "The people who are opposed to God will hate you. When that happens, remember that they hated me first.
\v 19 If you belonged to those who are opposed to God \f + \ft metonymy \f*, they would love \add you like they love\add* those who belong to them. But you do not belong to those who are opposed to God \f + \ft metonymy \f*. Instead, I chose you so that you would separate yourselves from \f + \ft metonymy \f* them. That is why those who are opposed to God \f + \ft metonymy \f* hate you.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 If the world despises you, you should realize that it hated me first.
\v 19 If you belonged to the unbelievers in this world, the world would love you, and you would love what they love and do what they do. But you do not belong to them; instead, I chose you to come out from among them. That is the reason the unbelievers in this world despise you.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you.
\v 19 If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world and because I chose you out of the world, for this reason the world hates you.
