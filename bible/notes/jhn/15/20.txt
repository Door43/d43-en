====== John 15:20-22 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 Remember these words that I told you: 'No servant is greater than his master.' \add That means that you, who are like my servants, cannot expect people to treat you better than they treat me\add*. So, since they have persecuted me\f + \ft Or: caused me to suffer \f*, they will persecute you\f + \ft Or: cause you to suffer \f* also. If they had paid attention to the things I taught them, they would pay attention to what you teach them.
\v 21 They will treat you like that because you \add belong to\add* me \f + \ft metonymy \f*, and because they do not know the one who sent me.
\v 22 If I had not come and spoken \add God's message\add* to them, they would not be guilty \add of rejecting me and my message\add*. But now \add I have come and told them God's message, so\add* they will have no excuse \add when God judges them\add* for their sin.

\v 20 Remember when I taught you this: 'A servant is not greater than his master.' Since they have made me suffer, you can be sure they will make you suffer also. If any of them have received my teachings and followed them, they will also follow what you teach them.
\v 21 The unbelievers in this world will do horrible things to you because you represent me and because they do not know my Father, who has sent me to you.
\v 22 If I had not come and spoken God's message to them, they would not have been guilty of rejecting me and my message. However, now I have come and told them God's message, and they have no excuse for their sin.

<usfm>
\v 20 Remember the word that I said to you, 'A servant is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they kept my word, they will also keep yours.
\v 21 They will do all these things to you because of my name because they do not know him who sent me.
\v 22 If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin.
