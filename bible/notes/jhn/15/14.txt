===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 You \add show that you\add* are my friends if you keep doing what I have commanded you.
\v 15 I will no longer call you my servants, because servants do not know \add why\add* their masters \add want them to\add* do things. Instead, I have said that you are my friends, because I, \add acting like a friend\add*, have revealed to you everything that my Father told me.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 You are my friends if you not only listen to my commands but also live by them.
\v 15 I no longer call you my servants, for the servant does not understand what his master is doing. I now call you friends, for everything I heard from my Father I made it all known to you so that you also could understand it.
