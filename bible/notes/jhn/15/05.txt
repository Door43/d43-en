\v 5 I am \add like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a vine. You are \add like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* the branches. All those who have a close relationship with me and with whom I have a close relationship will \add do much that pleases God, like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add a vine that\add* bears much fruit. \add Remember that\add* you can do nothing \f + \ft hyperbole \f* \add that truly pleases God\add* without my \add help\add*.
\v 6 \add A gardener cuts off and\add* throws away useless branches. Then, after they dry up, \add he\add* picks them up and throws them into a fire and burns them \f + \ft simile \f*. Similarly, everyone who does not remain having a close relationship with me, \add God\add* will get rid of.
\v 7 If you remain having a close relationship with me and you keep \add living in accordance with\add* my message, you can ask \add God to do\add* anything for you, and he will do it.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain joined to me and I remain joined to my Father, you will  bear much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing at all.
\v 6 Everyone who does not stay joined to me and draw his life from me, will be thrown away like a dead branch. Those branches are gathered together and thrown into the fire and burned.
\v 7 If you stay joined to me and live by my message, you can ask God for anything, and he will do it.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 I am the vine; you are the branches. He who remains in me and I in him, this same person bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.
\v 6 If anyone does not remain in me, he is thrown away like a branch and dries up; people gather the branches and throw them into the fire, and they are burned up.
\v 7 If you remain in me, and if my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done to you.
