====== John 15 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

== Vine ==
The vine is an important image in scripture. This chapter forms a complex and extended metaphor. The various aspects of this image and how it is used will cause translation issues in any culture. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "I am..." ==

John uses this phrase seven times in his gospel. It is the same words used by God, when he revealed himself and his name at the burning bush. The name "Yahweh" can be translated as "I am." (See: [[:en:obe:kt:reveal|Revealed]])
