\v 17 Jesus said to him a third time, "John's son Simon, am I really dear to you \f + \ft Or: do you really love me \f*?" Peter was grieved because Jesus asked him this three times, \add and because the third time he changed the question\add*. He said, "Lord, you know everything. You know that you are dear to me \f + \ft Or: that I love you \f*." Jesus said, "Give to \add those who belong to\add* me \add what they need spiritually, as\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add a shepherd provides\add* food for \add his\add* sheep.
\v 18 Now listen to this carefully: When you were young, you put your clothes on by yourself, and you went wherever you wanted to go. But when you are old, you will stretch out your arms, and someone will fasten them \add with a rope\add* and will lead you to a place where you do not want to \add go\add*."

\v 17 Jesus said to him a third time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?” Peter was grieved because Jesus asked him three times, "Do you love me?"  Peter said, “Lord, you know everything. You know that I love you.” Jesus said, “Feed my sheep."
\v 18 I am telling you the truth: when you were young, you put your own clothes on and you walked about wherever you wanted to go. However, when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone will dress you and will lead you where you do not want to go."

\v 17 He said to him a third time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” Peter was sad because Jesus had said to him a third time, “Do you love me?” He said to him, “Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.” Jesus said to him, “Feed my sheep.
\v 18 Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to clothe yourself and walk wherever you wished; but when you become old, you will stretch out your hands, and another person will clothe you and carry you where you will not wish to go.”
