\v 6 He said to us, "Throw your net out from the right-hand side of the boat! Then you will find some!" We did that, and we caught so many fish \add in the net\add* that we were unable to pull the net into \add the boat\add*!

\v 4 In the morning as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.
\v 5 Jesus said to them, "My friends, do you have any fish?" They said, "No."
\v 6 He said to them, "Throw your net out off the right side of the boat and you will find some."  They cast it as he told them, and they caught so many fish in the net that they were unable to pull the net into the boat!

\v 4 When day was breaking, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not know it was Jesus.
\v 5 Jesus then said to them, "Young men, do you have anything to eat?" They answered him, "No."
\v 6 He said to them, "Cast your net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some." So they cast their net, but they were not able to draw it in because of the quantity of fish.
