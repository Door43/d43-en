\v 4 When day was breaking, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not know it was Jesus.
\v 5 Jesus then said to them, “Young men, do you have anything to eat?” They answered him, “No.”
\v 6 He said to them, “Cast your net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.” So they cast their net, but they were not able to draw it in because of the quantity of fish.
