\v 7 \add But I knew that it was Jesus\add*, \add so\add* I said to Peter, "It is the Lord!" Peter had taken off his cloak \add while he was working\add*, but as soon as he heard \add me say\add* "It is the Lord!" he wrapped his cloak around himself and jumped into the water \add and swam to shore\add*.
\v 8 The rest of us came \add to the shore\add* in the boat, pulling the net full of fish. We were not far from shore, only about a hundred yards\f + \ft Or: meters \f*.
\v 9 When \add we\add* got to the shore, we saw that there was a fire of burning coals there, with a \add large\add* fish on the fire, and \add some\add* buns.

\v 7 John, the disciple whom Jesus especially loved, said to Peter, "It is the Lord!" When Simon Peter heard him say this, he tucked up his outer garment around himself (he had worn almost nothing while working), and jumped into the water.
\v 8 The other disciples came to shore in the boat, pulling behind the net full of fish. They were not far from shore, only about ninety meters away.
\v 9 When they got to shore, they saw a charcoal fire ready and hot, with fish cooking on it, and there was some bread.

\v 7 Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the Lord." When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he tucked up his outer garment about himself (for he had been very lightly clothed), and threw himself into the sea.
\v 8 The other disciples came in the boat (for they were not far from the land, about two hundred cubits off), and they were pulling the net full of fish.
\v 9 When they got out upon the land, they saw a fire of charcoal there and fish laid on it, with bread.
