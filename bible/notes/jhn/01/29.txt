\v 29 The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him. He said to the people, "Look! The Lamb of God, who will give his life as a sacrifice to take away the sins of the world.
\v 30 He is the one of whom I said, 'Someone will come after me who is more important than I am, because he existed long before me.'
\v 31 I did not know him at first. But now I know who he is. My work was to come and baptize with water those who were sorry and turned from their sins. I want the  people of Israel to know who he is."

\v 29 The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, "Look, there is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!
\v 30 This is the one of whom I said, 'There is one coming after me who is really before me, for he was before me.'
\v 31 And I did not recognize him, but it so that he could be revealed to Israel, that I  came baptizing with water."
