Here is the \add man whom\add* God \add has appointed to be a sacrifice\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add like\add* the lambs \add that the people of Israel sacrificed! By sacrificing himself\add* he will \add make it possible for everyone in\add* the world to be no longer \add guilty for having\add* sinned.
\v 30 He is the one about whom I said \add before\add*, 'Someone will come later who is more important than I am, since he existed \add long\add* before me.'
\v 31 I myself did not \add previously\add* recognize that he \add was the Messiah\add*. But \add now I know who he is\add*, and I have baptized people with water to enable \add you people of\add* Israel to recognize who he is."

\v 29 The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him. He said to the people, "Look! The Lamb of God, who will give his life as a sacrifice to take away the sins of the world.
\v 30 He is the one of whom I said, 'Someone will come after me who is more important than I am, because he existed long before me, eternal ages, before I was born.'
\v 31 I did not know him at first, but now I know who he is. My work was to come and baptize with water those who were sorry and turned from their sins. I want the people of Israel to know who he is."

\v 29 The next day John saw Jesus coming to him and said, "Look, there is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!
\v 30 This is the one of whom I said, 'The one who comes after me ranks before me, for he was before me.'
\v 31 I did not recognize him, but it was so that he could be revealed to Israel that I came baptizing with water."
