\v 14 The one who expresses \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add God's character\f + \ft Or: what God is like\add* \f* became a human being, and he lived among us \add for a while\add*. As a result, we saw how wonderful he is. He came from \add God\add* his father, and there was no other person as wonderful as he. He was wonderful because he always acted kindly toward us\f + \ft Or: in ways we did not deserve \f*, and he always \add spoke\add* truthfully to us \add about God\add*.

\v 15 \add One day\add* when John was telling people about him, \add he saw Jesus\add*. Then he shouted to them, "I told you \add previously\add* that someone will come later who is more important than I am, since he existed \add long\add* before me. This \add is the man I was talking about\add*!"

\v 14 Now the Word became a real human being and lived here where we live for a while. We have seen him display his splendid and amazing nature, the nature of the one and only Son of the Father, who shows us that God loves us faithfully and teaches us about his truth. 

\p
\v 15 One day John the Baptizer was telling people about the Word, and Jesus came to him. John shouted to the crowd around him, "I told you someone would come after me, someone who is much more important than I am. He existed long before me, eternal ages, before I was born. This man here! This is that man I was talking about!"

\v 14 Now the Word became flesh and lived among us. We have seen his glory, glory as of the only unique person who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.
\v 15 John testified about him and cried out saying, "This was the one of whom I said, 'The one who comes after me ranks before me, for he was before me.'"

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **full of grace** - "always acts kindly toward us in ways we do not deserve"
  * **The one who comes after me** - John is speaking about Jesus. The phrase "comes after me" means that John's ministry has already started and Jesus' will start after him.
  * **ranks before me** - "is greater than I am" or "is more important than I am"
  * **for he was before me** - Be careful not to translate this in a way that suggests Jesus is more important just because he is older than John. Jesus is greater and more important than John because he is God the son who has always been alive and rules over everything along with God the Father.
