\v 14 Now the Word became a real human being and lived here where we live for a while. We have seen him display his splendid and amazing nature, the nature of the one and only Son of the Father, who shows us that God loves us faithfully and teaches us about his truth.

\v 15 One day John the Baptizer was telling people about the Word, and Jesus came to him. John shouted to the crowd around him, "I told you someone would come after me, someone who is much more important than I am. He existed long before me, eternal ages, before I was born. This man here! This is that man I was talking about!"

for he was before me.'"
