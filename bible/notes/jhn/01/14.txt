\v 14 The one who expresses \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add God's character\f + \ft Or: what God is like\add* \f* became a human being, and he lived among us \add for a while\add*. As a result, we saw how wonderful he is. He came from \add God\add* his father, and there was no other person as wonderful as he. He was wonderful because he always acted kindly toward us\f + \ft Or: in ways we did not deserve \f*, and he always \add spoke\add* truthfully to us \add about God\add*.

\v 14 Now the Word became a real human being and lived here where we live for a while. We have seen him display his splendid and amazing nature, the nature of the one and only Son of the Father, who shows us that God loves us faithfully and teaches us about his truth.
\p
\v 15 One day John the Baptizer was telling people about the Word, and Jesus came to him. John shouted to the crowd around him, "I told you someone would come after me, someone who is much more important than I am. He existed long before me, eternal ages, before I was born. This man here! This is that man I was talking about!"

\v 14 And the Word became flesh and lived among us. We have seen his glory, glory as of the one and only who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.
\v 15 John testified about him and cried out, saying, "This was the one of whom I said, 'He who comes after me is more than me, for he was before me.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Word** - This is a metaphor which refers to Jesus. He is the one who reveals what God is like. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Father** - This is an important title for God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **full of grace** - "full of kind acts towards us which we do not deserve"
  * **He who comes after me** - John is speaking about Jesus. The phrase "comes after me" means that John's ministry has already started and Jesus' ministry will start later, after John's.
  * **is more than me** - "is greater than I am" or "is more important than I am"
  * **for he was before me** - Be careful not to translate this in a way that suggests that Jesus is more important just because he is older than John in human years. Jesus is greater and more important than John because he is God the Son, who has always been alive.
