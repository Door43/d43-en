\v 16 We have all benefited very much from what he has done. Again and again, he has acted very kindly toward us.
\v 17 Moses proclaimed God's laws to the Jewish people. Jesus the Messiah was kind to us far beyond what we deserved and he taught us true things about God.
\v 18 No one has ever seen God. But, Jesus the Messiah, who himself is God, is always close to the Father, and he has made us know him.
