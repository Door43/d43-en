====== John 01 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent all the lines of 1:23, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "The Word" ==
This is a rather unique construction used to reference Jesus. He is the word of God embodied in flesh and the final revelation of God himself on earth. Although this can appear to be a complex teaching, it is rather simple: Jesus is God, the creator of the heavens and the earth.

== Light and Darkness ==
These are common images in the New Testament. Light is used here to indicate the revelation of God and his righteousness. Darkness describes [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]] and sin seeks to remain hidden from God.

== "Children of God" ==
When one believes in Jesus, they go from being a "child of wrath" to a child of God. They are adopted into the "family of God." This is an important image that will be unfolded in the New Testament.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphors ==
Although the other gospel accounts frequently contain [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|metaphors]] in the teachings of Jesus and in prophecy, the first chapter of this gospel uses metaphors in interpreting the meaning of the life of Jesus. Because of these metaphors, the reader can see that this gospel is going to be a more in-depth theological understanding of the life of Jesus. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "In the beginning was the word" ==
The first part of this chapter follows a logical and almost poetic pattern, which will be difficult to duplicate in translation.

== "Son of man" ==
Jesus refers to himself as the [[:en:obe:kt:sonofman|Son of Man]]. Some languages may struggle having a person refer to himself in the third person.
