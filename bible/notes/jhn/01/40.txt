\v 40 One of those two disciples who followed Jesus was named Andrew; he was Simon Peter's brother.
\v 41 Andrew first went off to find his brother Simon. When he came to him, he said, "We have found the Messiah (which means 'Christ')!"
\v 42 Andrew took Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked intently at Peter, and said, "You are Simon. Your father's name is John. You will be given the name Cephas." Cephas is an Aramaic name that means 'solid rock.' (Peter means the same thing in Greek.)

\v 42 He brought him to Jesus, and Jesus looked at him and said, "You are Simon son of John, you will be called Cephas" (which translated is: Peter).
