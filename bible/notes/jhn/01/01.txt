  * **In the beginning**  - This refers to the very earliest time before God created the heavens and the earth.
  * **the Word**  - This refers to Jesus. Translate as "the Word" if possible. If the "Word" is feminine in your language it could be translated as "the one who is called the Word."
  * **All things were made through him**  - This could be translated with an active verb: "God made all things through him." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **without him there was not one thing made that has been made**  - "God did not make anything without him" or "God made everything with him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
