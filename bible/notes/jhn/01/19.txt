\v 19 This is what John gave as his testimony: The Jews sent priests and the Levites from Jerusalem; they came to ask John, "Who are you?"
\v 20 So John testified to them and said, "I am not the Christ!"
\v 21 Then they asked him, "What do you say about yourself? Are you Elijah?" He said, "No." They asked again, "Are you the Prophet whom the prophets say will come?"
John answered, "No."

\v 19 Now this is John's testimony, when the Jews sent to him from Jerusalem priests and Levites to ask him, "Who are you?"
\v 20 He freely stated, and did not deny, but replied, "I am not the Christ."
\v 21 So they asked him, "What are you then? Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not." They said, "Are you the prophet?"  He answered, "No."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **He freely stated, and did not deny** - The second phrase says in negative terms the same thing that the first phrase says in positive terms. This emphasizes that John was telling the truth. AT: "He told them the truth freely" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **What are you then?** - "What then is the case, if you are not the Messiah?" or "What then is going on?" or "What then are you doing?"
