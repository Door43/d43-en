\v 19 And this is the testimony of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites to him from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?"
\v 20 He freely stated, and did not deny, but replied, "I am not the Christ."
\v 21 So they asked him, "What are you then? Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not." They said, "Are you the prophet?" He answered, "No."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the Jews sent ... to him from Jerusalem** - The word "Jews" here represents the "Jewish leaders." AT: "the Jewish leaders sent ... to him from Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **He freely stated, and did not deny** - The second phrase says in negative terms the same thing that the first phrase says in positive terms. This emphasizes that John was telling the truth. AT: "He told them the truth freely" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
  * **What are you then?** - "What then is the case, if you are not the Messiah?" or "What then is going on?" or "What then are you doing?"
