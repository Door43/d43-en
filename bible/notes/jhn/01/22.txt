===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - John continues to speak with the priests and Levites. 

  * **they said to him** - "the priests and Levites said to John"
  * **we ... us** - the priests and Levites, not John (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **He said** - "John said"
  * **I am a voice, crying in the wilderness** - The word "voice" is a metaphor that represents John and his message. AT: "I am like someone speaking loudly where no one can hear me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Make the way of the Lord straight** - Here the word "way" is used as a metaphor. AT: "Prepare yourselves for the Lord's arrival like people prepare the road for an important person to use" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
