\v 6 After he said that, he spat on the ground. He made \add a little bit of\add* mud with the saliva, and put it on the man's eyes.
\v 7 Then he said to him, "Go and wash in Siloam pool!" (That name means 'sent;' \add just like they sent the water by a channel into the pool, God sent Jesus\add*). So the man went and washed \add in the pool\add*, and when he went home he was able to see!

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **made mud with the saliva** - Jesus used his fingers to mix the dirt and saliva. AT: "and used his fingers to mix the dirt and saliva to make mud" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **which translated is: sent** - A brief break occurs here in the storyline so John can provide some additional information that would be helpful for a Greek-speaking audience. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **washed** - "washed his eyes in the pool"
