<usfm>
\v 22 The Jews who were against Jesus had previously agreed with one another that they would take anyone who declared that Jesus was the Christ and ban him from the synagogue.
\v 23 That is why his parents said, "Ask him, he is old enough to speak for himself."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 His parents said these things, because they were afraid  of the Jews. For the Jews had already agreed that if anyone should confess Jesus to be the Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
\v 23 Because of this, his parents said, "He is an adult. Ask him."
