\v 35 Jesus heard about what the Pharisees did to the man he healed, how they threw him out of the synagogue. So he went and searched for the man. When he found him, he said to him, "Do you believe in me, the Son of Man?"
\v 36 The man answered, "Sir, who is he? Tell me, so that I may believe in him."
\v 37 Jesus said to him, "You have seen him. He is the one who is speaking to you now."
\v 38 The man said, "Lord, I believe." Then he went down on his knees and worshiped him.
