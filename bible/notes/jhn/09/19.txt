\v 20 His parents replied, "We know that he is our son. We know that he was blind when he was born.
\v 21 But we do not know how he is able to see now. We also do not know who enabled him to see. Ask our son! He is old enough \add to answer questions from authorities like you\add*! He can tell you himself!"

\v 19 They asked his parents, "Is this your son? Do you say that he was blind from the day he was born? How, then, is he able to see?"
\v 20 His parents replied, "We know that this is our son. We know that he was blind when he was born.
\v 21 Nevertheless, we do not know how he is now able to see. We also do not know who healed his eyes. Ask him, he is old enough to speak for himself."

\v 19 They asked the parents, "Is this your son whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?"
\v 20 So his parents answered them, "We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.
\v 21 How he now sees, we do not know, and who opened his eyes, we do not know.  Ask him. He is an adult. He can speak for himself."
