\v 3 Jesus replied, "It was not that either this man or his parents sinned. He was born blind so that today people may see the powerful work God would do in him.
\v 4 We must do the works of the one who sent me while it is still day. Night is on the way and when it arrives, no one will be able to work.
\v 5 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **We**  - This "we" includes both Jesus and the disciples he is talking to. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive|Inclusive]])
  * **day … Night **- Jesus is comparing the time when people can do God's work to daytime when people work. Jesus is comparing the time when we cannot do God's work to night time. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **light of the world** - "the one who shows what is true just as light shows what is real". (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
