===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 57 \add My\add* Father, who is the \add source of everything that\add* lives, sent me, and I live because \add my\add* Father has \add given me life\add*. Similarly those who eat my \add flesh\add* will live \add eternally\add* because of what I \add do for them\add*.
\v 58 \add I am\add* the true bread that came down from heaven. Although our ancestors ate \add manna\add*, they \add later\add* died \add anyway\add*. But those who eat this bread will live forever."
\v 59 He said this while he was teaching people in the synagogue\f + \ft Or: the Jewish meeting place \f* in Capernaum.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 57 My Father, who makes everyone alive, has sent me, and I live because my Father has made me able to. In the same way, those who feed on me will live forever because of what I will do for them.
\v 58 I am the true bread that comes down from heaven. Anyone who eats me—this bread—will never die, but will live forever! What I do is not like what happened to your ancestors because they ate the manna and then died."
\v 59 Jesus said these things while he was teaching in the synagogue in the city of Capernaum.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 57 As the living Father sent me, and as I live because of the Father, so he who eats me, he will also live because of me.
\v 58 This is the bread that has come down out of heaven, not as the fathers ate and died. He who eats this bread will live forever."
\v 59 Jesus said these things in the synagogue, while he was teaching in Capernaum.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues speaking to all those listening to him ([[:en:bible:notes:jhn:06:32|6:32]]).

  * **living Father** - This can mean 1) "the Father who gives life" (see UDB) or 2) “the Father who is alive,” as people or animals are alive, the opposite of “dead” ([[:en:bible:notes:jhn:06:50|6:51]]).
