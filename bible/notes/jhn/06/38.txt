\v 38 I came down from heaven not to do what I want, but to do the will of him who sent me.
\v 39 This is what the one who sent me wants, that I lose none of those whom he has given me, and that I raise all of them up on the last day.
\v 40 For this is what my Father wants, that everyone who looks in faith on me, the Son, and who trust in me, will have everlasting life. I will raise them up on the last day."
