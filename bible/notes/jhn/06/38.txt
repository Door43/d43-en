<usfm>
\v 38 When I came down from heaven, it was not to do what I want. Instead, I came to do what \add God\f + \ft Or: my Father\add* \f*, who sent me, wants.
\v 39 What the one who sent me wants is that I keep forever all\f + \ft Or: never lose any \f* \f + \ft litotes \f* of those whom he has entrusted to me. He wants me to cause all of them to become alive again on the last day\f + \ft Or: on the day \add when I judge everyone\add* \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 40 \add Long ago in the desolate area when those who were bitten by snakes looked at the bronze replica of a snake, they were healed\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. What my Father wants is that \add similarly\add* everyone who looks at \add what\add* I \add have done\add* and believes in me will have eternal life. I will cause them to become alive again on the last day\f + \ft Or: on the day \add when I judge everyone\add* \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f*."

\v 38 I came down from heaven not to do what I want, but to do the will of him who sent me.
\v 39 This is what the one who sent me wants, that I lose none of those whom he has given me, and that I raise all of them up on the last day.
\v 40 For this is what my Father wants, that everyone who looks in faith on me, the Son, and who trust in me, will have everlasting life. I will raise them up on the last day."

\v 40 For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in him should have eternal life; and I will raise him up on the last day.
