\v 35 Jesus said to them, "I am the Bread that will make you live. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry. Whoever trusts in me will never be thirsty.
\v 36 Nevertheless, I have told you that, although you see me, you still do not trust me.
\v 37 All the people my Father gives to me will come to me, and I will never drive away anyone who comes to me.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 35 Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life, he who comes to me will not hunger, and he who believes on me will never thirst.
\v 36 However, I said to you that you have seen me, and you still do not believe.
\v 37 All whom the Father gives me will come to me, and he who comes to me I will absolutely not drive away.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues speaking to the people ([[:en:bible:notes:jhn:06:32|6:32]]).

  * **I am the bread of life** - Jesus is comparing himself to bread. Just as bread is necessary for our physical life, Jesus is necessary for our spiritual life. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he who comes to me I will absolutely not drive away** - "I will keep everyone who comes to me." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
