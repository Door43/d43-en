===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues speaking to the people and now also to the Jewish leaders ([[:en:bible:notes:jhn:06:32|6:32]]).

  * **draws** - This can mean 1) "pulls" ([[:en:bible:notes:jhn:21:04|21:6]]) or 2) "attracts" ([[:en:bible:notes:jhn:12:32|12:32]])
  * **It is written in the prophets** - "The prophets wrote" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me.** - The Jews thought Jesus was the "son of Joseph" (see [[:en:bible:notes:jhn:06:/|John 6:42]]), but he is the Son of God because his Father is God the Father, not Joseph. Those who truly learn from God the Father believe in Jesus, God the Son.
