\v 14 After the people saw the miracle that Jesus had performed in front of them, they said, "Surely he is the Prophet that God has been going to send into the world!"
\v 15 Jesus knew what the people were planning; they were about to come and force him to be their king. So he left them and went up the mountain to be by himself.
