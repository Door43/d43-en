===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus now continues speaking to all those listening to him ([[:en:bible:notes:jhn:06:32|6:32]]).

  * **Truly, truly** - Translate this as you did in [[en:bible:notes:jhn:01:49|1:51]].
  * **not that any man has seen the Father, except he who is from God** - Although no human alive on earth has seen God the Father, Jesus, the Son of God, has seen the Father. Translations must retain these words for God, "Father" and "Son," or the original meaning of the Scriptures will be lost.
  * **he who believes has everlasting life** - "Everlasting life" is connected to believing in Jesus, the Son of God the Father. The everlasting life of millions could be lost without an accurate translation of "Father" and "Son" as described in the Scriptures, since only the Father and Son can forgive sin and give eternal life.
