===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus now continues speaking to all those listening to him ([[:en:bible:notes:jhn:06:32|6:32]]).

  * **(Not that any man has seen the Father, except he who is from God—he has seen the Father.)** - This can mean one of two things: 1) John is adding his own words. You can use words that show that this is an important part of the story here. (See: ULB and [[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:discourse:background]]) or 2) Jesus is correcting possible misunderstandings of [[:en:bible:notes:jhn:06:43|6:45]] (see UDB).
  * **Truly, truly** - Translate this as you did in [[en:bible:notes:jhn:01:49|1:51]].
