\v 23 Then some \add men came\add* from Tiberias \add city\add* in boats. \add They were hoping to take some of the crowd back to Tiberias\add*. They arrived near the place where the people had eaten the food after Jesus had given thanks \add and caused it to multiply\add*.

\v 22 The next day the crowd of people that had stayed on the other side of the lake realized that there had been only one boat there the day before. They also knew that Jesus had not gone in the boat with his disciples.
\v 23 Some men came across the lake from the city of Tiberias in other boats they had. They put their boats near the place where the people had eaten the bread, that bread for which the Lord had given thanks to God.

\v 22 The next day, the crowd that had been standing on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there except the one, and that Jesus had not entered it with his disciples but that his disciples had gone away alone.
\v 23 However, there were some boats that came from Tiberias close to the place where they had eaten the bread loaves after the Lord had given thanks.
