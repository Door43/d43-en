===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 64 Yet there are some of you who do not trust what I am teaching you." Jesus said this because he knew from the start of his work who it was who would not trust in him, and he knew the person who would betray him.
\p
\v 65 Then he said, "That is why I told you that no one can come to me and to live forever unless the Father makes him able to come to me."

\v 64 Yet there are some of you who do not believe." For Jesus knew from the beginning who the ones were who would not believe and who it was who would betray him.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues speaking to all those listening to him ([[:en:bible:notes:jhn:06:32|6:32]]).

  * **come to me** - "follow me"
  * **no one can come to me unless it is granted to him by the Father** - Access to Jesus, the Son of God, is granted by his Father. God the Father and God the Son together are the way to salvation and eternal forgiveness. Whoever wants to believe must come to God through the Father and the Son, so these words for God must be maintained in translations.
