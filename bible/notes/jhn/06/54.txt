===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues speaking to all those listening to him.

  * **Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life** - The phrases "eats my flesh" and "drinks my blood" are metaphors. Just as one requires food and drink in order to have physical life, those who trust in Jesus will have spiritual life. AT: "whoever trusts me for their spiritual food and drink will have eternal life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **at the last day** - "on the day when God judges everyone"
  * **my flesh is true food ... my blood is true drink** - The words "true food" and "true drink" are metaphors that mean Jesus provides spiritual food and drink to those who trust in him. Receiving Jesus in faith provides everlasting life the same way food and drink nourish the physical body. AT: "I am truly spiritual food and drink" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **remains in me, and I in him** - "has a close relationship with me"
