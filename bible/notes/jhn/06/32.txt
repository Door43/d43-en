===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues speaking to the people ([[:en:bible:notes:jhn:06:32|6:32]]).

  * **Truly, truly** - Translate this as you did in [[en:bible:notes:jhn:01:49|1:51]].
  * **true bread** - Jesus is comparing himself to bread. Just as bread is necessary for our physical life, Jesus is necessary for our spiritual life. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
