====== John 06 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "Make him king" ==
While not all scholars agree on the exact reason Jesus did not want to be made king, it is generally agreed that they did not have the right motivation for making him king. They wanted him to be king because he gave them food. They failed to recognize the truth that he already is the king of kings. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

== Bread ==
Jesus uses the imagery of bread in this chapter. Bread's significance can be traces back to the daily provision God provided to Israel in the desert for 40 years and the events of the [[:en:obe:kt:passover|passover]].

== "I am..." ==
John uses this phrase seven times in his gospel. It is the same words used by God, when he revealed himself and his name at the burning bush. The name "Yahweh" can be translated as "I am."

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== "Gives to me...comes to me" ==
These phrases are used to mean that many will "come to believe in Jesus." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

== "Eat my flesh and drink my blood" ==
This should clearly be seen as a metaphor. It is a reference to the practice instituted at the Last Supper using bread and wine to represent Jesus' flesh and blood. This is a reference to Jesus' death for sin.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Parenthetical Ideas ==
Several times in this passage, John explains something or gives the reader some context to better understand the story. These explanation are intended to give the reader some additional knowledge without interrupting the flow of the narrative. The information is placed inside parentheses.

== "Son of Man, Son" ==

Jesus refers to himself as the "Son of Man" in this passage. It may not be possible in every language to have someone speaking in the first person, also speak in the third person.
