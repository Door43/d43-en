Jesus continues speaking to all those listening to him ([[:en:bible:notes:jhn:06:32|6:32]]).

  * **This is the bread** - See [[:en:bible:notes:jhn:06:35|6:35]].
  * **living bread** - This can mean 1) the same as "the bread of life" ([[:en:bible:notes:jhn:06:35|6:35]]) or 2) "bread that is alive," as people or animals are alive, the opposite of "dead."
