\v 8 \add Let me illustrate\add*: The wind blows wherever it wants to blow. You hear its sound, but you do not know where the wind comes from or where it is going. Similarly, those \add who do not know God cannot understand\f + \ft Or: control \f*\f + \ft Or: predict \f*\add* how people are born again as a result of what God's spirit \add does\add*."

\v 7 Do not be surprised when I tell you that you must be born again.
\v 8 It is like this: The wind blows wherever it wants. You hear the sound of the wind, but you do not know where it comes from or where goes. It is just like that with everyone who is made alive by the Spirit: the Spirit gives a new birth to whomever he desires.

\v 7 Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born again.'
\v 8 The wind blows wherever it wishes to, and you hear its  sound, but  do not know where it came from or where it is 
going. So is every one who is born of the Spirit."
