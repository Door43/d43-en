<usfm>
\v 7 Do not be surprised about my telling you that you must be born again \add and have a new life from God\add*.
\v 8 \add Let me illustrate\add*: The wind blows wherever it wants to blow. You hear its sound, but you do not know where the wind comes from or where it is going. Similarly, those \add who do not know God cannot understand\f + \ft Or: control \f*\f + \ft Or: predict \f*\add* how people are born again as a result of what God's spirit \add does\add*."

\v 7 Do not be surprised when I tell you that you must be born again.
\v 8 It is like this: The wind blows wherever it wants. You hear the sound of the wind, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. It is just like that with everyone who is made alive by the Spirit: the Spirit gives a new birth to whomever he desires.

<usfm>
\v 7 Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born again.'
\v 8 The wind blows wherever it wishes. You hear its sound, but you do not know where it came from or where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit."

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues speaking to Nicodemus.
    * **You must be born again**  - "You must be born from above" or "God must give you life". See notes on [[en:bible:notes:jhn:03:03]].
    * **The wind blows wherever it wishes** - There's a double meaning here. In the source language, wind and Spirit are the same word. Alternate translation: "The Holy Spirit is like a wind that blows wherever he wants." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
