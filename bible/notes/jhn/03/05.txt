\v 5 Jesus answered, "I promise this also is true: No one can enter God's kindgom unless he is born both of water and the Spirit. Being born of a human mother is not enough; people also need to be born spiritually. They must be born by the Spirit of God working within them.
\v 6 If someone comes to have life through a human birth, that person is just a human being. But those who are born again by the work of God's Spirit have a new spiritual nature that God makes within them.
