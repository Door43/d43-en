\v 13 I am the only one who has gone up to heaven; no one else has gone up there. I am also the one who came down from heaven. \add So I know what happens there\add*.

\v 12 If you do not trust what I say when I tell you about things of this earth, how will you trust what I say when I tell you about things of heaven?

  * **how will you believe if I tell you** - In both places "you" is singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
