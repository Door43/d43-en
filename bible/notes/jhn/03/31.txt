But since he came from heaven, his \add words are\add* more important than anyone else's.

\v 33 Those who have accepted what he has said verify that what God has said is true.

\v 31 Jesus comes from heaven, and he is higher in position than anyone else. We have our home on earth, and we can speak only of things that belong to the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above everyone on the earth and everything there is.
\v 32 Now there is one here who gives his testimony to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts what he says or trusts it to be true.
\v 33 However, those who have trusted in what he said, they testify that God is the source of all truth, and that he alone is the measure and standard of everything that is true.
