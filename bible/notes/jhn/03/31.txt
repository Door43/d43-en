<usfm>
\v 31 \add Jesus\add* came from heaven. He is more important than anyone else. Those who are born from \add parents here\add* on earth \f + \ft metonymy \f* are just humans, and they speak about things \add that happen here\add* on the earth. But since he came from heaven, his \add words are\add* more important than anyone else's.
\v 32 He tells people what he has seen and what he heard \add in heaven\add*, but very few people \f + \ft hyperbole \f* listen to what he says.
\v 33 Those who have accepted what he has said verify that what God has said is true.

<usfm>
\v 31 Jesus comes from heaven, and he is higher in position than anyone else. We have our home on earth, and we can speak only of things that belong to the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above everyone on the earth and everything there is.
\v 32 Now there is one here who gives his testimony to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts what he says or trusts it to be true.
\v 33 However, those who have trusted in what he said, they testify that God is the source of all truth, and that he alone is the measure and standard of everything that is true.

\v 31 He who comes from above is above all. He who is of the earth is from the earth and speaks of earthly things. He who comes from heaven is above all.
\v 32 He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no man accepts his testimony.
\v 33 He who has received his testimony has confirmed that God is true.

===== Translation Notes: =====
John the Baptist continues speaking.

    * **He who comes from above is above all** - John is speaking about Jesus. AT: "He who comes from heaven rules over everything" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **He who is of the earth is from the earth and speaks of earthly things** - John is contrasting himself with Jesus. John does not mean that since he is born on the earth that he is evil. He means that Jesus is greater than he is since Jesus is from heaven and John was born on the earth. AT: "He who is born in this world is like everyone else who lives in the world and he speaks about what happens in this world" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **He who comes from heaven is above all** - This means the same thing as the first sentence. John repeats this for emphasis.
    * **He testifies to what he has seen and heard** - John is speaking about Jesus. AT: "The one from heaven tells about what he has seen and heard in heaven"
    * **no man accepts his testimony** - AT: "very few people believe him" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]]) 
    * **He who has received his testimony** - "He" refers to any person. "A person who believes what Jesus"
    * **has confirmed** - "proves" or "agrees"
