\v 14 Long ago Moses, when he was in the wilderness during the Exodus, lifted up a poisonous snake on a pole and all who looked up at it were saved. In the same way, the Son of Man must be lifted up
\v 15 so that whoever looks up and trusts in him will have eternal life.

    * **As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so the Son of Man must be lifted up** - (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
