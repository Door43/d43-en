\v 16 God loved us people \f + \ft metonymy \f* in the world so much that he gave his only Son \add as a sacrifice for us\add*, in order that everyone who believes in him would not be separated from God forever. Instead, they would have eternal life.
\v 17 When God sent his Son into the world, his purpose was not to punish the \add people in\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* the world for their sins. Instead, he sent him in order that they might be saved by him \f + \ft Or:he might save them \f* \add from being\add* \add guilty\f + \ft Or: punished\add* \f* \add for their sins\add*.
\v 18 Everyone who trusts in his Son, \add God says that they\add* will not be punished \f + \ft Or:that he will not punish them \f*. But God has already \add said that\add* everyone who does not trust in his Son will be punished \f + \ft Or:that he will punish everyone who does not trust in his Son \f*, because they have not trusted in what his only Son \add has done for them\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 God loved the world in this way: He gave his only Son, so that anyone who trusts in him would not die, but would have everlasting life.
\v 17 God did not send his Son into the world to pronounce sentence on it, but to save it.
\v 18 Everyone who trusts in the Son, God will never condemn. But everyone who does not trust in him, God has already put under his condemnation, because they did not put their trust in the name of the only Son of God.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only unique Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life.
\v 17 For God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but so that the world should be saved through him.
\v 18 He who believes in him is not condemned. He who does not believe has been condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the unique Son of God.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **God so loved the world** - "world" refers to everyone in the world who believes in Jesus, rather than everyone who exists.
  * **loved** - This is the kind of love that comes from God is focused on the good of others, even when it doesn't benefit oneself. God himself is love and is the source of true love.
  * **unique Son** - "one and only Son"
  * **For God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but so that the world should be saved through him,** - These two sentences nearly mean the same, said twice for emphasis, first in the negative and then in the positive. Some languages emphasize in a different way. AT: God's real reason for sending his Son into the world was to save it." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
  * **condemn** - "punish"
  * ** not condemned** - "judged innocent" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
  * **the name of the unique Son of God** - Jesus as God's one and only, unique Son clarifies the importance of translating Jesus' title, "__the Son of God__," as it is worded. Jesus' uniqueness as the God and Savior of all who believe in him is connected to who He is, the only Son of God who is God the Son.
