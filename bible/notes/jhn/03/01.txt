\v 1 There was a man named Nicodemus. He was a member of the Pharisees, a very strict group within the Jewish faith of that day. He was an important man, a member of the highest Jewish governing council.
\v 2 He went by night to see Jesus. He said to Jesus, "Teacher, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. We know this because no one could perform the miracles you are doing unless God helped him."
