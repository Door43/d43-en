<usfm>
\v 19 The \add one who was like a\add* light \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add to reveal God's truth to us\add* came into the world. But people loved doing what was \add evil, like\add* darkness \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add is evil\add*, instead of loving the \add one who was like a\add* light. That is the reason \add God will\add* judge people \add and condemn them\add*.
\v 20 Everyone who does what is evil hates the \add one who is like a\add* light, and they will not come to the \add one who is like a\add* light, because it would be shown \f + \ft Or:\add the one who is like a light\add* would show \f* that their deeds \add are evil, and he would rebuke them\add*.
\v 21 But those who live according to \add God's\add* truth come to the \add one who is like a\add* light, in order that it may be seen clearly \f + \ft Or:that people may see clearly \f* that the things they have done they did them because \add they have depended\add* on God.

\v 19 God has made his justice for sinful people plain for all to see: his light has come into the world, but the people of this world have loved their darkness and they hide from the light. They loved the darkness because what they were doing was ugly and evil.
\v 20 Everyone who does wicked deeds hates the light, and they never will come to it because the light exposes what they do and reveals how wicked they are.
\v 21 But those who do what is good and true come to the light so that what they do may be seen by all and so that all might know that they were obeying God when they did these things.

<usfm>
\v 19 This is the reason for the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil.
\v 20 For everyone who does evil hates the light and does not come to the light so that his deeds might not be exposed.
\v 21 However, he who practices the truth comes to the light so that his deeds may be clearly seen and that they have been brought about in obedience to God."
