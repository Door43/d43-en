<usfm>
\v 29 I am like the friend of the bridegroom. I am standing there waiting for the groom to come. The friend of the bridegroom is very happy when he hears the bridegroom's voice when he finally arrives. Therefore, because all this has happened, my joy is overflowing because he has come.
\v 30 Over time he will grow in status and importance, and I will become less and less important.

<usfm>
\v 29 He who has the bride is the bridegroom. Now the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and listens, rejoices
greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice. This, then, is my joy made complete.
\v 30 He must increase, but I must decrease.
