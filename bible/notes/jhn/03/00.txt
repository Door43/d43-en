====== John 03 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Light ==
Light is a common image in Scripture used to represent [[:en:obe:kt:righteous|righteousness]]. Light is also used to show the path of righteousness and to show righteous living. Darkness is often used as an image to represent [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]] or [[:en:obe:kt:unrighteous|unrighteousness]].

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "We know that you are a teacher come from God" ==
Although this appears to be display of faith, it is not. This is because believing Jesus is "only a teacher" shows a lack of awareness of who he truly is. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

== "Son of Man" ==

Jesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this passage. It may not be possible in every language to have someone speaking in the first person, also speak in the third person.
