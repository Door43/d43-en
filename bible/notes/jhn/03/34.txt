\v 34 \add We know it is true\add* because\add Jesus\add*, the one God sent, speaks the message of God. \add That is also true\add* because God causes his Spirit to live \add in Jesus\add* to completely \add direct everything he says and does\add*.
\v 35 God loves his Son, and has caused him to have control\f + \ft Or: power \f* over everything.
\v 36 Those who trust in \add God's\add* Son have eternal life. But those who reject God's Son will never have \add eternal\add* life. Instead, God is angry with them \add and he will surely punish them\add*.

\v 35 The Father loves the Son and he puts everything under his power.
