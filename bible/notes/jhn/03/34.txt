<usfm>
\v 34 \add We know it is true\add* because\add Jesus\add*, the one God sent, speaks the message of God. \add That is also true\add* because God causes his Spirit to live \add in Jesus\add* to completely \add direct everything he says and does\add*.
\v 35 God loves his Son, and has caused him to have control\f + \ft Or: power \f* over everything.
\v 36 Those who trust in \add God's\add* Son have eternal life. But those who reject God's Son will never have \add eternal\add* life. Instead, God is angry with them \add and he will surely punish them\add*.

\v 34 God sent his spokeman and what he has said is true, for he speaks the words of God. And he gives his Spirit with no concern for how much he gives.
\v 35 The Father loves the Son and he gives all things into the Son's hand.
\v 36 Whoever trusts in God's Son has eternal life. Whoever does not obey Son of God can never have eternal life, and the just fury of God for every sin that person has done will remain upon him forever.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>

\v 35 The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand.
\v 36 He that believes on the Son has eternal life, but the one  that disobeys the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God
abides on him."
