===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues to pray

  * **that they should know you** -  "know" God by experience, rather than just "knowing" things about God. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **the work that you have given me to do - **"The work" refers to Jesus' entire earthly gospel ministry. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
