\v 6 Those whom you chose from everyone in this world to belong to me—I have taught them who you really are and what you are like. They belonged to you and you have given them to me. They have believed in what you said to them, and they have obeyed it.
\v 7 Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you.
\v 8 I gave them the message that you gave me. They accepted it, and now they know for sure that I came from you, and they believe that you sent me.
