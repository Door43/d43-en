<usfm>
\v 12 While I have been with them, I have \add completely\add* protected them by the power \f + \ft metonymy \f* that you gave me. As a result, only one of them will be eternally separated from you. He is the one who was doomed to be eternally separated from you. \add That has happened\add* to fulfill \add what a prophet wrote\add* in the Scriptures \add would happen\add*.
\p
\v 13 \add Father\add*, now I am about to return to you. I have said these things while I am still \add here\add* in the world in order that my \add disciples\add* may fully experience being joyful, as I have been joyful.
\v 14 I have given them your message. As a result, those who are opposed to you \f + \ft metonymy \f* have hated them, because \add my disciples\add* do not belong to those who oppose you \f + \ft metonymy \f*, just like I do not belong to those who oppose you \f + \ft metonymy \f*.

\v 12 While I was with them, I kept them safe and watched over them by your own power. Not one of them was lost, except the one whom you had destined for destruction, as the Scriptures foretold long ago.
\p
\v 13 Now I am coming to you, Father. I have said these things while I am here in the world so that I may give them my complete joy.
\v 14 I have spoken your messages to them, and those who are part of this world hate your people because they do not belong to this world.

<usfm>
\v 12 While I was with them, I kept them in your name that you have given me; I guarded them, and not one of them has perished, except the son of perdition, so that the scriptures might be fulfilled.
\v 13 Now I am coming to you; but I am speaking these things in the world so that they may have my joy made full in themselves.
\v 14 I have given them your word; the world has hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.
