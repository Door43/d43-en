\v 9 I am praying for them. I am not praying for those \add who do not belong to you\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. Instead, \add I am praying\add* for those whom you have brought to me, because they belong to you.
\v 10 All \add the disciples\add* that I have belong to you, and all those who belong to you also belong to me. They have shown how great I am.
\v 11 I will not be \add staying\add* in the world any longer. I will be coming back to you. They, however, will be \add here\add* in the world \add among those who are opposed to you\add*. \add My\add* Holy Father, protect them from spiritual harm by your power \f + \ft metonymy \f*, the power that you gave me, in order that they may be united as we are united.

\v 9 I am praying for them. I am not praying for those who belong to this world, those who continue to oppose you. I am praying for those whom you gave me because they belong to you.
\v 10 All I have belongs to you, and all you have is mine. They know who I am, and they sincerely tell the truth about who I am.
\v 11 I am not staying in the world any longer. However, they are staying in the world. I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them safe; keep them belonging to yourself by the same power that you gave to me so that they may be united together, just as we are.

\v 9 I pray for them. I do not pray for the world but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours.
\v 10 All things that are mine are yours, and your things are mine; I am glorified in them.
\v 11 I am no longer in the world, but these people are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them in your name that you have given me so that they may be one, just as we are one.
