\v 9 I am praying for them. I am not praying for those who are belong to this world—those who continue to oppose you. I am praying for those whom you gave me because they belong to you.
\v 10 All I have belongs to you, and all you have is mine. They know who I am, and they sincerely tell the truth about who I am.
\v 11 I am not staying in the world any longer. But they are staying in the world. I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them safe; keep them belonging to yourself by the same power that you gave to me, so that they may be united together, just as we are.
