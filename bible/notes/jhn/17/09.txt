\v 9 I am praying for them. I am not praying for those who do not belong to you . Instead, I am praying for those whom you have brought to me, because they belong to you.
\v 10 All the disciples that I have belong to you, and all those who belong to you also belong to me. They have shown how great I am.
\v 11 I will not be staying in the world any longer. I will be coming back to you. They, however, will be here in the world among those who are opposed to you. My Holy Father, protect them from spiritual harm by your power , the power that you gave me, in order that they may be united as we are united.

\v 9 I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for those whom you have given me; for they are thine:
\v 10 and all things that are mine are your, and your are mine: and I am glorified in them.
\v 11 And I am no more in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep them in your name which
you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are.
