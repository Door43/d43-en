\v 1 After Jesus said these things, he looked up to the sky and said, "Father, it is time for you to announce to everyone and to tell them who I, your Son, am, and to show them all that I have done. Do this so that I, your Son, may reveal you to everyone who you really are, the great King who can do anything.
\v 2 Do this just as you have allowed me, your Son, to rule over all people. Father, you have done this in order that I might be able to them live forever—all whom you have given to me.
