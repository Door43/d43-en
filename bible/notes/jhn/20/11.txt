\v 11 But Mary was standing without at the tomb weeping: so, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb;
\v 12 and she sees two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
\v 13 And they say to her, Woman, why weep thou? She says to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not
where they have laid him.
