===== Translation Notes: =====
Mary had just told Peter and John that someone had moved Jesus' body.

  * **the other disciple** - John apparently expresses his humility by referring to himself in this manner rather than stating his name.
  * **linen cloths** - These were the burial cloths used to wrap the body of Jesus.
