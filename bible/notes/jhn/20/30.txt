\v 30 Now Jesus did many other works of power and miracles that proved who he is. The disciples witnessed them, but they were so numerous that I have not written them all down in this book.
\v 31 But I have written these so that you may have complete confidence that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and by trusting in him you may have eternal life in his name.
