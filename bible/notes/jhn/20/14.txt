\v 14 When she had thus said, she turned herself back, and sees Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.
\v 15 Jesus says to her, Woman, why weep thou? whom seek thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, says to him,
Sir, if you have borne him hence, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.
