===== Translation Notes: =====

This is the third day after Jesus was buried.

  * **first day of the week** - AT: "Sunday"
  * **she saw the stone rolled away from the tomb** - There had been a large stone that covered the opening of the tomb, and she saw that it had been moved.
   * **disciple whom Jesus loved** -Throughout  his book John refers to himself as the "disciple whom Jesus loved."
  * **They have taken away the Lord** - The word "They" is used generally because Mary does not know who has taken the body.  The words "taken away" could also be translated "lifted."  As recorded in the gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, Mary had been told Jesus had risen, and from this passage we learn she had assumed his body had been lifted out of the tomb.
