===== Translation Notes: =====

  * If the fact that verse 57 happens before verse 56 might confuse your readers, you could combine these verses and put the text of verse 57 before the contents of verse 56. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_events]])

  * **They were looking for Jesus** - The word "they" refers to the Jewish people who had traveled to Jerusalem.
  * **Now the chief priests** - This is background information that explains why the Jewish worshipers were wondering if Jesus would come to the festival or not. If your language has a way to mark background information, use it here. (See:[[en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **What do you think? That he will not come to the festival?**- The speaker here was wondering if Jesus would come to the festival even with the danger of being arrested.  He asked others around them for their opinion. AT: "Do you think Jesus will be too afraid to come to the festival?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
