====== John 11 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Light ==
Light is a common image in Scripture used to represent righteousness. Light is also used to show the path of righteousness and to show righteous living. Darkness is often used as images representing sin or unrighteousness. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:light]], [[:en:obe:kt:righteous]], [[:en:obe:kt:darkness]], [[:en:obe:kt:sin]] and [[:en:obe:kt:unrighteous]])

== "I am..." ==

John uses this phrase seven times in his gospel. It is the same words used by God, when he revealed himself and his name at the burning bush. The name "Yahweh" can be translated as "I am."

== Passover ==
This chapter records that Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews. In turn, the Pharisees waited to find him during the Passover. It was the responsibility of the Jews, who were able, to go to Jerusalem during the Passover celebration. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:passover]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== "One man should die for the people" ==
Caiaphas said, "it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people rather than that the whole nation should perish." It is ironic that Jesus would come to die for the sins of the nation and the whole world. This statement almost functions as a prophecy about Jesus' death for sin. This is something the high priest also gives a prophecy about later in this chapter. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]] and [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "If you had been here" ==
Mary and Martha had faith in Jesus but they did not understand fully who he was. In this passage, they had not yet come to realize that he had power over death itself and could raise Lazarus from the dead if he desired. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
