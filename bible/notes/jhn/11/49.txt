\v 49 One of the \add Jewish Council\add* members was Caiaphas. He was the Jewish high priest that year. \add Hinting that they should get rid of Jesus\add*, he said to them, "You \add talk as though you\add* do not know anything \f + \ft hyperbole \f*!
\v 50 You do not realize that it would be much better for us if one man died for the sake of the people rather than that \add the Romans kill\add* all the \add people of our Jewish\add* nation."

\v 49 One of them on the Council was Caiaphas, the high priest for that year. He said to them, "You all know nothing!
\v 50 Do you not realize that it is better that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perishes."

\v 49 However, a certain man among them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, "You know nothing at all.
\v 50 You do not take into account that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people rather than that the whole nation should perish."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **You know nothing at all**  - Caiaphas does not use this phrase because he thinks they know nothing but because they haven't thought of the same solution he has. Alternate translation: "You talk as if you do not know what to do." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole|Hyperbole]])
