===== translationNotes: =====

  * **a certain man among them** - This is a way to introduce a new character to the story. If you have a way to do this in your language, you can use it here. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_participants]])
  * **You know nothing** - This is an exaggeration that Caiaphas uses to insult his hearers. AT: "You do not understand what is happening!" or "You speak as though you know nothing!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **than that the whole nation perishes** - Caiaphas implies that the Roman army would kill all of the people of the Jewish nation if Jesus is allowed to live and cause a rebellion. The word "nation" here is a synecdoche that represents all of the Jewish people. AT: "than that the Romans kill all the people of our nation" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
