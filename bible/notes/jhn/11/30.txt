\v 30 Jesus had not yet entered the village; he was still at the place where Martha met him.
\v 31 The Jews who were in the house with Mary, consoling her, saw Mary get up quickly and go outside. So they followed her, thinking that she was going to the tomb \add where they had buried Lazarus\add*, in order to cry there.
\p
\v 32 When Mary got to where Jesus was and saw him, she prostrated herself at his feet and said, "Lord, if you had been here, my \add younger\add* brother would not have died!"

\v 32 Mary came to the place where Jesus was; when she saw him, she fell down before him at his feet and said, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."

\v 30 Now Jesus had not yet come into the village but was still in the place where Martha had met him.
\v 31 Then the Jews who were with Mary in the house and who were consoling her, when they saw her quickly rise and go out, followed her; they supposed that she was going to the tomb to weep there.
\v 32 Mary then, when she came where Jesus was and saw him, fell down at his feet and said to him, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."
