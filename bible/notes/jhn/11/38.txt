\v 38 Jesus was physically shaken and emotionally upset when he came to the tomb. It was a cave. The entrance had been covered by a large stone.
\v 39 Jesus gave a command to those standing there, "Take away the stone." But Martha objected, "Lord, by this time there will be a putred odor, for he has been dead for four days."
\v 40 Jesus said to her, "Did I not tell you the truth when I told you that if you trusted me, you would see who God is, and you would know what God can do?"

will be decaying for he has been dead four days."
\v 40 Jesus said to her, "Did I not say to you that, if you believed, you would see the glory of God?"
