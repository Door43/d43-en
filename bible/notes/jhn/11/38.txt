\v 38 Jesus was physically shaken and emotionally upset when he came to the tomb. It was a cave, and the entrance had been covered by a large stone.
\v 39 Jesus gave a command to those standing there, "Take away the stone." However, Martha objected, "Lord, by this time there will be a putrid odor, for he has been dead for four days."
\v 40 Jesus said to her, "Did I not tell you the truth when I told you that if you trusted me, you would see who God is and you would know what God can do?"

\v 38 Then Jesus, while groaning again in himself, went to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.
\v 39 Jesus said, "Take away the stone." Martha, the sister of Lazarus, the one who had died, said to Jesus, "Lord, by this time the body will be decaying, for he has been dead four days."
\v 40 Jesus said to her, "Did I not say to you that, if you believed, you would see the glory of God?"
