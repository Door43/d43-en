===== translationNotes: =====

  * **loved** - This refers to brotherly love or human love for a friend or family member.
  * **Could not this man, who opened the eyes of a blind man, also have made this man not die?** - This remark appears in the form of a question to express the Jews' surprise that Jesus did not heal Lazarus. AT: "He could heal a man who was blind, so he should have been able to heal this man so he would not have died" or "Since he did not keep this man from dying, maybe he did not really heal the man who was born blind, as they say he did!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **opened the eyes** - This is an idiom. AT: "healed the eyes" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
