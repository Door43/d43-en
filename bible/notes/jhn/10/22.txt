\v 22 The time for the celebration called the Festival of Dedication had now come, the time when the Jewish people remembered when their ancestors purified the temple in Jerusalem and gave it to God again. It was in the winter.
\v 23 Jesus was walking in the temple courtyard in the place called Solomon's porch.
\v 24 The Jewish opponents of Jesus gathered around him and said, "How long will you keep us wondering about who you are? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly so that we can know."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Festival of the Dedication**  - This is an eight day winter holiday Jews use to remember a miracle where God made a small amount of oil remain lit in a lampstand until they got more oil eight days later. The lampstand was lit to dedicate the Jewish temple to God. To dedicate something is to promise to use it for a certain purpose.
  * **porch **- a structure attached to the entrance of a building that has a roof and that may or may not have walls
