\v 19 After hearing these words Jesus had been speaking, the Jews were divided in their opinion of him.
\v 20 Many of them said, "A demon is controlling him and has caused him to become crazy. Do not waste time listening to him!"
\v 21 Others said, "What he is saying is not something a man oppressed by a demon would ever say. No demon can open the eyes of a blind man!"

\v 19 A division again occurred among the Jews because of these words.
\v 20 Many of them said, "He has a demon and is insane. Why do you listen to him?"
\v 21 Others said, "These are not the statements of one possessed with a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?"
