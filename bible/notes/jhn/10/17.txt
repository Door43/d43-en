<usfm>
\v 17 The reason my Father loves me is that I will sacrifice my life. I will give up my life, and I will take it up to live again.
\v 18 No one is causing me to lay down my life. I have chosen to sacrifice myself. I have authority to lay down my life and I have authority to take it up and to live again. This work is from my Father, and he has commanded me to do it."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 This is why the Father loves me: I lay down my life that I may take it again.
\v 18 No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again. I have received this command from my Father."

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues talking to the crowd.

  * **I lay down my life that I may take it again**  - This is a mild way for Jesus to say he will die and then bring himself back to life. Alternate translation: "I allow myself to die in order that I may bring myself back to life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism|Euphemism]])
