====== John 10:37-39 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 37 If I were not doing the miracles that my Father \add told me to do, I would not expect\add* you to believe in me.
\v 38 But because I perform these miracles, believe \add what\add* these miracles \add show about me\add*, even though you do not believe what I \add say\add*. If you do that, then you will know and understand that \add my\add* Father has a close relationship with me, and I have a close relationship with \add my\add* Father."
\p
\v 39 After they heard that, they tried to seize him again, but he got away from them.

\v 37 If I were not doing the works that my Father told me to do, I would not expect you to believe in me.
\v 38 But because I am doing these works, believe what these works tell you about me, even though you do not believe what I say. If you do that, then you will know and understand that my Father is in me and that I am in my Father."

<usfm>
\v 37 If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.
\v 38 But if I do them, though you believe not me, believe the works: that you may know and understand that the Father is in me,
and I in the Father.
\v 39 They sought again to take him: and he went forth out of their hand.
