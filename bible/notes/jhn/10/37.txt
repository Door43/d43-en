===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 37 If I were not doing the miracles that my Father \add told me to do, I would not expect\add* you to believe in me.
\v 38 But because I perform these miracles, believe \add what\add* these miracles \add show about me\add*, even though you do not believe what I \add say\add*. If you do that, then you will know and understand that \add my\add* Father has a close relationship with me, and I have a close relationship with \add my\add* Father."

\v 37 If I were not doing the works that my Father told me to do, I would not expect you to believe in me.
\v 38 However, because I am doing these works, place your trust in what these works tell you about me even though you do not trust what I say. If you do that, then you will know and understand that my Father is in me and that I am in my Father."
\p
\v 39 After they heard that, they tried to seize Jesus again, but he got away from them one more time.
