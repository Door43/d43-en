====== John 10:37-39 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 37 If I were not doing the miracles that my Father \add told me to do, I would not expect\add* you to believe in me.
\v 38 But because I perform these miracles, believe \add what\add* these miracles \add show about me\add*, even though you do not believe what I \add say\add*. If you do that, then you will know and understand that \add my\add* Father has a close relationship with me, and I have a close relationship with \add my\add* Father."

\v 39 After they heard that, they tried to seize him again, but he got away from them.

<usfm>
\v 37 If I were not doing the works that my Father told me to do, I would not expect you to believe in me.
\v 38 However, because I am doing these works, place your trust in what these works tell you about me even though you do not trust what I say. If you do that, then you will know and understand that my Father is in me and that I am in my Father."
\p
\v 39 After they heard that, they tried to seize Jesus again, but he got away from them one more time.

\v 39 They tried to seize him again, but he went away out of their hand.
