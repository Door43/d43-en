====== John 10:14-16 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 I am \add like\add* a good shepherd. \add Just like a good shepherd knows his\add* sheep \f + \ft metaphor \f*, I know those who belong to me, and they know me
\v 15 in the same way as \add my\add* Father knows me and I know \add my\add* Father. Furthermore, I am \add ready to\add* sacrifice myself for \add those who belong to me\add*.
\v 16 And I have other people \add who are not Jews\add* who \add will some day\add* belong to me. They will be \add like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* sheep from another sheep pen. I must bring them \add to God\f + \ft Or: myself \f*\add* also. They will pay attention to what I say, and eventually \add all those who belong to me\add* will be \add like\add* one flock, and \add I\add* will be \add like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* their one shepherd.

<usfm>
\v 14 I am, myself, the good shepherd. I know my own sheep, and my own sheep know me,
\v 15 just as I know my Father, and my Father knows me. Because of that, I am willing to die for my sheep.
\v 16 I have other sheep that do not belong to the same group of sheep that you do. I will cause them to listen to me also. They will listen to me, so there will eventually be only one flock of sheep under me, the only shepherd.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 I am the good shepherd, and I know my own, and my own know me.
\v 15 The Father knows me, and I know the Father, and I lay down my life for the sheep.
\v 16 I have other sheep that are not of this fold.  Those, also, I must bring, and they will hear my voice so that there will be one flock and one shepherd.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues his parable about the good shepherd.
  * **I am the good shepherd** - "I am like a good shepherd." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I lay down my life for the sheep**  - This is a mild way for Jesus to say that he will die to protect his sheep. AT: "I die for the sheep" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **fold** - A group of sheep belonging to the shepherd. "Fold" comes from sheepfold which is a place where the sheep stay.
