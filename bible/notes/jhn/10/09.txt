\v 9 I myself am like that gate. If anyone enters through the gate and goes into the pen where the sheep are, he will be safe, and he will go out and find good pasture. I will lead him to that rich pasture.
\v 10 The thief comes only to steal, kill, and destroy; I have come so that they may have life and have it lacking nothing.

\v 9 I am the gate. If anyone enters in through me, he will be saved; he will go in and out and will find pasture.
\v 10 The thief does not come except to steal, kill, and destroy. I have come so that they might have life and have it more abundantly.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to talk to the crowd.

  * **I am the gate** - By referring to himself as "the gate" Jesus is showing that he offers a true way to get what the sheepfold represents. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **pasture** - The word "pasture" is a grassy area where sheep eat.
  * **does not come except** - This is a double negative. In some languages it is more natural to use a positive statement. AT: "comes only" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]]) 
  * **that they might have life** - The word "they" refers to the sheep. "Life" refers to eternal life.
