\v 9 I myself am like that gate. If anyone enters through the gate and goes into the pen where the sheep are, he will be safe, and he will go out and find good pasture. I will lead him to that rich pasture.
\v 10 The thief comes only to steal, kill, and destroy; I have come so that they may have life and have it lacking nothing.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to talk to the crowd.

  * **I am the gate** - By referring to himself as "the gate" Jesus is showing that he offers a true way to get what the sheepfold represents. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **pasture** - The word "pasture" is a grassy area where sheep eat.
  * **that they might have life** - The word "they" refers to the sheep. "Life" refers to eternal life.
