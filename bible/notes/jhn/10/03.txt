\v 3 The hired man who guards the gate when the shepherd is away will open the gate for him when he comes. However, the sheep recognize only the shepherd's voice and only when he calls them by name. Then he leads them outside of the pen to feed them and to give them water.
\v 4 After he has brought out all of his own sheep, he goes in front of them. His sheep are eager to follow him because they know his voice.
