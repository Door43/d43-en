===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus begins to explain the meaning of the parables he had spoken.

  * **Truly, truly** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jhn:01:49|1:51]].
  * **I am the gate of the sheep** - Here "gate" is a metaphor that means Jesus provides access into the sheepfold where God's people dwell in his presence. AT: "I am like the gate that the sheep use to enter into the sheepfold" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Everyone who came before me** - This refers to other teachers who have taught the people, including the Pharisees and other Jewish leaders. AT: "All of the teachers who came without my authority" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) 
  * **a thief and a robber** - These words are metaphors. Jesus calls those teachers "a thief and a robber" because their teachings were false, and they were trying to lead God's people while not understanding the truth. As a result, they deceived the people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
