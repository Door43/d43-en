===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to talk to the crowd.

  * **Truly, truly** - Translate this as you did in [[en:bible:notes:jhn:01:49|1:51]].
  * **I am the door of the sheep**  - "I am the way the sheep enter into the sheepfold" Jesus is saying he is the one who allows entry. The word "sheep" is used to refer to God's people.(See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **All who came before me are thieves and robbers**- The phrase "All who came before me" refers to the other teachers who had taught before Jesus. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) Jesus calls them "thieves and robbers" because their teachings were false and they were trying to lead God's people while not understanding the truth. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
