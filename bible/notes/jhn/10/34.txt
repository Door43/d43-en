\v 34 Jesus replied to them, "In the Scriptures it is written \f + \ft Or:\add someone\f + \ft Or: the Psalmist\add* \f* has written \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add what God said to the rulers whom he had appointed\add*, 'I have said that you are \add like\add* gods.'
\v 35 God said that \add to those leaders when he appointed them. No one objected to that\add*. And nothing that is in Scripture can be set aside \f + \ft Or:no one can set aside anything that is in Scripture \f*.
\v 36 But I am the one \add my\add* Father set apart to completely belong to him. He sent me here into this world. So why are you angry with me for saying that \add I am equal with God when I say\add* that I am the Son of God?\f + \ft Or: you should not be angry with me for saying that \add I am equal with God when I say\add* that I am the person who is both God and man! \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 34 Jesus replied to them, "In the scriptures it is written what God said to the rulers whom he had appointed: 'I have said that you are like gods (with great honor and with power over many).'
\v 35 God said that to those leaders when he appointed them. No one objected to that, and nothing that is in scripture can be shown to be false.
\v 36 I am the one whom my Father chose to send here into this world. So why are you angry with me for saying that I am equal with God when I said, 'I am the Son of God'?

\v 34 Jesus answered them, "Is it not written in your law, 'I said, "You are gods"'?
\v 35 If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot be broken),
\v 36 do you say to him whom the Father set apart and sent into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Is it not written ... gods"'?** - This remark appears in the form of a question to add emphasis. AT: "You should already know that it is written in your law that I said, 'you are gods.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **You are gods** - Here Jesus quotes a scripture where God calls his followers "gods," perhaps because he has chosen them to represent him on earth.  
  * **the word of God came** - This idiom is used to explain that a God gave a message to someone. AT: "Yahweh gave his message" or "Yawheh spoke a message" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **the scripture cannot be broken** - Possible meanings are 1) "no one can change the scripture" or 2) "the scripture will always be true."
  * **do you say to him whom the Father set apart and sent into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'?** - This remark appears in the form of a question to add emphasis. Jesus' opponents believed Jesus was blaspheming by calling himself "the Son of God." They knew that he was claiming to be equal to God. AT: "you should not say to the very one whom the Father set apart to send into the world, "You are insulting God," when I say that I am the Son of God!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **Father ... Son of God** - These are important titles that describe the relationship between God and Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
