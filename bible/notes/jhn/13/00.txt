====== John 13 General Notes ======

=== Structure and formatting ===

The events of this chapter are commonly referred to as the last supper or the lord's supper. This Passover feast in many ways parallels Jesus' sacrifice as the lamb of God. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:passover]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "To wash the disciples' feet" ==
Feet were considered very dirty in the ancient Near East. It was normally the servant who was responsible for washing the feet of his master. This act would have been considered humiliating for Jesus, which is why the disciples did not want him to do it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

== Washing ==
The image of washing is used here on the eve of Jesus' death. It is Jesus who is able to make people clean. This image represents the ability "to make righteous." (See: [[:en:obe:kt:clean]] and [[:en:obe:kt:righteous]]). 

== "I am ... " ==

John uses this phrase seven times in his gospel. It is the same words used by God, when he revealed himself and his name at the burning bush. The name "Yahweh" can be translated as "I am." (See: [[:en:obe:kt:reveal]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Son of Man ==

Jesus refers to himself as the "Son of Man." Every language may not have the ability to have a person refer to himself in the third person.
