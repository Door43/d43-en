\v 28 But none of the rest of us who were sitting there knew why Jesus said that to him.
\v 29 Since Judas took care of the money \add people gave us to help us\add*, some thought Jesus was telling him to \add go and\add* buy some things we needed for the \add Passover\add* celebration. \add Some thought he was telling him\add* to give some money to poor people.
\v 30 As soon as Judas had eaten the bread, he left. It was dark \add outside\add*, and it was dark \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add in his soul, too\add*.

\v 28 No one else at the table knew why Jesus had said that to him.
\v 29 Some thought that because Judas had the money bag, Jesus was telling him to go and buy some things needed for the Passover Festival. Others thought Jesus was telling Judas to give something to the poor.
\v 30 After receiving the bread, immediately Judas went out. It was night.

\v 28 Now no one at the table knew the reason that Jesus said this to him.
\v 29 Some thought that, because Judas had charge of the money bag, Jesus said to him, "Buy the things we need for the festival," or that he should give something to the poor.
\v 30 After Judas received the bread, he went out immediately; and it was night.
