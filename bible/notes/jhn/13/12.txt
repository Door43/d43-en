\v 12 So when he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and sat down again, he said to them, Know you what I have done
to you?
\v 13 You call me, Teacher, and, Lord: and you say well; for so I am.
\v 14 If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet.
\v 15 For I have given you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you.
