\v 12 After he finished washing our feet, he put his cloak back on. Then he sat down and said to us, "Do you understand what I have done for you?
\v 13 You \add show that you respect me by\add* calling me 'Teacher' and 'Lord'. You are right to say that, because I am your teacher and your Lord.
\v 14 But if I, who am your teacher and your Lord, have washed your feet, you ought to \add serve each other by doing things like\add* washing each other's feet.
\v 15 I have made myself an example for you in order that you should \add humbly serve each other\add* as I have done for you.

\v 12 After he finished washing their feet, he put his outer clothing on again. Then he sat down at his place again and said, "Do you understand what I have done for you?
\v 13 You call me 'teacher' and 'Lord. You are right to say this, for that is what I am.
\v 14 If I, your teacher and Lord, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet.
\v 15 I have given you an example to follow in order that you should do as I have done for you.

\v 12 So when Jesus had washed their feet and taken his garments and sat down again, he said to them, "Do you know what I have done for you?
\v 13 You call me 'teacher' and 'Lord,' and you are speaking correctly, because so I am.
\v 14 If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you should also wash the feet of one another.
\v 15 For I have given you an example so that you should also do just as I did for you.
