===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Lord, are you going to wash my feet?** - Peter is surprised firstly that Jesus is the one who will do the washing, and secondly that Peter is the one whose feet Jesus will wash. AT: "Lord, are you the one who is going to wash my feet?" or "It is not right for you, the Lord, to wash the feet of me, a sinner." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **If I do not wash you, you can have no part with me** - "You can have part with me only if I wash you" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
