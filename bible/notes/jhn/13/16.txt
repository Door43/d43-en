\v 18 "I am not saying that \add God will bless\add* all of you. I knew \add what all of you were like when\add* I chose you. But \add I also chose the one who will betray me\add*, in order that what is written in Scripture might be fulfilled \f + \ft Or:to fulfill what someone, Or: the psalmist wrote in Scripture \f*, 'The one who is \add acting like he is my friend by\add* eating with me has become my enemy \f + \ft idiom \f*.'

\v 16 I promise what I say to you is true: A servant is not greater than his master. Nor is a messenger greater than the one who has sent him to carry a message.
\v 17 If you know these things, God will give you joy if you do them.


\p
\v 18 "I am not saying this about all of you. I know the ones I have chosen. But what is written in Scripture must be fulfilled, ‘He who ate my bread with me as a friend, has lifted his heel against me and treated me like an enemy.'

\v 16 Verily, verily, I say to you, A servant is not greater than his master; neither one that is sent greater than he that
sent him.
\v 17 If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.
\v 18 I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats my bread
lifted up his heel against me.
