===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 Listen to this carefully: A servant is not greater than his master. A messenger is not greater than the one who has sent him. \add So, since you are not greater than I am, you should not be proud and unwilling to serve each other\add*.
\v 17 Since you now know these things, \add God will\add* be pleased with you if you do them."


\p
\v 18 "I am not saying that \add God will bless\add* all of you. I knew \add what all of you were like when\add* I chose you. But \add I also chose the one who will betray me\add*, in order that what is written in Scripture might be fulfilled \f + \ft Or:to fulfill what someone, Or: the psalmist wrote in Scripture \f*, 'The one who is \add acting like he is my friend by\add* eating with me has become my enemy \f + \ft idiom \f*.'

\v 16 I am telling you the truth: A servant is not greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who has sent him.
\v 17 If you know these things, how fortunate you will be if you do them.


\p
\v 18 I am not saying this about all of you. I know the ones I have chosen. However, what is written in scripture must come true: 'The one who ate my food with me as a friend, he has turned against me and treated me like an enemy.'

\v 16 Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master; nor is a messenger greater than he who sent him.
\v 17 If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.
\v 18 I am not speaking about all of you; I know those whom I have chosenâ€”but this so that the scripture will be fulfilled: 'He who eats my bread lifted up his heel against me.'
