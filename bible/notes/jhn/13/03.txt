===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Jesus knew...the Father...he had come from God and was going back to God** - God the Son had always been with the Father, but he came to earth to be crucified for the sins of the world. Translate "Father" and "Son" literally to show that the "Father" has revealed his infinite closeness with his "Son," and the great difficulty experienced by them when the Son went to the cross to pay for our sins! (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **He rose from supper and laid down his outer clothing** - Because the area was very dusty it was customary for the host of a dinner to provide a servant to wash the feet of the guests.
