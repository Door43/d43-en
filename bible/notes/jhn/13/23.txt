===== translationNotes: =====

  * **One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved** - This refers to John.
  * **laying down at the table** - During the time of Christ, Jews would often dine together in the Greek style, in which they lay on their sides on low couches. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|]])
  * **Jesus' chest** - Lying with one's head against the chest of another diner in the Greek style was considered to be the place of greatest friendship with him.
  * **loved** - This kind of love comes from God and focuses on the good of others, even when it does not benefit oneself. This kind of love cares for others, no matter what they do.
