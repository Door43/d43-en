  * [[:en:obe:other:command]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:love]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:disciple]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues speaking to his disciples.
 
  * **love** - This is the kind of love that comes from God and focuses on the good of others, even when it does not benefit oneself. This kind of love cares for others, no matter what they do. 
  * **everyone** - You may need to make explicit that this exaggeration refers only to those people who see how the disciples love each other. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
