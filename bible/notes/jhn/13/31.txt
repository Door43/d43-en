\v 31 After Judas left, Jesus said, "Now God will make people know what I, the Son of Man, am doing. And I, the Son of Man, will make people know what God is doing as well, and people will praise him for it.
\v 32 Since I, the Son of Man, make God known to people and since I honor him, God will also honor me. God will do this immediately.
\p
\v 33 Little children, I am with you just a little while longer. You will look for me, but, just as I told the Jews, and as I am now  telling you, where I am going, you cannot come.

\v 32 God will glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him immediately.
\v 33 Little children, I am with you for still a little while. You will look for me. As I said to the Jews, 'Where I am going, you cannot come.' Now I say this to you, also.
