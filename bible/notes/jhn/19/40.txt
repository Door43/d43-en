\v 40 They took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in strips of linen cloth, and they packed the wrappings full with all the spices.
\v 41 Now in the place where Jesus was crucified was a garden, and at the edge of the garden was a new tomb in which no one had been buried.
\v 42 The Passover was about to begin that evening, and they chose this tomb because it was close at hand and because they could bury Jesus quickly. So they laid Jesus there.

\v 40 So they took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths with the spices, as was the custom of the Jews to bury bodies.
\v 41 Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden was a new tomb in which no person had yet been buried.
\v 42 Because it was the day of preparation for the Jews and because the tomb was close by, they laid Jesus in it.
