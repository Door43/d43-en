\v 10 So Pilate said to him, "Will you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you, and I also have authority to crucify you?"
\v 11 Jesus answered him, "You would have no authority over me at all, if God had not given it to you. So the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a worse sin."

\v 10 Pilate then said to him, “Are you not speaking to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you, and power to crucify you?”
\v 11 Jesus answered him, “You would have had no power against me unless it had been given to you from above. So the person who delivered me to you has the greater sin.”
