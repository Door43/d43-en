\v 23 After the soldiers nailed Jesus to the cross, they took his clothes and divided them into four parts, one part for each soldier. But they kept his cloak \add separate\add*. This cloak had been woven \add from top to bottom\add* from one piece of cloth.
\v 24 So they said to each other, "Let's not tear it. Instead, let's \add decide\add* \add by\add* throwing lots\f + \ft Or: \add by\add* gambling \f* who will get it." So that is what the soldiers did. As a result, these words were fulfilled \f + \ft Or:they fulfilled these words \f* that \add the Psalmist had written\add* in Scripture,
\q They divided \add most of\add* my clothes among themselves.
\q They cast lots for \add one piece of\add* my clothing.

\v 23 After the soldiers had put Jesus on the cross, they took his clothes and divided them into four parts, one part for each soldier. However, they kept his tunic separate. This tunic had been woven from top to bottom from one piece of cloth.
\v 24 So they said to each other, "Let us not tear it. Instead, let us decide who will keep it as one piece by throwing lots for the one who will get it." This happened to make come true the scripture that said,
\q "They divided my clothes among them.
\q They cast lots for my clothing."

\v 23 After the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his garments and made four parts of them, a part for each soldier; and also the shirt. Now the shirt was without seams, woven from the top throughout.
\v 24 Then they said to each other, "Let us not tear it apart, but instead let us throw lots for it to see whose it will be." This happened so that the scripture might be fulfilled that said,
\q "They divided my garments among themselves,
\q and for my clothing they threw lots."
