\v 23 After the soldiers nailed Jesus to the cross, they took his clothes and divided them into four parts, one part for each soldier. But they kept his cloak \add separate\add*. This cloak had been woven \add from top to bottom\add* from one piece of cloth.
\v 24 So they said to each other, "Let's not tear it. Instead, let's \add decide\add* \add by\add* throwing lots\f + \ft Or: \add by\add* gambling \f* who will get it." So that is what the soldiers did. As a result, these words were fulfilled \f + \ft Or:they fulfilled these words \f* that \add the Psalmist had written\add* in Scripture,
\q They divided \add most of\add* my clothes among themselves.
\q They cast lots for \add one piece of\add* my clothing.

\v 23 The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part;
and also the coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
\v 24 They said therefore one to another, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might
be fulfilled, which saith,
\q They parted my garments among them,
\q And upon my vesture did they cast lots.
