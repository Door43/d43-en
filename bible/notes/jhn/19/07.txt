===== Translation Notes: =====

 
  * **he ought to die because he made himself the Son of God."** - Jesus was condemned to death by crucifixion because he claimed he was "the Son of God." Jesus' claim and his words must be honored and translated clearly.
  * **From where do you come?** - "Where do you come from?" Pilate asked Jesus for his identity. Your culture may have a special way to ask for the identity of a person.
