\v 31 That was the day that they prepared \add everything for their\add* \add Sabbath\f + \ft Or: day of rest\add* \f*. The next day was a special day of rest, \add because it was the day of rest during the Passover celebration\add*. The Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* did not want the bodies \add of the three men\add* to remain on the cross during their Sabbath\f + \ft Or: day of rest \f* \add because leaving bodies hanging overnight would be contrary to their Jewish laws\add*. So they went to Pilate and asked him \add to command that\add* the legs \add of the three men on the crosses\add* be broken \f + \ft Or:the \add soldiers\add* to break the legs \add of the three men on the crosses\add* \f*, \add so that they would die quickly\add*. Then their \add bodies\add* could be taken down \add and buried\add* \f + \ft Or:someone could take down their bodies \add and bury them\add* \f*.
\v 32 So, \add after Pilate agreed\add*, the soldiers went and broke the legs of the first man whom they had nailed on a cross near Jesus. Then they broke the legs of the second man.
\v 33 But when they came to Jesus, they saw that he was dead already. So they did not break his legs.

\v 31 This was the day of preparation for the Passover and the next day was a Sabbath. It was against the law to allow dead bodies to remain on the crosses on the Sabbath, so they went to Pilate and asked him to break the legs of the three men so that the men would die quickly and their bodies would be taken down.
\v 32 So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and then of the other, the two men who had been crucified with Jesus.
\v 33 When they came to Jesus, they saw he was dead already. So they did not break his legs.

\p
\v 31 It was the Preparation, and in order that the bodies should not remain on the cross during the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was an important day), the Jews asked Pilate that the legs of the executed men be broken, and that their bodies might be taken down.
\v 32 Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and of the second man who had been crucified with Jesus.
\v 33 When they came to Jesus, they saw that he was already dead, so they did not break his legs.
