\v 31 That was the day that they prepared \add everything for their\add* \add Sabbath\f + \ft Or: day of rest\add* \f*. The next day was a special day of rest, \add because it was the day of rest during the Passover celebration\add*. The Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* did not want the bodies \add of the three men\add* to remain on the cross during their Sabbath\f + \ft Or: day of rest \f* \add because leaving bodies hanging overnight would be contrary to their Jewish laws\add*. So they went to Pilate and asked him \add to command that\add* the legs \add of the three men on the crosses\add* be broken \f + \ft Or:the \add soldiers\add* to break the legs \add of the three men on the crosses\add* \f*, \add so that they would die quickly\add*. Then their \add bodies\add* could be taken down \add and buried\add* \f + \ft Or:someone could take down their bodies \add and bury them\add* \f*.
\v 32 So, \add after Pilate agreed\add*, the soldiers went and broke the legs of the first man whom they had nailed on a cross near Jesus. Then they broke the legs of the second man.
\v 33 But when they came to Jesus, they saw that he was dead already. So they did not break his legs.

\v 31 The Jews therefore, because it was the Preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the cross upon the sabbath (for
the day of that sabbath was a high day), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and
that they might be taken away.
\v 32 The soldiers therefore came, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with him:
\v 33 but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:
