\v 25 The soldiers did those things.
\p Jesus' mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene were all standing near his cross.
\v 26 When Jesus saw his mother standing there and John, the disciple whom he especially loved, standing nearby, he said to his mother, "Mother, here is the one who will act like a son to you."
\v 27 And he said to the disciple, "Here is your mother!" So from that very moment, that disciple took her to live in his home.
