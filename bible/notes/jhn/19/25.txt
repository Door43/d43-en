\v 25 The soldiers did these things. But Jesus’ mother, his mother’s
sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene—these women were standing by the cross of Jesus.
\v 26 When Jesus saw his mother standing by, and the disciple whom he loved, he said to his mother, “Woman, see, here is your son!”

home.
