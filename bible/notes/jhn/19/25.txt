\v 25 These things therefore the soldiers did. But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s
sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
\v 26 When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by whom he loved, he says to his mother, Woman, behold,
your son!
\v 27 Then says he to the disciple, Behold, your mother! And from that hour the disciple took her to his own
home.
