\v 5 So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, "Look, here is the man!"
\v 6 When the chief priests and temple guards saw him, they shouted, "Crucify him! Crucify him!" Pilate said to them, "Take him yourselves and crucify him! As for me, I find no reason to punish him."

\v 4 Then Pilate went out again and said to the people, “See, I am bringing the man out to you so that you may know that I find no guilt in him.”
\v 5 Jesus therefore came out; he was wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. Then Pilate said to them, “See, here is the man!”
\v 6 When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw Jesus, they cried out and said, “Crucify him, crucify him!” Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves and crucify him, for I find no crime in him.”
