===== Translation Notes: =====
  * **Hail, King of the Jews**  - The greeting "Hail" with a raised hand was only used for Caesar. While the soldiers use the "crown of thorns" and the "purple robe" to mock Jesus, they do not recognize that he is indeed a king. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony|Irony]])
