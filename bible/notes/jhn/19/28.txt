\v 28 A little later, Jesus knew that everything that God sent him to do had now been done, and in order to make come true one final thing that the Scriptures had foretold, he said, "I am thirsty!"
\v 29 A jar of sour wine stood there, so they took a short branch from a hyssop plant and put a sponge on it, and they dipped in the sour wine and held it up to Jesus' mouth.
\v 30 After Jesus drank the sour wine, he said, "It is finished," and he bowed his head and died.

\v 28 After this Jesus, because he knew that all things are now finished, in order to make the Scriptures come true, said, “I am thirsty.”
\v 29 A container full of sour wine had been place there, so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop staff and lifted it up to his mouth.
\v 30 When Jesus had taken the vinegar, he said, “It is finished.” He bowed his head and gave up his spirit.
