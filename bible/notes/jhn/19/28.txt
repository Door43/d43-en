\v 28 A little later, Jesus knew that everything that God sent him to do had now been done, and in order to make come true one final thing that the scriptures had foretold, he said, "I am thirsty!"
\v 29 A jar of sour wine stood there, so they took a short branch from a hyssop plant and put a sponge on it, and they dipped in the sour wine and held it up to Jesus' mouth.
\v 30 After Jesus drank the sour wine, he said, "It is finished," and he bowed his head and died.

\v 28 After this Jesus, because he knew that everything was now completed, in order to complete the scriptures, said, "I am thirsty."
\v 29 A container full of sour wine was placed there, so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop staff and lifted it up to his mouth.
\v 30 When Jesus had taken the sour wine, he said, "It is finished." He bowed his head and gave up his spirit.
