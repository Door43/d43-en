====== John 19 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 19:24, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "Purple garment" ==
The color purpose was a sign of royalty in the ancient Near East. He was mockingly dressed to look like a king.

== "You are not Caesar’s friend" ==
Pilate did not want to sentence Jesus to death, but the Jews forced him. They did this make making it seem that allowing Jesus to live would betray the Roman government.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Sarcasm ==
The following phrases are intended to be taken sarcastically: "Hail, King of the Jews," "Should I crucify your king?" and "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews." This is sarcasm, which is the use of [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]] to insult someone. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Gabbatha, Golgotha ==
This is a phrase in Hebrew. John does not “translate” this phrase into Greek but chooses to “transliterate” or transfer it into Greek using Greek letters instead of Hebrew letters. The translators of the ULB and UDB have not translated this phrase either. The translator should try to form the sounds of this phrase without translating its meaning.
