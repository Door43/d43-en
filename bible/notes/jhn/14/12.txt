\v 12 I am telling you the truth: whoever trusts in me will also do the things that I do. He will do even greater works because I am going to be with the Father.
\v 13 Whatever you ask in my name, that I will do. I will do this in order that everyone might honor the Father and that they might know the Father  because of everything that I, his Son, do.
\v 14 If you ask the Father for anything because you belong to me, I will do it.

\v 12 Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes on me, the works that I do, he will do these works also; and he will do even greater works because I am going to the Father.
\v 13 Whatever you ask in my name, I will do it so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **believes on** - This means to “believe in Jesus,” that is, to believe that he is the Son of God, to trust him as Savior, and live in a way that honors him.
  * **I am going to the Father. Whatever you ask in my name, I will do it so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.** - Jesus returned to God the Father after the resurrection when he ascended back into heaven. But, Jesus is still with his followers because he answers prayer so that his Father is glorified in him, the Son of God.
