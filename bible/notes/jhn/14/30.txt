\v 31 Instead, the people who do not belong to God \f + \ft metonymy \f* must learn \add from what happens to me\add* that I love \add my\add* Father, and I am doing the things that he has commanded me to do. Now, let's get up and leave here."

<usfm>
\v 30 I will not be able to talk with you much longer because the ruler of this world is coming. However, he has no power over me,
\v 31 and I will do what the Father has commanded me to do. This is so that the world will know forever that I love the Father. Come, let us go from here."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 30 I will no longer speak much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me,
\v 31 but in order that the world will know that I love the Father, I do just as the Father commanded me. Let us get up and go from here."
