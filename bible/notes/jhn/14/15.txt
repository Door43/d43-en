\v 17 \add I am talking about\add* the Spirit, who \add will teach you God's\add* truth. He will be with you forever.

\v 15 "If you love me, you will live as I have taught you.
\v 16 Then I will ask the Father for him to give you another gift, and he will send you another Helper, one who will come alongside you to be with you forever.
\v 17 He is the Spirit who tells the truth about God. The unbelieving people in this world will never welcome Him. The world cannot see him or know him. You know him because he lives with you and he will be joined to you.
