\v 25 I have said these things to you while I am still with you.
\v 26 The Helper, the one who comes alongside to be with youâ€”my Father will send him in my name. He will teach you everything that you need to know. He will also cause you to remember all the things that I have told you.
\v 27 As I leave you with peace, it is my peace that I am giving to you. I give you a kind of peace no one and nothing that belongs to this world can give you.. So do not be upset or anxious; and do not be afraid.

\v 25 I have said these things to you, while I am still living among you.
\v 26 However, the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name,  will teach you all things and  will bring to your remembrance all that I said to you.
\v 27 Peace I leave with you; I give my peace to you. I do not give it as the world gives. Do not let your heart be troubled, and do not let it be fearful.
