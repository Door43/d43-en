\v 23 Jesus replied to him, "This is how you can tell whether people love me: whether they do what I have told you to do. Any people like this, my Father will love them. He and I will come to them and live with them.
\v 24 As for those who do not love me, they will not obey what I have told them to do. The things I have told you are not things that I have decided to say on my own; instead, they are things that my Father has sent me to tell you.
