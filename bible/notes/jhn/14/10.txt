\v 10 Do you not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* believe that I have a close relationship with \add my\add* Father, and that \add my\add* Father has a close relationship with me? The messages that I tell you do not come from me. They come from my Father, who has a close relationship with me. He is enabling me to \add teach these things, and\add* to work the miracles that he \add wants me to do\add*.
\v 11 Believe that I have a close relationship with \add my\add* Father and that \add my\add* Father has a close relationship with me. If you do not believe that just because of what I say, believe it because of the miracles themselves \add that I have done\add*.

\v 10 Do you not  believe that I am joined to my Father, and that my Father is joined to me? The things I have told you—I did not think of these things; rather, it is my Father who has sent me to tell you all of these things, for my Father is joined to me and works through me.
\v 11 Trust me, because I have told you that I am joined to the Father and that the Father is joined to me, or else trust me because of all the signs and mighty acts you have see me do.
