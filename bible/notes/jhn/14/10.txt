\v 10 Do you not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* believe that I have a close relationship with \add my\add* Father, and that \add my\add* Father has a close relationship with me? The messages that I tell you do not come from me. They come from my Father, who has a close relationship with me. He is enabling me to \add teach these things, and\add* to work the miracles that he \add wants me to do\add*.
\v 11 Believe that I have a close relationship with \add my\add* Father and that \add my\add* Father has a close relationship with me. If you do not believe that just because of what I say, believe it because of the miracles themselves \add that I have done\add*.

\v 10 Do you not believe that I am joined to my Father and that my Father is joined to me? The things I have told youâ€”I did not think of these things; rather, it is my Father who has sent me to tell you all of these things, for my Father is joined to me and works through me.
\v 11 Trust me because I have told you that I am joined to the Father and that the Father is joined to me, or else trust me because of all the signs and mighty acts you have seen me do.

\v 10 Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me? The words that I am speaking to you I speak not of my own accord; instead, it is the Father living in me who is doing his work.
\v 11 Believe me, that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me; or else believe me because of my very works.
