===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **he went down** - This means that they traveled from a higher place to a lower place. Cana is southwest of Capernaum, but is at a higher elevation. 
    * **his brothers** - This word is inclusive of brothers and sisters. All Jesus' brothers and sisters were younger than he was.
