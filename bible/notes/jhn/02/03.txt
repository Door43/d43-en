  * **Woman** - This refers to Mary. If a son calling his mother "woman" would be considered impolite, use another word that is polite and formal.
  * **what does that have to do with me?** - "this has nothing to do with me." or "do not tell me what to do." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **has not yet come** - "is not yet here"
