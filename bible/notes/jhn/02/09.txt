\v 9 The director of the feast tasted the water which had now become wine. He did not know where the wine had come from, although the servants knew. So he called the bridegroom to himself.
\v 10 "Everyone serves the best wine first, and later when the guests have drunk a lot and the best is gone, then they serve the cheap wine. But you have kept the best wine until now."

\v 9 The head waiter tasted the water that had become wine, but he did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew). Then he called the bridegroom
\v 10 and said to him, "Every man places first the good wine and then the cheaper wine when men are drunk.  But you have kept the fine wine until now."
