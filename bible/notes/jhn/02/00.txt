====== John 02 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

It may be significant to the structure of this book that the turning of water into wine was the first miracle Jesus performed. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Wine ==
It was customary for wine to be used during times of celebrate. It was not considered immoral to drink wine.

== Driving out the money changers ==
This is the first account of Jesus driving the money changers out of the Temple. This event showed the authority Jesus had over the Temple and over all of Israel. 

== "He knew what was in them" ==
John knows that this type of knowledge would only be possible if Jesus was God ([[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]).

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "His disciples remembered" ==
This phrase is used as an editorial commentary on the events that occur in this chapter. These comments are not known at the time when the events occur, but are already know when the book is written. Translators may choose to use parenthesis to set apart the author's explanation or commentary on past events.
