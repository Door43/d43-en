\v 20 So the Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* said, "We have been building this Temple for forty-six years \add and it is not finished yet\add*! So there is no way you will build it within three days!\f + \ft Or: how will you build it within three days? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*"
\v 21 But when Jesus said that about the temple, \add he was really talking about\add* his own body.
\v 22 \add Later\add*, after Jesus had \add died and had\add* become alive again, \add we\add* his disciples remembered the words he had said. As a result, we believed \add what had been prophesied in\add* the Scriptures \add about the Messiah becoming alive again\add*, and we believed that what Jesus said \add was true\add*.

\v 20 "Are you saying that you are you going to rebuild this entire temple is just three days?" they asked him. "It took forty-six years to build this temple."
\v 21 However, the temple Jesus was speaking about was his own body, not the temple building.
\v 22 Later, after Jesus had died and God had raised him from the dead, his disciples remembered what he had said about the temple. They believed both what the scriptures said and what Jesus himself had said.

\v 20 Then the Jewish authorities said, "It took forty-six years to build this temple, and you will raise it up in three days?"
\v 21 However, he spoke of the temple of his body.
\v 22 So then afterwards when he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this, and they believed the scripture and this statement that Jesus had spoken.
