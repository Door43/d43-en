\v 23 While Jesus was in Jerusalem at the Passover celebration, many people came to believe \add that he was the Messiah\add* because they saw the miracles he was performing.
\v 24 But he did not let them tell him what he should do \add as the Messiah\add*, because he knew within himself what they were all \add thinking\add*.
\v 25 He did not need anyone to tell him what others were thinking, because he already knew what they were \add thinking and wanting\add*.

\v 23 When Jesus was in Jerusalem during the Passover Festival, many people trusted in him because they saw the miracles that signified truth about Jesus.
\v 24 Nevertheless, Jesus knew what people were like, and because he knew them so well, he did not trust them.
\v 25 He did not need anyone to tell him what kind of people they were. He knew everything about them.

\v 23 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in his name, seeing the miraculous signs that he did.
\v 24 Nevertheless, Jesus would not trust himself to them because he knew all people
\v 25 and because he did not need anyone to testify concerning mankind. He himself knew what was in mankind.
