\v 23 When Jesus was in Jerusalem during the Passover celebration, many people came to trust in him because they saw the mighty works of power that he performed.
\v 24 But Jesus knew what people were like, what they were thinking, and what they could do. And because he knew them so well he did not trust them.
\v 25 He did not need anyone to tell him what kind of people they were. He already knew every secret deep within them.

\v 23 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed on his name, seeing his miraculous signs which he did.
\v 24 But Jesus would not trust himself to them, because he knew all people,
\v 25 and because he did not need that any one should testify concerning man, for he himself knew what was in man.
