<usfm>
\v 23 While Jesus was in Jerusalem at the Passover celebration, many people came to believe \add that he was the Messiah\add* because they saw the miracles he was performing.
\v 24 But he did not let them tell him what he should do \add as the Messiah\add*, because he knew within himself what they were all \add thinking\add*.
\v 25 He did not need anyone to tell him what others were thinking, because he already knew what they were \add thinking and wanting\add*.

<usfm>
\v 23 When Jesus was in Jerusalem during the Passover Festival, many people trusted in him because they saw the miracles that signified truth about Jesus.
\v 24 Nevertheless, Jesus knew what people were like, and because he knew them so well, he did not trust them.
\v 25 He did not need anyone to tell him how evil people were. He knew everything about them.

\p
\v 23 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover festival, many believed in his name when they saw the signs that he did.
\v 24 But Jesus did not trust in them because he knew them all,
\v 25 because he did not need anyone to testify to him about man, for he knew what was in man.

  * **Now when he was in Jerusalem** - The word "now" introduces us to a new event in the story.
  * **believed in his name** - Here "name" is a metonym that represents the person of Jesus. AT: "believed in him" or "trusted in him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the signs that he did** - Miracles can also be called "signs" because they are used as evidence that God is the all-powerful one who has complete authority over the universe.
