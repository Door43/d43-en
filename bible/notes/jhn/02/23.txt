\v 23 When Jesus was in Jerusalem during the Passover Festival, many people trusted in him because they saw the miracles that signified truth about Jesus.
\v 24 But Jesus knew what people were like. And because he knew them so well he did not trust them.
\v 25 He did not need anyone to tell him what kind of people they were. He knew everything about them.

\v 23 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in his name, seeing his miraculous signs that he did.
\v 24 But Jesus would not trust himself to them, because he knew all people,
\v 25 and because he did not need anyone to testify concerning mankind, for he himself knew what was in mankind.
