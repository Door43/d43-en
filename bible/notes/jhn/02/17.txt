===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **your house** - This term refers to the temple, God's house.
  * **consume** - This means "completely take over." (See:  [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **sign** - This refers to a "sign" that proves something is true.
  * **these things** - This refers to Jesus's actions against the money changers in the temple.
  * **Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up** - Jesus is referring to his own body as the temple that will die and come back to life three days later. But, it is important to translate this with words normally used to describe tearing down and rebuilding a building.
  * **raise it up** - This means to "rebuild" or "restore".
  * **Destroy this temple, and in three days** - Jesus is not commanding the people to go and tear down the temple. If this is confusing in your language you could translate it as "If you destroy this temple, in three days"
