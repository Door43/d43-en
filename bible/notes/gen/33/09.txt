\v 9 Esau said, "I have enough, my brother. Keep what you have for yourself."
\v 10 Jacob said, "No, please, if I have found favor in your sight, then accept my gift from my hand, for indeed, I have seen your face, and it is like seeing the face of God, and you have accepted me.
\v 11 Please accept my gift that was brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough." Thus Jacob urged him, and Esau accepted it.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I have enough** - This can be made more explicit: "I have enough property." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]).
  * **if I have found favor in your sight** - "if you are pleased with me." Alternate translation: "since you are pleased with me."
  * **my gift from my hand**  - "this gift that I am giving to you"
  * **for indeed** - This can be translated as a new sentence: "For certainly"
  * **I have seen your face, and it is like seeing the face of God** -  Jacob compares Esau's face to God's face. The meaning of this is unclear. Possible meanings are 1) Jacob is happy that Esau has forgiven him like God has forgiven him or 2) Jacob is amazed to see his brothers again like he was amazed to see God or 3) Jacob is humbled to be in Esau's presence like he was humbled to be in God's presence. 
  * **God has dealt graciously with me**  - "God has treated me very well" or "God has blessed me very much"
  * **Thus Jacob urged him, and Esau accepted it** - It was customary to refuse a gift first, but then to accept the gift before the giver was offended.
