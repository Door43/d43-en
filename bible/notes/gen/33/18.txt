\v 18 Some time later, Jacob and his family left Paddan-Aram in Mesopotamia, and they traveled safely to Canaan land. There they set up their tents in a field near Shechem city.
\v 19 One of the leaders of the people in that area was named Hamor. Hamor had several sons. Jacob paid the sons of Hamor a hundred pieces of silver for the piece of ground on which they set up their tents.
