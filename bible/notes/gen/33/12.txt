\v 12 Then Esau said, "Let us be on our way. I will go before you."
\v 13 Jacob said to him, "My master knows that the children are young, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young. If they overdrive them even one day, all the flocks will die.
\v 14 May my master go ahead of his servant.  I will travel more slowly, at the pace of the livestock that are before me, and at the pace of the children, until I come to my master in Seir."
