===== translationNotes: =====

  * **behold** - The word "behold" here alerts us to pay attention to a surprising new part of the story.
  * **four hundred men** - "400 men" (See [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **Jacob divided the children ... female servants** - This does not mean Jacob divided the children evenly so that each woman had the same amount of children with her. Jacob divided the children so that each one went with his or her mother. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) 
  * **female servants** - "servant wives." This refers to Bilhah and Zilpah.
  * **He himself went on ahead of them** - Here "himself" emphasizes that Jacob went alone in front of the others. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_rpronouns]])
  * **He bowed** - Here the word "bow" means to bend over to humbly express respect and honor toward someone. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
