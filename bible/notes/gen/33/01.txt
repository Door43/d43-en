  * **female servants**  - "servant wives" or "secondary wives."
  * **four hundred men**  - This large group of men is a threat and Jacob is in great fear for his family. You can make this clearer by translating: "four hundred fighting men" or "four hundred warriors."
  * **Then… in front, followed…, and followed… last of all.**  - The groups are in order of status from least important to most, so that the most important are also the most protected.
  * **bold words**  - explanation
