  * **female servants **- "servant wives." This refers to Bilhah and Zilpah.
  * **What do you mean by all these groups that I met?**  - The phrase "all these groups" refers to the groups of servants that Jacob sent to give gifts to Esau. "Why did you send all of those different groups to meet me?" 
  * **To find favor in the sight of my master**  - The phrase "my master" is a polite way of referring to Esau. Alternate translation: "So that you would be pleased with me." (See [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
