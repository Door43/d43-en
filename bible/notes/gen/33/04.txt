===== Translation Notes: =====
    * **meet him** - "meet Jacob"
    * **embraced him, hugged his neck, and kissed him**  - This could be translated as a new sentence. "Esau put his arms around Jacob, hugged him, and kissed him."
    * **they wept** - This can be translated more explicitly as "Then Esau and Jacob cried because they were happy to see each other again." (See [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]).
    * **he saw the women and the children**  - "he saw women and children that were with Jacob"
    * **The children whom God has graciously given your servant** - The phrase "your servant" is a polite way for Jacob to refer to himself. Alternate translation: "these are the children God has kindly given me." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]]).
