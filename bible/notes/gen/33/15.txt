\v 15 Esau said, "Let me leave with you some of my men who are with me."  But Jacob said, "Why do that? My master has already been kind enough to me."
\v 16 So Esau that day started on his way back to Seir.
\v 17 Jacob traveled to Succoth, built himself a house, and made shelters for his livestock.  Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Why do that?** - Jacob uses a question to emphasize that Esau does not need to leave men. Alternate translation: "Don't do that" or "You don't need to do that." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **My master** - This is a polite and formal way of referring to Esau. Ir can also be translated as "You" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]]).
  * **Succoth** - Translators may also add a footnote that says, "The name Succoth means 'shelters.'" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **for his livestock** - "for the animals he looked after"
