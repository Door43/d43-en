\v 15 Esau said, "Let me leave with you some of my men who are with me." But Jacob said, "Why do that? My master has already been kind enough to me."
\v 16 So Esau that day started on his way back to Seir.
\v 17 Jacob traveled to Succoth, built himself a house, and made shelters for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.
