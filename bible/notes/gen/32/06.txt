\v 7 Jacob was very afraid and worried. So he divided the people who were with him into two groups. He also divided the sheep and goats, the cattle, and the camels, into two groups.
\v 8 He was thinking, "If Esau and his men come and attack us, perhaps one of the groups will be left and will be able to escape."
