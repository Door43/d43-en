===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **rescue me** - "save me"
  * **from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau** - Here the word "hand" refers to power. The two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second clarifies that the brother whom Jacob intended was Esau. AT: "from the power of my brother, Esau" or "from my brother, Esau" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] or [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I am afraid of him, that he will**  - "I am afraid that he will"
  * **make you prosper **- "do good to you" or "treat you well."
  * **I will make your descendants like the sand of the sea** - God compared Jacob's descendants to the grains of sand around the sea. This emphasizes the large number of descendants that God will give Jacob. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **which cannot be numbered for their number**  - "which you cannot count because of their number"
