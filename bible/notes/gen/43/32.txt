\v 32 The people of Egypt considered that it was disgraceful for them to eat with Hebrews, so the servants served food to Joseph by himself, and served the other people of Egypt who ate with him by themselves, and they served Joseph's older brothers and younger brother by themselves.
\v 33 His brothers were astonished to see that their seats were arranged according to their ages, from the youngest to the oldest!
\v 34 And when their portions of food were served to them from Joseph's table, Benjamin's portion was five times as much as anyone else's portion! So they ate food and drank wine with Joseph until they became very cheerful.

\v 32 The servants served Joseph by himself and the brothers by themselves. The Egyptians there ate with him by themselves because the Egyptians could not eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is detestable to the Egyptians.
\v 33 The brothers sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth. The men were astonished together.
\v 34 Joseph sent portions to them from the food in front of him. But Benjamin’s portion was five times as much as any of his brothers. They drank and were merry with him.
