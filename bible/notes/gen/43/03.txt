===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Judah told him** - "Judah told his father Jacob"
  * **solemnly warned us** - "was very serious when he warned us saying"
  * **your brother is with you** - Judah is referring to Benjamin, Rachel's last born before she died.
  * **You will not see my face** - Judah uses this phrase twice in 43:3-5 to emphasize to his father that they cannot return to Egypt without Benjamin. The phrase "my face" refers to the man, who is Joseph. Alternate translation: "You will not see me." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  *  **For the man** - "for the man in command of all the food sales"
