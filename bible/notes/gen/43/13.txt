\v 13 Take your younger brother and go back to that man.
\v 14 I will pray that God Almighty will cause that man to act mercifully toward you, so that he will let your other brother, as well as Benjamin, come back here with you. But as for me, if my sons are taken from me, then I will not have my sons!"
\p
\v 15 So the men took the gifts that Jacob said that they should take, and twice the amount of money that the grain would cost, and they also took Benjamin. They went down quickly to Egypt, and they stood in front of Joseph.

\v 13 Take also your brother. Rise and go again to the man.
\v 14 May God Almighty give you mercy before the man, so that he may release to you your other brother and Benjamin. If I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved."
\v 15 The men took that gift. They took double money in their hand and Benjamin. They rose, went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
