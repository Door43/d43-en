  * **creeping thing of the ground**  - This refers to small animals that move on the ground (UDB).
  * **two of every sort**  - This refers to two of every kind of bird and animal.
  * **you**  - The word "you" here is singular and refers to Noah. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you|Forms of 'You']])
  * **food that is eaten**  - This can be translated as "food that people and animals eat."
  * **So Noah did this. According to all that God commanded him, so he did.** - These two sentences mean the same thing. The second sentence explains the first and emphasizes that Noah obeyed God.
