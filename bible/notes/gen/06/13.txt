  * **I will destroy them with the earth** - "I will destroy both them and the earth" or "I will destroy them when I destroy the earth"
  * **an ark** - This refers to a very large box that would be able to float on water even in a very bad storm. "a large boat" or "a ship" or "a barge" 
  * **cypress wood** - People do not know exactly what kind of tree this was. "wood used for building boats" or "good wood"

  * **pitch** - This is a thick, sticky or oily liquid that people put on the outside of a boat to stop water from going through gaps in the wood into the boat.
