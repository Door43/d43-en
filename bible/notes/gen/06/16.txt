===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **a roof for the ark**  - This was probably a peaked or slanted roof. Its purpose was to protect everything in the ark from the rain.
  * **cubit** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:06:13|6:15]].
  * **a lower, a second, and a third deck**  - This can be translated as "a lower deck, a middle deck, and an upper deck" or "three decks inside" (UDB) or "three levels."
  * **deck**  - This can be translated as "floor" or "story" or "level" or "room."
  * **Listen**  - This can be translated as "Pay attention" or "Listen to what I am saying." God said this in order to emphasize that he would do what he was about to say.
  * **all flesh that has in it the breath of life**  - "everything that lives" (UDB). The phrase "that has in it the breath of life" is a figurative way of saying "that lives." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
