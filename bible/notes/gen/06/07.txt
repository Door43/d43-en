===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I will wipe away mankind â€¦ from the surface of the earth**  - This can be translated as "I will destroy mankind whom I created so that there will not be any people on the earth."
  * **mankind whom I have created**  - God created all mankind. The phrase "whom I have created" tells some more information about all of mankind. Some languages would need to make this relative clause a separate sentence. (See the section on clauses in [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_sentences#clause|Sentences]].) This sentence could be translated as two sentences: "I created mankind. I will wipe them away from the surface of the ground."
  * **wipe away**  - This could be translated "totally destroy" or "make it not exist." This verb pictures God as thoroughly cleaning the earth by wiping away wicked mankind.
  * **Noah found favor in the eyes of Yahweh** - This can be translated as "Yahweh looked favorably on Noah" or "Yahweh was pleased with Noah" (UDB).
  * **in the eyes of Yahweh**  - Yahweh sees and knows what people do. AT: "in Yahweh's sight" or "in Yahweh's thoughts". (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
