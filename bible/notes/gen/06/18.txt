  * **but I will establish my covenant with you**  - This covenant was a promise that God made to Noah. God would fulfill the covenant. He did not require Noah to do anything as part of the covenant.
  * **with you**  - The word "you" is singular. God was making his covenant with Noah. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **Of every living creature of all flesh, two of every kind you must bring into the ark**  - "You must bring into the ark two of every kind of very living creature"
