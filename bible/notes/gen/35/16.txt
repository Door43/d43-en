\v 16 Jacob and his family left Bethel and traveled south toward Ephrath town. When they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel began to have severe childbirth pains.
\v 17 When her pain was the most severe, the midwife\f + \ft Or: woman who helped her to give birth \f* said to Rachel, "Do not be afraid, because now you have given birth to another son!"
\v 18 But she was dying, and with her last breath she said, "Name him Benoni," which means 'son of my sorrow,' but his father named him Benjamin, which means 'son of my right hand.'
\p
\v 19 After Rachel died, she was buried alongside the road to Ephrath, which is now called Bethlehem.
\v 20 Jacob set up a large stone over her grave, and it is still there, showing where Rachel's grave is.

\v 16 They journeyed on from Bethel.  While they was still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel went into labor. She had hard labor.
\v 17 While she was in hardest labor, the midwife said to her, "Do not be afraid, for now you will have another son."
\v 18 As she was dying, with her dying breath she named him Benoni, but his father called him Benjamin.
\v 19 Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).
\v 20 Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave. It is the marker of Rachel's grave to this day.
