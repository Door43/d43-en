\v 17 When her pain was the most severe, the midwife\f + \ft Or: woman who helped her to give birth \f* said to Rachel, "Do not be afraid, because now you have given birth to another son!"
\v 18 But she was dying, and with her last breath she said, "Name him Benoni," which means 'son of my sorrow,' but his father named him Benjamin, which means 'son of my right hand.'
\p
\v 19 After Rachel died, she was buried alongside the road to Ephrath, which is now called Bethlehem.

\v 16 They journeyed on from Bethel. While they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel went into labor. She had hard labor.
\v 17 While she was in hardest labor, the midwife said to her, "Do not be afraid, for now you will have another son."
\v 18 As she was dying, with her dying breath she named him Ben-Oni, but his father called him Benjamin.
\v 19 Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).
\v 20 Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave. It is the marker of Rachel's grave to this day.
