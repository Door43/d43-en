\v 1 Some time later, God said to Jacob, "Go up to Bethel, and live there. Build an altar to worship me, God, who appeared to you when you were fleeing from your older brother Esau."
\v 2 So Jacob said to his household and to all the others who were with him, "Get rid of the idols you brought from Mesopotamia. Also, bathe yourselves and put on clean clothes.
\v 3 Then we will get ready and go up to Bethel. There I will make an altar to worship God. He is the one who helped me at the time when I was greatly distressed and afraid, and he has been with me wherever I have gone."
