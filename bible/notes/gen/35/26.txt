===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Zilpah** - See how you translated this name in [[en:bible:notes:gen:29:23|29:24]].
  * **who were born to him in Paddan Aram** - It is implied that this does not include Benjamin who was born in the land of Canaan near Bethlehem. It only mentions Paddan Aram since that is where most of them were born. AT: "who were born to him in Paddan Aram, except Benjamin who was born in the land of Canaan" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Mamre** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:gen:13:16|13:18]].
