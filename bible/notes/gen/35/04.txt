===== translationNotes: =====

  * **So they gave** - "so everyone in Jacob's household gave" or "so all of his family and servants gave"
  * **that were in their hand** - Here "in their hand" stands for what they own. AT: "that were in their possession" or "that they had" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the rings that were in their ears** - "their earrings" (UDB). Possible meanings are 1) the gold in the earrings could have been used to make more idols or 2) they took these earrings from the city of Shechem after they attacked it and killed all the people. The earrings would have reminded them of their sin.
  * **God made panic to fall on the cities** - God causing the people of the cities to be afraid of Jacob and his family is spoken of as if panic were an object that fell on the cities. The abstract noun "panic" can be stated as "afraid." AT: "God made the people in the surrounding cities afraid of Jacob and those with him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **on the cities** - Here "cities" stands for the people who live in the cities. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the sons of Jacob** - It is implied that no one attacked anyone in Jacob's family. But two of the sons, Simeon and Levi had attacked the Canaanites relatives of Shechem after he seized and slept with Jacob's daughter. Jacob was afraid they would seek revenge in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:34:30|34:30]]. The full meaning of this may be made explicit. AT: "Jacob's family" or "Jacob's household" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
