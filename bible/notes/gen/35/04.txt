  * **So they gave**  - "So everyone in Jacob's household" or "So all of his family and servants gave"
  * **that were in their hand**  - "that were in their possession" or "that they had"
  * **the rings that were in their ears**  - "their earrings." (UDB) Possible meanings are 1) the gold in the earrings could have been used to make more idols or 2) they took these earrings from the city of Shechem after they attacked it and killed all the people. The earrings would have reminded them of their sin.
  * **God made panic to fall on the cities** - The people were afraid of Jacob, but God was the one who caused the people to fear Jacob.
  * **the sons of Jacob**  - It is implied that no one attacked anyone in Jacob's family. But two of the sons, Simeon and Levi had attacked the Canaanites relatives of Shechem after he raped Jacob's daughter. Jacob was afraid they would seek revenge in [[en:bible:notes:gen:34:30|34:30]].
