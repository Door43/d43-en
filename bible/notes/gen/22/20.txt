===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **It came about after these things**  - This can be translated as "After these events." The phrase "these things" refers to the events of Genesis 22:1-19. 
  * **Abraham was told** - "it was told to Abraham" or "someone told Abraham" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:translate:active]])
  * **Milcah has borne children, as well** - "Milcah has also borne children"
  * **Milcah** - This is the name of a woman. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:translatenames]])
  * **They were Uz his first-born, Buz his brother**  - This can be translated as "The name of his first born was Uz, and the names of the rest of his children were Buz his brother,"
  * **Uz…Buz…Kemuel…Aram…Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel**  - These are all names of men. Translate this so that it is clear that all of these except Aram are the sons of Nahor and Milcah.
