===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The angel of Yahweh**  - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:22:11|22:11]].
  * **and said—this is an oracle of Yahweh**  - This is a formal way of saying that the words that follow come directly from Yahweh. It can also be translated as "and said—these are the words of Yahweh" or "and declared these words of Yahweh."
  * **By myself I have sworn**  - This can also be translated as "I have sworn and I am my witness." Yahweh said "by myself" to assure Abraham that he would do what he swore to do.
  * **you have done this thing**  - This can be translated as "you obeyed me"
  * **have not withheld**  - "have not kept back"
  * **your son, your only son**  - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:22:01|22:2]].
  * **surely bless**  - "certainly bless"
  * **I will greatly multiply your descendants**  - "I will cause your descendants to increase again and again" or "I will cause your descendants to be very many"
  * **as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore**  - God compared Abraham's descendants to the stars and the sand. Just as people cannot count the huge number of stars or the grains of sand, so there would be so many of Abraham's descendants that people would not be able to count them. This could also be translated as "beyond what you can count." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:simile]])
  * **will possess the gate of their enemies**  - This means "will triumph over their enemies." Armies would break through the gate of their enemies' cities and conquer them. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
