\v 1 Several years later, God tested Abraham \add to find out\add* whether Abraham \add really trusted in him and would obey him\add*. He called out to Abraham, and Abraham replied, "I'm here."
\v 2 God said, "Your son, Isaac, whom you love very much, is the only son \add who is still here with you\add*. But take him and go together to the Moriah region. Offer him as a sacrifice like a burnt offering, on a hill that I will show you."
\v 3 So Abraham got up early the next morning, put a saddle on his donkey, and took with him two of his servants along with his son, Isaac. He also chopped some wood to kindle a fire for a burnt offering. Then they started traveling to the place God told him about.

\v 1 It came about after these things that God tested Abraham. He said to him, "Abraham!" Abraham said, "Here I am."
\v 2 Then God said, "Take your son, your only son, whom you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah. Offer him there as a burnt offering upon one of the mountains there, which I will tell you about."
\v 3 So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, along with Isaac his son. He cut the wood for the burnt offering, then set out on his journey to the place that God had told him about.
