===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **After Noah had lived**  - This can also be translated as "When Noah lived."
  * **he became the father of**  - "he had his sons." This does not tell us whether the sons were born on the same day or in different years.
  * **Shem, Ham, and Japheth**  - These sons are not listed in the order of their birth. Ham was the youngest son. Avoid translating this in a way that imply that the list is in the order of their ages.
