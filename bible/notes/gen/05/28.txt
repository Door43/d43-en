\v 28 When Lamech was 182 years old, he became the father of a son,
\v 29 whom he named Noah, which sounds like the Hebrew word that means 'relief,' because he said, "He will bring us relief from all the hard work we have been doing to produce food from the ground that Yahweh cursed."

===== Translation Notes: =====

 
  * **became the father of a son**  - "had a son"
  * **Noah**  - Translators may want to add a footnote that says "This name sounds like the Hebrew word that means 'rest.'" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]).
  * **from our work and from the toil of our hands** - Lamech says the same thing twice to emphasize how hard the work was. AT: "from working so hard with our hands" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
