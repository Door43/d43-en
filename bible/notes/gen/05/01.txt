  * **the book of the generations of Adam**  - This could be translated as "the written record of of Adam's descendants."
  * **the likeness of God**  - "to be like God." This verse does not tell how God made people to be like himself. Since God does not have a body, it probably does not refer to physical likeness.
  * **named them Man**  - "called them 'humans'" or "called them 'people'." The word "Man" is the same as "Adam" in verse 1.
