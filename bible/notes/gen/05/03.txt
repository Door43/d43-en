===== translationNotes: =====

  * **130 ... eight hundred** - Translators may write the numerals "130" and "800" or the words "one hundred thirty" and "eight hundred." (The ULB and the UDB use numerals if the number has three or more words; they use words if a number has only one or two words.) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **he became the father of a son** - "he had a son"
  * **in his own likeness, after his image** - These two phrases mean the same thing. They are used as a reminder that God made man in his own image. See how you translated similar phrases in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:26|1:26]].
  * **Seth** - Translate this name as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:04:25|4:25]].
  * **He became the father of more sons and daughters** - "He had more sons and daughters"
  * **and then he died** - This phrase will be repeated throughout the chapter. Use the ordinary word for "died."
  * **Adam lived 930 years** - People used to live a very long time. Use your ordinary word for "years." AT: "Adam lived a total of 930 years" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
