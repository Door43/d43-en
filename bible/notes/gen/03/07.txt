===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The eyes of both of them were opened** - This can be translated as "Then their eyes opened" or "They became aware" or "They understood." See how you translated "your eyes will be opened" in [[en:bible:notes:gen:03:04|3:5]].
  * **sewed**  - "fastened" or "joined"
  * **fig leaves**  - If people do not know what fig leaves are like, this can be translated as "large leaves from a fig tree" or simply "large leaves."
  * **and made coverings for themselves**  - This can be translated as "and clothed themselves with them." They did this because they were ashamed. This implicit information can be made explicit if needed as in the UDB. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **in the cool of the day** - This could be translated "at the time of day when a cool breeze blows."
  * **from the presence of Yahweh God** - This could be translated as "from Yahweh God's sight" or "so that Yahweh God would see them" (UDB) or as "from the the Lord God."
