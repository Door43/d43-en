===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **more shrewd**  - AT: "more cunning" (UDB) or "smarter at getting what he wanted by telling lies"
  * **Has God really said**  - "Is it true that God said." The serpent was pretending to ask a real question. Translate this as a question.
  * **You must not eat**  - The serpent was speaking to the man and the woman. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you|Forms of You]])
  * **We may eat**  - "We are allowed to eat" or "We have permission to eat"
  * **We may eat…God said, 'You may not eat it**  - Eve told the serpent what God had permitted them to do and what God had told them not to do. Some languages would say what they were told not to do, and then say what they were allowed to do, as in the UDB.
  * **You may not eat it**  - AT: "You must not eat it" or "Do not eat it"
  * **nor may you touch it**  - AT: "and you must not touch it" or "and do not touch it"
  * **or you will die**  - The word "or" introduces what will happen if they eat the fruit of that tree. AT: "If you do, you will die." This refers to "physical death."
