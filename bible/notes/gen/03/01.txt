\v 1 Now the serpent was more shrewd than any other beast of the field which Yahweh God had made. He said to the woman, "Has God really said, 'You must not eat from any tree of the garden'?"
\v 2 The woman said to the serpent, "We may eat the fruit from the trees of the garden,
\v 3 but concerning the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God said, 'You may not eat it, nor may you touch it, or you will die.'"

  * **Now** - The writer is beginning a new part of the story.
  * **more shrewd** - "more cunning" or "smarter at getting what he wanted by telling lies"
  * **Has God really said, 'You ... garden'?** - The snake is pretending to be surprised that God has made this rule. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "I am surprised that God said, 'You ... garden.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **You must not eat** - The word "you" is plural and refers to the man and the woman. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **We may eat ... God said, 'You may not eat it** - Eve told the serpent what God had permitted them to do first and then what God had told them not to do. Some languages would say what they were told not to do first and then say what they were allowed to do, as in the UDB.
  * **We may eat** - "We are allowed to eat" or "We have permission to eat"
  * **You may not ... nor may you ... you will die** - The word "you" is plural and refers to the man and the woman. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
