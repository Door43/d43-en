===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **more shrewd**  - This can also be translated as "more cunning" (UDB) or "smarter at getting what he wanted by telling lies."
  * **Has God really said**  - "Is it true that God said." The serpent was pretending to ask a real question. Translate this as a question.
  * **You must not eat**  - The serpent was speaking to the man and the woman (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]]).
  * **We may eat**  - "We are allowed to eat" or "We have permission to eat"
  * **We may eat ... God said, 'You may not eat**  - Eve told the serpent what God had permitted them to do and what God had told them not to do. Some languages would say what they were told not to do, and then say what they were allowed to do, as in the UDB.
  * **You may not eat it**  - This could be translated as "You must not eat it" or "Do not eat it."
  * **nor may you touch it**  - This can be translated as "and you must not touch it" or "and do not touch it."
  * **or you will die**  - The word "or" introduces what will happen if they eat the fruit of that tree. This could be translated "If you do, you will die."
