\v 23 So Yahweh God drove out the man and his wife from the park of Eden. Yahweh God had created Adam from the ground, and he forced him to plow the ground.
\v 24 After Yahweh God drove them out, on the east side of the park he placed cherubim and a flaming sword that flashed back and forth, in order to block the entrance, so that people could not go back to the tree that enables anyone who eats its fruit to live forever.

\v 22 Yahweh God said, "Now the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. So now he must not be allowed to put forth his hand, take from the tree of life, eat it, and live forever."
\v 23 Therefore Yahweh God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to cultivate the ground from which he had been taken.
\v 24 So God drove the man out of the garden, and he placed cherubim at the east of the garden of Eden, and a flaming sword that turned every way, in order to guard the way to the tree of life.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The man**  -  “The human being.” Possible meanings are 1) God was referring to one human—the man, or 2) God was referring to humans in general, which at this point was the man and his wife. Even if God was speaking about the man, what he said applied to the man's wife, too. 
  * **like one of us**  - This can also be translated as "like us." The word “us” here refers to God. He may have used this plural form “us” as kings sometimes used to do, or because he was talking to himself.
  * **knowing good and evil**  - "He knows what is good and what is bad” or “He is able to distinguish what is good from what is bad.”
  * **he must now be allowed**  - This can be translated as "I will not let him."
  * **put forth his hand**  - "reach out with his hand"
  * **the ground from which he had been taken**  - The man was made out of ground. This does not refer to a particular plot of land that the man was taken from.
  * **So God drove the man out of the garden**  - "God forced the man to leave the garden." This refers to the event in 3:23 where it says "Yahweh God sent him out of the garden of Eden." God did not send the man out a second time.
  * **in order to guard the way to the tree of life**  - "in order to stop people from going to the tree of life."
  * **flaming sword**  - Possible meanings are 1) a sword that had flames coming from it, or 2) a fire that was shaped like a sword. Languages that do not have swords could use another weapon such as a spear or arrow.
