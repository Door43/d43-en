So now, it will not be good if they reach out and pick and eat \add some of the fruit from\add* the tree \add which enables people who eat it\add* to live \add forever\add*!"
\v 23 So Yahweh God expelled the man and his wife from the garden of Eden. Yahweh God had created Adam from the ground, but now he forced him to till that same ground \add to produce food to eat\add*.
\v 24 After he expelled them, on the east side of the garden he placed cherubim\f + \ft Or: creatures with wings \f* and an angel holding a flaming sword which flashed back and forth, in order to block the entrance, so that people could not go back to the tree that enables people \add who eat its fruit\add* to live \add forever\add*.

\v 23 So Yahweh God drove out the man and his wife from the park of Eden. Yahweh God had created Adam from the ground, and he forced him to plow the ground.
\v 24 After Yahweh God drove them out, on the east side of the park he placed cherubim and a flaming sword that flashed back and forth, in order to block the entrance, so that people could not go back to the tree that enables anyone who eats its fruit to live forever.

\v 22 Yahweh God said, "Now the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. So now he must not be allowed to reach out with his hand, take from the tree of life, eat it, and live forever."
\v 23 Therefore Yahweh God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to cultivate the ground from which he had been taken.
\v 24 So God drove the man out of the garden, and he placed cherubim at the east of the garden of Eden, and a flaming sword that turned every way, in order to guard the way to the tree of life.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The man**  - Possible meanings are 1) God was referring to one human—the man, or 2) God was referring to humans in general, which at this point was the man and his wife. Even if God was speaking about one person, what he said applied to both of them.
  * **like one of us**  - This can also be translated as "like us." The pronoun "us" is plural. (See the note on "Let us make" in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:26|1:26]].)
  * **knowing good and evil**  - "He knows what is good and what is bad” This can be translated as "he know everything, whether good or bad." This is a figure of speech that refers to both extremes and everything in between. In this verse, it means "everything, including both good and evil." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **he must now be allowed**  - This can be translated as "I will not let him."
  * **put forth his hand**  - "reach out with his hand"
  * **the ground from which he had been taken**  - The man was made out of ground. This does not refer to a particular plot of land that the man was taken from.
  * **So God drove the man out of the garden**  - "God forced the man to leave the garden." This refers to the event in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:03:22|3:23]] where it says "Yahweh God sent him out of the garden of Eden." God did not send the man out a second time.
  * **in order to guard the way to the tree of life**  - "in order to stop people from going to the tree of life."
  * **flaming sword**  - Possible meanings are 1) a sword that had flames coming from it, or 2) a fire that was shaped like a sword. Languages that do not have swords could use another weapon such as a spear or arrow.
