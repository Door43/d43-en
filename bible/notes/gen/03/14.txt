\v 14 Then Yahweh God said to the snake, "Because you did this, of all the domestic animals and the wild animals, I will curse you alone. As a result, you and all other snakes will crawl on the ground on your bellies, and so what you eat will have dirt on it as long as you live.
\v 15 I will cause you and the woman to be enemies to each other, and I will cause your descendant and her descendant to be enemies  toward each other. You will bite his heel, but he will crush your head."

  * [[:en:obe:kt:curse]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:seed]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **cursed are you alone**  - "you alone are cursed". The word "curse" is first in Hebrew in order to emphasize the contrast between God's blessing on the animals and this curse on the serpent. This is a "curse formula," or the way that curses were expressed. By saying this curse, God made it happen.
  * **all the livestock and all the beasts of the field **- AT: "all domestic animals and all wild animals."
  * **It is on your belly that you will go**  - "You will move along the ground on your belly". The phrase "upon your belly" comes first in Hebrew in order to emphasize the contrast between the way other animals would move along using their legs with the way the serpent would slither along on its belly. This is also part of the curse formula.
  * **it is dust that you will eat**  - "you will eat dust". The word "dust" comes first in Hebrew in order to emphasize the contrast between the plants above the ground that other animals would eat and the dirty food on the ground that the serpent would eat. This is part of the curse formula.
  * **hostility between you and the woman**  - This means that the serpent and the woman would become enemies.
  * **seed**  - "offspring" or "descendants." The term “seed” is used to refer to the cells inside a man or woman that combine to cause a baby to grow inside the woman. “Seed” is also used to refer to a person's offspring or descendants.
  * **He will bruise…you will bruise his heel**  - The words "he" and "his" refer to the woman's descendant. If "seed" was translated as plural, this can be translated as "They will bruise…you will bruise their heel." In this case, consider inserting footnotes to say that the "He" and "his" are singular.
  * **bruise**  - AT: "crush" or "strike" or "attack."
