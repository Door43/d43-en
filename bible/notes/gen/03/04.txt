\v 4 The serpent said to the woman, "You will surely not die.
\v 5 For God knows that the day you eat it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."
\v 6 When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took some of its fruit and ate it. Then she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate it.

  * **knowing good and evil** - Here "good and evil" is a figure of speech that refers to both extremes and everything in between. See how you translated "knowledge of good and evil" in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:02:09|2:9]]. AT: "knowing everything, including both good and evil" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **it was a delight to the eyes** - "the tree was delightful to look at" or "it was nice to look at" or "it was very beautiful" (UDB)
