===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Where are you?** - "Why are you trying to hide from me?" God knew where the man was. When the man answered, he did not say where he was but why he was hiding.
  * **you** - In verses 9 and 11, God was speaking to the man. Languages that have a singular form of "you" would use that here. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **I heard you** - "I heard the sound you were making"
  * **Who told you** - God knew the answer to this question. He asked it in order to force Adam to confess that he had disobeyed God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Have you eaten ... from?** - Again, God knew this had happened. Translate this question in a form that shows God was accusing Adam of disobedience. The sentence can be translated as a statement. AT: "You must have eaten ... from." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
