===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Where are you?**  - This can also be translated as "Why are you trying to hide from me?" (UDB). God knew where the man was. When the man answered, he did not say where he was but why he was hiding. 
  * **you**  - In verses 9 and 11, God was speaking to the man. Languages that have a singular form of 'you' would use that one. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **I heard you**  - This could be translated "I heard your sound."
  * **Who told you...** - God knew the answer to this question. He asked it in order to force Adam to confess that he had disobeyed God.
  * **Have you eaten...** - Again, God knew this had happened. Translate this question in a form that shows God was accusing Adam of disobedience.
