===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **What is this you have done?** - God already knew what the woman had done. When he asked this question, he was giving her the opportunity to tell him about it, and he was expressing his disappointment with what she had done. Many languages use rhetorical questions for scolding or rebuking. If possible, use a form that expresses this disappointment. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
