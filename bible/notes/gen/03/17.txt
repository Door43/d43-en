\v 17 Then he said to the man, "You heeded what your wife said, and you ate some of the fruit \add of the tree\add* concerning which I commanded you saying, 'Do not eat it.' So I will make it difficult \add to grow things in\add* the ground because of what you did. You will have to work hard as long as you live to produce things from the ground to eat.
\v 18 Thornbushes and thistle plants and other weeds will grow \add and prevent what you have planted from growing\add*. And for food, you will have to eat things that just grow in your fields.
\v 19 \add All your life\add* you will sweat as you work hard to produce food to eat. Then you will die \f + \ft euphemism \f*, and your \add body will be buried\add* in the ground. I made you from soil, so, since I made your body from soil, when you \add die and are buried your body will decay\add* and become soil again."

\v 17 To Adam he said, "Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree, concerning which I commanded you, saying, 'You may not eat from it,' cursed is the ground because of you. In painful toil you will eat from it all the days of your life.
\v 18 It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field.
\v 19 By the sweat of your face you will eat bread, until you return to the ground. For out of it you were taken. For dust you are, and to dust you will return."
