\v 14 by saying to them, "No, we cannot do that. We cannot give our sister to be the wife of a man who is not circumcised, because that would be a shameful thing for us to do.
\v 15 We will do that only if you do one thing: You must become like us by circumcising all the males that are among you.
\v 16 Then we will give our daughters to your young men to be your wives, and we will take your daughters to be the wives of our young men. We will live among you, and we will become one people-group.
\v 17 But if you will not agree to being circumcised, we will take our sister and go back to our land."

\v 14 They said to them, "We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to anyone who is uncircumcised; for that would be a disgrace to us.
\v 15 Only on this condition will we agree with you: if you will become circumcised as we are, if every male among you is circumcised.
\v 16 Then will we give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to ourselves, and we will live with you and become one people.
\v 17 But if you do not listen to us and become circumcised, then we will take our sister and we will leave."
