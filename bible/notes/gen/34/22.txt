===== Translation Notes: =====
Hamor and Shechem his son continue to talk to the city elders.

  * **Only on this condition...as they are circumcised** - "Only if every man among us is circumcised, as the men of Israel are circumcised, will they agree to live among us and unite with us as one people"
  * **Will not their livestock and their property—all their animals be ours?** - Shechem uses a question for emphasis. Alternate translation: "All of their animals and property will be ours!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
