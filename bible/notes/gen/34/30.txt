===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **brought trouble on me** - "caused great difficulties for me" or "brought ruin on me"
  * **to make me stink to the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites and the Perizzites** - This can be translated as a new sentence. Alternate translation: "You have made me repulsive to the Canaanites and the Perizzites." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **I am few in number** - Here the word "I" refers to all of Jacob's household. Jacob only says "I" since he is the leader. Alternate translation: "My household is small" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **gather themselves against me** - "form an army"
  * **then I shall be destroyed** - Alternate translation: "they will destroy me." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Should Shechem have dealt with our sister as with a prostitute?** - Simeon and Levi use a question for emphasis. Alternate translation: "Shechem should not have treated our sister as if she were a prostitute!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
