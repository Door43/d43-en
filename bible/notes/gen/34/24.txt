<usfm>
\v 24 Shechem was the most respected person in his household, so all the men who were there at the city gate agreed to what Hamor and Shechem suggested. So every male in the city was circumcised.
\p
\v 25 On the third day after that, when the men of the city were still sore because of being circumcised, two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, who were Dinah's brothers, took their swords and entered the city without anyone opposing them, and killed all the men.
\v 26 They even killed Hamor and his son Shechem. Then they took Dinah out of Shechem's house and left the city.
