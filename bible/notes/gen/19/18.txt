\v 18 But Lot said to one of them, "No, sir, don't make me do that!

\v 18 Lot said to them, "Oh, please, no, my lords!
\v 19 Your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have shown me great kindness in saving my life, but I cannot escape to the mountains, because the disaster will overtake me, and I will die.
\v 20 Look, that city over there is near enough to flee to, and it is a little one. Please, let me escape there (is it not a little one?), and my life will be saved."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Your servant has found favor in your sight**  - "You have been pleased with me" (UDB) or "I have been accepted by you"
  * **Your servant**  - "I." Lot was showing respect by referring to himself as "your servant."
  * **you have shown me great kindness in saving my life**  - "you have been very kind to me by saving my life"
  * **I cannot escape to the mountains, because the disaster will overtake me**  - The implicit information about why the disaster would overtake him can be made explicit: "I cannot escape to those faraway mountains because the disaster will reach me before I can get there." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]])
  * **(is it not a little one?)**  - Lot used this rhetorical question to get the angels to notice that the city really is a small one. It can also be translated as "See how small it is." You could also translate this before or after the last sentence. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **my life will be saved**  - The implied information about how his life would be saved can be made explicit: "My life will be saved if you do not destroy that city."
