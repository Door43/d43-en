\v 18 But Lot said to one of them, "No, sir, don't make me do that!
\v 19 Please, listen. You have been pleased with me and have been very kind to me and spared my life. But I cannot flee to the mountain. If I try to do that, I will die in this disaster \f + \ft personification \f*.
\v 20 But listen to me. There is a town nearby. Let me run to that small town. Let me go there now. It is a small town, but our lives will be saved if we go there."

\v 18 Lot said to them, "Oh, please, no, my lords!
\v 19 Your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have shown me great lovingkindness in saving my life, but I cannot escape to the mountains, because the disaster will overtake me, and I will die.
\v 20 Look, that city over there is near enough to flee to, and it is a little one. Please, let me escape there (is it not a little one?), and my life will be saved."
