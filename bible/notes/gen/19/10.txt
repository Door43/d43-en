===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **But the men**  - "But Lot's two guests" or "But the two angels"
  * **Lot's visitors attacked them with blindness**  - "Lot's visitors blinded them" or "they took away their sight." The phrase "attacked them" is a [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] that does not involve physical hitting.
  * **both young and old**  - "men of all ages." This could also be translated as "both small and great" and indicate social standing rather than age.
  * **so that they wore themselves out trying to find the door**  - "so that they got tired of trying to find the door"
