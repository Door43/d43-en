\v 12 Then the two angels said to Lot, "Who else is with you here? If you have sons or sons-in-law or daughters or anyone else in the city who is related to you, take them out of the city,
\v 13 because we are the ones who are going to destroy this place. Yahweh considers that these people are so evil that he sent us to destroy the city."

\v 12 Then the men said to Lot, "Do you have anyone else here? Any sons-in-law, your sons and your daughters, and whoever you have in the city, get them out of here.
\v 13 For we are about to destroy this place, because the accusations against it before Yahweh have become so loud that he has sent us to destroy it."

===== translationWords: =====

  * [[:en:obe:other:lot]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:yahweh]]
 
===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Then the men said** - "Then the two men said" or "Then the angels said"
  * **Do you have anyone else here?** - "Are there any other members of your family in the city?" or "Do you have any other family members in this place?"
  * **whoever you have in the city** - "any other members of your family living in this city"
  * **we are about to destroy** - The word "we" here is exclusive. Only the two angels would destroy the city; Lot would not destroy it. If your language has an exclusive form of "we," use it here. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **the accusations against it before Yahweh have become so loud** - This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "accusations" is expressed as a verb. AT: "so many people have been telling Yahweh that the people of this city are doing evil things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and how similar words are translated in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:18:20|18:20]])
