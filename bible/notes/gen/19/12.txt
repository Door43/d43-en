\v 12 Then the men said to Lot, "Do you have anyone else here? Any sons-in-law, your sons and your daughters, and whoever you have in the city, get them out of here.
\v 13 For we are about to destroy this place, because the accusations against it before Yahweh have become so loud that he has sent us to destroy it."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Then the men said**  - "Then the two men said" or "Then the angels said"
  * **Do you have anyone else here?**  - "Are there any other members of your family in the city?" or Do you have any other family members in this place?
  * **whoever you have in the city**  - "any other members of your family living in this city"
  * **we are about to destroy**  - The word "we" here is exclusive. Only the two angels would destroy the city; Lot would not destroy it. If your language has an exclusive form of "we," use it here. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive|Exclusive]])
  * **the accusations against it before Yahweh have become so loud **- This could also be translated as "people have made so many accusations against the people of this city to Yahweh...."
