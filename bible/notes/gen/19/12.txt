===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Then the men said**  - "Then the two men said" or "Then the angels said"
  * **Do you have anyone else here?**  - "Are there any other members of your family in the city?" or Do you have any other family members in this place?
  * **whoever you have in the city**  - "any other members of your family living in this city"
  * **we are about to destroy**  - The word "we" here is exclusive. Only the two angels would destroy the city; Lot would not destroy it. If your language has an exclusive form of "we," use it here. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **the outcry against its people has become so loud before Yahweh** - This could also be translated as "people have cried out to Yahweh so loudly against the people of this city."
