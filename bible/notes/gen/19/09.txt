\v 9 But they replied, "Get out of our way! You are a foreigner; so you have no right to tell us what is right! We will do worse things to you than we will do to them!" Then they lunged towards Lot, and tried forcefully to break down the door.

\v 9 They said, "Stand back!" They also said, "This one came here to live as a foreigner, and now he has become our judge! Now we will deal worse with you than with them." They pressed hard against the man, against Lot, and came near to break down the door.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Stand back!** - "Step aside!" or "Get out of our way!" 
  * **This one came here to live as a foreigner** - "This one came here as an outsider" or "This foreigner came to live here"
  * **This one** - "Lot." The men are speaking to each other. If this would be unclear in your language, you may have the men speak to Lot here, as in UDB.
  * **now he has become our judge** - Here "become our judge" is an idiom that means Lot is acting as if he can tell the men what actions are right or wrong. AT: "now he thinks he has the authority to tell us what is right and what is wrong"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **now he** - "even though he has no good reason to, he" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Now we** - "Because you are telling us that what we are doing is wrong, we"
  * **we will deal worse with you than with them** - The men are angry that Lot said, "Do not act so wickedly" ([[:en:bible:notes:gen:19:06|19:7]]), so they are threatening to act more wickedly than Lot had feared at first. AT: "we will act more wickedly with you than we will with them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **They pressed hard against the man, against Lot, and came near to break down the door** - Possible meanings are 1) "They kept coming closer to the man, to Lot, until they were close enough to break down the door" or 2) they physically pushed Lot up against the wall or door of the house and were about to break the door down.
  * **the man ... Lot** - This is two ways of referring to Lot.
