\v 21 One of the angels said to Lot, "I will allow you to do what you have requested \f + \ft metonymy \f*. I will not destroy the little town you are speaking about.
\v 22 But hurry! Run to there, because I cannot destroy anything until you arrive there." People later called the name of the town Zoar which means 'small,' because Lot said it was small.

\v 21 He said to him, "Alright, I am granting this request also, that I will not destroy the city which you have mentioned.
\v 22 Hurry! Escape there, for I cannot do anything until you arrive there." Therefore the city was called Zoar.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I am granting this request also** - "I will do what you have asked."
  * **cannot do anything**  - This can be made more explicit: "cannot do anything to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah." (See [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Zoar**  - Translators may add a footnote that says "The name Zoar sounds like the Hebrew word that means 'little.' Lot called this town 'little' in Genesis 19:20."
