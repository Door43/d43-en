<usfm>
\v 1 That evening, the two angels arrived in Sodom. Lot was sitting at the gateway of the city. When he saw them, he got up to greet them, and prostrated himself with his face on the ground.
\v 2 He said to them, "Gentlemen, please stay in my house tonight. You can wash your feet, and tomorrow you can continue your journey." But they said, "No, we will just sleep in the city square."
\v 3 But Lot kept insisting strongly that they sleep in his house. So they entered his house with him, and he prepared a meal for them. He baked some bread without yeast, and they ate it.

\c 19
\p
\v 1 The two angels came to Sodom in the evening, while Lot was sitting at the gate of Sodom. Lot saw them, arose to meet them, and bowed down with his face to the ground.
\v 2 He said, "Please my masters, I urge you to turn aside into your servant's house, stay for the night, and wash your feet. Then you can rise up early and go on your way." And they said, "No, we will spend the night in the town square."
\v 3 But he urged them strongly, so they went with him, and entered into his house. He prepared a meal and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The two angels** - Genesis 18 says that two men went to Sodom. Here we learn that they are really angels. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:gen:18:22|18:22]])
  * **the gate of Sodom** - "the entrance to the city of Sodom." The city had a wall around it, and people had to go through a gate to get into it. This was a very important place in a city. Important people often spent time there.
  * **bowed down with his face to the ground** - He put his knees on the ground then touched his forehead and nose to the ground.
  * **my masters** - This was a term of respect Lot used for the angels.
  * **I urge you to turn aside into your servant's house** - "Please come and stay in your servant's house"
  * **your servant's house** - Lot refers to himself as their servant in order to show them respect. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **wash your feet** - People liked to wash their feet after traveling.
  * **rise up early** - "wake up early"
  * **we will spend the night** - When the two angels said this, they were referring only to themselves, not to Lot. The two of them planed to spend the night in the square. Some languages would use the exclusive form of "we" here. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **town square** - This is a public, outdoor place in the town.
