\v 31 The firstborn said to the younger, "Our father is old, and there is no man anywhere to sleep with us according to the way of all the world.
\v 32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will sleep with him, so that we may extend our father's line."
\v 33 So they made their father drink wine that night. Then the firstborn went in and slept with her father; he did not know when she lay down, nor when she arose.
