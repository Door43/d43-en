This time you can go and sleep with him. If he has sex with you, you can become pregnant, and that way you can have a child, too."
\v 35 So that night, they caused their father to become drunk with wine again, and then his younger daughter went and slept with him. But again, he was so drunk that he did not know when she lay down with him or when she got up.

\v 34 The next day the firstborn said to the younger, "Listen, last night I slept with my father. Let us make him drink wine tonight also, and you should go in and sleep with him, so that we may extend our father's line."
\v 35 So they made their father drink wine that night also, and the younger went and slept with him. He did not know when she lay down, nor when she arose.
