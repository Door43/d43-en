\v 8 Abimelech rose early in the morning and called all of his servants to himself. He told all these things to them, and the men were very afraid.
\v 9 Then Abimelech called for Abraham and said to him, "What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me that which ought not to be done."
