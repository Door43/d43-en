\v 8 Abimelech rose early in the morning and called all of his servants to himself. He told all these things to them, and the men were very afraid.
\v 9 Then Abimelech called for Abraham and said to him, "What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me that which ought not to be done."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He told all these things to them** - "He told them everything that God had told him"
  * **What have you done to us?** - Abimelech used this rhetorical question to scold Abraham. AT: "You have done something bad to us!" or "Look what you have done to us!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **to us** - The word "us" here is exclusive and does not include Abraham and Sarah. If your language uses an exclusive form of "we" or "us," use it here. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **How have I sinned against you, that you have brought ... sin?** - Abimelech used this rhetorical question to remind Abraham that he had not sinned against Abraham. AT: "I have done nothing against you to cause you to bring ... sin." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin** - To cause someone to be guilty of sinning is spoken of as if "sin" was a thing  that could be placed on a person. AT: "that you should make me and my kingdom guilty of such a terrible sin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **on my kingdom** - Here "kingdom" stands for the people. AT: "on the people of my kingdom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **You have done to me that which ought not to be done** - "You should not have done this to me"
