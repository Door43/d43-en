\v 6 God said to him in another dream, "Yes, I know that your motives were pure. That is why I truly prevented you from sinning against me. I did not allow you to have sex \f + \ft euphemism \f* with her.
\v 7 Now, return this man's wife to her husband, because he is a prophet\f + \ft Or: a man who receives messages from me \f*. He will pray for you, and you will remain alive\f + \ft Or: not die \f*. But if you don't return her to him, you will certainly die, and all the members of your household will also certainly die."

\v 6 Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I also know that in the integrity of your heart you did this, and I also kept you from sinning against me. Therefore I did not allow you to touch her.
\v 7 Now therefore, return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet. He will pray for you, and you will live. But if you do not restore her, know that you and all who are yours will surely die."
