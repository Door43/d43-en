\v 6 God said to him in another dream, "Yes, I know that your motives were pure. That is why I truly prevented you from sinning against me. I did not allow you to have sex \f + \ft euphemism \f* with her.
\v 7 Now, return this man's wife to her husband, because he is a prophet\f + \ft Or: a man who receives messages from me \f*. He will pray for you, and you will remain alive\f + \ft Or: not die \f*. But if you don't return her to him, you will certainly die, and all the members of your household will also certainly die."

\v 6 God said to him, "Yes, I know that you did not want to do anything wrong. That is why I prevented you from sinning against me. I did not allow you to touch her.
\v 7 Therefore, return this man's wife to her husband, because he is a prophet. He will pray for you so that you may live. But if you do not return her to him, you will certainly die, and all the members of your household will also certainly die."

\v 6 Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I also know that in the integrity of your heart you did this, and I also kept you from sinning against me. Therefore I did not allow you to touch her.
\v 7 Therefore, return the man's wife, for he is a prophet. He will pray for you, and you will live. But if you do not restore her, know that you and all who are yours will surely die."
