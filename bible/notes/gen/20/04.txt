===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a change from the story to information about Abimelech.
  * **Abimelech had not come near her**  - "Abimelech had not had sex with Sarah" or "Abimelech had not touched Sarah"  (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **Did he not himself say to me, 'She is my sister?'** - Abimelech used this rhetorical question to remind God of something God would have already known. It can also be translated but "But Abraham himself told me 'She is my sister'."   (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Did he not himself say** - The words “he himself” are used for emphasis to bring attention to Abraham.  It can also be translated as "Did not Abraham himself say." Abimelech was showing that it was Abraham's fault that Abimelech took Sarah.
  * **Even she herself said, 'He is my brother.'** -  The words “she herself” are used for emphasis to bring attention to Sarah."
  * **I have done this in the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands**  - This means "I have done this with good intentions and actions" or "I have done this with no evil thoughts or actions." Heart and hands are a figure of speech for thoughts and actions. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
