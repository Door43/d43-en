  * **Did he not himelf say to me, 'She is my sister?'** - Abimelech used this rhetorical question to remind God of something God would have already known. It can also be translated but "But Abraham himself told me 'She is my sister'."   (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Did he not himself say** - The words “he himself” are used for emphasis to bring attention to Abraham.  It can also be translated as "Did not Abraham himself say." Abimelech was showing that it was Abraham's fault that Abimelech took Sarah.
