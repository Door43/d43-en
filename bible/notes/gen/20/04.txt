\v 4 But Abimelech had not slept with her, so he said, "Lord, since the people of my nation and I are innocent, will you kill us?

\v 4 Now Abimelech had not come near her and he said, "Lord, would you kill even a righteous nation?
\v 5 Did he not himself say to me, 'She is my sister?' Even she herself said, 'He is my brother.' I have done this in the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Now ... her** - This word is used here to mark a change from the story to information about Abimelech. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **Abimelech had not come near her** - This is a polite way of saying he did not have sex with her. AT: "Abimelech had not slept with Sarah" or "Abimelech had not touched Sarah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **even a righteous nation** - Here "nation" stands for the people. Abimelech is worried that God will punish not only him, but his people also. AT: "even a people who are innocent" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Did he not himself say to me, 'She is my sister?' Even she herself said, 'He is my brother'** - This has quotations within a quotation. They can be stated as indirect quotations. AT: "Did he himself not tell me that she is his sister? Even she herself told me that he is her brother" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotesinquotes]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **Did he not himself say to me, 'She is my sister?'** - Abimelech used this rhetorical question to remind God of something God already knew. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "Abraham himself told me 'She is my sister.'" or "Abraham said that she is his sister." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Did he not himself say ... Even she herself** - The words "he himself" and "she herself" are used for emphasis to bring attention to Abraham and Sarah and to blame them for what happened. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_rpronouns]])
  * **I have done this in the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands** - Here "heart" stands for his thoughts or intentions. Also "hands" stands for his actions. AT: "I have done this with good intentions and actions" or "I have done this with no evil thoughts or actions" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
