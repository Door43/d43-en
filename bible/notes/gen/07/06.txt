===== Translation Notes: =====

Verses 6-12 repeat for a second time and give more detail about how Noah went into the ark with his family and the animals in Genesis [[en:bible:notes:gen:07:01|7:1-5]]. This is not a new event.

  * **came upon the earth**  - This can be translated as "happened" or "came on the earth."
  * **because of the waters of the flood**  - This can be translated as "because of the flood that would come" or "to escape the flood water."
