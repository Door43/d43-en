===== Translation Notes: =====

Verses 6-12 repeat for a second time and give more detail about how Noah went into the ark with his family and the animals in Genesis [[:en:bible:notes:gen:07:01|7:1-5]]. This is not a new event.

  * **second month**  - This refers to the second month of the year and not the second month from Noah's birthday.
  * **on the same day**  - This refers to the specific day when the rain began. This phrase emphasizes how all of these major events happened quickly when the time arrived.
  * **the fountains of the great deep burst open**  ​- "water from underground rushed up to the surface"
  * **the great deep**  - This refers to underground water sources.
  * **the windows of heaven were opened**  - This can be translated as "the sky opened" or "the doors in the sky opened." It is figurative language that means that the rain in the sky poured down. It describes the sky as a ceiling that keeps the ocean above it from falling down to the earth. When the windows, or doors, in the sky were opened, the water came down through them.
  * **rain**  - If your language has a word for a great amount of rain, it would be appropriate here.
