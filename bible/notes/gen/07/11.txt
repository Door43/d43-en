===== Translation Notes: =====

Verses 11 and 12 give more detail about the information in verse 10. They tell what day the rain started on and how long it fell.

  * **second month**  - This refers to the second month of the year and not the second month from Noah's birthday.
  * **the fountains of the great deep burst open**  ​- "water from underground rushed up to the surface"
  * **the great deep**  - This refers to underground water sources.
  * **the windows of heaven were opened**  - This can be translated as "the sky opened" or "the floodgates in the sky opened." It is figurative language that means that the rain in the sky poured down. The sky is pictured as a ceiling that keeps the ocean above it from falling down to the earth. When the windows, or floodgates, in the sky were opened, the water came down through them.
  * **rain** - "downpour" or "torrential rain." If your language has a word for "heavy rain," it would be appropriate here.
