===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **wild animal… domestic animal… creeping thing… bird **- Use your local categories, here
  * **creeping thing**  - This refers to animals that crawl on the ground, like rodents, lizards, and snakes.
  * **its kind**  - "its type" or "its species" or "its variety."
  * **Shem, Ham, Japheth**  - Translators may add the following footnote. "The sons are not listed in the order that they were born in."
  * **on that very day**  - This introduces more about what happened on the day that God's promise to flood the earth was fulfilled. Each phrase builds in intensity (v. 10 "after the seven days"; v. 11 "on that day"; v. 13 "on that very day"). It would be a benefit to find native language phrases that also keep building.
  * **with each wild animal … and each domestic animal … and each creeping thing **- This could be translated as "with every kind of wild animal … and every kind of domestic animal … and every kind of creeping thing."
  * **bold words**  - explanation
