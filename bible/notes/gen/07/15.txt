===== Translation Notes: =====

Verses 13-18 repeat for a third time and give more detail about how Noah went into the ark with his family and the animals in Genesis [[en:bible:notes:gen:07:01|7:1-5]]. This is not a new event. 

  * **two of all flesh in which was the breath of life**  - This refers to the animals that were listed in verse 14.
  * **in which was the breath of life**  - The phrase “in which was the breath of life” is a figurative way of saying “that lived.” (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **male and female of all flesh**  - This could be translated as "male and female of every kind of animal."
  * **after them**  - This could be made more explicit: "after they entered the ark" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]).
