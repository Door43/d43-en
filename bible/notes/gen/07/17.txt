===== Translation Notes: =====

Verses 13-18 repeat for a third time and give more detail about how Noah went into the ark with his family and the animals in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:07:01|7:1-5]]. This is not a new event.

  * **and the water increased** - This happened during the forty days while the water kept coming. AT: "and the water got very deep."
  * **and lifted up the ark** - AT: "and it caused the ark to float on it"
  * **It rose up from upon the earth** - AT: "the ark rose up high over the ground" or "the ark floated on top of the deep water"
