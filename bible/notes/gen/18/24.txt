\v 24 What will you do if there are 50 righteous people in the city? Will you really get rid of them all, and not spare the place\f + \ft Or: city \f* for the sake of the 50 righteous people who are in the city?
\v 25 It would certainly not be right for you to do such a thing, to kill righteous people along with wicked ones, and treat righteous people and wicked people the same way. You could not do that, because you, who are the judge of everyone on the earth, will certainly do what is right \add regarding the people of Sodom\add*!" \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 26 Yahweh replied, "If I find 50 righteous people in Sodom, I will spare the whole place\f + \ft Or: city \f* for their sake."

\v 24 What will you do if there are fifty people in the city who have done nothing wrong? Will you really destroy them all, and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people who have done nothing wrong?
\v 25 Certainly you would not do such a thing, to kill good people along with wicked ones, and treat good people and wicked people the same way. You could not do that, because you, who are the judge of everyone on the earth, will certainly do what is right regarding the people of Sodom!"
\v 26 Yahweh replied, "If I find fifty people in Sodom who have done nothing wrong, I will spare the whole place for their sake."

\v 24 Perhaps there are fifty righteous within the city. Will you sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous that are there?
\v 25 Far be it from you to do such a thing, killing the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be treated the same as the wicked. Far be it from you! Will not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?"
\v 26 Yahweh said, "If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare the whole place for their sake."
