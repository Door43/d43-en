\v 24 What will you do if there are 50 righteous people in the city? Will you really get rid of them all, and not spare the place\f + \ft Or: city \f* for the sake of the 50 righteous people who are in the city?
\v 25 It would certainly not be right for you to do such a thing, to kill righteous people along with wicked ones, and treat righteous people and wicked people the same way. You could not do that, because you, who are the judge of everyone on the earth, will certainly do what is right \add regarding the people of Sodom\add*!" \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 26 Yahweh replied, "If I find 50 righteous people in Sodom, I will spare the whole place\f + \ft Or: city \f* for their sake."

\v 24 What will you do if there are fifty people in the city who have done nothing wrong? Will you really destroy them all, and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people who have done nothing wrong?
\v 25 Certainly you would not do such a thing, to kill good people along with wicked ones, and treat good people and wicked people the same way. You could not do that, because you, who are the judge of everyone on the earth, will certainly do what is right regarding the people of Sodom!"
\v 26 Yahweh replied, "If I find fifty people in Sodom who have done nothing wrong, I will spare the whole place for their sake."

\v 24 Perhaps there are fifty righteous within the city. Will you sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous that are there?
\v 25 Far be it from you to do such a thing, killing  the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be treated the same as the wicked. Far be it from you! Will not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?"
\v 26 Yahweh said, "If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare the whole place for their sake."

===== Translation Notes: =====

Abraham continues talking to Yahweh.

  * **Perhaps there are**  - "Suppose there are"
  * **sweep it away**  - "destroy it"
  * **Will you sweep it away** - Abraham was hoping that God would say "I will not sweep it away."
  *  **and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous that are there?** - Abraham was hoping that God would say "I will spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people there."
  * **spare the place**  - This can be translated as "put up with" or "refrain from killing" or "let the people live."
  * **for the sake of**  - "because of"
  * **Far be it from you**  - "It is not like you" or "It seems far from your manner"
  * **such a thing, killing**  - "such a thing as killing" or "such a thing, that is, killing"
  * **Will not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?**  - Abraham used this a rhetorical question to say what he expected God to do: “The Judge of all the earth will certainly do what is just.” Since Abraham was speaking to the judge of all the earth, it may be more natural in some languages to say "you":  "Since you are the Judge of all the earth, you will surely do what is right."
