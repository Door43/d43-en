\v 13 Yahweh said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh and say, 'Will I really bear a child, when I am old?'
\v 14 Is anything too hard for Yahweh? At the time appointed by me, in the spring, I will return to you. About this time next year Sarah will have a son."
\v 15 Then Sarah denied it and said, "I did not laugh," for she was afraid. He replied, "No, you did laugh."

===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **Why did Sarah laugh and say** - God used this rhetorical question to show that he knew what Sarah was thinking and that he was not pleased with it. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Is anything too hard for Yahweh?**  - "Is there anything too difficult for Yahweh to do?" or "Is there anything that Yahweh cannot do?" God used this rhetorical question to remind Abraham that God can do anything. 
  * **At the time appointed by me, in the spring**  - "at the time I appointed." The phrase "in the spring" clarifies what time it was that God appointed.
  * **Then Sarah denied it and said** - "The Sarah denied it by saying"
  * **He replied**  - "Yahweh replied"
  * **No, you did laugh**  - This means "No, that is not true; you did in fact laugh." In some languages, it would be better to translate this as "Yes, you did laugh."
