===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Lord**  - This is a title of respect. Possible meanings are 1) Abraham knew that one of these men was God, or 2) Abraham knew that these men came on behalf of God.
  * **if I have found favor in your sight**  - Abraham was speaking to one of the men. The word "your" in verse 3 is singular. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you|Forms of 'You']])
  * **do not pass by**  - "please do not keep on going"
  * **your servant**  - Abraham referred to himself this way in order to show respect to his guest. It could also be translated here as "me."
  * **Let a little water be brought**  - This can also be translated with an active verb: "Let me bring you some water" or "My servant will bring you some water." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **a little water…a little food**  - Saying "little" was a polite way of showing generosity. Abraham would give them more than enough water and food. It can also be translated as "some water…some food."
  * **wash your feet**  - This custom helped tired travelers to refresh themselves after walking long distances.
  * **your … you**  - When Abraham spoke in verses 4 and 5, the words "you" and "your" are plural. He was offering the water, food, and rest to all three of the men.
