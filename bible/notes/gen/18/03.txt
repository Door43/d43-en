===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Lord** - This is a title of respect. Possible meanings are 1) Abraham knew that one of these men was God or 2) Abraham knew that these men came on behalf of God.
  * **in your sight** - Abraham is speaking to one of the men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **do not pass by** - "please do not keep on going"
  * **your servant** - "me." Abraham refers to himself this way in order to show respect to his guest. 
  * **Let a little water be brought** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Let me bring you some water" or "My servant will bring you some water" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **a little water ... a little food** - "some water ... some food." Saying "little" was a polite way of showing generosity. Abraham would give them more than enough water and food.
  * **wash your feet** - This custom helped tired travelers to refresh themselves after walking long distances.
  * **your ... you** - Abraham speaks to all three of the men, so "you" and "your" are plural. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
