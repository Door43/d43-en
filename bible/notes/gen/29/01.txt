====== Genesis 29:1-3 ======

<usfm>
\v 1 Jacob continued on the road \f + \ft metonymy \f*, and he arrived at the land that was east of Canaan.
\v 2 There he was surprised to see a well in a field, and three flocks of sheep were lying near the well. It was the well from which shepherds habitually got water for their sheep. There was a large stone covering the top of the well.
\v 3 When all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would work together to roll the stone away from the top of the well and get water for the sheep. When they finished doing that, they would put the stone back in its place over the top of the well.

\c 29
\p
\v 1 Then Jacob went on his journey and came to the land of the people of the east.
\v 2 As he looked, he saw a well in the field, and, behold, three flocks of sheep were lying there by it. For out of that well they would water the flocks, and the stone over the well's mouth was large.
\v 3 When all the flocks had gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone from the well's mouth and water the sheep, and then put the stone again over the well's mouth, back in its place.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the people of the east** - This means the people of Paddan Aram, which is a land east of the land of Canaan. 
  * **and, behold, three flocks of sheep were lying there by it** - The word "behold" marks the beginning of another event in the larger story. Your language may have a way of doing this.
  * **For out of that well** - "For from that well." This phrase marks a change from the story to background information about how the shepherds watered the flocks. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **they would water** - "the shepherds would water" or "those taking care of the sheep would water"
  * **the well's mouth** - Here "mouth" is a way of referring to an opening. AT: "the opening of the well" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
