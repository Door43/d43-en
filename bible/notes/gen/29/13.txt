  * [[:en:obe:other:laban]]
  * [[en:obe:other:kiss]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **his sister's son** - "his nephew"
  * **embraced him** - "hugged him"
  * **kissed him** -  In ancient Near East, it is common to greet a relative with a kiss. However, it is normally done between men. If your language has an affectionate greeting for a relative, use that. If not, use what is appropriate.
  * **Jacob told Laban all these things** - "then Jacob told Laban everything he told Rachel"
  * **my bone and my flesh** - This phrase means they are directly related. Alternate translation: "my relative" or "a member of my family." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
