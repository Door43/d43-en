\v 1  Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had not borne any children for him, but she had a female servant, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.
\v 2 So Sarai said to Abram, "See, Yahweh has kept me from having children.  Go sleep with my servant. It may be that I will have children by her." Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.  
\v 3 It was after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan that Sarai, Abram's wife, gave Hagar, her Egyptian servant, to her husband as a wife.
\v 4 So he had relations with Hagar, and she conceived. And when she saw that she had conceived, she looked with contempt on her mistress.
