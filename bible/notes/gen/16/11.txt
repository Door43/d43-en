  * **Behold** - "Look" or "Listen" or "Pay attention." 
  * **bear a son**  - "give birth to a son."
  * **you will call his name**  - "you will name him." The word "you" refers to Hagar.
  * **Ishmael, because Yahweh has heard**  - Translators may add a footnote that says "The name 'Ishmael' means 'God has heard.'" 
  * **He will be a wild donkey of a man**  - This metaphor can be translated as a simile: "He will be like a wild donkey among men."  This was not an insult. It may mean that Ishmael would be independent and strong like a wild donkey. (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor]])
  * **he will live apart from**  - This can also mean "he will live in hostility with"
  * **brothers**  - "relatives" or "kin"
