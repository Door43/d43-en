===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Hagar gave birth**  - Hagar's return to Sarai and Abram is implict. You can make this more explicit: "So Hagar went back and gave birth." (See: [[:en:ta:discourse:implicitexplicit]]).
  * **named his son, whom Hagar bore**  - "named his son by Hagar" or "named his and Hagar's son"
  * **Abram was**  - This introduces background information about Abram's age when these things happened. Your language may have a special way to mark background information.
  * **bore Ishmael to Abram**  - This means "gave birth to Abram's son, Ishmael." The focus is on Abram having a son.
