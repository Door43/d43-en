===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures** - This is a command. By commanding that living creatures should swarm in the waters, God made them swarm. Some languages may have one word that refers to all kinds of fish and sea animals. AT: "Let the waters be full of many living things" or "Let many animals that swim live in the oceans" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_imperative]])
  * **let birds fly** - This is a command. By commanding that birds should fly, God made them fly. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_imperative]])
  * **birds** - "animals that fly" or "flying things"
  * **the expanse of the sky** - "the open space of the sky" or "the sky"
  * **God created** - "In this way God created"
  * **great sea creatures** - "large animals that live in the sea"
  * **after its kind** - Living things of the same "kind" are like the ones they came from. See how you translated "kind" in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:11|1:11,12]].
  * **creatures that move and with which the waters swarm** - "animals that move and that the waters are full of"
  * **every winged bird** - "every flying thing that has wings." If the word for birds is used, it may be more natural in some languages to simply say "every bird," since all birds have wings.
  * **God saw that it was good** - Here "it" refers to the birds and the fish. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:03|1:4]].
