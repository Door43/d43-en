===== Translation Notes: =====



  * **Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures** - Other ways to translate this are "Let the waters be full of many living things" or "Let many animals that swim live in the oceans."  Some languages may have one word that refers to all kinds of fish and sea animals.
  * **birds** - This can be translated as "animals that fly" or "flying things." Some languages have a word that refers to birds and other animals and insects that fly.
  * **the expanse of the sky** - This can be translated as "the open space of the sky" or "the sky."
  * **God created**  - This can be translated as "In this way God created."
  * **great sea creatures** - "large animals that live in the sea"
  * **after its kind**  - See how you translated this in 1:11,12.
  * **creatures that move and with which the waters swarm** - This can also be translated as "animals that move and that the waters are full of."
  * **every winged bird** - This  can also be translated as "every flying thing that has wings."  Or if the word for birds is used, it may be more natural in some languages to say simply say "every bird" since all birds have wings.
  * **God saw that it was good**  - See how you translated this in 1:10.
