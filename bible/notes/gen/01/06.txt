===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **expanse**  - "large empty space." The Jewish people thought of this space as being shaped like the inside of dome or the inside of a bowl that is turned upside down.
  * **between the waters**  - This can be translated as "in the water."
  * **God made the expanse and divided the waters**  - This can be translated as "In this way God made the expanse and divided the waters." When God spoke, it happened. This sentence explains what God did when he spoke.
  * **It was so**  - What God commanded happened just as he said it should. This phrase appears throughout the chapter and has the same meaning. It can be translated as "It happened like that" or "That is what happened."
  * **This was evening and morning**  - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:03|1:5]].
  * **the second day**  - See how you translated "the first day" in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:03|1:5]] and decide if this should be translated in the same way.
