\v 6 Then God said, "I command that there be an empty space like a huge dome to separate the water that is above it from the water on the earth that is below it!"
\v 7 And that is what happened. God gave to the space the name 'sky.'
\v 8 Then there was another evening, which was followed by another morning. He called that period of time 'the second day.'

<usfm>
\v 6 Then God said, "I command that there be an empty space like a huge dome to separate the water into two parts."
\v 7 And that is what happened. God made the empty space like a huge dome and it separated the water that is above it from the water on the earth that is below it.
\v 8 God named the space like a huge dome "sky." This was an evening and morning, the second day.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Let there be an expanse ... let it divide** - These are commands. By commanding that the expanse should exist and that it divide the waters, God made it exist and divide the waters. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_imperative]])
  * **expanse** - "large empty space." The Jewish people thought of this space as being shaped like the inside of dome or the inside of a bowl that is turned upside down.
  * **between the waters** - "in the water"
  * **God made the expanse and divided the waters** - "In this way God made the expanse and divided the waters." When God spoke, it happened. This sentence explains what God did when he spoke.
  * **It was so** - "It happened like that" or "That is what happened." What God commanded happened just as he said it should. This phrase appears throughout the chapter and has the same meaning wherever it appears.
  * **evening and morning** - This refers to the whole day. The writer speaks of the whole day as if it were these two parts. In the Jewish culture, a day begins when the sun sets. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:03|1:5]]. (See: Merism)
  * **the second day** - This refers to the second day that the universe existed. See how you translated "the first day" in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:03|1:5]] and decide if you should translate this the same way.
