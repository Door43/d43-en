===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Let there be light**  - This is a command. God commanded that the light should exist.
  * **God saw the light, that it was good**  - This can be translated as "God considered the light and was pleased with it." "Good" here means "pleasing" or "suitable."
  * **divided the light from the darkness**  - This refers to God creating the daytime and the night time. It can be translated as "separated the light and the darkness" or "made it light in one place and dark in the another."
  * **This was evening and morning, the first day**  - God did these things on the first day of the universe.
  * **evening and morning**  - This refers to the whole day. Two parts of the day are used to refer to the whole day. In the Jewish culture, a day begins when the sun sets. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
