\v 26 Then God said, "Now we will make human beings that will have many of the qualities that we have. I want them to rule over the fish in the sea, over the birds, over all the livestock\f + \ft Or: domestic animals \f*, and over all the other creatures that move across the surface of the ground."
\v 27 So God created human beings that were like him in many ways. He made them to be like himself. He created some to be male and some to be female.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Let us make**  - The word "us" here refers to God. God was saying what he intended to do. The pronoun "us" is plural. Possible reasons for this plural pronoun are 1) the plural form suggests that God is discussing something with the angels that make up his heavenly court or 2) the plural form foreshadows the later New Testament implications that God exists in the form of the Holy Trinity. Some translate it as "Let me make" or "I will make." If you do this, consider adding a footnote to say that the word is plural. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:talink-pronouns|talink pronouns]])
  * **man**  - "human beings" or "people." This word does not mean males only.
  * **in our image, after our likeness**  - These two phrases mean the same thing and emphasize that God made mankind to be like him. This verse does not tell in what ways God made people to be like himself. God does not have a body, so it does not mean that people would look like God. AT: "to truly be like us." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet|Doublet]] and [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:talink-pronouns|talink pronouns]])
  * **have dominion over**  - "rule over" or "have authority over"
  * **God created man…he created him**  - These two sentences mean the same thing and emphasize that God created people in his own image. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]])
  * **God created man**  - The way that God created man was different than the rest of creation. This will be described in the next chapter. Do not specify that he created man by simply speaking as in the preceding verses.
