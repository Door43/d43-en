<usfm>
\v 16 God made two of them that were like big lights. The bigger one, the sun, shines during the day and the smaller one, the moon, shines during the night. He also made the stars.
\v 17 God set all of them in the sky to shine on the earth,
\v 18 to govern the day and the night, and to separate the light of the daytime from the darkness of the nighttime. God was pleased with these things he had made.
\v 19 Then there was another evening which was followed by another morning. He called that period of time 'the fourth day.'
