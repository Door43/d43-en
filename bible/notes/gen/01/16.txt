===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 God made two of them that were like big lights. The bigger one, the sun, shines during the day and the smaller one, the moon, shines during the night. He also made the stars.
\v 17 God set all of them in the sky to shine on the earth,
\v 18 to govern the day and the night, and to separate the light of the daytime from the darkness of the nighttime. God was pleased with these things he had made.
\v 19 Then there was another evening which was followed by another morning. He called that period of time 'the fourth day.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **God made the two great lights** - "In this way God made the two great lights." This sentence explains what God did when he spoke.
  * **the two great lights** - "the two large lights" or "the two bright lights." The two great lights are the sun and the moon.
  * **to rule the day** - The lights that controlled the day are spoken of as if they were a human ruler that controlled what people do. AT: "to direct the daytime as a ruler directs a group of people" or "to mark the times of the day" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **day** - This refers only to the daylight hours.
  * **the lesser light** - "the smaller light" or "the dimmer light"
  * **in the sky** - "in the heavens" or "in the open space of the sky"
  * **to divide the light from the darkness** - "to separate the light from the darkness" or "to make it light at one time and dark at another." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:03|1:4]].
