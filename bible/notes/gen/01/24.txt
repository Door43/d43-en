===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Let the earth produce living creatures**  - "Let the earth produce living things" or "Let many living animals live on the earth." See if you can translate "bring forth" here as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:11|1:11]].
  * **each according to its own kind** - AT: “so that each kind of animal will produce more of its own kind.”
  * **livestock, creeping things, and beasts of the earth**  - This shows that God created all kinds of animals. If your language has another way of grouping all the animals, you can use that, or you can use these groups.
  * **livestock**  - This can be translated as "animals that people look after."
  * **creeping things**  - This can be translated as "small animals."
  * **beasts of the earth**  - This can be translated as "wild animals" or "dangerous animals."
  * **It was so**  - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:06|1:7]].
  * **God made the beasts…**  - This can be translated as "In this way God made the beasts…."
  * **He saw that it was good**  - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:09|1:10]].
