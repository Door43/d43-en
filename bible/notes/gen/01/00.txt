======  Genesis 01 General Notes ======

=== Formatting in this chapter ===

This chapter presents the first account of God creating the world. There is a pattern to this account: “God said...God saw that it was good...This was evening and morning, the first day.” Translators should preserve this pattern in their versions.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== The universe ==

This account of creation is told in the framework of the ancient Hebrew ideas of what the universe was like: the earth was resting with water around it and below it. Over the earth was something like a vast dome, called “an expanse between the waters” (1:6), on top of which was more water. Translators should try to convey this picture in their work, even though the project language readers might have a completely different idea of what the universe is like.

== Evening and morning ==

Genesis 1 presents the ancient Hebrew idea of what a day is: it begins with sunset, lasts through the night, and continues through the daylight hours until the next sunset. This pattern should be preserved in translation, even if the project language readers define "day" differently.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "God said, 'Let there be'" ==

This expression occurs often in this chapter. It can be difficult to translate, because God is not shown as talking to anyone in particular. And if he is talking to a thing, it is something that does not yet exist. Translators should find the most natural way in the project language to signal the idea that God spoke things into existence, that is, that he created the world and the things in it by simply commanding that they should exist.
