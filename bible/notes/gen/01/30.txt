===== Translation Notes: =====

God continues speaking.

  * **every bird of the heavens**  - "all the birds that fly in the sky"
  * **that has the breath of life **- AT: "that breathes" (UDB). This phrase emphasizes that these animals had a different kind of life than the plants. Plants do not breathe, and were to be used as food for the animals. Here "life" means physical life.
  * **It was so**  - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:06|1:7]].
  * **Behold**  - The word "behold" here adds emphasis to what follows. AT: "Indeed."
  * **it was very good**  - See how you translated "it was good" in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:09|1:10]]. Now when God looked at everything he had made, it was "very good."
  * **This was evening and morning**  - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:03|1:5]].
  * **the sixth day**  - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:06|1:8]].
