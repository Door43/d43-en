\v 12  Then Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.
\v 13 He spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying, "But if you are willing, please hear me. I will pay for the field. Take the money from me, and I will bury my dead there."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **people of the land** - "people who lived in that place"
  * **in the hearing of the people of the land** - "while the people of the land were listening"
  * **But if you will** - This can be translated as "No, but if you are willing" or "No, but if you agree with this." The word "but" shows that there is a contrast between what Ephron offered to do and what Abraham would do. Ephron said that he would give the field to Abraham. Abraham would pay for the field.
  * **I will pay for the field** - This can also be translated as "I will give you money for the field."
