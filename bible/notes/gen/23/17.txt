  * **Mamre** - This was a town or small city.
  * **that is, the field, the cave that was in it, and all the trees**  -  This phrase explains what the author meant when he wrote "the field of Ephron." It was not only the field, but also the cave and trees in the field.
  * **passed to Abraham by purchase** - This can be translated as "was purchased by Abraham" or "became Abraham's possession when he purchased it"  or "was bought by Abraham."
  * **in the presence of the sons of Heth** - This can be translated as “in the sight of the sons of Heth” or “while the sons of Heth watched.”
  * **sons of Heth**  - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:gen:23:03|23:3]].
  * **all those who had come into the gate of his city**  - This  tells which sons of Heth saw Abraham buy the property. See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:gen:23:10|23:10]].
  * **his city** - This phrase shows that Ephron belonged to that city. It does not mean that he owned it. It can also be translated as “the city.”
