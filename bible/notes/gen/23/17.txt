  * **Machpelah** - Machpela was the name of an area or region. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:23:07|23:9]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Mamre** - This was another name for the city of Hebron. It may have been named after Mamre, the friend of Abraham who lived there. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **that is, the field, the cave that was in it, and all the trees** - This phrase explains what the author meant when he wrote "the field of Ephron." It was not only the field, but also the cave and trees in the field.
  * **passed to Abraham by purchase** - "became Abraham's possession when he purchased it" or "belonged to Abraham after he bought it"
  * **in the presence of the sons of Heth** - Here "presence" stands for the people serving as witnesses. AT: "with the people of Heth watching as witnesses" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
