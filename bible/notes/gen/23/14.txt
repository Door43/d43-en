===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Ephron** - See [[en:bible:notes:gen:23:10|23:10]]
  * **Please, my lord, listen to me**  - "Hear me, my lord" or "listen to me, kind sir."
  * **A piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between me and you?**  - "A piece of land that is worth only four hundred shekels of silver is nothing to you and me." This sentence can be divided in two. "The piece of land is worth only four hundred shekels of silver. For you and me, that is nothing." Ephron meant that since he and Abraham were both so wealthy, 400 pieces of silver was a small amount. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **four hundred shekels of silver** - about 4.5 kilograms of silver (See: [[en:obe:other:biblicalweight]])
  * **four hundred** - "400" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **Bury your dead**  - "Go bury your dead."
  * **Abraham weighed out to Ephron the amount of silver**  - This can be translated as "Abraham weighed out for Ephron the amount of silver" or "Abraham weighed the silver and gave Ephron the amount" or "Abraham counted out to Ephron the amount of silver."
  * **the amount of silver that he had spoken** - "them amount of silver that Ephron had said"
  * **in the hearing in the hearing of the sons of Heth** -  This can be translated as "in the presence of the sons of Heth" or "while the sons of Heth listened."
  * **the sons of Heth**  - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:gen:23:03|23:3]].
  * **according to the standard measurement of the merchants**  - This can be translated as "using the standard measurement of weight that merchants used" or "He weighed the silver the same way that the merchants used to weigh it."
