  * **A piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between me and you?**  - "A piece of land that is worth only four hundred shekels of silver is nothing to you and me." This sentence can be divided in two. "The piece of land is worth only four hundred shekels of silver. For you and me, that is nothing."

  * **in the hearing in the hearing of the sons of Heth** -  This can be translated as "in the presence of the sons of Heth" or "while the sons of Heth listened."
