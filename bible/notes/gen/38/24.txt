\v 24 About three months later, someone told Judah, "Your daughter-in-law Tamar has become a prostitute and now she is pregnant!" Judah said, "Drag her outside of the city and kill her by burning her!"
\p
\v 25 But as they were taking her outside of the city, she gave the ring and walking stick to someone, and told him to take them to Judah, and say to him, "The man who owns these things is the one who caused me to become pregnant." She also said to tell him, "Look at this ring, and the cord that is attached to it, and this walking stick. Whose are they?"
\v 26 When the man did that, Judah recognized the ring and the stick. He said, "She is more righteous than I am. I did not tell my son Shelah to marry her, as I promised that I would." And Judah did not have sex \f + \ft euphemism \f* with her again.

\v 24 It came about after about three months that it was told to Judah, "Tamar your daughter-in-law has committed prostitution, and indeed, she is pregnant by sexual immorality." Judah said, "Bring her here and let her be burned."
\v 25 When she was brought out, she sent to her father-in-law a message, "By the man who owns these I am pregnant. "She said, "Determine please whose these are, the seal and cords and staff."
\v 26 Judah recognized them and said, "She is more right than me since I did not give her as a wife to Shelah, my son.” He did not make love to her again.
