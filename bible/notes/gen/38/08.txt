\v 8 Then Judah said to Onan, "Your older brother died without having any sons. So marry his widow and have sex \f + \ft euphemism \f* with her. That is what our customs require that you should do."
\v 9 But Onan knew if he did that, any children who would be born would not be considered to be his. So every time he had sex \f + \ft euphemism \f* with his brother's widow, he spilled his semen on the ground, so that she would not get pregnant and produce children for his older brother.
\v 10 Yahweh considered that what he did was wicked, so he caused him to die also.

\v 8 Judah said to Onan, "Make love to your brother's wife. Do the duty of a brother-in-law to her, and raise up a child for your brother."
\v 9 Onan knew that the child would not be his.  Whenever he slept with his brother's wife, he spilled the semen on the ground so he would not have a child for his brother.
\v 10 What he did was evil in the sight of Yahweh. Yahweh killed him also.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Onan** - See how you translated this name in [[en:bible:notes:gen:38:03|38:4]].
  * **Do the duty of a brother-in-law to her** - This refers to a custom that when the oldest brother dies before he and his wife have a son, the next oldest brother would marry and sleep with the widow.  When the widow gave birth to the first son, that son was considered the son of the oldest brother and he would receive the oldest brother's inheritance.
  * **Yahweh killed him also** - "So Yahweh killed him also"
