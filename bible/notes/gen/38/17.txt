===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **give me a pledge** - a "pledge" is something that you leave with another person to show that you will keep your promise.
  * **seal and cord** - A "seal" is a device with a design engraved on it. The owner of the seal would press it into clay or wax that was used to seal a document. This would leave a mark of the design in the clay or wax. This mark was used to prove that the owner of the seal sent the document. The "cord" was put through the seal so the owner could wear it around his neck.
  * **She became pregnant by him** - Alternate translation: "He caused her to become pregnant." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
