\v 3 Just as I previously said you could eat green plants for food, now I am saying you can eat everything that lives and moves.
\v 4 It is blood that causes creatures to be alive, therefore you must not eat meat that still has blood in it after the animal is killed. After you have drained the blood out, you may eat it.
