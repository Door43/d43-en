====== Genesis 09:3-4 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Just as I previously said you could eat green plants for food, now I am saying you can eat everything that lives and moves.
\v 4 It is blood that causes creatures to be alive, therefore you must not eat meat that still has blood in it after the animal is killed. After you have drained the blood out, you may eat it.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Previously I allowed you to eat green plants for food, but now you may eat everything that lives and moves.
\v 4 But you must not eat meat that still has the blood in it, because the life is in its blood.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Every moving thing that lives will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything.
\v 4 But you must not eat meat with its life— that is its blood—in it.

===== Translation Notes: =====

God continues speaking to Noah and his sons.
 
  * **life … blood** - Translators may add a footnote such as this: "The blood is a symbol for life." They may also add a foot note saying something like this: "God commanded people not to eat meat while the blood was still in it. They had to drain out the blood first."
