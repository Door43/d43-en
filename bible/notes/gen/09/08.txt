===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Then God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him** - God was already speaking to them. This phrase marks a change in what God was going to speak about. AT: "God continued speaking to Noah and his sons" or "Then God went on to say"
  * **As for me** - This phrase is used in English to mark the change from God talking about what Noah and his sons must do to talking about what God would do.
  * **confirm my covenant with you** - "make a covenant between you and me." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:06:18|6:18]].
