====== Genesis 09:5-7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 I insist that murderers must be executed. Animals that kill people must also be executed. The reason that everyone who murders someone else must be executed is that
\v 6 I made people to be like myself \add in many ways\add*. So someone who murders another human being must be executed by others, \add because he killed someone who is like me\add*.
\p
\v 7 As for you, I want you to produce many children, in order that they and their descendants may live all over the earth."

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 I punish any creature who kills a human being—that they answer to Yahweh—whether it be an animal or from a human being. I demand that murderers must suffer for their crimes and pay with their own lives. Even when an animal kills a person, that animal must also have their life taken because they have taken the life of a human being.
\v 6 For I made people to be like myself. So I insist that if someone murders another human being, another person must kill him. Anyone who pours another's blood out must himself lose his own blood.
\p
\v 7 As for you, I want you to produce many children, in order that they and their descendants may live all over the earth."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 But for your blood, the life that is in your blood, I will require payment. From the hand of every animal I will require it. From the hand of any man, that is, from the hand of one who has murdered his brother, I will require an accounting for the life of that man.
\q
\v 6 Whoever sheds man's blood, by man will his blood be shed,
\q for it was in the image of God that he made man.
\v 7 As for you, be fruitful and multiply, spread throughout the earth and multiply on it."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - God continues speaking to Noah and his sons.

  * **But for your blood** - This contrasts man's blood with the blood of animals ([[:en:bible:notes:gen:09:01|9:4]]).
  * **for your blood, the life that is in your blood** - It is implied that the blood is shed, or poured out, or spilled out. AT: "if anyone causes your blood to pour out" or "if anyone spills your blood" or "if anyone kills you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **life** - This refers to physical life.
  * **I will require payment** - This payment refers to the death of the murderer, not to money. AT: "I will require anyone who kills you to pay"
  * **from the hand** - Here the word "hand" refers to the one who is responsible for something happening. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **From the hand of every animal I will require it** - "I will require any animal that takes your life to pay"
  * **From the hand of any man, that is, from the hand of one who has murdered his brother, I will require an accounting for the life of that man** - "I will require anyone who takes the life of another person to pay"
  * **From the hand of** - This phrase refers to the person in a very personal way. AT: "From that very man" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **brother** - Here "brother" is used as a general reference to relatives, such as members of the same tribe, clan, or people group.
  * **Whoever sheds man's blood, by man will his blood be shed** - The shedding of blood is a metaphor for killing someone. This means that if a person murders someone, someone else must kill the murderer. However, "blood" is very significant in this passage and should be used in the translation if possible. Translate "sheds blood" with words that indicate a major loss of blood that causes death. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **for it was in the image of God that he made man** - "because God made people to be like him" or "because I made people in my own image"
  * **be fruitful and multiply** - This is God's blessing. He told Noah and his family to produce more humans like themselves, so that there would be many of them. The word "multiply" explains how they are to be "fruitful." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:28|1:28]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
