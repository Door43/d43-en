===== Translation Notes: =====

God continues speaking to Noah and his sons.

  * **in order to commemorate** - "in order to remember" or "in order to think about"
  * **between God and every living creature**  - Since God was speaking, this can also be translated as "between me and every living creature."
  * **every living creature of all flesh** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:gen:09:14|9:15]].
  * **Then God said to Noah** - God was already talking to Noah. This phrase marks the final part of what God was saying. It can also be translated as "God finished by saying to Noah" or "So God said to Noah."
