  * **Only in the throne** - Here "throne" stands for Pharaoh's rule as king. AT: "Only in my role as king"
  * **See, I have put you** - The word "See" adds emphasis to what Pharaoh says next. AT: "Look, I have put you" 
  * **I have put you over all the land of Egypt** - The phrase "put you over" means to give authority. Here "land" refers to the people. AT: "I put you in charge of everyone in Egypt" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
