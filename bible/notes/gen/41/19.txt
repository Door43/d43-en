\v 19 Soon seven other cows, ugly and thin ones, came up behind them from the river. I never saw such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt!
\v 20 The thin ugly cows ate the seven fat cows that came up first.
\v 21 But afterwards, no one would have known that the thin cows ate them, because they were just as ugly as they were before. Then I woke up.

\v 19 Behold, seven other cows came up after them, weak, very undesirable, and thin. I never saw in all the land of Egypt such undesirableness like them.
\v 20 The thin and undesirable cows ate up the first seven fat cows.
\v 21 When they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them, for they were still as undesirable as before. Then I awoke.
