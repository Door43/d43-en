\v 50 Before the seven years of famine started, Joseph's wife Asenath gave birth to two sons.
\v 51 Joseph named the first one Manasseh, which sounds like the Hebrew word that means 'forget,' because he said, "God has caused me to forget all my troubles and all my father's family."
\v 52 He named his second son Ephraim, which means 'to have children,' because he said, "God has given me children here in this land where I have suffered."
