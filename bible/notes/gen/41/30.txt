\v 31 The people will forget how plentiful food was previously, because the famine will be very terrible.
\v 32 The reason God gave to you two dreams is that he has firmly decided that this will happen, and he will cause it to happen very soon.

\v 30 Seven years of famine will come after them, and all the abundance will be forgotten in the land of Egypt, and the famine will devastate the land.
\v 31 The abundance will not be remembered in the land because of the famine that will follow, for it will be very severe.
\v 32 That the dream was repeated to Pharaoh is because the matter has been established by God, and God will soon do it.

===== Translation Notes: =====
Joseph continues interpreting Pharaoh's dreams.

  * **Seven years of famine will come after them** - "Seven years of famine will follow the seven years of great abundance"
  * **all the abundance will be forgotten...and the famine will devastate the land. The abundance will not be remembered...because of the famine that will follow** - Joseph expresses an idea in two ways to emphasize its importance. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **That the dream was repeated to Pharaoh is because the matter has established by God** - "God gave you two dreams to show you that these events will happen" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
