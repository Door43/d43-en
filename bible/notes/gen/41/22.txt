====== Genesis 41:22-24 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 Then I had another dream. I saw seven heads of grain. They were full of kernels of grain and ripe, and they were all growing on one stalk.
\v 23 Then to my surprise I saw seven other heads of grain that sprouted. They were thin and had been dried up by the hot east wind.
\v 24 The thin heads of grain swallowed the seven good heads. I told these dreams to the magicians, but none of them could explain to me what they meant."

\v 22 I looked in my dream, and, behold, seven heads came up upon one stalk, full and good.
\v 23 Behold, seven more heads, withered, thin and scorched by the east wind, sprang up after them.
\v 24 The thin heads swallowed up the seven good heads. I told these dreams to the magicians, but there was none that could explain it to me."
