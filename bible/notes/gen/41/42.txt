<usfm>
\v 42 The king took from his finger the ring that had his seal on it, and he put it on Joseph's finger. He put robes made of fine linen on him, and he put a gold chain around his neck.
\v 43 Then he arranged for Joseph to ride around in the chariot that showed that he was the second-most important man in the country. When Joseph rode in the chariot, men shouted to the people who were on the road in front of him, "Get off the road!" So the king put Joseph in charge of everything in the country.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **He had him ride in the second chariot which he possessed. **  - It is likely that no one but Pharaoh had ridden in this spare chariot. Placing Joseph in it while introducing him to Egypt in his new role was a brilliant job of positioning Joseph for success.
