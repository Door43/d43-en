\v 42 The king took from his finger the ring that had his seal on it, and he put it on Joseph's finger. He put robes made of fine linen on him, and he put a gold chain around his neck.
\v 43 Then he arranged for Joseph to ride around in the chariot that showed that he was the second-most important man in the country. When Joseph rode in the chariot, men shouted to the people who were on the road in front of him, "Get off the road!" So the king put Joseph in charge of everything in the country.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **Pharaoh took off his signet ring...and put it upon Joseph's hand** - Joseph having Pharaoh's signet ring grants him all authority and money to carry out the plans he outlined to Pharaoh.     
    * **clothes of fine linen** - "Linen" is a smooth, strong cloth made from the blue-flowered flax plant.
    * **He had him ride in the second chariot which he possessed** - This act makes clear to the people that Joseph is second only to Pharaoh.  
    * **Bend the knee** - "bow down and honor Joseph"
    * **Pharaoh put him over all the land** - See how you translated a similar phrase in [[en:bible:notes:gen:41:39|41:41]].
