===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The man** - "The servant" (UDB)
  * **watched her** - "watched Rebekah" or "watched the young woman"
  * **to see**  - This is an idiom which you can translate as "to know" (UDB) or "to determine." (See: [[en:ta:translate:idiom]])
  * **had prospered his journey**  - "had fulfilled the purpose of his journey" or "had made his journey successful." Since the purpose of his journey was to find a wife for Abraham's son, this could also be translated as "was showing him the woman who would become Isaac's wife."
  * **camels** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:gen:24:10|24:10]].
  * **a gold nose ring weighing half a shekel** - "a gold nose ring that weighed six grams" (UDB). The weight shows its value, so it can also be translated a "an expensive gold nose ring."
  *  **two gold bracelets for her arms weighing ten shekels** - "two gold bracelets for her arms that weighed 100 grams." The weight shows their size and value, so it can also be translated as "two large gold bracelets for her arms" (UDB).
  * **Whose daughter are you** - This could also be translated as "Who is your father?"
  * **is there room in your father’s house**  - "is there a place in your father's house"
  * **for us to spend the night**  - "where we can stay for the night" Apparently other men went on this journey with Abraham's servant.
