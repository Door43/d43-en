===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The man** - "The servant" (UDB)
  * **watched her** - "watched Rebekah" or "watched the young woman"
  * **to see** - This is another way of saying to learn something. AT: "to know" (UDB) or "to determine." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **had prospered his journey** - "had fulfilled the purpose of his journey" or "had made his journey successful." AT: "was showing him the woman who would become Isaac's wife."
  * **or not** - "or not prospered his journey" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **camels** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:24:10|24:10]].
  * **a gold nose ring weighing half a shekel** - "a gold nose ring that weighed six grams" (UDB). The weight shows its' value. AT: "an expensive gold nose ring." (See: [[:en:obe:other:biblicalweight]])
  * **two gold bracelets for her arms weighing ten shekels** - "two gold bracelets for her arms that weighed 110 grams." The weight shows their size and value. AT: "two large gold bracelets for her arms" (UDB). (See: [[:en:obe:other:biblicalweight]])
  * **Whose daughter are you** - AT: "Who is your father?"
  * **is there room in your father's house** - "is there a place in your father's house"
  * **for us to spend the night** - "where we can stay for the night." Apparently other men went on this journey with Abraham's servant.
