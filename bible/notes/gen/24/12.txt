\v 12 The servant prayed, "Yahweh God whom my master Abraham worships, enable me to be successful today! Act kindly to my master, Abraham!
\v 13 Listen to me. I am standing near a well of water, and the daughters of the people of the city are coming to get water.
\v 14 I am asking you this: I will say to some girl, 'Please lower your jar so that I may drink some water.' If she says, 'Drink some, and I will draw some water for your camels, too,' I will know that she is the woman whom you chose to be a wife for your servant, Isaac, and I will know that you have acted kindly to my master."

\v 12 Then he said, "Yahweh, God of my master Abraham, grant me success today and show covenant faithfulness to my master Abraham.
\v 13 Look, here I am standing by the spring of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.
\v 14 Let it happen like this. When I say to a young woman, 'Please lower your pitcher so that I may drink,' and she says to me, 'Drink, and I will water your camels too,' then let her be the one that you have appointed for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown covenant faithfulness to my master."
