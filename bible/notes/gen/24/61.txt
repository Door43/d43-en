  * **Then Rebekah arose, and she and her servant girls mounted the camels** - "Then Rebekah and her servant girls went and got on the camels"
  * **Thus the servant took Rebekah, and went his way** - "In this way Abraham's servant took Rebekah with him and returned to where he had come from"
  * **Now** - This word marks a change in the story. It was telling about the servant finding a wife, and now it will tell about Isaac.
  * **Beerlahairoi** - This is the name of a water well in the Negev. See how you translated it in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:16:13|16:14]].
