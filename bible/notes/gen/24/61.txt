===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **Then Rebekah arose and she and her servant girls mounted the camels**  - "Then Rebekah and her servant girls went and got on the camels"
    * **Thus the servant took Rebekah, and went his way** - "In this way Abraham's servant took Rebekah and went back to where he had come from"
    * **Now** - This word marks a change in the story. It was telling about the servant finding a wife, and now it will tell about Isaac.
    * **Beerlahairoi** - This is the name of a water well in the Negev. See how you translated it in [[en:bible:notes:gen:16:13|16:14]].
