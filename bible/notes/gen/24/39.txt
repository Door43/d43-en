\v 39 Then I asked my master, 'What shall I do if the woman you show me will not come back with me?'
\v 40 He replied, 'Yahweh, whom I have always obeyed \f + \ft metonymy \f*, will send his angel with you, and he will cause your journey to be successful, with the result that you can get a wife for my son from my clan, from my father's family.
\v 41 But if my clan refuses to allow her to return with you, you will be freed from being cursed because of not obeying me.'

\v 39 I said to my master, 'Perhaps the woman will not follow me.'
\v 40 But he said to me, 'Yahweh, before whom I walk, will send his angel with you and he will prosper your way, so that you will get a wife for my son from among my relatives and from my father’s family line.
\v 41 But you will be free from my oath if you come to my relatives and they will not give her to you. Then you will be free from my oath.'

===== Translation Notes: =====

Abraham's servant continues speaking to Rebekah's family.

  * **Perhaps the woman will not follow me.** - This is something that could possibly happen. The servant wanted to know what he should do if it did. It could be translated as a question: “What if the woman will not come back with me?” or "What should I do if the woman will not come back with me?" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **before whom I walk** - This is a way of saying "whom I serve" or "whom I obey." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **he will prosper your way**  - "he will make your journey successful"
  * **family line** - "family"
  * **But you will be free from my oath if you come to my relatives and they will not give her to you. Then you will be free from my oath** -"But, if you come to my relatives and they will not give her to you, then you will be free from my oath." This is a hypothetical situation that Abraham did not think was likely to happen.
  * **if you come to my relatives** - Different languages use the words come and go differently. Alternate translations: "if you arrive at my relatives' home" or "if you go to my relatives"
