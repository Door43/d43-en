===== Translation Notes: =====

Verse 8 is a continuation of the instructions Abraham gave his servant.

  * **But if the woman is not willing to follow you**  - "But if the woman refuses to come with you." Abraham was answering the servant's question from [[:en:bible:notes:gen:24:05|24:5]]. Abraham did not think that the woman would refuse to come. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **you will be free from this oath of mine**  - "you will be released from the oath you made to me." It can also be translated as "you will not have to do what you swore to do." 
  * **put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master** - This was to show that he would certainly do what he was swearing to do.
  * **swore to him** - "made an oath to him"
  * **concerning this matter**  - "concerning Abraham's request" or "that he would do what Abraham said."
