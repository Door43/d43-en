\v 28 The girl ran and told everyone in her mother's household about what had happened.
\v 29 Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban. Laban went quickly to the servant, who was outside by the well.
\v 30 He was surprised to have seen the nose ring and the bracelets on his sister's arms and to have heard Rebekah tell what the man had said to her. So he went out and saw the man standing near the camels, close to the well.

\v 28 Then the young woman ran and told her mother's household about all of these things.
\v 29 Now Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban. Laban ran to the man who was out at the road by the spring.
\v 30 When he had seen the nose ring and the bracelets on his sister's arms, and when he had heard the words of Rebekah his sister, "This is what  the man said to me," he went to the man, and, behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **all of these things**  - "everything that had just happened"
    * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a new part of the story. We learn that Rebekah had a brother, and the story now tells about what he did.
    * **spring**  - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:gen:24:12|24:13]].
    * **When he had seen the nose ring...and when he had heard the words of Rebekah his sister** - This tells why Laban ran out to the man. 
    * **when he had heard the words of Rebekah his sister, "This is what the man said to me"**  - What Laban heard can be translated as an indirect quote: "when he had heard his sister Rebekah tell what the man had said to her."
    * **behold**  - The word "behold" here adds emphasis to what follows. You could translate this as "indeed."
