\v 42 When I came today to the well, I prayed, 'Yahweh God whom my master, Abraham worships, if you are willing, please allow this journey of mine to be successful.
\v 43 Listen to me. I am standing alongside a well. A girl may come to draw water. I am asking you that if I say to her, "Please, give me a little water to drink from your jar."
\v 44 If she says to me, "Certainly, drink some, and I will also draw some water for your camels," that will be the woman whom you have chosen for my master's son!'

\v 42 When I came today to the well, I prayed, 'Yahweh, God whom my master, Abraham, worships, if you are going to make me successful on this journey, please do this for me:
\v 43 I am standing alongside a well, where girls will come to draw water. I am asking you that if I say to a girl, "Please, give me a little water to drink from your jar,"
\v 44 and if she says to me, "Certainly, drink some, and I will also draw some water for your camels," then let that be the woman whom you have chosen for my master's son!'

\v 42 So I arrived today at the spring, and said, 'O Yahweh, God of my master Abraham, please, if you do indeed intend to make my journey successful—
\v 43 here I am, standing by the spring of water—let the young woman who comes out to draw water, the woman to whom I say, "Please give me a little water from your pitcher to drink,"
\v 44 the woman who says to me, "Drink, and I will also draw water for your camels"—let her be the woman whom you, Yahweh, have chosen for my master’s son.'
