====== Genesis 24 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended or special quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 24:60, which is a quotation. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Intermarriage ==
Abraham forbid any marriage between his son and the people of Canaan. This is because it would cause him to worship other gods. Intermarriage and worshipping false gods are things that frequently caused Abraham's descendants to struggle. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod]])

== Abraham's wealth ==
There are many instances recorded in this chapter which highlight Abraham's significant wealth. He owned more than 10 camels and had large amounts of gold. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "Put your hand under my thigh" ==
Many scholars believe this is a euphemism. Putting one's hand on a man's genitals was a way to make an important oath. It represented power and progeny. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
