===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **So they sent their sister Rebekah**  - "So the family sent Rebekah"
    * **Our sister**  - Rebekah was not the sister to everyone in her family. This idiom is used to show deep feelings for Rebekah. This could be translated "Our dear Rebekah." (See: [[en:ta:translate:idiom]])
    * **may you be the mother of thousands of ten thousands**  - The phrase "the mother of" is an idiom that refers to her descendants not just the children she gives birth to. Also, "thousands of ten thousands" is a hyperbole. This could be translated as "may you have more descendants than you can count." (See: [[en:ta:translate:hyperbole]])
    * **possess the gate of those who hate them**  - "rule over their enemies"
