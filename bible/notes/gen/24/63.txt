\v 63 One evening he went out into the field to meditate as he walked. He looked up and was surprised to see some camels coming.
\v 64 Rebekah also looked up and saw Isaac. She got off the camel,
\v 65 and asked the servant, "Who is that man who is approaching?" The servant replied, "That is Isaac, my master." So she took her veil and covered her face, which was the custom for a woman who was about to be married.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Isaac went out to meditate in the field in the evening** - "One evening Isaac went out to the field to think." This must have been a long time after the servant and Rebekah left her home since they had to travel a long distance.
  * **When he looked up and saw, behold, there were camels coming!** - The word "behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows. "When he looked up he was surprised to see camels coming"
  * **Rebekah looked** - "Rebekah looked up"
  * **she jumped down from the camel** - "she quickly got off the camel"
  * **So she took her veil, and covered herself** - "So she covered her face with her veil." This is a sign of respect and modesty towards the man she will marry. The full meaning of this can be made explicit. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **veil** - a piece of cloth used to cover a person's head, shoulders, and face
