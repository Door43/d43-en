\v 1 Abraham was now a very old man. Yahweh had blessed Abraham in many ways.
\v 2 One day Abraham said to the chief servant of his household, the man who was in charge of all Abraham owned, "Put your hand between my thighs to solemnly promise you will do what I tell you.
\v 3 Knowing that Yahweh God \add who created\add* the heavens and the earth is listening, promise that you will not get a wife for my son, Isaac, from the daughters of the Canaan people-group among whom I am now living.
\v 4 Instead, go to my country and to my relatives and get a wife for my son Isaac from among them."

\v 1 Now Abraham was old, well advanced in years, and Yahweh had blessed Abraham in all things.
\v 2  Abraham said to his servant, the one who was the oldest of his household and who was in charge of all that he had, "Put your hand under my thigh
\v 3 and I will make you swear by Yahweh, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you will not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I make my home.
\v 4 But you will go to my country, and to my relatives, and get a wife for my son Isaac."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **old, well advanced in years** - The words "old" and "well advanced in years" mean the same thing. The two of them together emphasize that Abraham was "very old." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Put your hand under my thigh** - Abraham was about to ask the servant to swear to do something. Putting his hand under Abraham's thigh would show that he would certainly do what he would swear to do.
  * **and I will make you swear** - This can be expressed as a command: "and swear."
  * **swear by Yahweh** - This can be translated as "promise me in the name of Yahweh" or "promise me with God as your witness."
  * **the God of heaven and the God of the earth**  - "the God of heaven and earth" or "the God of everything in heaven and earth" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]] )
  * **from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I make my home**  - "from these Canaanites that we live among"
  * **But you will go** - This can be translated as a command: "Swear that you will go" or "But go."
  * **my relatives**  - "my family"
