\v 3 Knowing that Yahweh God \add who created\add* the heavens and the earth is listening, promise that you will not get a wife for my son, Isaac, from the daughters of the Canaan people-group among whom I am now living.
\v 4 Instead, go to my country and to my relatives and get a wife for my son Isaac from among them."

\v 2  Abraham said to his servant, the one who was the oldest of his household and who was in charge of all that he had, "Put your hand under my thigh
\v 3 and I will make you swear by Yahweh, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you will not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I make my home.
\v 4 But you will go to my country, and to my relatives, and get a wife for my son Isaac."
