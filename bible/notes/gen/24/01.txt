\v 1 Abraham was now a very old man. Yahweh had blessed Abraham in many ways.

\v 3 Knowing that Yahweh God \add who created\add* the heavens and the earth is listening, promise that you will not get a wife for my son, Isaac, from the daughters of the Canaan people-group among whom I am now living.
\v 4 Instead, go to my country and to my relatives and get a wife for my son Isaac from among them."

\v 1 Now Abraham was old, well advanced in years, and Yahweh had blessed Abraham in all things.
\v 2  Abraham said to his servant, the one who was the oldest of his household and who was in charge of all that he had, "Put your hand under my thigh
\v 3 and I will make you swear by Yahweh, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you will not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell.
\v 4 But you will go to my country, and to my relatives, and get a wife for my son Isaac."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **and I will make you swear** - This can be expressed as a command: "and swear."
  * **swear by Yahweh** - This can be translated as "promise me in the name of Yahweh" or "promise me with God as your witness."
  * **the God of heaven and the God of the earth**  - "the God of heaven and earth" or "the God of everything in heaven and earth" (See: [[:en:ta:translate:merism]] )
  * **from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell**  - "from these Canaanites that we live among"
  * **my relatives**  - "my family"
