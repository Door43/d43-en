\v 10 There was a famine in that land, so they went further south to live for awhile in the land of Egypt, because the lack of food in the land where they were was very severe.
\v 11 When they were coming near to the land of Egypt, Abram said to his wife Sarai, "Listen, I know that you are a very beautiful woman.
\v 12 When the people in Egypt see you, they will say, 'This woman is his wife!' and they will kill me, but they will not kill you.
\v 13 So I ask you to tell them that you are my sister, so that I will be safe and so they will spare my life because of you."

\v 10 There was a famine in the land, so Abram went down into Egypt to stay, for the famine was severe in the land.
\v 11 When he was about to enter into Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, "See here, I know that you are a beautiful woman.
\v 12 When the Egyptians see you they will say, 'This is his wife,' and they will kill me, but they will keep you alive.
\v 13 Say that you are my sister, so that it may be well with me because of you, and so that my life will be spared because of you."
