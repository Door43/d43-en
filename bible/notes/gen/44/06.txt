===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Why does my lord speak such words as these** - The brothers refer to the steward as "my lord." This is a formal way of speaking to someone with greater authority. Alternate translation: "Why are you saying this, my lord?"
  * **Far be it from your servants that they would do such a thing** - The brothers refer to themselves as "your servants" and "they." This is a formal way of speaking to someone with greater authority. Alternate translation: "We would never do such a thing."
