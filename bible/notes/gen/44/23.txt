\v 24 When we returned to our father, we told him what you said.
\v 25 Months later our father said, 'Go back to Egypt and buy some more grain!'
\v 26 But we said, 'We cannot go back by ourselves. We will go only if our youngest brother is with us. We will not be able to see the man who sells grain if our youngest brother is not with us.'

\v 23 And you said to your servants, 'Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will not see my face again.'
\v 24 And it came about when we went up to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.
\v 25 And our father said, 'Go again, buy us some food.'
\v 26 And we said, 'We cannot go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then will we go down, for we will not be able to see the man’s face unless our youngest brother is with us.'
