\v 23 But you told us, 'If your youngest brother does not come down with you, I will not let you see me again!'
\v 24 When we returned to our father, we told him what you said.
\v 25 Months later our father said, 'Go back to Egypt and buy some more grain!'
\v 26 But we said, 'We cannot go back by ourselves. We will go only if our youngest brother is with us. We will not be able to see the man who sells grain if our youngest brother is not with us.'

\v 23 And you said to your servants, 'Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will not see my face again.'
\v 24 And it came about when we went up to your servant my father, we told him the words of my master.
\v 25 And our father said, 'Go again, buy us some food.'
\v 26 And we said, 'We cannot go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then will we go down, for we will not be able to see the man's face unless our youngest brother is with us.'

===== Translation Notes: =====
Judah continues his story to Joseph

    * **And you said to your servants** - Judah refers to himself and his brothers as "your servants." This is a formal way of speaking to someone with greater authority. Alternate translation: "Then you said to us, your servants."
    * **you will not see my face** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:gen:43:03|43:3]].
    * **And it came about** -This phrase is used here to mark the beginning of a new part of the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
    * **we told him the words of my master** - Judah refers to Joseph as "my master." Alternate translation: "we told him what you said, my master."
