\v 8 Look, the money that we found in our sacks’ openings, we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan. How then could we steal out of your master’s house silver or gold?
\v 9 With whomever of your servants it is found, let him die, and we also will be my master’s slaves."
\v 10 The steward said, "Now also let it be according to your words. He with whom the cup is found will be my slave, and you others will be innocent."

  * **How then could we steal out of your lord’s house silver or gold?** - The brothers use a question to emphasize that they would not steal from the lord of Egypt. Alternate translation: "So we would never take anything from your lord's house!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
