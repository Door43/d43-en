\v 20 We answered, 'Our father is alive, but he is an old man. He has a young son who was born after our father became an old man. That son had an \add older\add* brother, who is now dead. So the youngest son is the only one of his mother's sons who is still alive, and his father loves him very much.'
\v 21 Then you said to us, 'The next time you come here, bring your younger brother down to me, so that I can see him.'
\v 22 We said to you, 'No, we cannot do that, because the boy cannot leave his father. If he leaves his father, his father will die because of sorrow.'

\v 21 And you said to your servants, 'Bring him down to me that I may see him.'
\v 22 And we said to my master, 'The boy cannot leave his father. For if he should leave his father his father would die.'
