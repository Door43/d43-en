\v 3 The next morning at dawn the men started on the way home with their donkeys.
\v 4 When they had not gone far from the city, Joseph said to the servant in charge of things in his house, "Pursue those men immediately. When you catch up to them, say to them, 'We did good things for you! Why have you paid us back by doing something bad to us?
\v 5 You have stolen the cup that my master drinks from \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*! It is the cup that he uses to find out things that nobody knows! What you did was very wicked!'~"

\v 3 The morning dawned, and the men were sent away, they and their donkeys.
\v 4 When they were out of the city but were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, "Get up, follow after the men, and when you overtake them, say to them, 'Why have you returned evil for good?
\v 5 Is this not the cup from which my master drinks, and the cup that he uses for divination? You have done evil, this thing that you have done.'"
