\v 30 So please listen. My father will remain alive only if his youngest son remains alive.
\v 31 If he sees that the boy is not with us when we return to him, he will die. We will cause our gray-haired father to die because of his sorrow.
\v 32 I guaranteed\f + \ft Or: promised \f* to my father that the boy would return safely. I told him, 'You can require me to do what I am promising. If I do not bring him back to you, you can say forever that I am to blame\f + \ft Or: it is my fault \f* for not bringing him back to you.'

\v 30 Now, therefore, when I come to your servant my father, and the lad is not with us, since his life is bound up in the boy’s life,
\v 31 it will come about, when he sees that the boy is not with us that he will die. And your servants will bring down the gray hair of your servant our father with sorrow to sheol.
\v 32 For your servant became a guarantee for the boy to my father and said, 'If I do not bring him to you, then I will bear the guilt to my father forever.'

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Now, therefore, when I come** - Judah is describing to Joseph a realistic but hypothetical case of what he will expect will happen to Jacob when he returns without Benjamin.
  * **the lad is not with us** - "the boy is not with us"
  * **since his life is bound up in the boy’s life** - "since he said he would die if the boy did not come back"
  * **it will come about** - Judah is speaking about a hypothecial case in the future as if it would certainly happen. (See [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **And your servants will bring down the gray hair of your servant our father with sorrow to Sheol** - See how you translated a similar phrase in [[en:bible:notes:gen:42:37|42:38]].
  * **And your servants** - Judah refers to himself and his brothers as "your servants." This is a formal way of speaking to someone with greater authority. Alternate translation: "And we, your servants" or "And we."
  * **For your servant** - Judah refers to himself as "your servant." Alternate translation: "For I, your servant" or "For I."
  * **became a guarantee for the boy to my father**  - "made a promise about the boy to my father"
