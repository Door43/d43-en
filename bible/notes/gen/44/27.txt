\v 27 Our father replied, 'You know that my wife Rachel gave birth to two sons for me.
\v 28 One of them disappeared, and I said, "A wild animal has surely torn him to pieces." And I have not seen him since then.
\v 29 If you take this other one from me, too, and something harms him, you would cause me, an old gray-haired man, to die because of my sorrow.'

\v 27 Your servant my father said to us, 'You know that my wife bore me two sons.
\v 28 And the one went out from me and I said, "Surely he is torn in pieces, and I have not seen him since."
\v 29 And if you take this one also from me and harm comes to him, you will bring down my gray hair with sorrow to sheol.'

  * **you know** - "you"refers to Judah.
  * **And if you take this one also from me ** - "you" refers to Judah, "this one" refers to Benjamin, and "me" refers to Jacob.
  * **you will bring down my gray hair with sorrow to sheol** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:gen:42:37|42:38]].
