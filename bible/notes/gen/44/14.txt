===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He was still there** - "Joseph was still there"
  * **they bowed before him** - "they fell before him." This is a sign of the brothers wanting the lord to be merciful to them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **Do you not know that a man like me practices divination?** - Joseph uses a question to scold his brothers. AT: "Surely you know that a man like me can learn things by magic!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
