There they mourned loudly for Jacob for a long time. Joseph performed mourning ceremonies for his father for seven days.
\v 11 When the Canaan people-group who lived there saw them mourning like that, they said, "This is a sad mourning place for the people of Egypt!" So they named the place Abel-Mizraim, \add which sounds like the Hebrew words that mean 'mourning of the Egyptians\add*.' \p

\v 10 When they came to the threshing floor of Atad on the other side of  the Jordan, they mourned with very great and grievious sorrow. There Joseph made a seven day mourning for his father.
\v 11 When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, "This is a very sad occasion for the Egyptians."  That is why the place was called Abel-Mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.
