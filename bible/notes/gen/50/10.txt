There they mourned loudly for Jacob for a long time. Joseph performed mourning ceremonies for his father for seven days.

\v 10 When they came to the threshing floor of Atad on the other side of  the Jordan, they mourned with very great and grievous sorrow. There Joseph made a seven day mourning for his father.
\v 11 When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, "This is a very sad occasion for the Egyptians."  That is why the place was called Abel Mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.
