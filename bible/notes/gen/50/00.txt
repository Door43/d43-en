====== Genesis 50 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Embalming ==
Embalming was practiced in Egypt on very important people when they died. They remove the liquids from the body and attempted to wrap and preserve the body from decay. 

== Joseph's character ==
Joseph's character was so upright that Pharaoh's officials went with him to Canaan to bury Jacob. This was a very large funeral procession. He also learned lessons from earlier and his life and unified his family. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:upright]])
