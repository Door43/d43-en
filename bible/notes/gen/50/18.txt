\v 18 His brothers also went and lay facedown before him. They said, "See, we are your servants."
\v 19 But Joseph answered them, "Do not be afraid. Am I in the place of God?
\v 20 And as for you, you meant to harm me, but God meant it for good, to preserve the lives of many people, as you see today.
\v 21 So now do not be afraid. I will provide for you and your little children." He comforted them in this way and spoke kindly to them.
