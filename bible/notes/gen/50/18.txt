\v 19 But Joseph replied to them, "Do not be afraid! \add God is the one who punishes people\add*; am I God?\f + \ft Or: I am not God! \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 20 As for you, yes, you wanted to do something very evil to me. But God caused something good to come from it! He wanted to save many people from dying of hunger, and that is what happened! Today they are alive!
\v 21 So I say \add again\add*, do not be afraid! I will make sure that you and your children have enough to eat." In that way he reassured them and made their hearts to be peaceful.

\v 18 His brothers also went and lay facedown before him. They said, "See, we are your servants."
\v 19 But Joseph answered them, "Do not be afraid. Am I in the place of God?
\v 20 And as for you, you meant to harm me, but God meant it for good, to preserve the lives of many people, as you see today.
\v 21 So now do not be afraid. I will provide for you and your little children." He comforted them in this way and spoke kindly to their hearts.
