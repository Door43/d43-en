\v 15 After Jacob died, Joseph's brothers became worried. They realized what might happen. They said, "Suppose Joseph hates us and tries to get revenge for all the evil things that we did to him many years ago?"
\v 16 So they sent someone to tell this to Joseph for them: "Before our father died, he told us this:
\v 17 'Say to Joseph, "Please forgive your \add older\add* brothers for the evil thing that they did to you, for their terrible sin against you, because what they did to you was very wrong."~' So now we, who are servants of your father's God, ask you, please forgive us for what we did to you." But Joseph just cried when he received their message.

\v 15 When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, "What if Joseph bears a grudge and wants to repay us in full for all the evil that we did to him?"
\v 16 So they sent a message to Joseph, saying, "Your father gave instructions before he died, saying,
\v 17 'Tell  Joseph this, "Please forgive your brothers and the wrong they committed when they treated you so badly."' Now please forgive  the servants of the God of your father."  Joseph wept when the message was brought to him.
