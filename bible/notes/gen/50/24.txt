\v 24 Joseph said to his brothers, "I am about to die; but God will  surely come to you and lead you up out of this land to the land which he swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob."
\v 25 Then Joseph made the people of Israel swear an oath. He said, "God will surely come to you. At that time you must carry up my bones from here."
\v 26 So Joseph died, one hundred ten years old. After they embalmed him, they put  him in a coffin in Egypt.
