\v 15 When all the money of the lands of Egypt and  Canaan was spent, all the Egyptians came to Joseph saying, "Give us food! Why should we die in your presence because our money is gone?"
\v 16 Joseph said, "If your money is gone, bring your livestock and I will give you food in exchange for your livestock."
\v 17 So they brought their livestock to Joseph. Joseph gave them food in exchange for the horses, for the flocks, for the herds, and for the donkeys. He fed them with bread in exchange for all their livestock that year.
