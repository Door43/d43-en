\v 19 If you do not give us some food, we will die!\f + \ft Or: Do you want to watch us die? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* If you do not give us seeds, our fields will become useless [IDI]. Buy us and our land in exchange for food. Then we will be the king's slaves, and he will own the land.

\v 18 When that year was ended, they came to him the next year and said to him, "We will not hide from my master that our money is all gone, and the herds of cattle are my master's. There is nothing left in the sight of my master, except our bodies and our land.
\v 19 Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh. Give us seed that we may live and not die, and that the land may not become desolate."

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **they came to him** - "the people came to Joseph"
  * **We will not hide from my master** - The people refer to Joseph as "my master." This is a formal way of speaking to someone with greater authority. It can be stated in second person. AT: "We will not hide from you, our master" or "We will not hide from you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **There is nothing left in the sight of my master** - Here "sight" stands Joseph himself. AT: "We have nothing left to give you, our master" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land?** - The word "eyes" refers to Joseph's sight. The people use a question to emphasize how desperate they are to buy food. AT: "Please do not just watch as we die and our land is ruined!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Why should we die ... both we and our land** - The land becoming useless and ruined because there is no seed to plant is spoken of as if the land would die. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
