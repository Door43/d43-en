\v 18 When that year was ended, they came to him the next year and said to him, "We will not hide from my lord that our money is all gone, and the herds of cattle are my lord’s. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord, except our bodies and our lands.
\v 19 Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh. Give us seed that we may live and not die, and that the land may not become desolate."
