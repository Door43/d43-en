\v 18 When that year was ended, the next year they came to him and said, "We cannot hide this from you: We have no more money, and now our livestock belongs to you. We have only our bodies and our land to give to you. We have nothing else left.
\v 19 If you do not give us some food, we will die!\f + \ft Or: Do you want to watch us die? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* If you do not give us seeds, our fields will become useless [IDI].

\v 18 When that year was ended, they came to him the next year and said to him, "We will not hide from my master that our money is all gone, and the herds of cattle are my masterâ€™s. There is nothing left in the sight of my master, except our bodies and our land.
\v 19 Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh. Give us seed that we may live and not die, and that the land may not become desolate."

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **they came to him** - "the people came to Joseph"
    * **We will not hide from my lord** - The people refer to Joseph as "my lord." This is a formal way of speaking to someone with greater authority. Alternate translation: "We will not hide from you, our lord"
    * **There is nothing left in the sight of my lord** - "We have nothing left to give you, our lord"
    * **Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land?** - The word "eyes" refers to Joseph's sight. The people use a question to emphasize how desperate they are to buy food. Alternate translation: "Please do not just watch as we die and our land is ruined." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
