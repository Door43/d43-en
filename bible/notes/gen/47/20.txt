====== Genesis 47:20-22 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 So Joseph bought all the farms in Egypt for the king. The people of Egypt each sold their land to him because the famine was very severe, and they had no other way to get money to buy food. So all the farms became the king's farms.
\v 21 As a result, Joseph caused all the people from one border of the country to the other to become the king's slaves.
\v 22 But he did not buy the priests' land, because they received food from the king regularly, so the food that the king gave them was enough for them. That is the reason they did not sell their land to him.

\v 20 So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh. For every Egyptian sold his field, because the famine was very severe. In this way, the land became Pharaohâ€™s.
\v 21 As for the people, he made them slaves from one end of  Egypt's border to the other end.
\v 22 It was only the land of the priests that Joseph did not buy, because the priests were given an allowance. They ate from the allotment which Pharaoh gave them. Therefore they did not sell their land.
