====== Genesis 37 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter begins to record the account of Jacob's sons. The rest of the book of Genesis focuses on Jacob's sons, especially Joseph. This chapter also references Jacob as "Israel" beginning in this chapter.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Favoritism ==
Jacob's favoritism became a great problem for his sons. They are always jealous of Joseph because he is the favorite son. The beautiful garment Jacob gave to Joseph greatly strained the relationship between Joseph and his brothers. His dream is about how he will rule all of his brothers, even though he is not the oldest son. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:favor]])

== God's power ==
The account of Joseph focuses on the power of God. God is able to protect his people despite the evil actions of some. He also is able to continue to bless them despite their circumstances. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:peopleofgod]] and [[:en:obe:kt:bless]])
