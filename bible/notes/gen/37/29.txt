===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **Reuben returned to the pit, and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit** - The word "behold" here shows that Reuben was surprised to find out Joseph was gone. Alternate translation: "Reuben returned to the pit, and was surprised to see that Joseph was not there."
    * **He tore his clothes** - This is an act of deep distress or grief.
    * **Where is the boy? And I, where will I go?** - Reuben uses questions for emphasis. Alternate translation: "The boy is gone! I cannot go back home now!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
