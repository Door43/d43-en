\v 18 They saw him from a distance, and before he came near to them, they plotted against him to kill him.
\v 19 His brothers said to one another, "Look, this dreamer is approaching.
\v 20 Come now, therefore, let us kill him and cast him into one of the pits. We will say, 'A wild animal has devoured him.' We will see what will become of his dreams."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **They saw him from a distance** - "Joseph's brothers saw him while he was far away"
  * **they plotted against him to kill him** - "they made plans to kill him"
  * **this dreamer is approaching** - "here comes the one who has the dreams"
  * **Come now, therefore** - This wording shows that the brothers acted upon their plans. AT: "So now" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **wild animal** - "dangerous animal" or "ferocious animal"
  * **devoured** - to eagerly have eaten
  * **We will see what will become of his dreams** - His brothers planned to kill him, therefore it is ironic that they would speak of his dream coming true, since he would be dead. AT: "That way we will make sure his dreams do not come true" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
