===== Translation Notes: =====

Joseph tells his brothers about his dream.

  * **Behold, we were** - Here, the word "behold" can be translated as “Look” or “Listen” or “Pay attention to what I am about to tell you.” The word "we" refers to Joseph and includes all of his brothers. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
  * **tying bundles of grain** - When grain is reaped it is tied into bundles and stacked until it is time to separate the grain from the straw. Alternate translation: "tying bundles of wheat."
  * **and behold, my bundle rose and stood upright, and behold, your bundles came around and bowed down to my bundle.** - The word “behold” here shows that Joseph was surprised by what he saw in his dream. Alternate translation: "then suddenly, my bundle stood up and your bundles gathered around and bowed down to my bundle."
  * **Will you really reign over us? Will you actually rule over us?** - Both of these phrases mean basically the same thing. Joseph's brothers are using questions to mock Joseph. Alternate translation: "You will never be our king, and we will never bow down to you!" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **reign over us** - The word "us" refers to Joseph's brothers but not Joseph. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **for his dreams and for his words** - "because of his dreams and what he said"
