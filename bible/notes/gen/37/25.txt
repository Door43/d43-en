===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **They sat down to eat bread** - "Joseph's brothers sat down to eat"
  * **They lifted up their eyes and looked, and behold, a caravan** - The word "behold" marks the beginning of another event in the larger story. Your language may have a way of doing this. Alternate translation: "They looked up and they saw that a caravan."
  * **their camels bearing** - "their camels carrying"
  * **spices** - a substance used in cooking to add flavor to food. Alternate translation: "seasonings."
  * **balm**  - an oily substance with a sweet smell used for healing and protecting skin. Alternate translation: "medicine."
  * **traveling to carry them down to Egypt** - "bringing them down to Egypt." This can be made more explicit: "bringing them down to Egypt to sell them." ([[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **What profit is it if we kill our brother and cover up his blood?** - Judah uses this question to emphasize they could make money if they sell Joseph. Alternate translation: "We would gain nothing by killing our brother and lying about it" or "Instead of killing our brother and lying about it, I have a better idea." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]).
