===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continued to speak to Abram while Abram dreamed.

  * **that they will serve**  - "that your descendants will serve"
  * **abundant possessions**  - "many possessions" or "great wealth"
  * **you will go to your fathers**  - "you will go to your ancestors." This means "you will die." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metonymy|Metonymy]])
  * **you will be buried in a good old age**  - This can be translated as "you will be very old when you die and your family buries your body."
  * **In the fourth generation**  - In this verse, one generation apparently refers to a lifespan of 100 years. Therefore it could be translated as "After four hundred years."
  * **they will come here again**  - "your descendants will come back here." Abraham's descendants would come to the land where Abram was then living, the land that Yahweh had promised to give to him.
  * **has not reached its limit**  - "is not yet complete." It can also be translated as "will get much worse before I punish them."
