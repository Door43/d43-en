===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continued to speak to Abram while Abram dreamed.

  * **that they will serve** - "that your descendants will serve"
  * **abundant possessions** - "many possessions" or "great wealth"
  * **you will go to your fathers**  - "you will go to your ancestors." This is a metonym meaning "you will die." When people died, they would be buried in tombs that belong to their families. So in that sense, they would go to be with their ancestors. (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
  * **you will be buried in a good old age** - This can be translated as "you will be very old when you die and your family buries your body."
  * **In the fourth generation** - In this verse, one generation apparently refers to a lifespan of 100 years. So "In the fourth generation" could be translated as "After four hundred years."
  * **they will come here again**  - "your descendants will come back here." Abraham's descendants would come to the land where Abram was then living, the land that Yahweh had promised to give to him.
  * **has not reached its limit**  - "is not yet complete." It can also be translated as "will get much worse before I punish them."
