<usfm>
\v 17 When the sun had set and it had become dark, unexpectedly a blazing torch and a clay pot containing burning coals from which smoke was rising appeared and went between the halves of the animals.
\v 18 On that day Yahweh made an agreement with Abram. Yahweh told him, "I will give to your descendants all the land between the river that is on the eastern border of Egypt to the south, and north to the huge Euphrates River.
\v 19 That is the land where the Ken, the Keniz, the Kidmon,
\v 20 the Heth, the Perez, the Repha,
\v 21 the Amor, the Canaan, the Girgash, and the Tebus people-groups live."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **behold**  - The word “behold” here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.
  * **a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between the pieces**  - God did this to show Abram that he was making a covenant with him.
  * **passed between the pieces**  - This can also be translated as "passed through between the two rows of animal pieces."
  * **I hereby give this land** - By saying this, God was giving the land to Abram's descendants. God was doing this then, but the descendants would not go into the land until many years later.
  * **the great river, the Euphrates River**  - "the large river, the Euphrates River." This is two ways of referring to the same river.
  * **the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites**  - These are the names of groups of people who lived in that land. God would would allow Abraham's descendants to conquer these people and take their land.
