===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **After these things**  - These things refers to when the kings fought and Abram rescued Lot.
  * **the word of Yahweh came to Abram in a vision**  - "Yahweh spoke to Abram in a vision." The phrase "the word of the Yahweh came" is often used in the Bible to introduce an account in which God gives a message to a prophet.
  * **shield ... reward** - God used these two metaphors to tell Abram about his character and his relationship to Abram. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I am your shield**  - Soldiers use a shield to protect themselves from their enemies. This can also be translated as a simile: "I will protect you like shield" or "I am your shield to protect you."
  * **reward**  - This can be translated as "payment." It refers to the payment a person deserves. "I am the treasure that you will receive." Abram had not accepted the reward that the king of Sodom had offered him. God was saying that he would give Abram everything he needed. Two possible interpretations are 1) "I am all that you need" or 2) "I will give you all you need."
  * **Abram said, "Since you have given me**  - Since Abram had already been speaking, "Abram said" can be translated as "Abram continued speaking and said" or it can be deleted.
