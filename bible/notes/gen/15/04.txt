\v 4 Yahweh replied, "No! He will not be the one who will inherit it. Instead, you yourself will be the father of the one who will inherit everything you own."
\v 5 Then Yahweh took Abram outside of his tent and said, "Look up at the sky! Can you count the stars? No, you cannot count them because there are so many of them, and your descendants will be as numerous as the stars."

\v 4 Then, behold, the word of Yahweh came to him, saying, "This man will not be your heir; but rather the one who will come from your own body will be your heir."
\v 5 Then he brought him outside, and said, "Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them." Then he said to him, "So will your descendants be."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Then, behold** - The word "behold" emphasizes the fact that the word of Yahweh came to Abraham again.
  * **the word of Yahweh came** - This is an idiom. AT: "Yahweh spoke his word." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:15:01|15:1]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **This man** - This refers to Eliezer of Damascus. "Your servant"
  * **the one who will come from your own body** - "the one that you will father" or "your very own son." Abram's own son would become his heir. 
  * **number the stars** - "count the stars"
  * **So will your descendants be** - Just as Abram would not be able to count all the stars, he would not be able to count all his descendants because there would be so many.
