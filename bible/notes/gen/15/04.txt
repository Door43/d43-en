===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Then, behold, the word of Yahweh came to him** - The word "behold" emphasizes the fact that the word of Yahweh came to Abraham again, as in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:15:01|15:1]]. This could be translated as "Then, the word of Yahweh came to him again."
  * **This man will not be your heir**  - The phrase "This man" refers to Eliezer of Damascus. It can also be translated as "Your servant will not be your heir."
  * **the one who will come from your own body**  - This can be translated as "the one that you will father" or "your very own son." Abram's own son would become his heir.
  * **number the stars**  - "count the stars" 
  * **So will your descendants be** - Just as Abram would not be able to count all the stars, he would not be able to count all his descendants because there would be so many.
