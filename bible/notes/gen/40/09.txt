\v 9 So the king's chief drink-server told his dream to Joseph. He said, "In my dream I saw a grapevine in front of me.
\v 10 On the vine there were three branches. After the branches budded, they blossomed, and then they produced clusters of grapes.
\v 11 I was holding the king's cup, so I took the grapes and squeezed the juice into the cup. Then I gave the cup to the king to drink the juice."
