<usfm>
\v 14 But when you are out of prison and everything goes well for you, please do not forget me.
\v 15 People took me away forcefully from the land where my fellow Hebrews live. I did nothing wrong there, and also while I have been here in Egypt, I have done nothing for which I deserved to be put in prison. So be kind to me and tell the king about me, so that he will release me from this prison!"

\v 15 For indeed I was abducted out of the land of the Hebrews. Here also have I done nothing that they should put me in this dungeon."
