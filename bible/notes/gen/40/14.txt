===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **But remember me... show kindness to me... mention me..  bring me out... **  - Joseph says the same thing in 4 ways in an extreme attempt to be remembered by the wine steward. The meaning of this is,"Be sure to remember me when you report that I correctly interpreted your dream." This figure of speech is called a doublet, saying the same thing in multiple ways for emphasis. (see: [[en:ta:translate:doublet|Doublet]])
