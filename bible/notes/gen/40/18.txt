===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **This is the interpretation** - "Here is what the dream means"
    * **will lift up your head from you and will hang you on a tree** - Joseph also used the phrase "will lift up your head" when he spoke to the cupbearer in [[en:bible:notes:gen:40:12|40:13]]. Here it has a different meaning. Possible meanings are 1) "will lift up your head to put a rope around your neck and hang you from a tree" or 2) "will lift up your head to cut it off."
