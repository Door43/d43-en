\v 20 It came about on the third day that it was Pharaoh's birthday. He made a feast for all his servants. He paid special attention to the chief cupbearer and the chief baker, more than to all his other servants.
\v 21 He restored the chief cupbearer to his responsibility, and he put the cup into Pharaoh's hand again.
\v 22 But he hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had interpreted to them.
\v 23 Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember to help Joseph. Instead, he forgot about him.
