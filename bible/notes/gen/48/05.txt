\v 5 And now I will consider that your two sons, who were born to you here in Egypt before I came here, will belong to me\f + \ft Or: be as though they are my sons \f*. Ephraim and Manasseh will be my sons, and they will inherit my possessions, just like my sons Reuben and Simeon and the others will.
\v 6 If you later become the father of any more children, they will not be considered to be my children, but as my grandchildren, and they will receive as part of what they inherit some of the same land that is in the territory that their brothers will inherit.
\v 7 Many years ago, as I was returning from Paddan-Aram\f + \ft Or: Mesopotamia \f*, your mother Rachel died in Canaan land, while we were still traveling, not far from Ephrath \add town\add*. So I buried her body there alongside the road to Ephrath (which is now called Bethlehem)."

\v 5 And now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt, they are mine. Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine, just as Reuben and Simeon are mine.
\v 6 The children you have after them will be yours; they will be listed under the names of their brothers in their inheritance.
\v 7 But as for me, when I came from Paddan, to my sorrow Rachel died in the land of Canaan on the way, while there was still some distance to go to Ephrath. I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem)."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **now** - This does not mean "at this moment," but is used to draw attention to the important point that follows.
  * **they will be listed under the names of their brothers in their inheritance** - This means the rest of Joseph's children would inherit land as part of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh. AT: "as for their inheritance, you will list them under the names of their brothers"
  * **Ephrath** - See how you translated the name of this city in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:35:16|35:16]].
