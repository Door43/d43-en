===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **between Israel's knees** - When Joseph placed his sons on Israel's lap or knees it was a sign that Israel was adopting them.
    * **putting Manasseh on his left side toward Jacob's right hand** - Joseph places the boys so that Israel will put his right hand on Manasseh. Manasseh was the oldest brother and the right hand was the sign he would receive the greater blessing.
