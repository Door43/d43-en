\v 8 When Jacob saw Joseph's sons, he asked, "Who are these boys?"
\v 9 Joseph replied to his father, "They are the sons that God has given to me here in Egypt." Jacob said, "Bring them close to me so that I can bless them."
\v 10 Jacob was almost blind because he was very old. He could not see well. So Joseph brought his sons close to his father, and Jacob kissed them and hugged them.

\v 8 When Israel saw Joseph's sons, he said, "Whose are these?"
\v 9 Joseph said to his father, "They are my sons, whom God has given me here." Israel said, "Bring them to me, that I may bless them."
\v 10 Now Israel's eyes were failing because of his age, so he could not see. So Joseph brought them near to him, and he kissed them and embraced them.
