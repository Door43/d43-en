\v 19 But his father refused, saying, "I know that, my son, I know what I am doing. Manasseh's descendants will also become a people-group, and they will become important. But his younger brother's descendants will become greater than his will. His descendants will become several nations."
\v 20 So he blessed them both on that day, saying, "The people in Israel will use your names when they bless people. They will say, 'We pray that God will help you as he helped Ephraim and Manasseh.'~" In that way, Jacob said that Ephraim would become more important than Manasseh.

\v 19 His father refused and said, "I know, my son, I know. He also will become a people, and he also will be great.  Yet his younger brother will be greater than he, and his descendants will become a multitude of nations."
\v 20 Israel blessed them that day with these words,  "The people of Israel will pronounce blessings by your names saying, 'May God make you like Ephraim and like  Manasseh'." In this way, he put Ephraim before Manasseh.
