  * **the tree of the knowledge of good and evil**  - "the tree that gives people the ability to understand both good and evil" or "the tree that makes people who eat its fruit able to know good things and bad things."
  * **good and evil**  - This is a figure of speech that refers to both extremes and everything in between. In this verse, it means "everything, including both good and evil." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **in the midst of the garden**  - "in the middle of the garden." The two trees may not have been in the exact center of the garden.
  * **A river went out of Eden to water the garden**  - This can be translated as "A river flowed through Eden to water the garden." The garden was in Eden. The river continued to flow outside of Eden.
