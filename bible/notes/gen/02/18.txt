\v 18 Then Yahweh God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone. I will make him a helper corresponding to him."
\v 19 Out of the ground Yahweh God formed every animal of the field and every bird of the sky. Then he brought them to the man to see what he would call them. Whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.
\v 20 The man gave names to all the livestock, to all the birds of the sky, and to every beast of the field. But for the man himself there was found no helper corresponding to him.
