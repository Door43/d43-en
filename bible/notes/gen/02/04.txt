===== Important Terms: =====

  * [[:en:bible:notes:key-terms:yahweh|Yahweh God]]
 
===== Translation Notes: =====

The rest of Genesis 2 tells about how God created people on the sixth day.

  * **These are the events concerning the heavens and the earth**  - "This is the account of the heavens and the earth" or "This is the story about the heavens and the earth." There are two understandings of the purpose of this sentence. Either it is a summary of the events described in Genesis 1:1-2:3, or it introduces the events described in Genesis 2. If possible, translate this so that it could be understood either way.
  * **in the day that Yahweh God made**  - This can be translated as "when the LORD God created." The word "day" refers to the whole time span of the creation, not to just one particular day.
  * **bush of the field**  - This refers to shrubs growing in the wild, that animals might eat.
  * **plant of the field**  - This refers to leafy plants like vegetables or greens that both animals and humans can eat.
  * **mist**  - This refers either to 1) something like dew or morning fog or 2) springs from underground streams.
  * **the whole surface of the ground**  - the entire earth
