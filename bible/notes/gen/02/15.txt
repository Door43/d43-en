===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the garden of Eden** - "the garden that was in Eden"
  * **to work it** - "to cultivate it." This means to do everything necessary so that the plants will grow well.
  * **to maintain it** - to guard against anything bad happening in it
  * **From every tree in the garden** - "The fruit of every tree in the garden"
  * **you** - This pronoun is singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **you may freely eat ... you may not eat** - In some languages it would be natural to first say what is not permitted and to then say what is permitted, as in the UDB.
  * **may freely eat** - "may eat without restriction"
  * **the tree of the knowledge of good and evil** - "the tree that gives people the ability to understand both good and evil" or "the tree that makes people who eat its fruit able to know good things and bad things." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:02:09|2:9]].
  * **you may not eat** - "I will not permit you to eat" or "you must not eat"
