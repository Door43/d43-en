  * **the garden of Eden**  - This can also be translated as "the garden in Eden."
  * **From every tree in the garden**  - "The fruit of every tree in the garden"
  * **you**  - This pronoun is singular. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you|Forms of 'You']])
  * **you may freely eatâ€¦you may not eat**  - In some languages it would be natural to first say what is not permitted and to then say what is permitted, as in the UDB.
  * **may freely eat**  - "may eat without restriction"
  * **the tree of the knowledge of good and evil**  - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:02:09|2:9]].
  * **you may not eat**  - This can be translated as "I will not permit you to eat" (UDB) or "you must not eat."
