===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Gihon**  - (See: [[:en:ta:translate:translatenames]]).
  * **flows throughout the whole land of Cush** - This can be translated as "winds through the whole land of Cush." The river did not cover the whole land, but wound through various parts of the land.
  * **the land of Cush**  - "the land called Cush". This was modern Ethiopia or Sudan.
  * **which flows east of Asshur** - "which flows in the land east of the city of Asshur." The Tigris River flows from north to south. The phrase "which flows east of Asshur" is a relative clause. Some languages would not use a relative clause here. It can also be translated as "and it flows east of Asshur." (See: Clause in [[en:ta:vocabulary:sentencestructure#clause]])
