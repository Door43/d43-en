===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Gihon** - (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **flows throughout the whole land of Cush** - The river did not cover the whole land, but wound through various parts of the land.
  * **the whole land of Cush** - "the entire land called Cush"
  * **which flows east of Asshur** - "which flows in the land east of the city of Asshur." The Tigris River flows from north to south. The phrase "which flows east of Asshur" is a relative clause. Some languages would not use a relative clause here. AT: "and it flows east of Asshur." (See the section on clauses in [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_sentences]])
