===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Gihon**  - (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|How to Translate Names]])
  * **flows throughout the whole land of Cush**  -  The river did not cover the whole land, but wound through various parts of the land.
  * **the land of Cush**  - "the land called Cush". This was modern Ethiopia or Sudan.
  * **which flows east of Asshur**  - "which flows in the land east of the city of Asshur." The Tigris River flows from north to south. The phrase "which flows east of Asshur" is a relative clause. Some languages would not use a relative clause here. It can also be translated as "and it flows east of Asshur." (See the section on clauses in [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_sentences|Sentences]].)
