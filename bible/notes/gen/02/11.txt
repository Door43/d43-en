===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Pishon** - This is the only time this river is referred to in the Bible. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]).
  * **the whole land of Havilah** - "the whole land called Havilah." It was somewhere in the Arabian Desert. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]).
  * **where there is gold** - This is a relative clause that describes Havilah. Some languages would not use a relative clause for this. AT: "there is gold in Havilah." (See the section on clauses in [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_sentences]])
  * **bdellium** - This resin comes from a tree and smells nice. A resin is sticky stuff that comes out of some trees and can burn. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **the onyx stone** - "onyx stones." Onyx is a certain kind of beautiful stone. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
