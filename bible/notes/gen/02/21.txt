===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man**  - "caused the man to sleep intensely." A deep sleep is a time of sleeping in which a person is not easily disturbed or wakened.
  * **with the rib…he made a woman**  - "From the rib…he formed a woman." The rib was the material God made the woman from.
  * **This time, this one is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh**  - This can also be translated as "Finally this one's bones are like my bones, and her flesh is like my flesh." After looking among all the animals for a partner and not finding one, he finally saw someone who was like him and could be his partner. The man was probably expressing his feeling of relief and joy.
  * **flesh**  - This refers to the soft parts of the body like skin and muscle.
  * **She will be called 'woman', because she was taken out of man.**  - The translator may want to write a footnote saying "The Hebrew word for 'woman' sounds like the Hebrew word 'man'.
