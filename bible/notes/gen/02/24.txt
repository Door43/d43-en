===== Translation Notes: =====

What follows is written by the author. The man did not say these things.

  * **Therefore**  - AT: "That is why"
  * **a man will leave his father and his mother**  - This is about men in general. It does not refer to any particular man at any particular time. AT: "men stop living in their father and mother's home."
  * **become one flesh**  - This is an idiom. AT: "become as one body" or "become like one person in body and spirit." It does not mean that they literally become one person.
  * **They were both naked**  - The word "they" refers to the man and the woman that God had created.
  * **naked**  - "not wearing clothing"
  * **but were not ashamed**  - At that time there was no reason for them to be ashamed about being naked.
