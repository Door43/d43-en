===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **from there**  - "from the city"
  * **its name was called Babel, because there Yahweh confused…**  - The name "Babel" sounds like the word that means "confused." Translators may want to add a footnote about this.
  * **confused the language of the whole earth**  - This could also be translated as “mixed up the language of the whole earth.” It means that Yahweh caused the people all over the earth to no longer speak the same language.
