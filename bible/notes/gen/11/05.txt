\v 5 So they began to build the city and the tower. Then Yahweh looked down and saw the city and the tower that those puny men were building.
\v 6 Yahweh said, "These people are one group that all speak the same language. If they have begun to do this now, then there is nothing that they will decide to do that will be impossible for them\f + \ft Or: they will be able to do whatever they decide to do \f* \f + \ft litotes \f*!
\v 7 So, okay\f + \ft Or: now \f*, we will go down there and cause there to be many different languages, so that they will not be able to understand what each other is saying."

\v 5 One day Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower that the people were building.
\v 6 Yahweh said, "These people are one group that all speak the same language. If they have begun to do this, then there is nothing that they will decide to do that will be impossible for them!
\v 7 So, let us go down there and make the people speak different languages, so that they will not be able to understand what each other is saying."

\v 5 So Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower which the descendants of Adam had  built.
\v 6 Yahweh said, "Look, they are one people with the same language, and they are beginning to do this! Soon nothing that they intend to do will be  impossible for them.
\v 7 Come, let us go down and confuse their language there, so that they may not understand each other."

===== translationWords: =====

  * [[en:obe:kt:yahweh]]
  * [[en:obe:other:descendant]]
  * [[en:obe:other:adam]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the descendants of Adam**  - This can be translated as "the people."
  * **came down**  - The information about where he came down from can be made explicit: "came down from heaven." This does not tell how he came down. Use a general word meaning "came down." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Explicit and Implicit]])
  * **to see**  - "to observe" or "to look more closely"
  * **one people with the same language**  - All the people were one big group and they all spoke the same language.
  * **nothing that they intend to do will be impossible for them**  - This double negative can also be translated as: "anything they intend to do will be possible for them." It can also be translated as "they will be able to do anything they want to do." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives|Double Negatives]])
  * **let us go down**  - The word “us” is plural even though it refers to God. Some translate it as "let me go down" or “I will go down.” If you do this, consider adding a footnote to say that the word is plural. (See the note on "Let us make" in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:26|1:26]].) ([[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pluralpronouns|English Plural Pronouns]])
  * **confuse their language**  - This could also be translated "mix up their language." This means that Yahweh would cause the people all over the earth to stop speaking the same language.
  * **so that they may not understand each other**  - This was the purpose of confusing their language. It can also be translated as "so that they will not understand what each other is saying." (UDB)
