===== translationNotes: =====

  * **his** - Here the word "his" refers to Terah.
  * **Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife** - "his daughter-in-law Sarai, who was the wife of his son Abram"
  * **Haran ... Haran** - These are two different names and they are spelled differently in Hebrew. One refers to a person and the other refers to a city. (The "h" sound in the city's name is louder than the "h" sound in the person's name.) You might choose to spell them differently in your language to show this.
