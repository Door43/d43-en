===== Translation Notes: =====

The rest of this chapter lists the line of Shem's descendants down to Abram.

  * **These are the descendants of Shem**  - This sentence introduces the list of Shem's descendants in Genesis 11:10-26.
  * **became the father of Arpachshad**  - This can also be translated as "had his son Arpachshad" or "his son Arpachshad was born."
  * **Arpachshad**  - (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|How to Translate Names]])
  * **a hundred…two…five hundred**  - Translators may write the words or the numerals “100,” "2" and “500.” (The ULB and the UDB have words if the number has only one or two words; they have numerals if the number has three or more words. See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
