===== Translation Notes: =====

Verses 8 and 9 repeat what was said in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:14:03|14:3]] and continues to tell what happened when the kings came together to fight.

  * **they turned and came**  - The word "they" refers to the four foreign kings who were attacking the region of Canaan. Their names were Amraphel, Arioch, Chedorlaomer, and Tidal.
  * **the Amorites that lived in Hazazaon Tamar** - This phrase tells which Amorite people were defeated. There were other Amorite people who lived in other places.
  * **prepared for battle**  - "joined battle" or "drew up battle lines." Some translators may need to also say that the armies fought, as the UDB does in verse 9. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the king of Bela (also called Zoar)**  - The city of Bela was also called Zoar. This information could also be put at the end of the the sentence: "and the king of Bela went out and prepared for battle. Bela is also called Zoar."
  * **four kings against the five**  - Since the five kings were listed first, some languages might prefer to translate this as "five kings against four."
