\v 21 The King of Sodom said to Abram, "You can keep all the goods you recovered. Just let me take back the people from my city whom you captured."

\v 23 that I will not accept even one thread or a thong of a sandal from anything that belongs to you. As a result, you will never be able to say, 'I caused Abram to become rich.'
\v 24 The only thing I will accept is the food that my men have eaten. But Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre went with me and fought alongside me, so let them also have a share of the goods we brought back."

\v 21 The king of Sodom said to Abram, "Give me the people, and take the goods for yourself."
\v 22 Abram said to the king of Sodom, "I have lifted up my hand to Yahweh, God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth,
\v 23 that I will not take a thread, a sandal strap, nor anything that is yours, so that you can never say, 'I have made Abram rich.'
\v 24 I will take nothing except what the young men have eaten and the share of the men that went with me. Let Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre take their portion."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Give me the people**  - The phrase "the people" may refer to the people of Sodom that the enemies had captured. Abram rescued them when he rescued Lot
  * **I have lifted up my hand**  - This means "I have taken an oath" or "I have made a promise."
  * **I will take nothing except what the young men have eaten**  - This can be translated as "I take from you only what my young men have already eaten." Abram was refusing to accept anything for himself, but acknowledged that the soldiers had eaten some of the supplies during the journey back to Sodom after the battle.
  * **the share of the men that went with me**  - This can be made more explicit: "the share of the recovered property that belongs to the men who helped me get it back." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre**  - These are the allies of Abram (See: [[:en:bible:notes:gen:14:13|14:13]]). Because they were Abram's allies they fought battles alongside him. You can make this more explicit: "my allies Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre."
