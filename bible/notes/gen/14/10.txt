\v 10 Now the Valley of Siddim was full of tar pits, and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, they fell in there. Those who were left fled to the mountains.
\v 11 So the kings took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their provisions, and went their way.
\v 12 When they went, they also took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who was living in Sodom, along with all his possessions.
