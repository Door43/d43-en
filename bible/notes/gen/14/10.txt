===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Now**  - This word introduces background information about the valley of Siddim. Your language may have another way of introducing background information (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]]).
  * **was full of tar pits**  - "had many tar pits." These were holes in the ground that had tar in them. See how you translated "tar" in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:11:03|11:3]].
  * **the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah**  - This is a figure of speech that refers to the kings and their armies. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
  * **they fell in there**  - Possible meanings are 1) some of their soldiers fell in the tar pits (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]]) or 2) the kings themselves fell in the tarpits. Since [[:en:bible:notes:gen:14:17|14:17]] says that the king of Sodom went to meet Abram, the first meaning is more likely correct.
  * **Those who were left**  - "those who did not die in battle and did not fall in the pits"
  * **the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah**  - "the wealth of Sodom and Gomorrah" or "the property of Sodom and Gomorrah"
  * **the enemy**  - This refers to King Chedorlaomer and the other kings and their armies with him who were attacking Sodom and Gomorrah.
  * **their provisions**  - "their food and drink"
  * **went their way**  - "they went away"
  * **they also took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who was living in Sodom, along with all his possessions**  - The phrases "Abram's brother's son" and "who was living in Sodom" remind the reader of things that were written earlier about Lot. You can translate this differently if necessary: "they also took Lot along with all his possessions. Lot was Abram's brother's son and was living in Sodom at that time." (See the section on clauses in [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_sentences#clause]].)
