\v 10 Now the valley of Siddim was full of tar pits, and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, they fell in there. Those who were left fled to the mountains.
\v 11 So the enemy took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their provisions, and went their way.
\v 12 When they went, they also took Lot, Abramâ€™s brother's son, who was living in Sodom, along with all his possessions.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Now**  - This word introduces background information about the valley of Siddim. Your language may have another way of introducing background information (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]]).
  * **was full of tar pits**  - "had many tar pits." These were holes in the ground that had tar in them. See how you translated "tar" in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:11:03|11:3]].
  * **the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah**  - This is a figure of speech that refers to the kings and their armies. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
  * **they fell in there**  - Possible meanings are 1) some of their soldiers fell in the tar pits (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]]) or 2) the kings themselves fell in the tarpits. Since [[:en:bible:notes:gen:14:17|14:17]] says that the king of Sodom went to meet Abram, the first meaning is more likely correct.
  * **Those who were left**  - "those who did not die in battle and did not fall in the pits"
  * **the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah**  - "the wealth of Sodom and Gomorrah" or "the property of Sodom and Gomorrah"
  * **the enemy**  - This refers to King Chedorlaomer and the other kings and their armies with him who were attacking Sodom and Gomorrah.
  * **their provisions**  - "their food and drink"
  * **went their way**  - "they went away"
  * **they also took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who was living in Sodom, along with all his possessions**  - The phrases "Abram's brother's son" and "who was living in Sodom" remind the reader of things that were written earlier about Lot. You can translate this differently if necessary: "they also took Lot along with all his possessions. Lot was Abram's brother's son and was living in Sodom at that time." (See the section on clauses in [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_sentences#clause]].)
