====== Genesis 14 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other translations indent the lines 14:19-20, which is an extended quotation. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Names of places ==
Sometimes the names of places in Scripture are referred to by the name used during the time of the writer. For example, the location referred to as Dan was not yet known by that name because Dan had not yet come to live there. Moses, the author of Genesis, would have known this location as Dan.

== Melchizedek ==
Melchizedek was both a priest and a king. Because of this, he parallels the roles of Jesus. Melchizedek is an important figure in the book of Hebrews. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:priest]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== God Most High ==
Melchizedek worshipped the God Most High. This is probably a reference to the true and only God who created the heavens and the earth and came to be known as Yahweh. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:heaven]])
