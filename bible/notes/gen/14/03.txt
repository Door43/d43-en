\v 3 Those five kings and their armies gathered together in Siddim Valley, which is also called the Salt Sea Valley, to fight against the four kings and their armies. The five kings gathered their armies to fight against the armies of the four kings because King Chedorlaomer and his army had conquered the armies of those five kings many years before, and then forced those kings to pay him tribute money each year.
\v 4 For twelve years King Chedorlaomer  ruled them. But during the thirteenth year, they rebelled against King Chedorlaomer and refused to keep giving him tribute money.
\v 5 The next year, King Chedorlaomer and the other kings that were with him gathered their armies and started coming toward the area of the five kings. They defeated the Rephaite people in Ashteroth-Karnaim, the Zuzite people in Ham, and the Emite people in Shaveh-Kiriathaim.
\v 6 They also defeated the Horite people in their hilly area of Seir as far as El-Paran near the desert, which is past the area of the five kings to the south.
