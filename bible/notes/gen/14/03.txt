===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **These latter five kings joined together** - The information that their armies were with them can be made explicit: "These latter five kings and their armies joined together." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Twelve years they had served**  - The events in verses 4-7 happened before verse 3. Your language may have a way of showing this.
  * **they had served Chedorlaomer**  - This could be translated as "they had been under the control of Chedorlaomer." They probably had to pay him taxes and serve in his army. 
  * **they rebelled**  - This can also be translated as "they refused to serve him" or "they stopped serving him."
  * **came and attacked**  - "came and attacked." They did this because the other kings rebelled.
  * **Rephaim ... Zuzim ... Emim ... Horites** - These are the names of people groups. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Ashteroth-karnaim ... Ham ... Shaveh-kiriathaim ... Seir ... El Paran** - These are the names of places.
  * **as far as El Paran, which is near the desert**  - The phrase "which is near the desert" tells us something more about El Paran. You can translate this relative clause with two sentences if necessary: "as far as El-paran. El-paran is near the desert." (See the section on clauses in [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_sentences]].)
