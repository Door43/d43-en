===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This is Isaac's blessing. He thought he was speaking to Esau, but he was speaking to Jacob.

  * **give you** - Here "you" is singular and refers to Jacob. But the blessing would also apply to Jacob's descendants. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **dew of heaven** - "Dew" is drops of water that form on the plants during the night. This can be made explicit in the translation. AT: "night mist from heaven to water your crops" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **fatness of the earth** - Having fertile land is spoken of as if the earth were fat or rich. AT: "good soil for producing crops" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **plenty of grain and new wine** - If "grain" and "wine" are unknown, this can be stated more generally. AT: "plenty of food and drink"
