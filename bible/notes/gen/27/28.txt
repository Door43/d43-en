===== Translation Notes: =====

This is Isaac's blessing. He thought he was speaking to Esau, but he was speaking to Jacob.

  * **you** - Here "you" is singular and refers to Jacob. But the blessing would also apply to Jacob's descendants. (See: [[en:ta:translate:formsofyou|Forms of 'You']])
  * **dew from heaven**  - "mist in the air" or "rain from the sky"
  * **and of the fatness of the earth**  - The word "fatness of the earth" refers to "fertile land" or "a land that produces plenty." This could be translated as "and good soil for producing crops." (See: [[en:ta:translate:idiom]])
