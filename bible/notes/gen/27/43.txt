\v 43 Now therefore, my son, obey me and  flee  to Laban, my brother, in Haran.
\v 44 Stay with him there for a few days, until your brother’s fury subsides,
\v 45 until your brother’s anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send and bring you back from there. Why should I lose you  both in one day?
