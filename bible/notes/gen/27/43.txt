\v 43 So now, my son, listen carefully to what I am telling you. Escape quickly and go and stay with my brother Laban, in Haran.
\v 44 Stay with him a while, until your older brother is no longer angry.
\v 45 When he forgets what you did to him, I will send a message to you, to tell you to return from there. If Esau kills you, then others will kill him, and then both my sons would die at the same time!" \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 43 Now therefore, my son, obey me and  flee  to Laban, my brother, in Haran.
\v 44 Stay with him there for a few days, until your brother’s fury subsides,
\v 45 until your brother’s anger turns  away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him, Then I will send and bring you from back there. Why should I lose you  both in one day?
