===== translationNotes: =====

  * **said to him** - "said to Esau"
  * **Look** - This adds emphasis to what Isaac says next. AT: "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **far from the richness of the earth** - This speaks about fertile land as if it were rich or fat. AT: "far from the fertile soil" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **your ... you** - In 27:39-40 these pronouns are singular and refer to Esau, but what Isaac says also applies to Esau's descendants (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]]).
  * **dew of the sky above** - "Dew" is drops of water that form on the plants during the night. This can be made explicit in the translation. AT: "the night mist from the sky to water your crops." See how you translated "dew from heaven" in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:27:28|27:28]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **By your sword you will live** - Here "sword" stands for violence. AT: "You will rob and kill people in order to get what you need to live" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **you will shake his yoke from off your neck** - This speaks about someone having a master as if the master's control over the person were a yoke that the person had to carry. AT: "you will free yourself from his control" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
