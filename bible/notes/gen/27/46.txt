===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **I am weary of life**  - Rebekah is exaggerating to emphasize how upset she is about the Hittite women that Esau married. This could be translated as "I am terribly upset." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
    * **the daughters of Heth**  - "these Hittite women"
    * **like these women, some of the daughters of the land**  - "like these women who live in this land"
    * **what good will my life be to me?**  - Rebekah uses a question to emphasize how upset she would be if Jacob marries a Hittite woman. This could be translated as a statement: "My life will be awful!"(See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
