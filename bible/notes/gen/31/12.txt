\v 12 He said to me, 'Look up and you will see that all the male goats that are mating have black and white stripes on them, or are speckled or spotted. This is happening because I have seen all that Laban has done to you.
\v 13 I am God who appeared to you at Bethel, where you set up a stone to show that the place was holy, and you poured olive oil on the stone and made a solemn promise to me. So now leave this land immediately, and return to the land where you were born.'~"

\v 12 He said, "Lift up your eyes and see all the male goats that are mating with the flock. They are ringstreaked, speckled, and spotted, for I have seen everything that Laban is doing to you.
\v 13 I am the God of Beth-el, where you anointed a pillar, where you vowed a vow to me. Now leave this land and return to the land of your birth."
