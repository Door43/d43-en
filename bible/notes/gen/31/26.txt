\v 26 Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done, that you deceived me  and carried away my daughters like prisoners of war?
\v 27 Why did you flee secretly and trick me and did not tell me. I would have sent you away with celebration and with songs, with tambourine and with harps.
\v 28 You did not allow me to kiss my grandsons and my daughters good bye.  Now you have done foolishly.

  * **flee secretly** - "run away in secret"
  * **with celebration** - "with joy"
  * **tambourine** - a musical instrument with a head like a drum that can be hit and with pieces of metal around the side that sound when the instrument is shaken (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **to kiss my grandsons** - "to kiss my grandchildren"
