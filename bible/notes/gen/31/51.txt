\v 51 Laban also said to Jacob, "You see this large stone and this pile of rocks that we have set up to be between us.
\v 52 Both this pile of rocks and this large stone will remind us, that I will not go past these rocks to harm you, and you will not go past these rocks to harm me. We will ask the God whom Abraham and his father Nahor worshiped to punish \f + \ft metonymy \f* either one of us, if we harm the other one."

\v 51 Laban said to Jacob, "Look at this pile, and look at the pillar, which I have set between you and me.
\v 52 This pile is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass beyond this pile to you, and that you will not pass beyond this pile and this pillar to me, to do harm.
\v 53 May the God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us." Jacob swore by God, him whom his father Isaac feared.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **This pile is a witness, and the pillar is a witness**  - These piles of stones were to act as a remembrance and a boundary marker for Jacob and Laban regarding their peace agreement.
  * **May the God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us**  - The word "God" is plural in this context. Since Laban worshipped several gods he was making a general promise that included the gods from both their grandfathers. Alternate Translation: "May Abraham's gods and Nahor's gods and their father's gods, judge between us."
