===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Once at the time of breeding season**  - "During the breading season"
  * **were ringstreaked, speckled, and spotted**  - "had stripes, little spots, and big spots"
  * **angel of God**  - Possible meanings are 1) God made himself look like an angel, or 2) this was one of God's angels, or 3) this was a special messenger from God (some scholars think it was Jesus). Since the phrase is not well understood, it is best to simply translate it as “the angel of God” using the normal word that you use for “angel.”
  * **I said, "Here I am" - **"And I answered, "Here I am"
  * **Here I am**  - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:22:01|Genesis 22:1]].
