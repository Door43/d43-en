===== Translation Notes: =====

Jacob continues his story to his wives Leah and Rachel.

  * **Once at the time of breeding season**  - "During the breading season"
  * **were striped, speckled, and spotted**  - "had stripes, little spots, and big spots"
  * **angel of God**  - Possible meanings are 1) God himself appeared as a man, or 2) One of God's messengers appeared. Since the phrase is not well understood, it is best to simply translate it as “the angel of God” using the normal word that you use for “angel.”
  * **I said, "Here I am"**  - "And I answered, 'Here I am' "
  * **Here I am**  - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:22:01|Genesis 22:1]].
