===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Jacob heard the words of Laban’s sons, that they said**  - "Jacob heard that Laban's sons were saying,"
  * **has taken away all that was our father’s**  - Laban's sons were exaggerating because they were angry. This could be translated as "has taken so much that belonged to our father." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole|Hyperbole]])
  * **Jacob saw the look on Laban's face. He saw that his attitude toward him had changed** - These two sentences mean basically the same thing. The second explains the look that Jacob saw on Laban's face. AT: "Jacob noticed that Laban was no longer pleased with him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **your fathers**  - "your father Isaac and your grandfather Abraham"
