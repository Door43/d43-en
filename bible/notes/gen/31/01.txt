===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Jacob heard the words of Laban’s sons, that they said**  - "Jacob heard that Laban's sons were saying,"
  * **has taken all that was our father’s**  - Here the word "all" is a hyperbole. Laban's sons were exaggerating because they were angry. This could be translated as "has taken so much from our father." "(See: [[:en:ta:translate:hyperbole|Hyperbole]])
  * **Jacob saw the look on Laban's face. He saw that his attitude toward him had changed**  - Stating the same idea in two ways strengthens what is being said. "Jacob noticed that Laban was no longer pleased with him."

  * **your fathers**  - "your ancestors"
