  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Here the author starts to tell a new part of the story.
  * **Jacob heard the words of Laban's sons, that they said** - "Jacob heard that Laban's sons were saying" 
  * **Jacob has taken away all that was our father's** - Laban's sons were exaggerating because they were angry. AT: "Everything that Jacob has taken belonged to our father" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **Jacob saw the look on Laban's face. He saw that his attitude toward him had changed** - These two sentences mean basically the same thing. The second explains the look that Jacob saw on Laban's face. AT: "Jacob noticed that Laban was no longer pleased with him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **your fathers** - "your father Isaac and your grandfather Abraham"
