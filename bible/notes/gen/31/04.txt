  * **I see your father's attitude toward me has changed** - "I have noticed your father is no longer pleased with me"
  * **You know that it is with all my strength that I have served your father** - The word "you" here refers to both Rachel and Leah. It also adds emphasis. Alternate translation: "You yourselves know that I have served your father with all my strength." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
