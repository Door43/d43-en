\v 43 Laban answered and said to Jacob, "The daughters are my daughters, the grandchildren are my grandchildren, and the flocks are my flocks. All that you see is mine.  But what can I do today to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne?
\v 44 So now, let us make a covenant, you and I, and let it be for a witness between you and me."

  * **But what can I do today to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne?**  - Laban uses a question for emphasis. Alternate translation: "But, there is nothing I can do to bring my daughters and grandchildren back with me." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
