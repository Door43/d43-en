\v 14 Joseph replied, "You are lying! I think it is just as I told you. You are spies!
\v 15 But this is how I will determine whether what you are saying is true. I think that as surely as the king lives, you are spies. And you will not leave this place until your youngest brother comes here!
\v 16 Send one of your group to go and get your younger brother and bring him here. I will put the rest of you in prison, in order that I may test what you have said to find out whether what you are telling me is true. If the one who goes does not bring your younger brother here, then, just as surely as the king lives, it will be clear that you are lying and that you are spies."
\v 17 Then Joseph put them all in prison for three days.

\v 14 Joseph said to them, "It is what I said to you; you are spies.
\v 15 By this you will be tested. By the life of Pharaoh, you will not leave here, unless your youngest brother comes here.
\v 16 Send one of yourselves and let him get your brother. You will be bound that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you, or else by the life of Pharaoh surely you are spies."
\v 17 He put them all in custody for three days.
