  * **"Did I not tell you, 'Do not sin against the boy,' but you would not listen?** - Reuben uses a question for emphasis. Alternate translation: "I told you not to hurt the boy, but you would not listen!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **his blood is required of us** - "blood" refers to Joseph's death. His brothers thought Joseph was dead. Alternate translation: "Now we are getting what we deserve for his death." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
