===== translationNotes: =====

  * **in that we saw the distress of his soul** - The word "soul" stands for Joseph. AT: "because we saw how distressed Joseph was" or "because we saw that Joseph was suffering" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Therefore this distress has come upon us** - The abstract noun "distress" can be stated as the verb "suffering." AT: "That is why we are suffering like this now" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Did I not tell you, 'Do not sin against the boy,' but you would not listen?** - Reuben uses a question to scold his brothers. AT: "I told you not to hurt the boy, but you would not listen!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Did I not tell you, 'Do not sin against the boy,'** - This has a quotation within a quotation. It can be stated as an indirect quotation. AT: "Did I not tell you not to sin against the boy," or "I told you not to harm the boy," (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotesinquotes]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **Now, see** - Here "Now" does not mean "at this moment," but both "Now" and "see" are used to draw attention to the important point that follows.
  * **his blood is required of us** - Here "blood" stands for Joseph's death. His brothers thought Joseph was dead. The phrase "is required of us" means they must be punished for what they did. AT: "we are getting what we deserve for his death" or "we are suffering for having killed him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
