\v 18 On the third day after that, Joseph went to the prison and said to them, "I am a man who fears that God will punish me if I do not do what I promise. So do what I tell you, and I will spare your lives.
\v 19 If you are honest men, let one of you brothers stay here in prison, and the rest of you can take some grain back to your families who are very hungry because of the famine.
\v 20 But if you come back here again, you must bring your youngest brother to me, so that you can prove that what you told me is true, and as a result I will not have you executed." So they agreed to do that.

\v 18 Joseph said to them on the third day, "Do this and live, for I fear God.
\v 19 If you are honest men, let one of your brothers be confined in this prison, but you go, carry grain for the famine of your houses.
\v 20 Bring your youngest brother to me so your words will be verified and you will not die." So they did so.
