\v 26 The brothers loaded their donkeys with their grain and departed from there.
\v 27 As one of them opened his sack to give his donkey feed in the lodging place, he saw his money. Behold, it was in the opening of his sack.
\v 28 He said to his brothers, "My money has been put back. Look at it; it is in my sack." And their hearts sank and they turned trembling to one another. They said, "What is this that God has done to us?"
