===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Put him under my authority** - AT: "put me in charge of him"
  * **My son will not go down with you** - "My son will not go with you to Egypt." In 42:8 the word "you" is plural and refers to Jacob's older sons. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **For his brother is dead and he alone is left** - The full meaning can be made explicit. AT: "for my wife, Rachel, only had two children. Joseph is dead and Benjamin is the only one left" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **then you will bring down my gray hair with sorrow to sheol** - Here "gray hair" refers to Jacob and emphasizes his old age. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **bring down...to sheol** - This is another way of saying "cause to die." AT: "then you will cause me, an old man, to die of sorrow." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
