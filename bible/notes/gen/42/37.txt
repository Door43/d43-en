\v 37 Reuben spoke to his father, saying, "You may kill my two sons if I do not bring Benjamin back to you. Put him under my authority, and I will bring him to you again."
\v 38 Jacob said, "My son will not go down with you. For his brother is dead and he alone is left. If harm comes to him on the road in which you go, then you will bring down my gray hair with sorrow to sheol."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Put him under my authority** - "Put me in charge of him"
  * **My son will not go down with you** - "My son will not go with you to Egypt." In 42:8 the word "you" is plural and refers to Jacob's older sons. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **For his brother is dead and he alone is left** - The full meaning can be made explicit: "For my wife, Rachel, only had two children. Joseph is dead and Benjamin is the only one left." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **then you will bring down my gray hair with sorrow to Sheol** - Here "gray hair" refers to Jacob and emphasizes his old age. Also, "bring down...to Sheol" is another way of saying "cause to die." Alternate translation: "then you will cause me, an old man, to die of sorrow." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
