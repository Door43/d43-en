===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them**  - "When Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them"
  * **he disguised himself to them**  - "he acted like he was not their brother" or "he did not let them know that he was their brother"
  * **"Where have you come from?"** - This was not a rhetorical question even though Joseph knew the answer. It was part of his choice to keep his identity from his brothers.
