===== translationNotes: =====

  * **These were the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, 175 years** - "Abraham lived 175 years" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **Abraham breathed his last and died** - "Abraham took his last breath and died." The phrases "breathed his last" and "died" mean basically the same thing. AT: "Abraham died" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **breathed his last** - This is a polite way of saying a person died. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **at a good old age, an old man with a full life** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that Abraham lived a very long time. AT: "when he had lived a very long time and was very old" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **an old man with a full life** - Living a long life is spoken of as if life were a container that becomes full. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he was gathered to his people** - This means that after Abraham died, his soul went to the same place as his relatives who died before him. This can be stated in active form. AT: "he joined his family members who had already died" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
