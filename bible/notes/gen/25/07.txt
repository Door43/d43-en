===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **These are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived, 175 years**  - "Abraham lived 175 years" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **Abraham breathed his last and died** - "Abraham took his last breath and died." Alternate translation: "Abraham died"
  * **at a good old age, an old man with a full life** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that Abraham lived a very long time. AT: "when he had lived a very long time and was very old" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **he was gathered to his people**  - This means that after Abraham died, his soul went to the same place as his relatives who died before him. Alternate translation: "he joined his family members who had already died." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
