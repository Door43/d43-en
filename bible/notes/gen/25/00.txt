====== Genesis 25 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended or special quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 25:23, which is a quotation.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Polygamy ==
Abraham married another wife. This was sinful of him. Many other Hebrew leaders came to marry multiple wives. This is known as "polygamy." It has never been an acceptable practice. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])

== Inheritance ==
In the ancient Near East, inheritance was passed on through the eldest son. Even though Esau and Jacob were twins, it is very important that Esau was born first. It was his birthright to receive his inheritance, but he foolishly gave it up. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:inherit]], [[:en:obe:kt:birthright]] and [[:en:obe:kt:foolish]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== God fulfill's his promise ==
God begins to fulfill the promise he gave to Abraham about making his descendants numerous. Many of these children through his concubines would become large people groups. This may not be easy to understand without the remainder of the Old Testament and the history it records. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
