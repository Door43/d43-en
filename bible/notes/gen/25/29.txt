\v 29 One day while Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came home from the field, very hungry.

  * [[:en:obe:other:esau|Esau]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **he was weak** - "he was very tired" or "he was very hungry"
  * **I am starving** - The word "starving" refers to a person who is dying from hunger. Esau is exaggerating to emphasize how hungry he is. This could be translated as "I am so hungry I feel like I could die." (See: [[en:ta:translate:hyperbole]])
  * **Edom** - Translators may also add a footnote that says "The name Edom means 'red.'"
