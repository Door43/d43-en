<usfm>
\v 29 One day while Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came home from the field, very hungry.
\v 30 He said to Jacob, "Give me some of that red stew to eat right now, because I am very hungry!" (That is why Esau's other name was Edom, which sounds like the Hebrew word that means 'red.')

  * **he was weak from hunger** - "he was weak because he was very hungry" or "he was very hungry"
  * **I am exhausted** - "I am weak from hunger" or "I am very hungry"
  * **Edom** - Translators may add a footnote that says "The name Edom means 'red.'"
