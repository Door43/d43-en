\v 31 Jacob said, "First sell me your birthright."

\v 33 Jacob said, "First swear to me," so Esau swore an oath and in that way he sold his birthright to Jacob.
\v 34 Jacob gave Esau bread and stew of lentils. He ate and drank, then got up and went on his way. In this manner Esau despised his birthright.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **birthright**  - "right as firstborn to inherit most of our father's wealth" (UDB)
    * **I am about to die** - Esau is exaggerating to emphasize how hungry he is. This could be translated as "I am so hungry I feel like I could die." (See: [[en:ta:translate:hyperbole]])
    * **What good is the birthright to me?** - Esau uses a question to emphasize that eating was more important than a birthright. This could be translated as a statement: "My inheritance is no good to me if I die of hunger!" (See: [[en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion]])
    * **lentils**  - This is like a bean. (See: [[en:ta:translate:translateunknowns]])
