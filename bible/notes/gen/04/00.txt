**Special concepts in this chapter**

== Vengeance ==

The theme of vengeance is important in this chapter. Ancient Hebrew society allowed for people to seek revenge if a relative was murdered. After Cain murdered Abel, his brother, he thought that he would be helpless against this danger because he had been driven away from God's protection.

The theme of vengeance continues with the words of Lamech, who had killed someone for injuring him:\\

"I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for bruising me.\\
If Cain is avenged seven times as much, truly Lamech will be avenged seventy-seven times as much." (Gen. 4:23b-24)
