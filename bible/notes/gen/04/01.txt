===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The man**  - This can also be translated here as "the human being" or "Adam" (UDB).
  * **slept with** - "had sex with." Your language may have a way of saying this politely. Some older versions say "knew." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism|Euphemism]]).
  * **I have produced a man**  - The word for "man" typically describes an adult male, rather than a baby or child. If that would cause confusion, it could be translated as "manchild" or "boy" or "baby boy" or "son."
  * **Cain**  - Translators may want to include a footnote that says "The name Cain sounds like the Hebrew word that means 'produce.' Eve named him Cain because she produced him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Explicit and Implicit]])
  * **Then she gave birth**  - We do not know how much time passed between the births of Cain and Abel. They may have been twins, or Abel may have been born after Eve became pregnant again. If possible, use an expression that does not tell how much time passed.
