===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Why are you angry and why are you scowling … **  - God used these rhetorical questions to tell Cain that he was wrong to be angry and scowl. They may also have been intended to give Cain an opportunity to confess that he was wrong. (See: [[en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **will you not be accepted**  - God used this rhetorical question to remind Cain of something Cain should have already known. It can also be translated as "You know that if you do what is right, I will accept you."
  * **sin crouches at the door**  - This is can be translated as "sin is already waiting for you outside your door." Here sin is spoken of as a wild animal that is waiting for the chance to attack Cain. This shows how dangerous sin is. It can also be translated as a simile as it is in the UDB. (See: [[en:ta:translate:personification|Personification]] and [[en:ta:translate:simile|Simile]])
  * **sin**  - Languages that do not have a noun that means "sin" could translate this as "your desire to sin" or "the bad things you want to do."
  * **and desires to control you**  - The personification of sin is continued.
  * **you must rule over it**  - "you must control sin." Sin is still personified here.
  * If a language cannot use personification to talk about sin, this sentence can also be translated as "But if you do not do what is right, your sinful thoughts are very dangerous, and they will lead you to do sinful things, but you must refuse to do them."
