===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Cain spoke to Abel his brother**  - Some languages will need to add the implicit information that Cain spoke to his brother about going to the fields. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Explicit and Implicit]])
  * **brother**  - Abel was Cain's younger brother. Some languages would need to use the word for "younger brother." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Explicit and Implicit]])
  * **Where is Abel your brother **- God knew that Cain had killed his brother, but he asked Cain this question so that Cain would have to answer.
  * **Am I my brother's keeper?**  - Cain used this rhetorical question in order to avoid telling the truth. He was implying that God should know that Cain was not his brother's keeper. AT: "Is it my responsibility to watch my brother?" or "I don't have to take care of my brother." (See [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
