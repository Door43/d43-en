===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Cain spoke to Abel his brother** - Some languages will need to add the implicit information that Cain spoke to his brother about going to the fields. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **brother** - Abel was Cain's younger brother. Some languages may need to use the word for "younger brother." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **rose up against** - Standing up to fight against a person is an idiom for attacking him. AT: "attacked" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Where is Abel your brother** - God knew that Cain had killed Abel, but he asked Cain this question so that Cain would have to answer. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Am I my brother's keeper?** - Cain used this rhetorical question so that he would not have to tell the truth. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "I am not my brother's keeper!" or "Taking care of my brother is not my job!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
