  * **Adah and Zillah, listen to my voice; you wives of Lamech, listen to what I say** - Lamech said basically the same thing twice to show how important it was that his wives listen to what he was about to say. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Adah and Zillah** - These are the names of women. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **what I say**  - This could be translated "my word" or "my speaking."
  * **a man for wounding me, a young man for bruising me**  - This is a doublet. It refers to only one person.

  * **If Cain is avenged seven times as much** - This can be translated with an active verb. "If God avenges Cain seven times as much as he punished him" or "Anyone who kills Cain will be punished seven times as much as Cain was punished." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
