===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **listen to my voice…listen to what I say**  - This is a doublet. Lamech said basically the same thing twice to show how important it was that they listen to what he was about to say. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet|Doublet]])
  * **what I say**  - This could be translated "my word" or "my speaking."
  * **a man for wounding me, a young man for bruising me**  - This is a doublet. It refers to only one person.
  * **for wounding me**  - "because he wounded me" or "because he hurt me"
  * **If Cain is avenged seven times as much** - This can be translated with an active verb. "If God avenges Cain seven times as much as he punished him" or "Anyone who kills Cain will be punished seven times as much as Cain was punished." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **truly Lamech will be avenged seventy-seven times as much** - "truly I will be avenged seventy-seven times as much" or "truly whoever kills me will be punished seventy-seven times as much."
