\v 23 One day Lamech said to his two wives, "Adah and Zillah, my two wives, listen carefully to what I am saying. A young man struck me and wounded me, so I killed him.
\v 24 Yahweh said long ago that he would avenge and punish anyone who killed Cain seven times as much as he punished Cain. So if anyone tries to kill me, I will punish him seventy-seven times as much."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Adah ... Zillah** - Translate these names as in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:04:18|4:19]].
  * **listen to my voice ... listen to what I say** - Lamech said basically the same thing twice to show how important it was that his wives listen to him. His voice is a metonym for him. AT: "Listen carefully to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **a man ... a young man** - Lamech killed only one person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **for wounding me ... for bruising me** - "because he wounded me ... because he bruised me" or "because he hurt me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech** - Lamech knows that God will avenge Cain seven times. AT: "God avenges Cain seven times, so Lamech" or "Since God will punish anyone who kills Cain seven times, Lamech" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **then Lamech will be avenged seventy-seven times** - Lamech speaks of himself as if he were someone else to show that he thinks of himself as very important. "then I, the great Lamech, will be avenged seventy-seven times." This can be made active. AT: "God will punish whoever kills me, the great Lamech, seventy-seven times" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **seventy-seven** - 77
