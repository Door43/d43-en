\v 10 Yahweh said, "You have done a terrible deed! So now it is as though your younger brother's voice is calling to me from the ground where you made his blood flow. It is as though he is demanding that I avenge his death.
\v 11 You have killed your younger brother, and, now that the ground has soaked up your younger brother's blood, you are not welcome on it and your efforts to produce crops on it will fail.
\v 12 When you till the ground to plant crops, the ground will produce very little for you. You will continually wander around the earth, and not have any place to live permanently."

\v 10 Yahweh said, "What have you done? Your brother’s blood is calling out to me from the ground.
\v 11 Now cursed are you from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.
\v 12 When you work the ground, from now on it will not yield to you its strength. A fugitive and a wanderer you will be in the earth."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **What have you done?**  - God used this rhetorical question to rebuke Cain. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **Your brother's blood is calling out to me**  - This personification can be translated as a simile. The implicit information is what the voice was calling out for. "Your brother's blood is like a person who is calling out to me to punish the person who killed him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification|Personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Explicit and Implicit]])
  * **which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood**  - This is figurative language that says that the blood soaked into the ground. It can be translated as "which is soaked with your brother's blood."
  * **from your hand**  - This can also be translated as "that spilled when you killed him." Cain caused his brother's blood to flow onto the ground.
  * **it will not yield to you its strength**  - This is a figure of speech that means "the ground will not produce much food for you."
  * **A fugitive and a wanderer**  - These words could be joined together and translated as "a homeless wanderer," which means "a person who roams around because he does not have a home."
