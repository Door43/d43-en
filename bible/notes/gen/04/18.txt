===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **To Enoch was born Irad**  - This can be translated as "Enoch had a son and named him Irad" or "Enoch became the father of Irad." Verse 17 told about Enoch being born. Verse 18 tells about Enoch having a son. The implied information is that Enoch grew up and married a woman. This can be made explicit as it is in the UDB. (See: [[en:ta:discourse:implicitexplicit]])
  * **Irad became the father of Mehujael** - This can be translated as "Irad had a son and named him Mehujael."
