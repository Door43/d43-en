\v 13 Cain said to Yahweh, "My punishment is greater than I can bear.
\v 14 Indeed, you have driven me out this day from this ground, and I will be hidden from your face. I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me."
\v 15 Yahweh said to him, "If anyone kills Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold." Then Yahweh put a mark on Cain, so that if anyone found him, that person would not attack him.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I will be hidden from your face**  - "I will not be able to come before your face" or "I will not be able to go to you." Cain thought that if he moved to a different place, he would not be able to worship God. It does not mean that God would not be able to see Cain.
  * **a fugitive and a wanderer**  - These words could be joined together and translated as “a homeless wanderer,” which means "a person who roams because he does not have a home."
  * **vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold**  - This can be translated with an active verb. "I will take vengeance on him seven times" or "I will punish that person seven times as severely as I am punishing you." (UDB) (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **would not strike him**  - "would not kill Cain"
