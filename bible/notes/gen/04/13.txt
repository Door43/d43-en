\v 13 Cain said to Yahweh, "My punishment is greater than I can bear.
\v 14 Indeed, you have driven me out this day from the face of the ground, and I will be hidden from your face as well. I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me."
\v 15 Yahweh said to him, "If anyone kills Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold." Then Yahweh put a mark on Cain, so that if anyone found  him, that person would not strike him.
