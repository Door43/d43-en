\v 14 You are about to expel me from the ground that I \add have been tilling\add*, and I will no longer be able to come into your presence\f + \ft Or: and talk with you \f*. Furthermore, I will be continually wandering around the earth with no place to live permanently, and anyone who sees me will kill me."

\v 13 Cain said to Yahweh, "My punishment is greater than I can bear.
\v 14 Indeed, you have driven me out this day from this ground, and I will be hidden from your face. I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me."
\v 15 Yahweh said to him, "If anyone kills Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold." Then Yahweh put a mark on Cain, so that if anyone found him, that person would not attack him.
