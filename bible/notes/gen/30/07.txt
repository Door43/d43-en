===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Bilhah...conceived again**  - "Bilhah...became pregnant again"
  * **and bore Jacob a second son**  - "and gave birth to a second son for Jacob"
  * **With mighty wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister**  - The phrase "wrestlings have I wrestled" is an idiom used for emphasis. It is also a metaphor that compares a physical fight with Rachel's attempts to have a child like her sister has. It could be translated as "I have had a great struggle to have children like my older sister, Leah." (UDB) (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **and have prevailed** - "and I have won" or "I have succeeded"
  * **called his name Naphtali**  - Translators may also add a footnote that says "The name Naphtali means 'my struggle.'"
