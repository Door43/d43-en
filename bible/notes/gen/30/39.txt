====== Genesis 30:39-40 ======

\v 39 The animals also mated in front of the branches, and eventually they gave birth to animals that were speckled, or to animals that were spotted, or to animals that had black and white stripes on them.
\v 40 Furthermore, Jacob separated the female sheep in his flock from the other sheep and goats in Laban's flock. And when his female sheep mated, he made them look toward the animals that belonged to Laban that had black and white stripes on them, and the dark-colored animals. He did that so that the female sheep would give birth to animals that were striped or dark-colored. By doing that, he made bigger flocks for himself, and he kept them separate from Laban's flocks.

\v 39 The animals also mated in front of the branches, and later they gave birth to animals that were speckled, or to animals that were spotted, or to animals that had black and white stripes on them.
\v 40 During the several years following, Jacob often separated the female sheep in Laban's flock from the other sheep and goats. When they mated, he made them look toward the animals that had black and white stripes, and toward the dark-colored animals. So they gave birth to animals with similar markings. Then he would separate these animals from Laban's flocks and keep them for his own.

\v 39 The flocks conceived in front of the sticks, and the flocks produced striped, speckled, and spotted young.
\v 40 Jacob separated the female sheep and directed their faces toward the striped animals and all the black sheep in the flock of Laban.  Then he separated his flocks and did not mix them any longer with Laban's flocks.
