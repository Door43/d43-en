<usfm>
\v 41 In addition, whenever the stronger female sheep were ready to mate, Jacob put some of those peeled branches in the troughs in front of them, so that they would mate in front of the branches.
\v 42 But when weak animals were ready to mate, he did not put the branches in their troughs. So the weak ones became part of Laban's flock, and the strong ones became part of Jacob's flock.

\v 41 Whenever the stronger sheep in the flock were breeding, then Jacob would lay the sticks in the watering troughs before the eyes of the flock, so that they might conceive among the sticks.
\v 42 But when the feebler animals in the flock came, he did not put the sticks in front of them. So the feebler animals were Laban's, and the stronger were Jacob's.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **before the eyes of the flock** - Here the flocks' "eyes" represent the sheep and emphasize what they see. AT: "so that the flock could see them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **among the sticks** - "in front of the sticks"
  * **the feebler animals** - "the weaker animals"
  * **So the feebler animals were Laban's, and the stronger were Jacob's** - "So the weaker offspring belonged to Laban, while the stronger offspring belonged to Jacob." You can make this even more explicit. AT: "So the weaker offspring did not have stripes or spots and so belonged to Laban, while the stronger offspring did have stripes or spots and so belonged to Jacob" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
