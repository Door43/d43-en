===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Jacob said to him** - "Jacob said to Laban"
  * **how your livestock have fared with me** - "how well your livestock have done since I started taking care of them"
  * **For you had little before I came** - "your herds were small before I worked for you"
  * **and it has increased abundantly** - "but now your wealth has greatly increased"
  * **Now when will I provide for my own household also?** - "Now when will I take care of my own family?" Jacob uses a question to emphasize that he wants to start providing for his own family. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "Now I want to take care of my family!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
