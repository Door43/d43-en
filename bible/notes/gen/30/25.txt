  * **After Rachel had borne Joseph** - "After Rachel gave birth to Joseph"
  * **and let me go** - "so I can go"
  * **you know the service I have given you** - Jacob is reminding Laban of their contract ([[:en:bible:notes:gen:29:26|Gen 29:27]]). The abstract noun "service" can be stated as "served." AT: "you know that I have served you long enough" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
