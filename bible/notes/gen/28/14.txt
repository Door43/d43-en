===== Translation Notes: =====
God continues to talk to Jacob in a dream.

  * **Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth** - God compares Jacob's descendants to the dust of the earth to emphasize their huge number. Alternate translation: "You will have more descendants than you can count." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **and you will spread far out to the west** - Here the word "you" is singular but refers to Jacob's descendants. It only speaks of Jacob since he is the leader of the family. Alternate translation: "and your descendants will spread out to the west." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **In you and in your descendants will all the families of the earth be blessed** - This can be translated with an active verb: "I will bless all families on the earth through you and your descendants." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Behold** - This can be translated as "Look" or "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you."
  * **for I will not leave you. I will do all...** - "for I will not leave you until I have done all..."
  * **I will keep you** - "I will keep you safe" or "I will protect you"
  * **I will bring you into this land again** - "I will bring you back to this land"
