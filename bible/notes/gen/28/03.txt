AT: "May God bless you and your descendants as he blessed Abraham" or "May God give to you and your descendants what he promised to Abraham" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **that you may inherit the land** - God giving the land of Canaan to Jacob and his descendants is spoken of as if a child were inheriting money or possessions from his father. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
