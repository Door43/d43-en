  * **As for you**  - God used this phrase to introduce what Abram would have to do as part of God's covenant with him.
  * **keep my covenant**  - "observe my covenant" or "honor my covenant" or "obey my covenant"
  * **This is my covenant**  - "This is a requirement of my covenant" or "This is part of my covenant." This sentence introduces the part of the covenant that Abram must do.
  * **Every male among you must be circumcised**  - If needed, this can be translated as "You must circumcise every male among you." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **Every male**  - This refers to human males.
  * **You must be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin**  - Some communities may prefer a less descriptive expression such as "you must be circumcised." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **the sign of the covenant**  - "the sign marking the covenant" or "the sign that shows the covenant exists"
  * **the sign** - Possible meanings are 1) “the sign” or 2) “a sign.” The first means that there was one sign, and the second means that there may have been more than one sign.
