\v 19 Then God replied, "\add No\add*! Your wife Sarah will bear a son for you. You must name him Isaac. I will establish my agreement with him, one which will be an everlasting covenant for him and his descendants.
\v 20 As for Ishmael, I have heard what you asked me to do for him. I will bless him so that he also will have many descendants. Among his descendants will be rulers of twelve nations. And I will cause his descendants \f + \ft metonymy \f* to become a great nation.

\v 19 Then God replied, "No! Your wife Sarah will soon bear a son for you. You must name him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him, one which will be an everlasting covenant with him and his descendants.
\v 20 As for Ishmael, I have heard what you asked me to do for him. I will bless him so that he also will have many descendants. Among his descendants will be the leaders of twelve tribes. And I will cause his descendants  to become a great nation.
\v 21 But it is with Isaac that I will establish my covenant—Isaac,  the son whom Sarah will give birth to at this time next year."

\v 19 God said, "Truly Sarah your wife is about to bear you a son, and you must name him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant with his descendants after him.
\v 20 As for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I hereby bless him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him abundantly. He will be the father of twelve leaders of tribes, and I will make him become a great nation.
\v 21 But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this time in the next year."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Truly Sarah...will bear**  - This is intended to contrast Abraham's wrong belief that the covenant would be with Ishmael with God's promise that the covenant would come through Isaac.
  * **you must name him**- The word "you" refers to Abraham. 
  * **leaders of tribes**  - "chiefs" or "rulers"
  * **Behold**  - The word "behold" here draws attention to the action that comes next.
  * **but my covenant…**  - The phrase "my covenant" is placed at the beginning of the sentence to draw attention to it. If your language uses word order to draw attention to phrases, you should do that here (see [[:en:ta:vocabulary:wordorder|Word Order]]).
