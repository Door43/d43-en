\v 19 God said, "No, but Sarah your wife will bear you a son, and you must name him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant with his descendants after him.
\v 20 As for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I hereby bless him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him abundantly. He will be the father of twelve leaders of tribes, and I will make him become a great nation.
\v 21 But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this time in the next year."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **No, but Sarah your wife will bear**  - God said this to correct Abraham's belief that Sarah could not have a son.
  * **you must name him**  - The word "you" refers to Abraham.
  * **As for Ishmael**  - The words "As for" show that God is switching from talking about the baby that would be born to talking about Ishmael.
  * **leaders of tribes**  - "chiefs" or "rulers"
  * **Behold**  - This can be translated as “Look” or “Listen” or “Pay attention to what I am about to tell you."
  * **I will make him fruitful**  - This is figurative language that means "I will cause him to have many children."
  * **and will multiply him abundantly**  - "and I will cause him to have many descendants"
  * **But my covenant I will establish with Isaac**  - God returned to talking about his covenant and emphasized that it would be with Isaac, not with Ishmael.
