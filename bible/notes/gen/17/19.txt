\v 19 Then God replied, "\add No\add*! Your wife Sarah will bear a son for you. You must name him Isaac. I will establish my agreement with him, one which will be an everlasting covenant for him and his descendants.

\v 19 God said, "No, but Sarah your wife will bear you a son, and you must name him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant with his descendants after him.
\v 20 As for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I hereby bless him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him abundantly. He will be the father of twelve leaders of tribes, and I will make him become a great nation.
\v 21 But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this time in the next year."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **No, but Sarah your wife will bear** - God said this to correct Abraham's belief that Sarah could not have a son.
  * **you must name him** - The word "you" refers to Abraham.
  * **As for Ishmael** - The words "As for" show that God is switching from talking about the baby that would be born to talking about Ishmael.
  * **Behold** - "Look" or "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you"
  * **will make him fruitful** - This is an idiom that means "will cause him to have many children." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **will multiply him abundantly** - "I will cause him to have many descendants"
  * **leaders of tribes** - "chiefs" or "rulers." These leaders are not the twelve sons and grandsons of Jacob that will lead the twelve tribes of Israel.
  * **But my covenant I will establish with Isaac** - God returns to talking about his covenant with Abraham and emphasizes that he would fulfill his promise with Isaac, not with Ishmael.
