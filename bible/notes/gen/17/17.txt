===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **bowed low with his face to the ground**  - alternately "fell on his face"
  * **And said in his heart**  - This can also be translated as "and thought to himself" or "and said to himself silently."
  * **Can a man who is a hundred years old father a child?** - Abraham used this rhetorical question because he did not believe that this could happen. It could also be translated as a statement: "Surely a man who is a hundred years old could not father a child." (See:  [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:rhetoricalquestion]]). 
  * **Can Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a son?**  - Again Abraham used a rhetorical question because he did not believe this could happen. The relative clause "who is ninety years old" could be expressed as a separate sentence: "Sarah is ninety years old. Could she bear a son?" or "Sarah is ninety years old. Surely she could not bear a son." (See the section on clauses in [[en:ta:vocabulary:sentencestructure]])
  * **Oh that Ishmael might live before you**  - This means "I wish that Ishmael could be my heir and live under your protection."
