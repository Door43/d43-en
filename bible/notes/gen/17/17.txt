===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **said in his heart**  - This can also be translated as "thought to himself" or "said to himself silently."
  * **Can a man who is a hundred years old father a child?**  - Abraham used this rhetorical question because he did not believe that this could happen. It could also be translated as a statement: "Surely a man who is a hundred years old could not father a child." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]]).
  * **Can Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a son?**  - Again Abraham used a rhetorical question because he did not believe this could happen. The relative clause "who is ninety years old" could be expressed as a separate sentence: "Sarah is ninety years old. Could she bear a son?" or "Sarah is ninety years old. Surely she could not bear a son." (See the section on clauses in [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_sentences|Sentences]])
  * **Oh that Ishmael might live before you**  - Abraham suggested something that he believed really could happen. It can also be translated as "Please let Ishmael inherit the covenant that you have made with me" or "Perhaps Ishmael could receive your covenant blessing."
