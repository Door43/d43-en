  * **As for me** - God used this phrase to introduce what he would do for Abram as part of his covenant with Abram.
  * **behold, my covenant is with you** - The word "behold" here says that what comes next is certain: "my covenant is certainly with you."
  * **the father of a multitude of nations** - "the father of a great number of nations" or "the one after whom many nations name themselves"
