\v 9 Hurry and go up to my father and say to him, 'This is what your son Joseph says, God has made me master of all Egypt. Come down to me, do not delay.
\v 10 You will live in the land of Goshen, and you will be near me, you and your children and your childrenâ€™s children, and your flocks and your herds, and all that you have.
\v 11 I will provide for you there, for there are still five years of famine, so that you do not come to poverty, you, your household, and all that you have.'
