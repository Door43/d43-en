  * **wept over them** - This means Joseph was crying while he kissed them.
  * **After that his brothers talked with him** - Earlier they were too afraid to speak. Now they feel they can speak freely. AT: "After that his brothers talked freely with him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
