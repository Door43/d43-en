\v 4 Then Joseph said to his brothers, "Come close to me!" When they came closer, he said, "I am your brother Joseph! I am the one you sold to traders who brought me here to Egypt!
\v 5 But now, do not be distressed, and do not be angry with yourselves for having sold me to people who brought me here, because it was to save you from dying because of the famine that God sent me here ahead of you.
\v 6 There has been a famine in this country for two years, and it will continue for five more years, so that no one will plow ground, and there will be no crops to harvest.

\v 4 Then Joseph said to his brothers, "Come near to me, please." They came near. He said, "I am Joseph your brother, whom you sold into Egypt.

\v 6 For these two years the famine has been in the land, and there are still five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest.
