===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the whole plain of the Jordan**  - This refers to the general region of the Jordan River.
  * **was well watered**  - "had supplies of clean water"
  * **like the garden of Yahweh, like the land of Egypt**  - "like the garden of Yahweh or like the land of Egypt". These were two different places.
  * **garden**  - Use the same word for "garden" as you used in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:02:07|2:8]].
  * **This was before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah**  - This anticipates something that would happen later and is told about in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:19:23|19:24-25]]. It is important here because it explains why Lot settled in a region that was later not fertile.
  * **the relatives**  - "the kinsmen" or "the families." This refers to Lot and Abram with their households.
