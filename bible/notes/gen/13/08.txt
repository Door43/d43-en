\v 8  So Abram said to Lot, "Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen; after all, we are family.
\v 9 Is not the whole land before you? Go ahead and separate yourself from me. If you go to the left, then I will go to the right. Or if you go to the right, then I will go to the left."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **strife**  - "hostility" or "fighting" or "quarreling"
  * **Let there be no strife between you and me** - This can be translated as "Let's not quarrel."
  *  **and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen** - This can be translated as "and let's stop the men who take care of our animals from quarreling."
  * **after all, we are family**  - "because we are family"
  * **family**  - "kinsmen" or "relatives." Lot was Abraham's nephew.
  * **Is not the whole land before you?**  - Abraham used this rhetorical question to remind Lot about something he would have already known. It can also be translated: "The whole land is available for you to use" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]).
  * **Go ahead and separate yourself**  - Abraham was speaking kindly to Lot and encouraging him to do something that would help them both. It can also be translated as "Let's separate."
  * **If you go to the left, then I will go to the right** - Possible meanings are 1) "If you go one way, then I will go the other" or 2) "If you go to the north, I will go to the south." Abraham let Lot choose the part of the land he wanted, and Abraham would take what was left.
