====== Genesis 36:6-8 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6-7 Jacob and Esau had very many possessions. The result was that they needed more land for their livestock. The land where they were living was not big enough for both of them. They had too much livestock. So Esau, whose other name was Edom, had taken his wives and sons and daughters and all the other members of his household, his sheep and goats and his other animals, and all the other things he had obtained in Canaan land, and they had moved to an area that was away from Jacob.
\v 8 They went to live in the Seir hilly area.

\v 6 Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the members of his household, his livestockâ€”all his animals, and all his possessions, which he had gathered in the land of Canaan, and went into a land away from his brother Jacob.
\v 7 He did this because their possessions were too many for them to stay together. The land where they had settled could not support them because of their livestock.
\v 8 So Esau, also known as Edom, settled in the hill country of Seir.
