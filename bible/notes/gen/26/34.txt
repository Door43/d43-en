===== Translation Notes: =====

Most of Genesis 26 was about Isaac. These verses are about his older son Esau.

  * **forty** - "40" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **he took a wife**  - This can be translated as "he married" or "he took two wives."
  * **Judith...Basemath** - These are names of Esau's wives. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Beeri...Elon** - These are names of men.
  * **the Hittite**  - "the descendant of Heth" or "a descendant of Heth"
  * **they brought sorrow to Isaac and Rebekah** - Here the word "they" refers to Judith and Basemath. Alternate translation: "Isaac and Rebekah were miserable because of them."
