\v 32 That day Isaac's servants came to him and told him about the well that they had finished digging. They said, "We found water in the well!"
\v 33 Isaac named the well Shibah, which sounds like the Hebrew word that means 'oath.' To the present time the town there has the name Beersheba which means 'peace treaty well.'
