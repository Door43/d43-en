===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to Isaac.

  * **I will multiply your descendants** - "I will cause you to have very many descendants."
  * **like the stars of heaven** - This speaks about the number of Isaac's descendants as if they were the same as the number of stars. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:22:15|22:17]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **heaven** - This refers to everything we see above the earth, including the sun, moon, and stars.
  * **all the nations of the earth will be blessed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "I will bless all the nations of the earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my instructions, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws** - The phrases "obeyed my voice" and "kept my instructions, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws" mean basically the same thing. AT: "Abraham obeyed me and did everything I commanded him to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **obeyed my voice** - Here "voice" stands for Yahweh. AT: "obeyed me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
