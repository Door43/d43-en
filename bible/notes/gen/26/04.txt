Yahweh continues speaking to Isaac

  * **I will multiply your descendants** - “I will cause your descendants to be very many” or “I will cause you to have very many descendants”
  * **like the stars of heaven** - This compares Isaac's descendants with the stars to emphasize that he would have very many descendants. See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:gen:22:15|22:17]]. (See: [[en:ta:translate:simile]])
  * **all the nations of the earth will be blessed** - This can be translated with an active verb: "I will bless all the nations of the earth." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **obeyed my voice** - "obeyed what I said" or "obeyed me" (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
