\v 9 Abimelech called Isaac to him and said, "Look, certainly she is your wife. Why did you say, 'She is my sister?' Isaac said to him, "Because I thought someone might kill me to get her."
\v 10 Abimelech said, "What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have had sexual relations  with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us."
\v 11 So Abimelech warned all the people and said, "Whoever touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death."
