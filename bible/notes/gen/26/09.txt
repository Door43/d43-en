\v 9 So Abimelech summoned Isaac and said to him, "Now I realize that she is really your wife! So why did you say, 'She is my sister'?" Isaac replied to him, "I said that because I thought that someone here might kill me to get her."
\v 10 Abimelech said, "You should not have done this to us!\f + \ft Or: Why did you do this? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* One of our people might have had sex with\f + \ft Or: slept with \f* \f + \ft euphemism \f* your wife, and you would have caused us to be guilty of a great sin!"

\v 9 Abimelech called Isaac to him and said, "Look, certainly she is your wife. Why did you say, 'She is my sister'?" Isaac said to him, "Because I thought someone might kill me to get her."
\v 10 Abimelech said, "What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have had sexual relations  with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us."
\v 11 So Abimelech warned all the people and said, "Whoever touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Abimelech called Isaac to him**  - "Abimilech sent for Isaac." Abimelech probably sent someone to tell Isaac to go to him.
  * **to get her**  - "so he could take her"
  * **"What is this you have done to us?**  - Abimelech used this question to scold Isaac. Alternate translation: "You should not have done this to us!" (UDB) (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Whoever touches this man**  - Here "touches" means to touch in a harmful way. Alternate translation: "Whoever harms this man." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **will surely be put to death**  - This can be translated with an active clause: "I will put him to death." Abimelech may have intended to tell someone to kill anyone who might harm Isaac or Rebekah. Alternate translation: "I will have him killed" or "I will have him executed." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
