<usfm>
\v 21 Then Isaac's servants dug another well, but they quarreled about who owned that one also. So Isaac named it Sitnah, which means 'opposition.'
\v 22 They moved on from there and dug another well, but this time no one quarreled about who owned it. So he named it Rehoboth, which means 'empty place,' saying, "Yahweh has given us an empty place to live in, a place that is not wanted by other people, and we will become very prosperous here."

\v 21 Then they dug another well, and they quarreled over that, too, so he gave it the name of "Sitnah."
\v 22 He left there and dug yet another well, but they did not quarrel over that one. So he called it Rehoboth, and he said, "Now Yahweh has made room for us, and we will prosper in the land."
