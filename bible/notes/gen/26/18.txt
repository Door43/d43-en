\v 18 Once again Isaac dug out the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father. The Philistines had stopped them up after Abraham's death. Isaac called the wells by the same names that his father had called them.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **which they had dug** - "which had been dug" (UDB) or "which Abraham's servants had dug."
    * **in the days of Abraham his father** - See how this was translated in [[en:bible:notes:gen:26:15|26:15]].
    * **The Philistines had stopped them up after Abraham's death** - This was the reason that Isaac dug them out. Since this happened first, this sentence can come before the sentence about Isaac digging them out, as in the UDB. Or this sentence can start with "Isaac did this because."
    * **had stopped them up** - "had filled them with earth"
