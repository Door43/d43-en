===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Assemble yourselves and listen, you sons of Jacob. Listen to Israel, your father** - Both sentences say the same thing for emphasis. AT: "Come and listen carefully to your father" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **you sons of Jacob. Listen to Israel, your father** - Jacob is referring to himself in the third person. It can be stated in the first person. AT: "my sons. Listen to me, your father" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
