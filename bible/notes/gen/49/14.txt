===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **Issachar is a strong donkey** - Often in prophecy events that will happen in the future are described as something that has already happened. This emphasizes that the event will certainly happen. Here "Issachar" refers to his descendants. They are compared to a donkey. This emphasizes that they will work very hard. Alternate translation: "The descendants of Issachar will be like a strong donkey." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **lying down between the sheepfolds** - Possible meanings are 1) "lying down between the packs they were carrying" or 2) "lying down between two sheep pens."
  * **He sees a good resting place and the pleasant land** - "They will see a resting place that is good and that the land is pleasant"
  * **He will bend his shoulder to the burden** - "They will work very hard to carry the load"
  * **and became a servant for the task** - "and they will work for others as slaves"
