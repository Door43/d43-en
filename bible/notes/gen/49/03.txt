\v 3 Reuben, you are my oldest son.
You were born when I was young and energetic.
When I became a grown man, you were my first child. You are prouder and stronger than all the rest of my sons.
\v 4 But you were as unstable as ocean waves.
So now you will not be my most important son,
because you climbed up onto my bed and slept with my concubine. That caused me, your father, to have great shame.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the beginning of my strength**  - Hebrew parents would dedicate their first child to God. The words "beginning" and "first-fruit" means that Reuben belonged to God in a special way. Alternate translation: "the first-fruit of my manhood."
  * **outstanding in dignity, and outstanding in power** - "You are first in honor and power."
  * **Uncontrollable as rushing water** - Jacob compares Reuben to water in a strong current to emphasize that he cannot control his anger and he is not stable. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **you will not have the preeminence** - "you shall not be first among your brothers"
  * **because you went up to your father's bed. Then you defiled it; you went up to my couch.** - This refers to when Reuben slept with Bilhah in [[en:bible:notes:gen:35:21|35:22]]. This can be made explicit: "because you went to my bed and slept with Bilhah my concubine. You brought shame on me." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
