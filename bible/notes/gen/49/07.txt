===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **May their anger be cursed** - In prophecy, the prophet will often speak the words of God as if God himself were speaking. This emphasizes how closely united the prophet and God are. Alternate translation: "The Lord says, "I will curse them because of their anger" or "I, the Lord, will curse them because of their anger."
  * **I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel** - The word "I" refers to God. The word "them" refers to Simeon and Levi but it is a prophecy about their descendants. The words "Jacob" and "Israel" refer to all people of Israel. Alternate translation: "I will divide their descendants and scatter them among all the people of Israel."
