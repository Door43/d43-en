===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Gad...Asher's...Naphtali** - These refer to the descendants of each man. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Naphtali is a doe let loose** - This compares the descendants of Naphtali to a female deer that is free to run. This may emphasize that they were swift messengers. Alternate translation: "The descendants of Naphtali will be like deer set free" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **beautiful fawns** - A "fawn" is a baby deer. The meaning of the Hebrew word is unclear. Some versions translate it as "beautiful words."
