===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Judah is a lion's cub** - Jacob compares Judah to a young lion to emphasize his strength. Alternate translation: "Judah is like a young lion" (UDB) (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **My son, you have gone up from your victims** - "You, my son, have come back from eating your prey"
    * **like a lioness** - Jacob also compares Judah to a female lion. The lioness is the primary hunter and protector of her cubs. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
    * **Who would dare to awaken him?** - Jacob uses a question to emphasize how terrifying Judah is to other people. Alternate translation: "No one wants to wake him up." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
