===== Translation Notes: =====
Jacob continues to bless Joseph and his descendants.

  * **They will be on the head of Joseph, blessings that crown the head of him** - "They" refers to the blessings of his father. Jacob compares the blessing he gives Joseph to a crown that a prince wears. This emphasizes that these blessings are a sign of Joseph's honor and that he has authority over his brothers. Alternate translation: "These blessings will be like a crown on Joseph's head." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **prince over his brothers **- "set apart from his brothers"
