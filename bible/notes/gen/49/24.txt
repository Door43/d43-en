\v 24 But they will hold their bows steady and their arms will remain strong,
because of the power of my mighty God,
because of Yahweh, who guides and provides for me, 
as a shepherd guides and provides for his sheep.
The people of Israel will ask Yahweh to protect them,
as people take refuge on top of a high rock.
