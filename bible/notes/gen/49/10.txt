===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet** - The "scepter" and the "staff" are long decorated sticks that kings carried. Here they are metonymies that stand for the power to rule. And, "Judah" stands his descendants. AT: "The power to rule will always be with the descendants of Judah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **until Shiloh comes. The nations will obey him** - Possible meanings are 1) "Shiloh" means "tribute." AT: "until the nations obey him and bring him tribute" or 2) "Shiloh" refers to the city of Shiloh. AT: "until the ruler comes to Shiloh. Then the nations will obey him." Many people consider this a prophecy about the Messiah who is a descendant of King David. David is a descendant of Judah.
  * **The nations will obey him** - Here "nations" refer to the people. AT: "The people of the nations will obey him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
