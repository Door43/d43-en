===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet** - The "scepter" and the "staff" are long decorated sticks that kings carried. Here they refer to the power to rule. And, "Judah" refer to his descendants. Alternate translation: "The power to rule will always be with the descendants of Judah" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **until Shiloh comes. The nations will obey him** - Possible meanings are 1) "until the ruler comes to Shiloh. Then the nations will obey him" or 2) "until the nations obey him and bring him tribute." Many people consider this a prophecy about the Messiah who is a descendant of King David. David is a descendant of Judah.
