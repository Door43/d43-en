===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Weapons of violence are their swords**  - "They use their swords to hurt and to kill people"
  * **do not come into their council; do not join in their meetings**  - Both of these phrases say the same thing for emphasis. Jacob uses the words "soul" and "heart" to refer to himself. AT: "I certainly will not join with them to make any plans" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]])
  * **My soul ... my heart**  - Jacob is talking to himself and saying that other people—and perhaps God also—honor him so much that he does not wish to join with those who make plans to do evil.
  * **they hamstrung oxen**  - Jacob compares the men of Shechem to oxen. This emphasizes the strength of the men and that Simenon and Levi killed them as if the men were just animals. AT: "they slaughtered men like they slaughter oxen" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
