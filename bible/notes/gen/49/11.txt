===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Binding his young horse** - the word "his" refers to Judah's descendants, or to the ruler in [[en:bible:notes:gen:49:10|49:10]]. 
  * **he has washed** - Often in prophecy events that will happen in the future are described as something that has already happened in the past. This emphasizes that this event will certainly happen. Alternate translation: "he will wash" or "they will wash"
  * **His eyes will be** - "their eyes will be." Alternate translation: "His eyes are" or "their eyes are"
  * **as dark as wine ... as white as milk** - "darker than wine ... whiter than milk"
