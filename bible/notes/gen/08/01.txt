\v 1 God considered Noah, all the wild animals, and all the livestock that were with him in the ark. God made a wind blow over the earth, and the water started to recede.
\v 2 The fountains of the deep and the windows of heaven were closed, and it stopped raining.
\v 3 The flood waters receded from off the earth continually. And after the end of a hundred and fifty days, the water had decreased considerably.
