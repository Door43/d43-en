\v 20 Noah built an altar to Yahweh. He took some of the clean animals and some of the clean birds, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
\v 21 Yahweh smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart, "I will not again curse the ground because of mankind, even though the inclination of their hearts is evil from childhood. Nor will I again destroy everything living, as I have done.
\v 22 While the earth remains, seed time and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, and day and night will not cease."
