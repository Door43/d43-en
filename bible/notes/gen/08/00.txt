====== Genesis 08 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 8:22, which is the poetic part of the quotation.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Flood waters ==
The waters receded after this great flood. Because there was so much water and it came from God, it is described in a unique way. 

== The mountains of Ararat ==
It is unclear where Ararat was located. Many people believe it is located in the modern country of Turkey.
