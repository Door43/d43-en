======  Genesis 08 General Notes ======


**Formatting in this chapter**\\

The author's pattern of summary statements and of repeated presentation of the same events continues in this chapter. 

The last verse in this chapter (8:22) is poetic, and the ULB presents it in this way:\\

"While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat,\\
summer and winter, and day and night will not cease."

Some translators will decide not to attempt a translation translation, however. If not, they may choose to use elegant prose.


**Special concepts in this chapter**\\

== Clean animals and birds ==

Noah sacrificed to Yahweh some of the "clean" animals and birds that he had with him (8:20). These were animals and birds that the Hebrew people would later consider to be fit to eat and to sacrifice to God.
