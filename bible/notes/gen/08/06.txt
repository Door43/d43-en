===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **It came about**  - This phrase is used here to mark the beginning of a new part of the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here. This can also be translated as "It happened that."
  * **the window of the ark which he had made**  - The phrase "which he had made" tells about the "window." Some languages may need to make this relative clause a separate sentence: "Noah had made a window in the boat. It came about after forty days that he opened the window." (See the section on clauses in [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_sentences|Sentences]].)
  * **raven**  - a bird with black feathers that mainly eats the flesh of dead animals that it finds
  * **it flew back and forth**  - This means that the raven kept leaving the boat and returning.
  * **until the water was dried up**  - This could be translated as an active clause: "until the wind dried up the water" or "until the water dried up." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
