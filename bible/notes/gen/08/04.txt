===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **came to rest**  - "landed" or "stopped on solid ground"
  * **the seventh month** - We do not know what time of year this was because we do not know what calendar the author was using. (Different cultures started their year in different seasons.)
  * **On the first day of the month**  - This could be translated as  "on the first day of the tenth month."
  * **appeared**  - This can be made more explicit as "appeared above the surface of the water." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
