  * **every living creature of all flesh** - "every kind of living creature." See how "all flesh" is translated in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:06:11|6:12]].
  * **be fruitful, and multiply** - This is an idiom. See how this is translated in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:28|1:28]]. God wanted the humans and animals to reproduce, so there would be many of them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
