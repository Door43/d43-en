===== translationNotes: =====

  * **she said to Abraham** - "Sarah said to Abraham"
  * **Drive out** - "send away" or "get rid of" (UDB)
  * **this slave woman and her son** - This refers to Hagar and Ishmael. Sarah probably did not refer to them by name because she was angry with them.
  * **with my son, with Isaac** - "with my son Isaac"
  * **This thing was very grievous to Abraham** - "Abraham was very unhappy about what Sarah said"
  * **because of his son** - "because it was about his son." It is implied that this means his son, Ishmael. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
