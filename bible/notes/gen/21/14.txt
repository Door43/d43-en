\v 14 Abraham rose up early in the morning, took bread and a skin of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder. He gave her the boy and sent her away. She departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.
\v 15 When the water in the waterskin was gone,  she abandoned the child under one of the bushes.
\v 16 Then she went, and sat down a short distance from him, about  the distance of a bowshot away, for she said, "Let me not look upon the death of the child." As she sat there across from him, she lifted up her voice and wept.
