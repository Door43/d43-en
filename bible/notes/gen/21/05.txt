  * **every one who hears**  - What people would hear can be stated explicitly: "everyone who hears about what God has done for me" (UDB) (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) 
  * **Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children**  -  This is a rhetorical question which emphasizes how unlikely it was for Sarah to have children. It can also be translated as a statement: "No one would have ever said to Abraham, 'Sarah will nurse children.'" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **nurse children** - This refers to breast-feeding babies. It can also be translated as "feed a baby her own milk" or "have a baby and feed it."
