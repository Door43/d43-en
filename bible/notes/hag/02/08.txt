===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The silver and gold are mine** - The words "silver and gold" are a metonym for the treasures that the nations would bring into the temple ([[:en:bible:notes:hag:02:06|2:7]]). (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **this is the declaration of Yahweh of hosts** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:hag:01:07|1:9]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
