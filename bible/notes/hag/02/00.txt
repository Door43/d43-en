====== Haggai 02 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers, or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 2:3-9, 21-23, which is the poetic part of the quotation.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Unclean ==
Haggai uses an extended metaphor in this chapter related to ritual cleanliness. While the Jews were not unclean by nature as the Gentiles were, their actions made them unclean. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]], [[:en:obe:kt:clean]] and [[:en:obe:kt:unclean]])
