<usfm>
\v 15 So now, consider from this day forward, before any stone was laid on another stone in the temple of Yahweh,
\v 16 whenever anyone came to the grainery for twenty measures of grain, there were only ten, and whenever someone came to the
wine vat to draw out fifty measures of wine, there were only twenty.
\v 17 I afflicted you and all the work of your hands with blight and mildew, but you still did not turn to me'—this is Yahweh's declaration.
