\p
\v 12 Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and the high priest Joshua the son of Jehozadak, along with all the remnant of the
people, obeyed the voice of Yahweh their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, because Yahweh their God had sent him. And the
people feared the face of Yahweh. [[I could have done this a couple of different ways. I translated this way reflecting on the idea of the face of God being harsh against sin in the other prophetic works.]]
\v 13 Then Haggai the messenger of Yahweh spoke Yahweh's message to the people and said, "'I am with you!'--this is Yahweh's declaration!"
