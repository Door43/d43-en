\v 3 Then Yahweh gave him this message to tell to the people of Jerusalem:
\v 4 "It is not right  for you to be living in luxurious houses while my temple is only ruins!
\v 5 I, Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies, says this: 'Think about what you are doing.
\v 6 You have planted a lot of seeds, but you are not getting many crops to harvest. You eat food, but you never get enough. You drink wine, but you are still thirsty. You wear clothes, but you do not stay warm. You earn money, but it is spent as quickly as you make it.'

\v 3 And so the word of Yahweh came by the hand of Haggai the prophet and said,
\q
\v 4 "Is it a time for you yourselves to live in your finished houses, 
\q while this house lies ruined?
\q
\v 5 So now Yahweh of hosts says this: 
\q 'Consider your ways!
\q
\v 6 You have sown much seed, but bring in little harvest; you eat but do not have enough; 
\q you drink but cannot get drunk. You wear clothes but cannot warm yourselves, 
\q and the wage earner earns money only to put it into a bag full of holes!'
