<usfm>
\v 10 It is because of what you \add are doing\add* that rain does not fall from the sky, and as a result there are no crops.
\v 11 I have caused a drought\f + \ft Or: severe lack of rain \f* on the hills and on your fields. The result has been that your grain \add has withered\add*, and your grapevines \f + \ft metonymy \f* and olive trees \f + \ft metonymy \f* and all your other crops have dried up. \add Because of that\add*, you and your cattle \add do not have enough food\add*, and the hard work that you have done will be for nothing."

\v 10 It is because of what you are doing that rain does not fall from the sky, and as a result there are no crops.
\v 11 I have caused a drought over both fields and mountains and all your other crops—whether grain or wine or oil—have dried up. Because of that, you and your cattle do not have enough food, and the hard work that you have done will be for nothing.'"

\q
\v 10 Because of this the heavens withhold the dew from you, and the earth withholds its produce.
\q
\v 11 I have summoned a drought upon the land and upon the mountains, upon the grain
\q and upon the new wine, upon the oil and upon the harvest of the earth,
\q upon men and upon beasts, and upon all the labor of your hands!"
