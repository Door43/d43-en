\v 7 So this is what Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, says: 'Think about what you are doing.
\v 8 Then go up into the hills, cut down trees, bring timber down here, and rebuild my temple. When you do that, I will be pleased and I will appear there with my glory.
\v 9 You expected to harvest plenty of crops, but there were few crops to harvest because I removed them. I did this because my temple is a ruin, while each of you are busy building your own beautiful house.

\v 7 Yahweh of hosts says this:
\q Consider your ways!
\q
\v 8 Go up to the mountain, bring timber, and build my house; 
\q then I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified!—says Yahweh.
\q
\v 9 You looked for much, but behold! you have brought little home, for I blew it away! 
\q Why?—this is the declaration of Yahweh of host!
\q Because my house lies in ruins, while every man takes pleasure in his own house.
