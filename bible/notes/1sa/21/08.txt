\v 9 Ahimelech replied, "I have only the sword that belonged to Goliath the \add giant from\add* the Philistia people-group whom you killed in Elah Valley. It is wrapped in a cloth, and is behind the sacred vest \add in the Sacred Tent\add*. If you want it, take it, because I have no other \add weapon\add* here."

\v 8 David said to Ahimelech, "Now is there not here on hand any spear or sword? For I brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business was urgent."
\v 9 The priest said, "The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want to take that, take it, for there is no other weapon here." David said, "There is no other sword like that one; give it to me."
