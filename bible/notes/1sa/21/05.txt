\v 5 David replied, "They have not been near women for many days. I do not allow my men to defile themselves by sleeping with women while they are preparing to fight in battles. They must continue to keep themselves acceptable to God when they are on ordinary trips, and \add today they have kept themselves acceptable to God\add* because now we are doing something very special\f + \ft Or: important \f*."
\v 6 The only bread that the priest had was the sacred bread that had been placed in Yahweh's presence \add in the Sacred tent\add*. So the priest gave David some of that bread. On that day the priest had taken those loaves from the table and replaced them with fresh\f + \ft Or: newly baked \f* loaves.

\v 5 David replied, "They have not been near women for many days. I do not allow my men to defile themselves by sleeping with women while they are preparing to fight in battles. They must continue to keep themselves acceptable to God when they are on ordinary trips, and today they have certainly kept themselves acceptable to God because now we are doing something very special."
\v 6 Now the only bread that the priest had was the bread on display before God, the bread that had been placed in Yahweh's presence in the sacred tent. So the priest gave David some of that bread. On that day the priest had taken those loaves from the table and replaced them with fresh loaves.

\v 5 David answered the priest, "Surely women have been kept from us for the past three days, as usual when I set out. The things belonging to the men have been set apart even on ordinary missions. How much more today will what they have be set apart!"
\v 6 So the priest gave him the bread that was set apart. For there was no bread there except the bread of the presence, which was removed from before Yahweh, in order to put hot bread in its place on the day it was taken away.
