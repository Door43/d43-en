\v 5 David replied, "They have not been near women for many days. I do not allow my men to defile themselves by sleeping with women while they are preparing to fight in battles. They must continue to keep themselves acceptable to God when they are on ordinary trips, and \add today they have kept themselves acceptable to God\add* because now we are doing something very special\f + \ft Or: important \f*."
\v 6 The only bread that the priest had was the sacred bread that had been placed in Yahweh's presence \add in the Sacred tent\add*. So the priest gave David some of that bread. On that day the priest had taken those loaves from the table and replaced them with fresh\f + \ft Or: newly baked \f* loaves.

They must continue to keep themselves acceptable to God when they are on ordinary trips, and today they have kept themselves acceptable to God because now we are doing something very special."
\v 6 The only bread that the priest had was the bread on display before God, the bread that had been placed in Yahweh's presence in the Sacred tent. So the priest gave David some of that bread. On that day the priest had taken those loaves from the table and replaced them with fresh loaves.

\v 5 David answered the priest, "Surely women have been kept from us for these three days. When I
set out, the bodies of the young men were holy, even though it was an ordinary journey. How much more then today will their
bodies be holy?"
\v 6 So the priest gave him the bread of the presence. For there was no bread there, only the bread of the presence, which was removed from before Yahweh, in order to put hot bread in its place when it was taken away.
