===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Is not this David the king of the land?**  - They were probably exaggerating when they said that David was king of the land. They used this question to imply that David was a powerful enemy and Achish should not let him stay there. AT: "Is not this David our enemy's king?" or "This David is as dangerous as the king of the land"  "This (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]], [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]], and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Did they not sing to one another about him in dances?**  - AT: "When the people of the land were dancing, they sang to each other about him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
