\v 4 Saul said to the man who was carrying his weapons, "Take out your sword and kill me with it, in order that these heathen Philistines will not be able to thrust their swords into me and make fun of me \add while I am dying\add*."
\p But the man who was carrying Saul's weapons was terrified, and refused to do that. So Saul took his own sword and fell on it. \add The sword pierced his body and he died\add*.
\v 5 When the man carrying his weapons saw that Saul was dead, he also threw himself on his own sword and died.
\v 6 So Saul, three of his sons, and the man who carried Saul's weapons, all died on that same day.

\v 4 Then Saul said to his armor bearer, "Draw your sword and thrust me through with it. Otherwise, these uncircumcised will come and abuse me." But his armor bearer would not, for he was very afraid. So Saul took his own sword and fell on it.
\v 5 When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword and died with him.
\v 6 So Saul died, his three sons, and his armor bearer—these men all died together that same day.
