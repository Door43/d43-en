\v 4 Saul said to the man who was carrying his weapons, "Take out your sword and kill me with it, in order that these heathen Philistines will not be able to thrust their swords into me and make fun of me \add while I am dying\add*."
\p But the man who was carrying Saul's weapons was terrified, and refused to do that. So Saul took his own sword and fell on it. \add The sword pierced his body and he died\add*.
\v 5 When the man carrying his weapons saw that Saul was dead, he also threw himself on his own sword and died.
\v 6 So Saul, three of his sons, and the man who carried Saul's weapons, all died on that same day.

\v 4 Then said Saul to his armorbearer, Draw your sword, and thrust me through therewith, lest these uncircumcised come and
thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armorbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell
upon it.
\v 5 And when his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell upon his sword, and died with him.
\v 6 So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armorbearer, and all his men, that same day together.
