\p
\v 5 David said to Achish, "If I have found favor in your eyes, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the
country, that I may live there: for why should your servant live in the royal city with you?"
\v 6 So Achish gave him Ziklag that day; that is why Ziklag belongs to the kings of Judah to this very day.
\v 7 The number of days that David lived in the land of the Philistines was a full year and four months.
