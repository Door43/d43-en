\v 8 David and his men attacked various places, making raids on the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites; for those
nations were the inhabitants of the land, as you go to Shur, as far as the land of Egypt. They had been living there in the land from ancient times.
\v 9 David attacked the land and saved neither man nor woman alive; he took away the sheep, the oxen, the donkeys, the camels, and the clothing; he would return and come again to Achish.
