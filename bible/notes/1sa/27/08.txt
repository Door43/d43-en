nations were the inhabitants of the land, who were there from ancient times, as you go to Shur, as far as the land of Egypt.
\v 9 David attacked the land and saved neither man nor woman alive; he took away the sheep, the oxen, the donkeys, the camels, and the clothing; he would return and come again to Achish.
