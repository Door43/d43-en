====== 1 Samuel 27 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This begins a section about David living with the Philistines.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== David's move ==
David is afraid Saul will someday catch him and kill him, so he moves to the Philistine city of Gath. This is a type of exile David creates for himself out of fear. It is caused by his lack of trust in God. This is the same reason his descendants would come to be exiled. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:trust]])
