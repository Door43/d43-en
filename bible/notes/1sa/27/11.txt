<usfm>
\v 11 David's men never brought back to Gath any man or woman who was still alive. David thought, "If we \add do not kill everyone, some of them who are still alive\add* they will go and tell Achish \add the truth\add* about what we really did." David did that all the time that he \add and his men\add* lived in the Philistia area.
\v 12 So Achish believed what David \add told him\add*, and said to himself, "\add Because of what David has done\add*, his own people, the Israelites, must now hate him very much. So he will have to \add stay here and\add* serve me forever."

\v 11 David would keep neither man nor woman alive to bring them to Gath, saying, "So that they cannot say about us, 'David did such and such.'" This was what he did all the while he has lived in the country of the Philistines.
\v 12 Achish believed David, saying, "He has made his people Israel utterly abhor him; he will therefore be my servant
forever."
