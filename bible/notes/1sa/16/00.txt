====== 1 Samuel 16 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

== 1 Samuel 16-31  Saul and David ==
This chapter establishes God's choice of David to be the next king. David receives the Holy Spirit to empower and guide him as the king. It also records the Holy Spirit leaving Saul because of his disobedience. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:holyspirit]])


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== David chosen to be the next king ==
Humans judge others by what they look like, but God judges people by their true inner character. So God rejected David's older brothers in favor of David, who truly loved and obeyed him. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:judge]] and [[:en:obe:kt:love]])

==  Saul tormented by an evil spirit ==
God used Saul's tormenting spirit and David's soothing harp playing to teach David about how the government was conducted. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:spirit]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

==Rhetorical Question ==
God scolds Samuel with this rhetorical question for his unwillingness to accept God's decision: "How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him from being king over Israel?" It was wrong to mourn because it was God's punish of Saul. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
