\v 14 Now the Spirit of Yahweh left Saul, and a harmful spirit from Yahweh troubled him instead.
\v 15 Saul's servants said to him, "Look, a harmful spirit from God troubles you.
\v 16 Let our master now command your servants who are before you to look for a man who is a skillful player on the harp. Then when the harmful spirit from God is on you, he will play it and you will be well."
