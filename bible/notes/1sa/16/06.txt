<usfm>
\v 6 When they arrived there, Samuel looked at \add Jesse's oldest son\add* Eliab, and thought, "Surely this is the one whom Yahweh has appointed \add be king\add*!"
\p
\v 7 But Yahweh said to Samuel, "Do not think \add that he is the one whom I have chosen\add* because of his being handsome and very tall, because I have not chosen him. I do not evaluate people as people do. You people evaluate people by their appearance, but I evaluate people by what is in their inner beings."

\v 6 When they came, he looked at Eliab and said to himself that Yahweh's anointed was certainly standing before him.
\v 7 But Yahweh said to Samuel, "Do not look at his outward appearance, or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him. For Yahweh does not see as man sees; man looks on the outward appearance, but Yahweh looks on the heart."
