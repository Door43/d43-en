\v 16 When the Egyptian had brought David down to the band, behold, the raiders were spread out over all the ground, eating and drinking, and dancing,
because of all the much booty that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines and out of the land of Judah.
\v 17 David attacked them from the twilight to the evening of the next day: not a man of them escaped except for four hundred young men, who rode on camels and fled.
