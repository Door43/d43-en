\v 23 Then David said, "You must not act like this, my brothers, with what Yahweh has given to us—he who has preserved us and
delivered into our hand the band who came against us.
\v 24 Who will listen to you in this matter? For as the share is for anyone who goes into battle, so also will the share be for anyone who waits by the baggage; they will share and share alike."
\v 25 It has been so from that day to this day, for David made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel.
