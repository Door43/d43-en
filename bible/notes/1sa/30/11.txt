\v 11 They found an Egyptian in a field and brought him to David; they gave him bread, and he ate; they gave him water to drink;
\v 12 and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins. When he had eaten, he gained strength again, for he had eaten no bread nor drunk any water for three days and three nights.
