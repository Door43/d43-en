\v 21 David and his men got back to where the other two hundred men were waiting, the men who did not go with David because they were very exhausted. They had stayed at the ravine of Besor. When they saw David and his men coming, they went out to greet them. And David greeted them also.
\p
\v 22 But some of the men who had gone with David, men who were evil and troublemakers, said, "These two hundred men did not go with us. So we should not give to them any of the things that we recovered. Each of them should take only his wife and children and go back to their homes."

\v 21 David came to the two hundred men who had been too weak to follow him, whom the others had made to stay at the brook Besor. These men went ahead to meet David and the people who were with him; and when David came
to these people, he greeted them.
\v 22 Then all the wicked men and worthless fellows among those who had gone with David said, "Because these men did not go with us, we will not give them any of the booty that we have recovered. Except that each man may take his wife and children, lead them away, and go."
