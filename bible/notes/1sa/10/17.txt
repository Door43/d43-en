\v 17 Now Samuel called the people together before Yahweh at Mizpah.
\v 18 He said to the people of Israel, "This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel says: 'I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I
delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians, and from the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you.'

have said to him, 'Set a king over us.' Now present yourselves before Yahweh by your tribes and
by your clans."
