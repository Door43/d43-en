====== 1 Samuel 10 General Notes ======

=== Structure and formatting ===

This is the first chapter about King Saul.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===
== Saul as the New King ==
Samuel told Saul that God had chosen him to be king, and on the way home he would meet some prophets. Saul would then begin prophesying and God would give him the Holy Spirit to help him to know what to do. Samuel told everyone to come to Mizpah where he announced that God had chosen Saul to be their king. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:obe:kt:holyspirit]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical question ==
  
This chapter uses rhetorical questions to express different ideas: to state a fact ("Has not Yahweh anointed you to be a ruler over his inheritance?"), to express surprise ("And who is their father?"), to say he is someone very special ("Do you see the man that Yahweh has chosen?"), and to express contempt ("How can this man save us?"). (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

== Idiom ==

Samuel frequently uses idioms when prophesying: "going to God" means "going to worship God"; "take it from their hands" means "accept their gift"; "rush upon you" means "control you"; "hand finds to do" means "what you think you should do"; "God is with you" means "God is directing you"; "another heart" means "a different way of thinking"; "came to pass" means "happened"; "before Yahweh" means "to do work for Yahweh"; and "hearts God had touched" means "God had made them want to help Saul." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
