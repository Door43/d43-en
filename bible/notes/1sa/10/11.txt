\v 11 When everyone who knew him before saw him prophesying with the prophets, the people
said to each other, "What has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul one of the prophets now?"
\v 12 A man from the same place answered, "And who is their father?" Because of this, it became a saying, "Is Saul also one of
the prophets?"
\v 13 When he finished prophesying, he came to the high place.
