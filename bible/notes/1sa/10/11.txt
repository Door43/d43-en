\p
\v 12 One of the men who lived there replied, "It does not matter who the parents of these other prophets are.\f + \ft Or: All prophets receive their power to speak messages from God, not from their parents. \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add What matters is that, amazingly, Saul is speaking messages from God\add*."

\v 11 When everyone who knew him before saw him prophesying with the prophets, the people
said to each other, "What has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul one of the prophets now?"
\v 12 A man from the same place answered, "And who is their father?" Because of this, it became a saying, "Is Saul also one of the prophets?"
\v 13 When he finished prophesying, he came to the high place.

  * **the son of Kish** - AT: "Saul, the son of Kish"
  * **And who is their father?** - "As for those whom we know to be prophets, we do not care who their fathers are, so we should not doubt that Saul is a prophet just because his father is not an important person." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Is Saul also one of the prophets?** - "Even Saul has become a prophet!"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
