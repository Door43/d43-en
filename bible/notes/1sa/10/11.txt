\v 11 When people who had known Saul previously heard him speaking messages from God as the prophets were doing, they said to each other, "What has happened to this son of Kish? Is he now really one of the prophets\f + \ft Or: men who speak messages from God \f*?"
\p
\v 12 One of the men who lived there replied, "It does not matter who the parents of these other prophets are.\f + \ft Or: All prophets receive their power to speak messages from God, not from their parents. \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add What matters is that, amazingly, Saul is speaking messages from God\add*." And that is why, \add when people are very skeptical about some report, they think about what happened to Saul, and\add* said, "Is Saul really one of the prophets?"
\v 13 When Saul finished speaking the messages that God gave him, he went to the place where the people offered sacrifices.

\v 11 When everyone who knew him before saw him prophesying with the prophets, the people said to each other, "What has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul one of the prophets now?"
\v 12 A man who was from that same place answered, "Then who is their father?" Because of this, it became a saying, "Is Saul also one of the prophets?"
\v 13 When he finished prophesying, he came to the high place.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **What has happened to the son of Kish?** - Possible meanings are 1) the people are asking for information or 2) this is a rhetorical question that means Saul is not important. AT: "Kish is not an important person, so it cannot be true that his son has become a prophet!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the son of Kish** - "Saul, the son of Kish"
  * **Then who is their father?** - This man uses a rhetorical question to remind people that being a prophet has nothing to do with who one's parents are. The question can be translated as a statement. AT: "It does not matter who the parents of these other prophets are. What matters is that, amazingly, Saul is speaking messages from God." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Because of this, it became a saying, "Is Saul also one of the prophets?"** - This became a proverb among the Israelites. Apparently people said this to express surprise when a person unexpectedly did something that he had not done before. The implied meaning of the question can be stated explicitly. AT: "And that is why, when people cannot believe some report, they think about what happened to Saul and say, 'Is Saul really one of the prophets?'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_proverbs]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
