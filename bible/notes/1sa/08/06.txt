\v 6 But it displeased Samuel when they said, "Give us a king to judge us." So Samuel prayed to Yahweh.
\v 7 Yahweh said to Samuel, "Obey the voice of the people in everything they say to you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being king over them.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But it displeased Samuel ... Give us a king to judge us** - Samuel was unhappy that the people did not just want him to remove his corrupt sons and to appoint honest judges, but they wanted a king to rule over them like other countries had. 
  * **Obey the voice of the people** - Here "the voice" is a metonym for the will or the desire of the people. AT: "Do what the people say" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **but they have rejected me** - Yahweh knew that the people were not just rejecting corrupt judges, but they were rejecting Yahweh as their king.
