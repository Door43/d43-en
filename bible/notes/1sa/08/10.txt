\v 10 So Samuel told all the words of Yahweh to the people who were asking for a king.
\v 11 He said, "This is how the king will reign over you. He will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots and to be his horsemen, and to run before his chariots.
\v 12 He will appoint for himself captains of thousands of soldiers, and captains of fifty soldiers. He will make some plow his ground, some reap his harvest, and some to make his weapons of war and the equipment for his chariots.
