\v 8 Saul disguised himself,  put on other clothing, and went, he and two men with him; they went to the woman by night. He said, "Divine to me, I beg you, by talking with the dead, and bring me up whomever I name to you."
\v 9 The woman said to him, "See, you know what Saul has done, how he has banned from the land those who talk with the dead or with spirits. So why are you setting a trap for my life, to make me die?"
\v 10 Saul swore to her by Yahweh and said, "As Yahweh lives, no punishment will happen to you for this thing."
