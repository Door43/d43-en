\v 8 Saul disguised himself, put on other clothing, and went, he and two men with him; they went to the woman by night. He said, "Divine for me, I beg you, with a spirit, and bring me up whomever I name to you."
\v 9 The woman said to him, "See, you know what Saul has done, how he has banned from the land those who talk with the dead or with spirits. So why are you setting a trap for my life, to make me die?"
\v 10 Saul swore to her by Yahweh and said, "As Yahweh lives, no punishment will happen to you for this thing."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Saul disguised himself ... and went ... to the woman by night** - Saul disguised himself because the way from Gilboa ([[:en:bible:notes:1sa:28:03|28:4]]) to Endor ([[:en:bible:notes:1sa:28:05|28:7]]) was through land that the Philistines were living in. He traveled all day and reached the woman after the sun had gone down.
  * **disguised** - changed his usual appearance no one would know who he was
  * **Divine for me ... with a spirit** - "Talk to the dead for me"
  * **those who talk with the dead or with spirits** - The words "those who talk with the dead" translate as one word in the original language, and the words "those who ... talk with spirits" also translate as one word in the original language. If your language has one word for those who talk with the dead and one word for those who talk with spirits, or if your language has only one word for those who talk with the dead and with spirits, you should use those words here. See how you translated similar words in [[:en:bible:notes:1sa:28:03|28:3]].
  * **my life** - The word "life" represents the person. AT: "me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
