\p
\v 3 Samuel was dead; all Israel had lamented him and buried him in Ramah, in his own city. Now Saul had banned from the land those who had talked with the dead or with spirits.
\v 4 The Philistines gathered themselves together and came and camped at Shunem; and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they camped at Gilboa.
