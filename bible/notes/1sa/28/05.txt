\v 5 When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled very much.
\v 6 When Saul prayed to Yahweh for help, but Yahweh did not answer him—neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.
\v 7 Then Saul said to his servants, "Find me a woman who claims to talk with the dead, so that I may go to her and seek her advice." His servants said to him, "See, there is a woman in Endor who claims to talk with the dead."
