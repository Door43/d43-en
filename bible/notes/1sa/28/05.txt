\v 5 When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled very much.
\v 6 Saul prayed to Yahweh for help, but Yahweh did not answer him—neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.
\v 7 Then Saul said to his servants, "Find me a woman who talks with the dead, so that I may go to her and seek her advice." His servants said to him, "See, there is a woman in Endor who claims to talk with the dead."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **he was afraid, and his heart trembled very much** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize the intensity of his fear. Here Saul is referred to by his "heart." AT: "he was terrified" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Urim** - The high priest carried the sacred lots called Urim and Thummin in his breastplate, in a marked pouch, next to his heart. 
  * **who talks with the dead** - These words translate as one word in the original language. If your language has one word for a person who talks to the dead, you should use it here. See how you translated similar words in [[:en:bible:notes:1sa:28:03|28:3]].
  * **Endor** - place name  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
