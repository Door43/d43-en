  * [[:en:obe:other:philistines]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:israel]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:david]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:know]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:servant]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **host** - large assembly of armies
  * **David said to Achish, "So ... do." Achish said to David, "So ... bodyguard."** - The word "so" shows that the speaker agrees with what the other person has just said. AT: "David said to Achish, 'Because you have said that, ... do.' Achish said to David, 'Because you have said that, ... bodyguard.'" Your language may have another way to say the same thing, like the English "very well" (see UDB).
  * **you will know what your servant can do** - David probably wanted Achish to think that David would kill many Israelites, but "what your servant can do" could also mean that David was planning to kill Philistines instead. Try to translate so that the reader can see both of these possible meanings.
  * **your servant** - David speaks as if he is another person so that Achish will think David respects him. AT: "I" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]])
  * **make you** - The word "you" refers to David and so is singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]])
  * **bodyguard** - a person who protects another person
