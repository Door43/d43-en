===== Translation Notes: =====

Abigail seeks to pacify David's lust for revenge.

    * **lay before David facedown and bowed herself to the ground** - This was an act of humility and submission to David as being a powerful leader.
    * **listen to** - "hear"
    * **your servant** - Abigail's use of "servant" establishes her inferior, respectful relationship with David.
