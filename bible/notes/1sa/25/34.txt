\v 34 Just as surely as Yahweh the God whom we Israelites \add worship\add* is alive, he has prevented me from harming you. If you had not come quickly to talk to me, neither Nabal nor even one of Nabal's men [IDI] would be still alive tomorrow morning."

\v 34 For in truth, as Yahweh , the God of Israel, lives, he who has kept me from hurting you, unless you had hurried to come meet me, there would certainly have not been left to Nabal so much as one male baby by morning."
\v 35 So David received from her hand what she had brought him; he said to her, "Go up in peace to your house; see, I have listened to your voice and have accepted you."

===== Translation Notes: =====

David accepts Abigail's gifts and counsel.

  *  **as one male baby** - every male would have been killed from the oldest to the youngest.
  * **received from her hand** - an expression for David accepting all the gifts that Abigail brought with her. It is unlikely that Abigail unloaded all the donkeys herself and handed all the food to David personally. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
