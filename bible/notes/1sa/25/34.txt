\v 34 For in truth, as Yahweh , the God of Israel, lives, he who has kept me from hurting you, unless you had hurried to come meet me, there would certainly have not been left to Nabal so much as one male baby by morning."
\v 35 So David received from her hand what she had brought him; he said to her, "Go up in peace to your house; see, I have listened to your voice and have accepted you."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - David accepts Abigail's gifts and counsel.

  * **as one male baby** - every male would have been killed from the oldest to the youngest
  * **received from her hand** - This is an idiom that is an expression for David accepting all the gifts that Abigail brought with her. It is unlikely that Abigail unloaded all the donkeys herself and handed all the food to David personally. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
