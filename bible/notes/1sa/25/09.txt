\v 9 When David's young men arrived, they said all of this to Nabal on David's behalf and then waited.
\v 10 Nabal answered David's servants, "Who is David? And who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants these days who are breaking away from their masters.
\v 11 Should I take my bread and my water and my meat that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to men who come from I do not know where?"

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **David's young men** - "David's army"
    * **Who is David? And who is the son of Jesse?** - These rhetorical questions show that Nabal considers David an unknown or unimportant person. Also, since David was fleeing Saul, Nabal thinks David might be a slave fleeing from his master. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]],[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **my bread** - any kind of food  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]) 
    * **men who come from I do not know where** - AT: "men whom I do not know"
