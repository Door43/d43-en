\v 9 When David's young men arrived, they said all of this to Nabal on David's behalf and then waited.
\v 10 Nabal answered David's servants, "Who is David? And who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants these days who are breaking away from their masters.
\v 11 Should I take my bread and my water and my meat that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to men who come from I do not know where?"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **David's young men** - "David's army"
  * **said all of this to Nabal on David's behalf** - "gave Nabal David's complete message"
  * **Who is David? And who is the son of Jesse?** - Nabal probably knew who David was, but he did not want to help David. (See [[:en:bible:notes:1sa:18:06|18:6-7]]; the words "servants ... breaking away from their masters" in verse 10 probably refer to David breaking away from Saul.) These rhetorical questions can be translated as statements. AT: "This David son of Jesse you speak of—I do not know him." or "I do not know who this David is, so I will not do as he says. I do not know who Jesse is, so I do not care what happens to his son." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **breaking away from** - "running away from" or "rebelling against"
  * **my bread** - Here "bread" is an idiom for any kind of food. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]) 
  * **men who come from I do not know where** - "men when I do not know where they have come from" or "men whom I do not know"
