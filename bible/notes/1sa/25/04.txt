===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **sent ten young men** - Not children or teenagers.  Probably from David's army so probably at least yet approximately 20 years old.  See: [[:en:bible:notes:num:01:44]] for the legal age of soldiers in biblical Israel.
    * **shearing his sheep**  - or "shaving the wool off his sheep".   See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]
    * **Liv in prosperity, Peace to you and peace to your house, and peace be to all that you have**  - The "may you" is implied at the beginning of all three clauses.   This is a short-hand equivalent for "May you live in prosperity, May peace be to you and may peace be to your house, and may peace be to all that you have"
