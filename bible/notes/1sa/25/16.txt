\v 17 So now you should think about it and decide what you can do. \add If you do not do something\add*, terrible things will happen to our master and to all his family. Nabal is an extremely wicked man, with the result that \add he will not heed anyone when\add* that person tries to tell him anything \add that he should do\add*."

\v 16 They were a wall to us both day and night, all the while we were with them tending the sheep.
\v 17 Therefore know this and consider what you will do, for evil is plotted against our master, and against his whole house.
He is such a worthless fellow that one cannot reason with him."
