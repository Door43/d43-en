====== 1 Samuel 25 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Revenge ==
When David decides to kill all of the men in Nabal's household, Abigail convinces David not to avenge himself but to leave revenge to God. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:avenge]])

 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Foreshadowing ==
It was sinful for David to marry Abigail because he was already married. Adding wives to one's marriage was against the law of Moses. His sin was eventually imitated and carried to an extreme by his son Solomon. This is a type of foreshadowing, or an anticipation, of the downfall of Israel. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sin]] and [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses]])
