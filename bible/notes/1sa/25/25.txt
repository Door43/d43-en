\v 25 Please do not pay attention to [IDI] what this worthless man Nabal has said. His name means 'fool', and he surely is a foolish man. But I, who am \add willing to be\add* your servant, did not see the messengers whom you sent to him.

\v 25 Let not my master regard this worthless fellow, Nabal, for as his name is, so is he. Nabal is his name,
and folly is with him. But I your servant did not see the young men of my master, whom you sent.
\v 26 Now then, my master, as Yahweh lives, and as you live, since Yahweh has restrained you from bloodshed, and from avenging yourself with your own hand, now let your enemies, and those who seek to do evil to my master, be like Nabal.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Abigail continues to counsel David from taking revenge

    * **worthless fellow, Nabal** - Nabal was a man without honor or respect.
    * **But I...did not see...whom you sent** - Abagail explains that she was not aware of David's men. Implying that she would not have sent them away empty handed.
    * ** Yahweh has restrained you from bloodshed, and from avenging yourself with your own hand** -  "Bloodshed" and "avenging yourself with your own hand" are similar.  (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])  
    * **let your enemies, and those who seek to do evil to my lord** - "your enemies" and "those who seek to do evil" express the same concept. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
