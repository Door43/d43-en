\v 25 Please do not pay attention to [IDI] what this worthless man Nabal has said. His name means 'fool', and he surely is a foolish man. But I, who am \add willing to be\add* your servant, did not see the messengers whom you sent to him.
\v 26 Yahweh has prevented you from getting revenge on anyone and killing anyone. I hope\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that as surely as Yahweh lives and as surely as you live, your enemies will be \add cursed\add* like Nabal will be.

\v 25 Let not my master regard this worthless fellow, Nabal, for as his name is, so is he. Nabal is his name, and folly is with him. But I your servant did not see the young men of my master, whom you sent.
\v 26 Now then, my master, as Yahweh lives, and as you live, since Yahweh has restrained you from bloodshed, and from avenging yourself with your own hand, now let your enemies, and those who seek to do evil to my master, be like Nabal.
