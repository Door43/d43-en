===== translationNotes: =====

  * **All Israel gathered together and mourned for him** - This is likely a generalization. A large number of the people of Israel were probably there, but some were probably unable to attend. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **gathered together** - "met together"
  * **buried him in his house at Ramah** - Possible meanings are that they buried Samuel 1) in his home town of Ramah or 2) on his family's land in Ramah but not physically in the house or 3) in his house in Ramah.
  * **David rose and went down** - "David and his men moved on and they went down"
