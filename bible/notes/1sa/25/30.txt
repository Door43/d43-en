===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Abigail continues to reason with David.

  * **this matter will be no sorrow to you** - Abigail is stating that if David chooses to refrain from taking revenge he will have a clear conscience when Yahweh makes him king of Israel. This can be stated in positive form. AT: "you will never regret what you have done" or "you will always be glad you acted as you did" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **the good things which he has promised you** - That is, when Yahweh actually makes him king after Saul's reign is over.
