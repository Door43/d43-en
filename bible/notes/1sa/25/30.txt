===== Translation Notes: =====

Abigail continues to reason with David.

  * **this matter will be no sorrow to you** - Abigail is stating that if David chooses to refrain from taking revenge he will have a clear conscience when Yahweh makes him king of Israel.
  * **the good things which he has promised you** - That is, when Yahweh actually makes him king after Saul's reign is over.
