\v 21 Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of
all that pertained to him: and he has returned me evil for good.
\v 22 God do so to the enemies of David, and more also, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light so much as
one man-child.
