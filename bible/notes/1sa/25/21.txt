\v 21 David had been saying to his men, "It was useless for us to protect that man and all his possessions here in this wilderness. We did not steal anything that belonged to him, but he has acted badly toward me in return for our good actions toward him.
\v 22 I hope that God will strike me and kill me if he or even one male person belonging to him is still alive tomorrow morning!"

<usfm>
\v 21 Now David had said, "Surely in vain have I guarded all that this man has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that belonged to him, and he has returned me evil for good.
\v 22 May God do so to me, David, and more also, if by the morning I leave so much as one male of all who belong to him."

  * **General Information:** - Change in narrative to David getting ready to attack Nabal.

  * **Now David** - "Now" marks a change in the narrative from Abigail back to David. 
  * **May God do so to me, David** - The Hebrew text has "May God strike the enemies of David," and some versions follow this. However, the reading of the ULB follows the main Greek tradition of the Old Testament, as some other modern versions do.
  * **belonged to** - "was owned by"
  * **male** - male, not female
