\v 15 Instead, before they burned the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man who was sacrificing, "Give meat to roast for
the priest; for he will not accept boiled meat from you, but only raw."
\v 16 If the man said to him, "They must burn the fat first, and then take as much as you want." Then he
would say, "No, you will give it me now; if not, I will take it by force."
\v 17 The sin of these young men was very great before Yahweh, for they despised Yahweh's offering.
