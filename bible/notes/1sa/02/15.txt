He wants raw meat; he does not want boiled meat."

\v 16 If the man said to the servant, "Let the priests \add cut off and\add* burn the fat first; then you can take what you want," the servant would reply, "No, give it to me now; if you do not give it to me, I will take it forcefully!"

\v 17 Yahweh considered that the young \add sons of Eli\add* were committing a very great sin, because they were treating very disrespectfully the offerings that were being given to Yahweh.

\v 15 Instead, before they burned the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man who was sacrificing, "Give meat to roast for the priest; for he will not accept boiled meat from you, but only raw."
\v 16 If the man said to him, "They must burn the fat first, and then take as much as you want." Then he would say, "No, you will give it me now; if not, I will take it by force."
\v 17 The sin of these young men was very great before Yahweh, for they despised Yahweh's offering.
