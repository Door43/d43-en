===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **He raises up the poor out of the dust; he lifts the needy from the dunghill** and **to make them sit with princes and inherit the seat of honor**  - Each of these phrases expresses the same idea in two different ways. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]])
  * **out of the dust**  - AT: "from off of the ground." This is another way of saying from poverty. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **from the dunghill**  - AT: "from the place where dung is taken outside of the city." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
