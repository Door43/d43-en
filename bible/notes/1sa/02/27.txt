\v 27 Now a man of God came to Eli and said to him, "Yahweh says, 'Did I not reveal  myself to the house of your ancestor, when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaohâ€™s house?
\v 28 I chose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, and to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me. I gave to the house of your ancestor all the offerings of the people of Israel made with fire.
