\v 32 You will be distressed and envious as you see the blessings that I will give to the \add other people in\add* Israel. And \add I repeat that\add* no men in your family will ever live long enough to become old men.
\v 33 There is one of your descendants whom I will spare, and not prevent him from serving me as a priest. But he will become blind, and then he will always be sad and grieving. But all your other descendants will die violently.

\v 32  You will see distress in the place where I live. Although good will be given to Israel, there will no longer be any old man in your house.
