\v 31 Listen carefully! There will soon be a time when I will cause all the strong \add young men\add* in your family to die. The result will be that no men in your family will \add live long enough to\add* become old men.
\v 32 You will be distressed and envious as you see the blessings that I will give to the \add other people in\add* Israel. And \add I repeat that\add* no men in your family will ever live long enough to become old men.
\v 33 There is one of your descendants whom I will spare, and not prevent him from serving me as a priest. But he will become blind, and then he will always be sad and grieving. But all your other descendants will die violently.

\v 31 See, the days are coming when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your father's house, so that there will no longer be any old man in your house.
\v 32 You will see distress in the place where I live. Although good will be given to Israel, there will no longer be any old man in your house.
\v 33 Any one of you that I do not cut off from my altar, I will cause your eyes to fail, and I will cause grief for your life. All the men born in your family will die.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **See** - "Listen carefully to what I am about to say" or "What I am about to say is very important"
  * **I will cut off your strength and the strength of your father's house** - The words "cut off ... strength" are probably a euphemism for the death of strong, young men; the words "your father's house" are a synecdoche for "your family." AT: "I will kill you and all strong, young male descendants in your family" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **cause your eyes to fail** - "cause you to lose your eyesight" or "cause you to go blind"
