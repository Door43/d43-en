\v 22 Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel, and how that they lay with the women that did
service at the door of the tent of meeting.
\v 23 And he said to them, Why do you such things? for I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.
\v 24 Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: you make Jehovah’s people to transgress.
