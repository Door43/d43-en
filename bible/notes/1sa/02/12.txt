\v 12 Eli's two sons, who were also priests, were very wicked. They were not faithful to Yahweh.
\v 13 The custom was that while the people were boiling the meat from their sacrifices in the huge pot at the temple, a priest would send his servant, who would come with a large three-pronged fork in his hand.
\v 14 He would stick the fork into the meat in the pot, and whatever meat fastened onto the fork, he would take and give it to the priest who sent him.

\p
\v 12 Now the sons of Eli were worthless men. They did not know Yahweh.
\v 13 The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered a sacrifice, the priestâ€™s servant would come with a three pronged fork in his hand, while the meat was boiling.
\v 14 He would stick it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot. All that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. They did this in Shiloh with all the Israelites that came there.
