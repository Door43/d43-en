\p
\v 12 Now the sons of Eli were base men; they knew not Jehovah.
\v 13 And the custom of the priests with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while
the flesh was boiling, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his hand;
\v 14 and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took
therewith. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites that came thither.
