\v 29 Why, then. do you scorn my sacrifices and offerings that I required in
my dwelling place? Why do you honor your sons above me by making yourselves fat with the best of every offering of my people Israel?'
\v 30 For Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, 'I promised that your house, and the house of your ancestor, should walk
before me forever.' But now Yahweh says, 'Far be it from me to do this, for I will honor those who honor me, but those who despise me will be lightly esteemed.
