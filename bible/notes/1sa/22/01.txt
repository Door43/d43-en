  * **cave** - a hollow space under the ground, generally opening into the side of a hill; large enough for people to enter
  * **Everyone who was in distress, everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was discontented—they all gathered to him** - This is an exaggeration. AT: "Many people who were distressed, owed debts, or were unhappy came to him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **four hundred** - "400" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
