===== translationNotes: =====


  * **Then David went from there** - "David went from the cave at Adullam"
  * **go out with you** - David wanted his parents to live with the king of Moab so that King Saul would not be able to harm them. Translators can express his basic meaning by using the ideas of "come to stay with you," "stay with you," or "live here with you," as in the UDB.
  * **go into the land of Judah** - "go to your home land of Judah"
  * **Hereth** - This is the name of a city. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
