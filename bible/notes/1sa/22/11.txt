\v 11 Then the king sent someone to summon Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his fatherâ€™s house, the priests who were in Nob. All of them came to the king.
\v 12 Saul said, "Listen now, son of Ahitub." He answered, "Here I am, my master."
\v 13  Saul said to him, "Why have you plotted against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread, and a sword, and have prayed to God that he might help him, so that he might rise up against me, to hide in secret, as he does today?"
