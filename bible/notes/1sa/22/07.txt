Will he appoint all of you to become generals and captains \add in his army\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?
\v 8 Is that why you have all conspired against me \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? None of you told me when my son \add Jonathan\add* made a solemn agreement with that son of Jesse.

\v 7 He shouted to them, "You men of the tribe of Benjamin, listen to me! Do you think that the son of Jesse will give all of you fields and vineyards if he becomes your king? Will he appoint all of you to become generals and captains in his army ?
\v 8 Is that why you have all conspired against me, as he is doing today? Not one of you informed me that my own son had sworn friendship with him! Not one of you has had any pity on me or told me that my son has encouraged the son of Jesse to revolt against me, to hide out from me!"

\v 7 Saul said to his servants who stood around him, "Listen now, people of Benjamin! Will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards? Will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds,
\v 8 in exchange for all of you plotting against me? None of you informs me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse. None of you is sorry for me. None of you informs me that my son has incited my servant David against me. Today he hides and waits for me so he may attack me."

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **Will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards?** - Saul uses a question to emphasize that David, who is from the tribe of Judah, does not desire to do this for the people of the tribe of Benjamin. AT: "The son of Jesse will not give you fields or vineyards." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Will the son of Jesse give** - The time when he will give can be made explicit. AT: "When the son of Jesse becomes king, will he give" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the son of Jesse** - "David"
  * **Will he make you all captains ... me?** - Saul uses a question to emphasize that David, who is from the tribe of Judah, does not desire to do this for the people of the tribe of Benjamin. AT: "He will not make you captains ... against me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Will he make you all captains** - You may need to make explicit when he will make them captains. AT: "When he becomes king, will he make you all captains" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **captains of thousands and captains of hundreds** - Possible meanings are 1) these numbers represent the exact amount of soldiers that these captains led. AT: "captains of 1,000 soldiers and captains of 100 soldiers" or 2) the words translated as "thousands" and "hundreds" do not represent exact numbers, but are the names of larger and smaller military divisions. AT: "captains of large military divisions and captains of smaller military divisions" See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:1sa:17:17|17:18]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
