\v 7 He shouted to them, "You men of the tribe of Benjamin, listen to me! Do you think that the son of Jesse will give all of you fields and vineyards if he becomes your king? Will he appoint all of you to become generals and captains in his army ?
\v 8 Is that why you have all conspired against me, as he is doing today! Not one of you informed me that my own son had sworn friendship with him! Not one of you has had any pity on me or told me that my son has encouraged the son of Jesse to revolt against me, to hide out from me!"

\v 7 Saul said to his servants who stood around him, "Listen now, people of Benjamin! Will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards? Will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds,
\v 8 in exchange for all of you plotting against me? No one reveals to me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse. None of you is sorry for me or reveals to me that my son has incited my servant David against me, to lie in hiding as he does today?"
