\v 15 Furthermore, this was certainly not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* the first time that I requested God to say what he wanted David to do. And it is not right for you to accuse me or any of my relatives \add of trying to get rid of you\add*, because I do not know anything about \add anyone wanting to do that\add*."

\v 14 Then Ahimelech answered the king and said, "Who among all your servants is so faithful as David, who is the king’s
son-in-law and is over your bodyguard, and is honored in your house?
\v 15 Is today the first time I have prayed to God to help him? Far be it from me! Do not let the king impute anything to his servant or to all the house of my father. For your servant knows nothing of this whole matter."
