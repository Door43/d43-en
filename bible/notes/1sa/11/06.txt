\v 6 When Saul heard what they said, the Spirit of God rushed upon him, and he was very angry.
\v 7 He took a yoke of oxen, cut them into pieces, and sent them throughout all the territory of Israel with the
messengers. He said, "Whoever does not come out after Saul and after Samuel, this is what will be done to his oxen." Then the terror of
Yahweh fell on the people, and they came out together as one man.
\v 8 When he mustered them at Bezek, the people of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty
thousand.
