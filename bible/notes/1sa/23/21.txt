\v 21 Saul said, "May you be blessed by Yahweh. For you have had compassion on me.
\v 22 Go, make even more sure. Learn and find out where his hiding place is and who has seen him there. It is told to me that he is very crafty.
\v 23 So look, and learn all of the places where he hides himself. Come back to me with sure information, and then I will return with you. If he is in the land, I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah."
