===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **They led away their cattle**  - In modern English "cattle" usually means cows.  In the biblical sense it can be a more generic term similar to livestock and can include several species such as cows, sheep, goats.   See Joseph's advice to his brothers when they arrived with their sheep in Egypt in Genesis 46:34 [[en/bible/notes/gen/46/33]]
