\v 24 And the men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eats
any food until it be evening, and I be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted food.
\v 25 And all the people came into the forest; and there was honey upon the ground.
\v 26 And when the people were come to the forest, behold, the honey dropped: but no man put his hand to his mouth; for the
people feared the oath.
