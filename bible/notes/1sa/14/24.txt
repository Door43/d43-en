\v 24 Before Saul's soldiers went to the battle, Saul declared to them solemnly, "I do not want any of you to eat any food before this evening, before we have defeated all our enemies. If anyone eats anything, \add Yahweh\add* will curse\f + \ft Or: punish \f* him." So none of the Israelite soldiers ate any food, and they became faint\f + \ft Or: weak \f* because they were very hungry.

\v 25 The Israelite army went into the forest, and they found honeycombs on the ground, but they did not eat any honey.

\p
\v 24 That day the men of Israel were distressed because Saul had put the people under an oath and said, "Cursed be the man that eats any food until evening and I am avenged on my enemies." So none of the troops tasted food.
\v 25 Then all the people entered the forest and there was honey upon the ground.
\v 26 When the people entered into the forest, the honey flowed, but no one put his hand to his mouth for the people feared the oath.
