\p
\v 24 That day the men of Israel were distressed because Saul had put the people under an oath and said, "Cursed be the man that eats
any food until evening and I am avenged on my enemies." So none of the troops tasted food.
\v 25 Then all the people entered the forest and there was honey upon the ground.
\v 26 When the people entered into the forest, the honey flowed, but no one put his hand to his mouth for the
people feared the oath.
