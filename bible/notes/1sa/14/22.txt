===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hills** - This does not refer to an ambush. These soldiers were hiding because they were afraid of the Philistines. This can be stated explicitly. AT: "the Israelite soldiers who were afraid and had hidden themselves in the hills" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Beth Aven** - This is a place in Israel. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:1sa:13:05|13:05]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
