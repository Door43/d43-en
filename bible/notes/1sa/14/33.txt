\v 33 Then they told Saul, "Look, the people are sinning against Yahweh by eating with the blood." Saul said, "You
have acted unfaithfully. Now, roll a big stone here to me."
\v 34 Saul said, "Go out among the people, and tell them, 'Let every man bring his ox and his sheep, kill them here, and eat. Do not sin against Yahweh by eating with the blood.'" So each of the people brought his own ox with him that night and killed it there.
