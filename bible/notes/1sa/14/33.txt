\v 33 One of the soldiers told Saul, "Look! The men are sinning against Yahweh by eating meat that still has blood in it!"
\p Saul replied \add to the men who were near him\add*, "They have disobeyed Yahweh! Roll a large stone over here!"
\p
\v 34 After they did that, he said to those men, "Go and tell all the soldiers that each of them must bring an ox or a sheep to me, and kill it here on this stone, \add and drain the blood\add* before he eats any of the meat. They should not sin against Yahweh by eating meat \add from some animal\add* without draining its blood." So that night all the soldiers brought animals and slaughtered them there. Then Saul built an altar to \add worship\add* Yahweh.

\v 33 Then they told Saul, "Look, the people are sinning against Yahweh by eating with the blood." Saul said, "You have acted unfaithfully. Now, roll a big stone here to me."
\v 34 Saul said, "Go out among the people, and tell them, 'Let every man bring his ox and his sheep, kill them here, and eat. Do not sin against Yahweh by eating with the blood.'" So each of the people brought his own ox with him that night and killed it there.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **by eating with the blood** - This was a violation of the Law which was given to Moses for the nation of Israel. This can be made explicit. AT: "by eating meat without draining the blood first as required by the law" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]
  * **You have acted unfaithfully** - Saul is accusing his whole army of acting unfaithfully though this is a generalization because not every soldier acted unfaithfully. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **Now, roll a big stone here to me** - The stone would hold the animals up and make it easier to drain the blood from them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **kill them here, and eat** - This would allow Saul to observe if the blood was properly drained from the animals.
