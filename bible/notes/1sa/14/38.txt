\v 38 Then Saul summoned all the leaders of his army. He said to them, "\add I am sure that God has not answered me because\add* someone has sinned. We must find out what sin someone has committed.
\v 39 Yahweh has rescued us \add from the Philistia army\add*. Just as certain as Yahweh lives, whoever has sinned must be executed. Even if it is my son Jonathan who has sinned, he must be executed."

\v 38 Then Saul said, "Come here, all you leaders of the people; learn and see how this sin has happened today.
\v 39 For, as Yahweh lives, who saves Israel, even if it is in Jonathan my son, he will surely die." But none of the men among all the people answered him.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the people** - This refers to the Israelites. 
  * **learn and see how this sin has happened** - "find who sinned"
  * **even if it is in Jonathan my son, he will surely die** - Saul stated this as a hypothetical situation because he did not believe that Jonathan was guilty. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **But none of the men among all the people answered him** - The people remained silent because most of them knew that Jonathan had broken Saul's oath. This can be stated explicitly. AT: "His men knew who was guilty, but none of them said anything to Saul" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
