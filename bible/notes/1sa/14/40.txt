===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Then he said to all Israel** - This was a generalization since only the Israelite soldiers were present. AT: "Then he said to the Israelite soldiers who were there" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **give the Thummim** - The Israelites at that time used special stones called the Urim and the Thummim to receive direction from God. AT: "Show us by means of the Thummim" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Thummim** - This is a borrowed word from the original language. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_transliterate]])
  * **Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot, but the army was exonerated** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "The lots indicated that either Jonathan or Saul was guilty, but the army was not guilty" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Then Jonathan was taken by lot** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Then the lot indicated that Jonathan was guilty" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
