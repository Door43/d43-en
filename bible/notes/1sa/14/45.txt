    * ** "Should Jonathan die, who has accomplished this great victory for Israel?  Far from it!** - The people scold Saul. AT: "Jonathan has just accomplished this great victory for Israel. He should surely not die." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
    * **As Yahweh lives** - The people were expressing their certainty that they would not let anything happen to Jonathan.
    * **not one hair of his head will fall to the ground** - This exaggeration show how the people of Israel  would protect Jonathan and keep him safe. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
