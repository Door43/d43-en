\v 22 Yahweh decided to make us his people. So he will not abandon us people whom he has chosen, because he would injure his own reputation \add of being completely faithful\add* if he did that.
\v 23 But as for me, I have solemnly promised that I will not sin against Yahweh by ceasing to pray for you. And I will continue to teach you what things are good and right \add for you to do\add*.

<usfm>
\v 22 For the sake of his great name, Yahweh will not reject his people, because it has pleased Yahweh to make you a people for himself.
\v 23 As for me, far be it from me that I should sin against Yahweh by ceasing to pray for you.  Instead, I will teach 
you the way that is good and right.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **For the sake of his great name**  - Here "name" refers to the reputation of Yahweh. "So that honor and respect for Yahweh will continue" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **far be it from me that I should sin against Yahweh by ceasing to pray for you.**  - The people are filled with fear because of the rain and thunder that Yahweh sent when Samuel prayed.  Some may believe Samuel would use his prayers to harm them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
