    * **before your eyes**  - The word "eyes" here represents the people of the nation of Israel.  AT: "out in the open where all of the nation of Israel may see" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]]) 
    * **Is it not the wheat harvest today?**  - Harvest time normally comes at the start of the dry season.  AT:"it is the time of the harvest and no rainstorms are present during this time." (See:[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
