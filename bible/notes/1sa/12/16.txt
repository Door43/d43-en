\v 16 Even now present yourself and see this great thing which Yahweh will do before your eyes.
\v 17 Is it not the wheat harvest today? I will call upon Yahweh, that he may send thunder and rain. Then you will know and see
that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight of Yahweh, in asking for yourselves a king."
\v 18 So Samuel called to Yahweh; and that same day Yahweh sent thunder and rain. Then all the people greatly feared Yahweh and
Samuel.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **before your eyes**  - The word "eyes" here represents the people of the nation of Israel.  AT: "out in the open where all of the nation of Israel may see" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]]) 
    * **Is it not the wheat harvest today?**  - Harvest time normally comes at the start of the dry season.  AT:"it is the time of the harvest and no rainstorms are present during this time." (See:[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
    * **he may send thunder and rain** - Rain is not good during the harvest. The grains need to be kept dry so that they do not rot in storage during the winter months.
    * **the people greatly feared Yahweh** - Israel is relearning what it means to fear Yahweh. A lesson that was not past down from one generation to the next.
