\v 12 When you saw that Nahash the king of the people of Ammon came against you, you said to me, 'No! Instead, a king must reign over us'—although Yahweh, your God, was your king.
\v 13 Now here is the king whom you have chosen, whom you have asked for and whom Yahweh has now appointed as king over you.

===== Translation Notes: =====
Samuel continues to rebuke the nation of Israel.

    * **No! Instead, a king must reign over us**  -  This phrase shows the nation of Israel's strong reaction against Samuel when he told them about trusting God because God delivered them in the past.
    * **whom you have chosen, whom you have asked for** - These two phrases share similar meanings and emphasis that this is the king whom the people wanted. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
