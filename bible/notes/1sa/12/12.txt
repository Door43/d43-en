===== Translation Notes: =====
Samuel continues to rebuke the nation of Israel.

    * **No! Instead, a king must reign over us**  -  This phrase shows the nation of Israel's strong reaction against Samuel when he told them about trusting God because God delivered them in the past.
    * **whom you have chosen, whom you have asked for** - These two phrases share similar meanings and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
