This chapter serves as a type of farewell address. This is a way for a leader or important person to given instructions to their followers before they leave or die. Samuel first establishes his holiness before calling on the people to repent of their desire to have a king. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:holy]] and [[:en:obe:kt:repent]])

It is common in Scripture to use Israel's history to show how faithful God has been. This gives the reader evidence to trust in Yahweh in their current situation. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:faithful]] and [[:en:obe:kt:trust]])
