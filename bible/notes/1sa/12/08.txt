\v 8 When Jacob came to Egypt, and your ancestors cried out to Yahweh. Yahweh sent Moses and Aaron, who led your ancestors out of Egypt and they settled in this place.
\v 9 But they forgot Yahweh their God; he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the armies of Hazor, into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab; these all fought against your ancestors.
