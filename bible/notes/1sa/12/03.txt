===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Here I am; testify against me before Yahweh and before his anointed one** - By this statement, Samuel is challenging the people to speak up if he has done anything wrong to anyone. AT: "I stand in front of you now. I ask you to speak in front of God and his anointed king if I have done you any wrong" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Whose ox have I taken? Whose donkey have I taken?** - Samuel uses rhetorical questions to remind the people that he has never stolen their animals. AT: "I have never stolen a prized animal from anyone." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Whom have I defrauded?** - Samuel uses another rhetorical question to say he has always been honest. AT: "I have never cheated or bribed any man." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Testify against me, and I will restore it to you** - "If I have done any of these evil things, speak now and I will pay back what I owe. I will make right any wrong."
