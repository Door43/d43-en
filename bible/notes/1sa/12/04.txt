===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **from any man’s hand… in my hand **- These phrases mean what a person possesses or what they have done to bring favor from others. This is a polite way of saying he has not stolen nor has he given or taken bribes. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism|Euphemism]])
