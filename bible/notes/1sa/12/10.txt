\v 10 Then our ancestors pleaded with Yahweh again to help them. They admitted, 'Yahweh, we have sinned, and we have forsaken you. We have worshiped \add idols that represent the god\add* Baal and the goddess Astarte. But if you rescue us from our enemies, we will worship you only.'
\v 11 So Yahweh sent men such as Gideon, Barak, Jephthah, and me to save you. And as a result, you did not have to worry about any enemies attacking you.
