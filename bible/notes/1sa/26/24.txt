===== translationNotes: =====

  * **your life was precious in my eyes** - The word "eyes" is a metonym for what a person thinks. AT: "I showed you that I want to protect you" or "I showed you that I really do respect you" Similar words appear in [[:en:bible:notes:1sa:26:21|26:21]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **may my life be much valued in the eyes of Yahweh** - The words "eyes of Yahweh" are a metonymy for Yahweh. AT: "may Yahweh value my life as much as I have valued your life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **May you be blessed** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "May Yahweh bless you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **my son** - Saul was not David's true father. Saul speaks as if he were David's father to show David that he wants David to trust and respect him as David would trust and respect his own father. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
