\v 6 Then David  said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, "Who
will go down with me to Saul in the camp?" Abishai said, "I will go down with you."
\v 7 So David and Abishai went to the army by night. And there was Saul sleeping inside the camp, with his spear stuck in the ground beside his head. Abner and his soldiers lay around him.
\v 8 Then Abishai said to David, "Today God has put your enemy into your hand. Now please let me pin him to the ground with the spear with just one blow. I will not strike him a second time."
