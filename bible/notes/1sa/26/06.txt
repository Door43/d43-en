\v 6 David \add went back to where his men were and\add* talked to Ahimelech, who was from the Heth people-group, and Joab's brother Abishai, whose mother was \add David's older sister\add* Zeruiah. He asked them, "Who will go with me down into the camp where Saul is?"
\p Abishai replied, "I will go with you."
\v 7 So that night David and Abishai crept into Saul's camp. They saw that Saul was asleep. His spear was stuck in the ground near his head. Saul was asleep in the middle of the camp. Abner and the other soldiers were sleeping around Saul.

\v 8 Abishai whispered to David, "Today Yahweh has enabled us to kill your enemy! Allow me to fasten Saul to the ground \add by thrusting\add* my spear into him. It will be necessary for me to strike him only once. I will not \add need to\add* strike him twice."

\v 6 Then David  said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, "Who
will go down with me to Saul in the camp?" Abishai said, "I will go down with you."
\v 7 So David and Abishai went to the army by night. And there was Saul sleeping inside the camp, with his spear stuck in the ground beside his head. Abner and his soldiers lay around him.
\v 8 Then Abishai said to David, "Today God has put your enemy into your hand. Now please let me pin him to the ground with the spear with just one blow. I will not strike him a second time."
