\v 20 Now do not force me to die \f + \ft metonymy \f* far from \add where we worship\add* Yahweh. You, the king of Israel, have come here searching for me. \add But I am not wanting to harm you\add*!

\v 19 Your majesty, listen to me! If Yahweh has caused you to be angry with me, I want him to accept a sacrifice from me. But if it is people who have caused you to be angry with me, I hope that Yahweh will curse them. They have forced me to leave the land that Yahweh gave to me. They have told me, 'Go somewhere else and worship other gods!'
\v 20 Now do not force me to die away from the land and presence of Yahweh. You, the king, are looking for me, but I am as good as a flea or a wild bird that someone hunts in the hills."

<usfm>
\v 19 Now therefore, I beg you, let my lord the king listen to the words of his servant. If it is Yahweh who has stirred you
up against me, let him accept an offering; but if it is human beings, may they be cursed in the sight of Yahweh, for they have today 
driven me out, that I should not cling to the inheritance of Yahweh; they have said to me, 'Go worship other gods.'
\v 20 Now therefore, do not let my blood fall to the earth away from Yahweh's presence; for the king of Israel has come out
to look for a flea, as when one hunts a partridge in the mountains."
