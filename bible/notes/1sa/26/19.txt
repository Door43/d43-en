\v 19 Now therefore, I pray you, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it be Jehovah that has stirred you
up against me, let him accept an offering: but if it be the children of men, cursed be they before Jehovah; for they have
driven me out this day that I should not cleave to the inheritance of Jehovah, saying, Go, serve other gods.
\v 20 Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of Jehovah: for the king of Israel is come out
to seek a flea, as when one does hunt a partridge in the mountains.
