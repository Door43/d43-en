at his head and the jar of water, and let us go."

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **and let us go** - This is an [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]]
    * **because a deep sleep from Yahweh** - Saul was probably in a clinically deep sleep since Yahweh caused this extraordinarily deep sleep to come upon him (deeper than normal but probably not quite as deep as a bear would hibernate).  If there is a word in your language for an extraordinarily deep sleep then prefer that word.
