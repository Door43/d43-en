===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **my son David**  - Saul established his desired (not actual) relationship with David by using the term "son." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]], [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **What have I done? What evil is in my hand?** - These two questions mean basically the same thing. David uses them to emphasize that he has done nothing wrong. AT: "Clearly, I have done nothing against you. I have no evil plans." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
