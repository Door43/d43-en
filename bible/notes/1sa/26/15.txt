\v 15 David replied, "\add I am sure that\add* you are the greatest man in Israel \f + \ft irony, rhetorical question \f*! So why did you not guard your master, the king? Someone came into your camp in order to kill your master, the king.
\v 16 You have done a very poor \add job of guarding Saul\add*. So just as surely as Yahweh lives, you and your men should be executed! You have not guarded your master whom Yahweh appointed to be the king. Where are the king's spear and the water jug that were close to his head?"

\v 15 David said to Abner, "Are not you a courageous man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have
you not kept watch over your lord the king? For someone came in to kill the king your lord.
\v 16 This thing is not good that you have done. As Yahweh lives, you deserve to die because you have not kept watch over
your lord, Yahweh’s anointed one. And now see where the king’s spear is, and the jar of water that was at his head."
