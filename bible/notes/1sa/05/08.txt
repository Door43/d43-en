\p The kings replied, "Take the sacred chest to Gath \add city\add*." So they moved it to Gath.

\v 8 So they sent for and gathered together all of the rulers of the Philistines; they said to them, "What should we do with the ark of
the God of Israel?" They answered, "Let the ark of the God of Israel be brought around to Gath." And they carried the ark of
the God of Israel there.
\v 9 But after they brought it around, Yahweh's hand was against the city, causing a very great confusion. He afflicted the men of the city, both small and great; and tumors broke out on them.
