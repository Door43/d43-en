\v 1 Now the Philistines had captured the ark of God, and they brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.
\v 2 The Philistines took the ark of God, brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it up beside Dagon.
\v 3 When the people of Ashdod got up early the next day, behold, Dagon had fallen facedown on the ground before the ark of Yahweh. So they took Dagon and set him up in his place again.
