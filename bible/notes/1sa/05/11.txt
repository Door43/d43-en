\v 11 So they sent for and gathered together all of the rulers of the Philistines; they said to them, "Send away the ark of the God
of Israel, and let it return to its own place, so that it does not kill us and our people." For there was a deathly panic
throughout the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.
\v 12 The men who did not die were afflicted with the tumors, and the cry of the city went up to the heavens.
