\v 4 And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of
Jehovah; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands lay cut off upon the threshold; only
the stump of Dagon was left to him.
\v 5 Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon’s house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod,
to this day.
