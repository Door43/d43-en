\v 4 But when they got up early the next morning, behold, Dagon had fallen face down on the ground before the ark of
Yahweh. The head of Dagon and both of his hands were lying cut off in the doorway. Only
the trunk of Dagon remained.
\v 5 This is why, even today, the priests of Dagon and anyone who comes into Dagon’s house does not step on the doorway of Dagon in Ashdod.
