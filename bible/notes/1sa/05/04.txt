\v 5 That is the reason that ever since that time, the priests of Dagon and everyone else who enters the temple of Dagon in Ashdod do not step on the doorsill where the hands and head of Dagon had fallen.

\v 4 But when they got up early the next morning, behold, Dagon had fallen face down on the ground before the ark of Yahweh. The head of Dagon and both of his hands were lying cut off in the doorway. Only the trunk of Dagon remained.
\v 5 This is why, even today, the priests of Dagon and anyone who comes into Dagon's house does not step on the doorway of Dagon in Ashdod.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **were lying cut off** - "cut" here implies an intentional act of removal, a cutting motion, similar to cutting a human head and hands off the body.
  * **This is why, even today** - The writer is about to give some background information separate from the main story.
