\v 4 But the following morning, they saw that it had fallen down in front of the sacred chest again. But this time, it was as if someone had cut the statue's head and hands off; they were lying in the doorway. Only its body remained in one piece.
\v 5 That is the reason that ever since that time, the priests of Dagon and everyone else who enters the temple of Dagon in Ashdod do not step on the doorsill where the hands and head of Dagon had fallen.

\v 4 But when they got up early the next morning, behold, Dagon had fallen facedown on the ground before the ark of Yahweh. The head of Dagon and both of his hands were lying cut off in the doorway. Only the trunk of Dagon remained.
\v 5 This is why, even today, the priests of Dagon and anyone who comes into Dagon's house does not step on the doorway of Dagon in Ashdod.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Dagon had fallen** - The reader should understand that Yahweh had caused Dagon to fall.
  * **The head of Dagon and both of his hands were lying cut off** - It was as if Yahweh were a soldier who had defeated his enemy and cut off the enemy's head and hands.
  * **hands** - the palms of the hands, a synecdoche for both whole hands (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **This is why, even today** - The writer is about to give some background information separate from the main story. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
