\v 14 The cart came into the field of Joshua from the town of Beth Shemesh and stopped there. A great stone was there, and they
split the wood from the cart, and offered the cows as a burnt offering to Yahweh.
\v 15 The Levites took down the ark of Yahweh and the box that was with it, where the golden figures were, and put
them on the great stone. The men of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices the same day to
Yahweh.
