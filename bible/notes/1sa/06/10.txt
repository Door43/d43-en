\v 10 The men did as they were told; they took two nursing cows, tied them to the cart, and confined their calves at home.
\v 11 They put the ark of Yahweh on the cart, together with a box containing the golden mice and the castings of their tumors.
\v 12 The cows went straight in the direction of Bethshemesh. They went along one highway, lowing as they went, and they did not
turn aside either to the right or to the left. The rulers of the Philistines followed after them to the border of
Bethshemesh.
