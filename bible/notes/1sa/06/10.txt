\v 10 So the people did what the priests and diviners told them to do. They \add made a cart\add*, and hitched two cows to it. They took the calves from their mothers.
\v 11 They put in the cart Yahweh's sacred chest and the box with the models of the gold rats and the tumors.
\v 12 Then the cows started walking, and they went straight toward Beth-Shemesh. They stayed on the road, and were mooing all the time. They did not turn to the left or to the right. The five kings of the Philistia area followed the cows until they reached the edge of Beth-Shemesh.

\v 10 The men did as they were told; they took two nursing cows, tied them to the cart, and confined their calves at home.
\v 11 They put the ark of Yahweh on the cart, together with a box containing the golden mice and the castings of their tumors.
\v 12 The cows went straight in the direction of Beth Shemesh. They went along one highway, lowing as they went, and they did not turn aside either to the right or to the left. The rulers of the Philistines followed after them to the border of Beth Shemesh.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **castings of their tumors** - "models of their tumors made by pouring molten metal into a form; the form can used many times."
    * **The cows went straight in the direction of Beth Shemesh** - milking cows should have returned to their calves but these instead went on to Beth she mesh which was unnatural.
    * **lowing as they went** - These cows were making complaining noises. These cows were wanting to return to their calves.
    * **did not turn aside** - these cows were being led to a destination without any person guiding them.
