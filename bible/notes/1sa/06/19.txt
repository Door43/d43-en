===== translationNotes: =====

  * **they had looked into the ark** - The ark was so holy that no one was permitted to look inside it. Only the priests were allowed to even see the ark.
  * **50,070 men** - "fifty thousand seventy men" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **Who is able to stand before Yahweh, this holy God?** - Possible meanings are 1) this is a rhetorical question that expresses the people's fear of Yahweh. AT: "There is no one who can resist Yahweh because he is so holy!" or 2) this is a question asking for information. The phrase "stand before Yahweh" may refer to priests who serve Yahweh. It is implied that the people were looking for a priest whom Yahweh would permit to handle the ark. AT: "Is there a priest among us who serves this holy God, Yahweh, and is able to handle this ark?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **To whom will the ark go up from us?** - This is a question asking for information. It is implied that the people want Yahweh and the ark to go somewhere else so he will not punish them again. AT: "Where can we send this ark so that Yahweh will not punish us again?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
