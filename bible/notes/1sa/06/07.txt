<usfm>
\v 7 So you must build a new cart. Then get two cows that have very recently given birth to calves. They must be cows that have never been hitched to a cart \f + \ft metonymy \f*. Hitch those cows to the new cart, and take the calves away from their mothers.
\v 8 Put their god's sacred chest on the cart. Also put in the cart the five gold models of the tumors on your skin and the five gold models of rats. Put them in a small box alongside the sacred chest. They will be an offering to show that you know that you deserved to be punished \add for capturing the sacred chest\add*. Then send the \add cows\add* down the road, \add pulling\add* the cart.
\v 9 \add Watch the cart as the cows pull it\add*. If they pull it to Beth-Shemesh \add town\add* in Israel, we will know that it was their god who brought this plague on us. But if they do not take it there, we will know that it was not the god \f + \ft metonymy \f* of the Israelites who has punished us. We will know that it just happened."

\v 7 Now then, prepare a new cart with two nursing cows, which have never been yoked. Tie the cows to
the cart, but take their calves home, away from them.
\v 8 Then take the ark of Yahweh and place it in the cart. Put the golden figures that you are returning to him as a guilt offering into a box to one side of it. Then send it off and let it go its own way.
\v 9 Then watch; if it goes up on the way to its own land to Beth Shemesh, then it is Yahweh who has executed this great disaster. But if not, then we will know that it is not his hand that afflicted us; instead, we will know that it happened to us by chance."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **two nursing cows, which have never been yoked** - It is unlikely that these two cows would wander to Israel. 
  * **Then send it off and let it go its own way.** - The expected action would be for the two cows to head back home to their calves.
  * **if it goes...to Beth Shemesh, then it is Yahweh** - It is unlikely that the cows would choose to wander to Beth Shemesh when their calves are back in the Philistine home.
  * ** we will know that it happened to us by chance."**  - "we will know that it just happened."
