\v 17 The five gold models of tumors that they sent to be an offering to Yahweh to show that they knew that they deserved to be punished were gifts from \add those five kings who were rulers of\add* Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron \add cities\add*.
\v 18 The models of the five gold rats were gifts from the people of those five cities and the surrounding towns. The large rock at Beth-Shemesh, on which the \add men of the tribe of Levi\add* set the sacred chest, is still there in the field that belonged to Joshua. When people see it, they remember \add what happened there\add*.

\v 17 These are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a guilt offering to Yahweh: One for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, and one for Ekron.
\v 18 The golden mice were the same in number as the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five rulers, both fortified cities and country villages. The great stone, beside which they set down the ark of Yahweh, remains a witness to this day in the field of Joshua the Bethshemite.
