\v 3 And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet. Now David and his men were living in the innermost parts of the cave.
\v 4 And the men of David said to him, Behold, the day of which Jehovah said to thee, Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it shall seem good to thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe privily.
