\v 3 He came to sheep pens on the way, where there was a cave. Saul went inside to relieve himself. Now David and his men were sitting far back in the cave.
\v 4 David's men said to him, "This is the day of which Yahweh spoke when he said to you, 'I will give your enemy into your hand, for you to do with him as you wish.'" Then David arose and quietly crept forward and cut off the corner of Saul’s robe.

    * **Saul went inside to relieve himself**  - Here "relieve himself" is a [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]] for either to urinate or to defecate.   Prefer to use a polite [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]] in the target language if possible.
    * **give your enemy into your hand**  - The sense here is to deliver your enemy into your power.
