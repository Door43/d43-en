\v 14 You are the king of Israel. So why are you pursuing me? What is it you are chasing? I am nothing more than a dead dog or a flea.
\v 15 I hope that Yahweh will decide who is right in this matter, you or I? And when he decides in my favor, I hope he will defend me and save me from your power."

\v 14 After whom has the king of Israel come out? After whom do you pursue? After a dead dog! After a flea!
\v 15 May Yahweh be judge and give judgment between you and me, and see to it, and plead my cause and permit me to escape from your hand."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **After whom has the king of Israel come out? After whom do you pursue?** - These rhetorical questions can be translated as  statements. When David asks the questions, he knows that he will answer the questions himself. AT: "Let me tell you who the king of Israel has come out after. Let me tell you who it is that you are pursuing." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **After a dead dog** - The words "dead dog" are a metaphor for a powerless person. This sentence can be made complete. AT: "You are pursuing a person who is as powerless as a dead dog" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **After a flea** - The word "flea" is a metaphor for a person whom others do not consider important. AT: "You are pursuing a person who is as unimportant as a flea" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **see to it, and plead my cause** - Possible meanings are 1) "do what is right, and plead my cause" or 2) "see that my cause is right and fight for me."
  * **from your hand** - The word "hand" is a metonym for power. AT: "so that you have no power over me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
