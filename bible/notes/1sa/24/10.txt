===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 Today you can see with your own eyes that \add what they say is not true\add*. Yahweh put you in a place where I and my men could have killed you when you were in this cave. Some of my men told me that I should do that, but I did not allow them to do that. I said to them, 'I will not harm my master, because he is the king whom Yahweh appointed.'
\v 11 Your majesty, look at this piece of your robe that is in my hand! I cut it from your robe, but I did not kill you. So now you should be able to understand that I am not planning to do anything evil to you. I have not done anything wrong to you, but you are searching for me to kill me.

\v 10 "Today your eyes have seen how Yahweh delivered you into my hand in the cave. Some told
me to kill you, but I spared you. I said, 'I will not put out my hand against my lord; for he is Yahweh's anointed.'
\v 11 See, my father, see the corner of your robe in my hand. For the fact that I cut off the corner of your robe and did not kill you, you may know and see that there is no evil or treason in my hand, and I have not sinned against you,
even though you hunt my life to take it.
