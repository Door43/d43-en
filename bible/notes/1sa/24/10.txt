====== 1 Samuel 24:10-11 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 Today you can see with your own eyes that \add what they say is not true\add*. Yahweh put you in a place where I and my men could have killed you when you were in this cave. Some of my men told me that I should do that, but I did not allow them to do that. I said to them, 'I will not harm my master, because he is the king whom Yahweh appointed.'
\v 11 Your majesty, look at this piece of your robe that is in my hand! I cut it from your robe, but I did not kill you. So now you should be able to understand that I am not planning to do anything evil to you. I have not done anything wrong to you, but you are searching for me to kill me.

\v 10 Today your eyes have seen how Yahweh put you into my hand when we were in the cave. Some told me to kill you, but I spared you. I said, 'I will not put out my hand against my master; for he is Yahweh's anointed.'
\v 11 See, my father, see the corner of your robe in my hand. For the fact that I cut off the corner of your robe and did not kill you, you may know and see that there is no evil or treason in my hand, and I have not sinned against you, even though you hunt my life to take it.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **your eyes have seen** - "Your eyes" represent King Saul. AT: "you have seen with your own eyes" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **put you into my hand** - The word "hand" is a metonym for control. AT: "put you where I could decide whether to kill you or allow you to live" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Yahweh's anointed** - "the one whom Yahweh has chosen to lead his people" or "the one Yahweh has made king" Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:1sa:24:05|24:6]].
  * **my father** - Saul was not David's real father. David calls him "father" to show that he respects Saul.
  * **there is no evil or treason in my hand** - David speaks as if evil and treason were physical objects he could hold in his hand. The nominalized adjective "evil" can be translated as an adjective. The abstract noun "treason" can be translated as a clause. AT: "I have done no evil deed against you, nor do I wish to rebel against you, my king" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
