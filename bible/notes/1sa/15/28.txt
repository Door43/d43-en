===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Yahweh has torn the kingdom of Israel** - This refers back to the tearing of the robe in [[:en:bible:notes:1sa:15:26|15:26-27]]. The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. AT: "Just as Saul tore the robe, Yahweh has torn the kingdom." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **from you today and has given it to a neighbor of yours** - God has already decided who should be the next king.
  * **the Strength of Israel** - "Strength" is a metonymy that phrase refers to Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
