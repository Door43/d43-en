===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the words of Yahweh** - "the message of Yahweh" 
  * **completely destroy all that they have ... kill both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey** - These two phrases mean the same thing. The second phrase gives specific details about what they are to destroy completely. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Do not spare them** - This negative statement emphasizes the completeness of the destruction. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
