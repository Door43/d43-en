\c 15
\p
\v 1 And Samuel said to Saul, Jehovah sent me to anoint you to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore listen
you to the voice of the words of Jehovah.
\v 2 Thus says Jehovah of hosts, I have marked that which Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against him in the way,
when he came up out of Egypt.
\v 3 Now go and strike Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but kill both man and woman, infant
and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.
