\v 32 Then Samuel said, "Bring Agag, the king of the Amalekites, here to me." Agag came to him cheerfully and said, "Surely the bitterness of death has past."
\v 33 Samuel replied, "As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women." Then Samuel chopped Agag to pieces before Yahweh at Gilgal.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **Bring Agag...to me.** - Samuel is having to do Saul's job of executing Agag.
    * **As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women.**  - Both of these phrase have similar meaning and are combined here for emphasis. AT: "Since you have killed people, you will also die." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
