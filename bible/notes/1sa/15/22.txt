\q1 "Which \add do you think\add* pleases Yahweh more, animals that are completely burned \add on the altar\add* and other sacrifices,
\q1 or people obeying him \f + \ft synecdoche \f*?

\q1 It is better to pay attention to what he says than \add to burn\add* the fat of rams, \add which God said should be sacrificed to him\add*.

\v 23 To rebel \add against God\add* is as sinful as doing sorcery\f + \ft Or: black \f* magic,
\q1 and being stubborn is as sinful as worshiping idols.
\q2 So, because you disobeyed what Yahweh told you to do,
\q1 he has declared that you will no longer be king."

\v 22 Samuel replied, "Has Yahweh as much delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of Yahweh?
Obedience is better than sacrifice, and to listen is better than the fat of rams.
\v 23 For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and stubbornness is like wickedness and iniquity. Because you have rejected the
word of Yahweh, he has also rejected you from being king."

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **Has Yahweh as much delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of Yahweh?**  - This question emphasizes that Yahweh's character always puts obedience in front of sacrifices after disobedience. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **as in obeying the voice of Yahweh** - Here the phrase "the voice of Yahweh" is representing the authority of Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
   * **Obedience is better than sacrifice** - God wanted Saul's complete obedience in the destruction of the Amalekites. Nothing in the land was fit for sacrifice.
