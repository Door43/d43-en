\v 14 Samuel said, "What then is this bleating of sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen that I hear?"
\v 15 Saul replied, "They have brought them from the Amalekites. For the people spared the best of the sheep and oxen,
to sacrifice to Yahweh your God. The rest we have completely destroyed."
\v 16 Then Samuel said to Saul, "Wait, and I will tell you what Yahweh has said to me tonight." Saul said to him, "Speak!"

===== Translation Notes: =====
Samuel questions why Saul did not utterly destroyed the Amalekites.

  * **They have brought... the people spared** - The word "they" and the phrase "the people" here both represent Saul's army.
  * **Yahweh your God** - Saul did not embrace Samuel's God as his God.
