\v 14 Samuel said, "What then is this bleating of sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen that I hear?"
\v 15 Saul replied, "They have brought them from the Amalekites. For the people spared the best of the sheep and oxen, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God. The rest we have completely destroyed."
\v 16 Then Samuel said to Saul, "Wait, and I will tell you what Yahweh has said to me tonight." Saul said to him, "Speak!"
