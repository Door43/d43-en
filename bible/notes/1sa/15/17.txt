\v 18 And Yahweh sent you to do something for him. He said to you, 'Go and get rid of all those sinful people, the Amalek people group. Attack them and kill all of them.'
\v 19 So why did you not obey Yahweh? Why did you take the plunder for yourself instead of destroying it? You have done what Yahweh says is evil, and he knows it!"

\v 17 Samuel said, "Though you are little in your own sight, were you not made the head of the tribes of Israel? And
Yahweh anointed you king over Israel;
\v 18 Yahweh sent you on your way and said, 'Go and completely destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them
until they are destroyed.'
\v 19 Why then did you not obey the voice of Yahweh, but instead you seized the booty and did what was evil in
the sight of Yahweh?"
