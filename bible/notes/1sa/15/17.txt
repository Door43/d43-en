\v 17 Samuel said, "Though you are little in your own sight, were you not made the head of the tribes of Israel? And
Yahweh anointed you king over Israel;
\v 18 Yahweh sent you on your way and said, 'Go and completely destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them
until they are destroyed.'
\v 19 Why then did you not obey the voice of Yaweh, but instead you seized the booty and did what was evil in
the sight of Yahweh?"
