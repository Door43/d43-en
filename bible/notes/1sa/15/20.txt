\v 20 Then Saul said to Samuel, "I have indeed obeyed the voice of Yahweh, and have gone on the way that Yahweh sent me. I have captured Agag, the king of Amalek, and have completely destroyed the Amalekites.
\v 21 But the people took some of the booty—sheep and oxen, the best of the things devoted to destruction, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God in Gilgal."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I have indeed obeyed the voice of Yahweh** - This is an emphatic statement. It is unclear if Saul thought this was true, or if he was simply making excuses for his sin. 
  * **the voice of Yahweh** - Here "voice" refers to the commands that Yahweh spoke. AT: "the things that Yahweh commanded" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Agag** - This is the name of the king of the Amalekites. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **But the people took** - This appears to be shifting the blame to the people.
  * **things devoted to destruction** - "animals that Yahweh commanded them to destroy"
  * **Gilgal** - This is the name of a place. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
