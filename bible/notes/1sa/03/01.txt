\p
\v 1 And the child Samuel ministered to Jehovah before Eli. And the word of Jehovah was precious in those days; there was no
frequent vision.
\v 2 And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to wax dim, so that he could
not see),
\v 3 and the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down to sleep, in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God was;
\v 4 that Jehovah called Samuel: and he said, Here am I.
