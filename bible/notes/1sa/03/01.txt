\v 1 While he was still a boy, Samuel was serving Yahweh while Eli supervised him. At that time there were very few messages that anyone received from Yahweh, and very few people saw visions that Yahweh gave them.
\p
\v 2 By that time Eli's eyes were very weak; he was almost blind. One night he was sleeping in his room,
\v 3 and Samuel was sleeping in the temple of Yahweh, where the sacred chest was kept. There was  a lamp there that represented the presence of God, and it was still burning.
\v 4 Just then Yahweh called, "Samuel! Samuel!" Samuel replied, "I am here!"

\c 3
\p
\v 1 The child Samuel served Yahweh under Eli. Yahweh's word was rare in those days; there was no frequent prophetic vision.
\v 2 At that time, when Eli, whose eyesight had begun to grow dim so that he could not see well, was lying down in his own bed.
\v 3 The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down to sleep in the temple of Yahweh, where the ark of God was.
\v 4 Yahweh called to Samuel, who said, "Here I am."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Yahweh's word was rare** - "Yahweh did not often speak to people"
  * **The lamp of God** - This is the seven-candle lampstand in the holy place of the tabernacle that burned every day and through the night until it was empty.
  * **the temple of Yahweh** - The "temple" was actually a tent, but it was where the people worshiped, so it is best to translate the word as "temple" here. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:1sa:01:09|1:9]].
