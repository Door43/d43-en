====== 1 Samuel 03 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This is the beginning of the story of Samuel, the [[:en:obe:kt:prophet|prophet]] God. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== God speaks to Samuel ==

God spoke at night to Samuel when he was a small boy telling him that he would punish Eli's family. As Samuel grew up, God gave him many messages and people came from all over Israel to find out what God had to say. 


=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metonymy == 

In order to show respect when talking to God, Samuel calls himself "your servant" when referring to himself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]).

== Idiom ==

One characteristic of prophecy is the use of figures of speech. In this passage that is realized by the use of two [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom|idioms]]: "ears will shake" meaning "will shock everyone who hears" and "carry out" meaning "do." 

In order to be sure Samuel would tell him the whole truth, Eli used the standard formula for a curse   "may God do to you, and more if" meaning "God will punish severely if the person does what the curse says he will do."
