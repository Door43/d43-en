\v 4 But the princes of the Philistines were angry with him; they said to him, "Make that man
go away, that he may go back to his place that you have given him; do not let him go with us into battle, so that he does not become an enemy to us in the battle. For how else could this fellow make peace with his master? Would it not be with the heads of our men?
