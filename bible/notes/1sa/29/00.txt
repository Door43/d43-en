====== 1 Samuel 29 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Many translations set apart quotations, prayers or songs. 29:5 is a song praising David. It has been set apart in the ULB through the use of indentation.

=== Other possible translation difficulties ===

It is unclear whether David wanted to go into battle with the Philistines. He would have been fighting against Saul, but he also would have been fighting against Israel's soldiers. It is probably best to see that David is conflicted over this issue, but some scholars believe that David planned on turning against the Philistines in the battle.
