\v 6 Then Achish called David and said to him, "As Yahweh lives, you have been good, and your going out and your coming
in with me in the army is good in my view; for I have nothing wrong with you since the day of your coming to me to this very day. Nevertheless, the princes are not favorable to you.
\v 7 So now return and go in peace, so that you do not displease the princes of the Philistines."
