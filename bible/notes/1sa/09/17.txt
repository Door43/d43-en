\v 17 And when Samuel saw Saul, Jehovah said to him, Behold, the man of whom I spoke to thee! this same shall have authority
over my people.
\v 18 Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer’s house is.
\v 19 And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer; go up before me to the high place, for you shall eat with me to-day:
and in the morning I will let you go, and will tell you all that is in your heart.
