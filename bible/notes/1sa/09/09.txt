\v 9-11 Saul said, "Very good, let's go talk to him." So they went to the town where the prophet lived. As they were going up the hill into the town, they met some young women who were coming out of the town to get some water from a well. One of them asked the women, "Is the seer in the town today?" They said that because previously, if people in Israel wanted a message from God, they would say, "Let's go to the seer," and people who now are called prophets were at that time called seers, or "those who see visions from God."

\v 9 (Formerly in Israel, when a man went to seek the knowledge of God's will, he said, "Come, let us go to the seer." For today's prophet was formerly called a seer.)
\v 10 Then Saul said to his servant, "Well said. Come, let us go." So they went to the city where the man of God was.
\p
\v 11 As they went up the hill to the city, they found young women coming out to draw water; Saul and his servant said to them, "Is the seer here?"
