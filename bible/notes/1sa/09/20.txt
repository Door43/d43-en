\v 20 As for your donkeys that were lost three days ago, do not worry about them, for they have been found. And on whom are all the desires of Israel set? Is it not on you and all your father's house?"
\v 21 Saul answered and said, "Am not I a Benjamite, from the smallest of the tribes of Israel? Is not my clan the least of all
the clans of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then have you spoken to me in this manner?"

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **And on whom...father's house?**  - This question is an expression of deep conviction that Israel wants Saul to be king. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Am not I a Benjamite...Why then have you spoken to me in this manner?**  - Saul is expressing surprise because small tribes often are not honored. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
