\v 7 Then Saul said to his servant, "But if we go, what can we bring the man? For the bread in our sack is gone, and there is no present to bring to the man of God. What do we have?"
\v 8 The servant answered Saul and said, "Here, I have with me one-fourth of a shekel of silver that I will give to the man of God, to tell us which way we should go."

  * **what can we bring the man?** - Giving a gift is a sign of respect for the man of God.
  * **man of God** - This phrase usually means a prophet of Yahweh. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:1sa:02:27|2:27]]. AT: "a man who hears and tells words from God"   
  * **one-fourth of a shekel** - "1/4 of a shekel." A shekel is a type of money used in the Old Testament. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bmoney]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_fraction]])
