===== Translation Notes: =====
Hannah begins to pray to Yahweh and Eli watches.


  * **Hannah rose up after** - "Hannah rose up and went to the house of Yahweh to pray after" It is implied that either Hannah's tent was next to the tabernacle tent or she walked from her tent to the tabernacle to pray. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Now Eli the priest** -  This word "Now" is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Here the author tells about a new person in the story. This person is the priest Eli. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **She was deeply distressed** - Hannah was deeply troubled or grieving because of not having any children and being ridiculed regularly by Peninnah her husband's other wife. (See: Explicit and Implicit)
