===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Hannah begins to pray to Yahweh, and Eli watches.


  * **Hannah rose up after** - Implicit information here can be made explicit. Either Hannah's tent was next to the tabernacle tent or she walked from her tent to the tabernacle to pray. AT: "Hannah rose up and went to the house of Yahweh to pray after" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Now Eli the priest** - "Now" is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Here the author tells about a new person in the story. This person is the priest Eli. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **the temple of Yahweh** - The "temple" was actually a tent, but it was where the people worshiped, so it is best to translate as "temple" here.
  * **She was deeply distressed** - Hannah was deeply troubled or grieved because of not having any children and being ridiculed regularly by Peninnah, her husband's other wife. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
