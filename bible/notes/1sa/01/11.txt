===== Translation Notes: =====
Hannah's prayer to Yahweh continues

  * **affliction of your servant**- This refers to Hannah being unable to become pregnant.
  * **call me to mind** - This is a special plea to God to take action on Hannah's behalf. Not to be mistaken with God not knowing or being aware of Hannah's situation.
  * ** do not forget your servant** - Hannah is repeating her plea for God not to ignore her request but to intervene in her life. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
