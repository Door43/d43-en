===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Hannah's prayer to Yahweh continues.

  * **affliction of your servant** - This refers to Hannah being unable to become pregnant.
  * **call me to mind** - This is a special plea to God to take action on Hannah's behalf. It should not be mistaken with God not knowing or being aware of Hannah's situation.
  * **do not forget your servant** - This phrase says in negative terms basically the same thing that the previous phrase says in positive terms. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
