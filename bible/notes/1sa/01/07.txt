\v 7 This happened every year. When they went up to the temple of Yahweh at Shiloh, Peninnah always ridiculed Hannah so much that Hannah cried and would not eat.
\v 8 Then Elkanah would say to her, "Hannah, why are you crying? Why are you eating nothing? You are so sad! Surely it is better for you to have me as your husband than to have even ten sons!"

\v 7 So year after year, when she went up to the house of Yahweh with her family, her rival always provoked her. Therefore she used to weep and eat nothing.
\v 8 Elkanah her husband always said to her, "Hannah, why do you weep? Why do you not eat? Why is your heart sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **her rival** - This is Peninnah, the other wife of Elkanah. A rival is someone who competes against another person. In this case Peninnah was competing against Hannah to try to get Elkanah to love her best. 
  * **Hannah, why do you weep? Why do you not eat? Why is your heart sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?** - These rhetorical questions can be translated as statements, if necessary. AT: "Hannah, you should not weep. You should eat, and your heart should be glad because I am better to you than ten sons!" or "You have little reason for sadness. I favor you and that should be enough." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **than ten sons** - Elkanah uses this expression to emphasize how important Hannah is to him. AT: "than any son could be" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
