\v 7 So year after year, when she went up to the house of Yahweh with her family, her rival always provoked her. Therefore she used to weep and eat nothing.
\v 8 Elkanah her husband always said to her, "Hannah, why do you weep? Why do you not eat? Why is your heart sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?"

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **her rival**  - This is Peninnah, the other wife of Elkanah. 
  * **Hannah, why do you weep? Why do you not eat? Why is your heart sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?** -  Elkanah knows the answers to these four questions, but asks them to make the point that she is his favored wife.  AT: "You have little reason for sadness I favor you and that should be enough." (See [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
