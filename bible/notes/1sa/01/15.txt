===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit** - "I am a woman who is deeply sad" 
  * **pouring out my soul before Yahweh** - This is an idiom that means "telling Yahweh my deepest emotions." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **your servant** - Hannah speaks of herself as if she were someone else to show her humility. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]])
  * **I have been speaking out of the abundance of my great concern and provocation** - This is another way of saying that she has a "sorrowful spirit," as in 1:15. The abstract nouns "abundance," "concern," and "provocation" can be translated as adjectives and verbs. AT: "I have been speaking because I am very sad, and my rival has greatly provoked me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **concern and provocation** - These words both mean that Hannah is sad and annoyed because her rival has been provoking her. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **concern** - Peninnah irritates and annoys her.
  * **provocation** - Hannah is referring to the grief and shame she feels because Peninnah is being cruel to her.
