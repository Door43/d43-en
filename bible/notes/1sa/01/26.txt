===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Oh, my master! As you live, my master** - Here the idiom "As you live" shows that Hannah is being sincere and truthful. AT: "Sir, what I am going to tell you is certainly true" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]) 
  * **has given me my petition which I asked of him** - Hannah speaks as if a petition were a physical object that one person could give another, and she speaks of a petition as if it were the answer to the petition that she made. The abstract noun "petition" can be translated as a verb phrase. AT: "has agreed to do what I solemnly requested that he do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **he is lent to Yahweh** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "I am loaning him to Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **he worshiped Yahweh** - Possible meanings: 1) "He" refers to Elkanah or 2) "he" is a synecdoche referring to both Elkanah and his family. AT: "Elkanah and his family" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
