\v 19 Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel; for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them
swords or spears:
\v 20 but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and
his mattock;
\v 21 yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to set the goads.
