\v 20 So whenever the Israelites needed to sharpen the blades of their plows, or picks, or axes, or sickles, they were forced to take those things to a Philistine man who could sharpen those things.
\v 21 They needed to pay about eight grams of silver for the sharpening of their plow blades and their picks. They needed to pay about four grams of silver for the sharpening of their axes or sickles, or to straighten the goads used to drive the oxen.

\v 19 No blacksmith could be found throughout all of Israel, because the Philistines said, "Otherwise the Hebrews would make swords or spears for themselves."
\v 20 But all the men of Israel used to go down to the Philistines, each to sharpen his plow points, his mattock, his axe, and
his sickle.
\v 21 The charge was two thirds of a shekel for the plow points, and the mattocks, and one third of a shekel for sharpening axes and for straightening the goads.
