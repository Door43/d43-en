\v 19 No blacksmith could be found throughout all of Israel, because the Philistines said, "Otherwise the Hebrews make swords or spears for themselves."
\v 20 But all the men of Israel used to go down to the Philistines, each to sharpen his plow points, his mattock, his axe, and
his sickle.
\v 21 The charge was two-thirds of a shekel for the plow points, and the mattocks, and a third of a shekel for sharpening axes and for setting the goads.
