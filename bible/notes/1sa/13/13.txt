\v 13 Samuel replied, "What you did was very foolish! You have not obeyed what Yahweh, your God, commanded \add about sacrifices\add*. If you had obeyed him, God would have allowed you and your descendants to rule \add Israel\add* for a long time.
\v 14 But now \add because of what you have done, you will die, and after you die\add*, none of your descendants will continue to rule. Yahweh is seeking for a man \add to be king\add* who be just the kind of person that he wants him to be, so that he can appoint him to be the leader of his people. Yahweh will do this because you have not obeyed what he commanded."

\v 13 Then Samuel said to Saul, "You have acted foolishly. You have not kept the command of Yahweh your God that he
gave you. For then Yahweh would have established your rule over Israel forever.
\v 14 But now your rule will not continue. Yahweh has sought out a man after his own heart, and Yahweh has appointed him to be prince over his people, because you have not obeyed what he commanded you."

===== Translation Notes: =====

Saul told Samuel why he had acted wrongfully as priest and given the offering.

  * **You have not kept the command of Yahweh** - Saul was to wait for Samuel to come and sacrifice the burn offering to God. Not perform the sacrifice himself.
  * **established your rule** - "set up your rule" or "authorized your rule" or "appointed your rule"
  * **a man after his own heart** - This phrase means "will follow his command," it uses "heart" to represent the desire or will of Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
