\v 13 Samuel replied, "What you did was very foolish! You have not obeyed what Yahweh, your God, commanded \add about sacrifices\add*. If you had obeyed him, God would have allowed you and your descendants to rule \add Israel\add* for a long time.
\v 14 But now \add because of what you have done, you will die, and after you die\add*, none of your descendants will continue to rule. Yahweh is seeking for a man \add to be king\add* who be just the kind of person that he wants him to be, so that he can appoint him to be the leader of his people. Yahweh will do this because you have not obeyed what he commanded."

\v 13 Then Samuel said to Saul, "You have acted foolishly. You have not kept the command of Yahweh your God that he
gave you. For then Yahweh would have established your rule over Israel forever.
\v 14 But now your rule will not continue. Yaweh has sought out a man after his own heart, and Yahweh has appointed him to be prince over his people, because you have not obeyed what he commanded you."
