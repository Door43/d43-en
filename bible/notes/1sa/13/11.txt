\v 12 So I thought, 'The Philistine army is going to attack us here at Gilgal, and I have not yet asked Yahweh to bless\f + \ft Or: help \f* us.' So I felt it was necessary to offer the burnt offerings \add to seek God's blessings\add*."

\v 11 Then Samuel said, "What have you done?" Saul replied, "When I saw that the people were leaving me, and that you did not come within the set time, and that the Philistines had assembled at Michmash,
\v 12 I said, 'Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the favor of Yahweh.' So I
forced myself to offer the burnt offering."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **What have you done** - Samuel was not really asking a question, but a rebuke to Saul, but Saul sought to defend his actions even though they were wrong. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Michmash** - See how you translated "Michmash" in [[en:bible:notes:1sa:13:01|13:02]].
