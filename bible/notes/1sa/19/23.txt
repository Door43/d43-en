\v 24 There he took off his \add outer\add* clothes, and he spoke messages from God in front of Samuel. He lay on the ground doing that all day and all night. That is the reason that \add when people see someone doing something that is very unexpected\add*, they say, "Is Saul also a prophet?" \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 23 While Saul was walking toward Naioth, the Spirit of God also came upon him. While he walked on, he shouted messages from Yahweh until he came to Naioth.
\v 24 There he took off his outer clothes, and he spoke messages from God in front of Samuel. He lay on the ground doing that all day and all night. That is the reason that when people see someone doing something that is very unexpected, they say, "Is Saul also a prophet?"

\v 23 Saul went to Naioth in Ramah. And the Spirit of God came upon him also, and as he went he prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.
\v 24 And he, too, stripped off his clothes, and he also prophesied before Samuel and lay naked all that day and all that night. Because of this they say, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"
