===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Michal helps David escape King Saul. She uses a household idol to make David's bed look like he is sleeping in it.
  * **she put a pillow of goats' hair at its head, and covered it with the clothes** - Possible meanings are 1) the head of the idol was lying on the goat's hair pillow and Michal dressed the idol in David's clothes or 2) Michal used David's clothes as a blanket to completely cover the idol and made the "pillow" of goat's hair look like David's hair sticking out from under the blanket of clothes.
