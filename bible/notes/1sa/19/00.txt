=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== God protects David ==
Jonathan persuades Saul not to kill David, but Saul again becomes jealous and orders his servants to bring David to him to be killed. God uses Michal to save David. David flees to Samuel and they begin prophesying. When Saul sends servants to capture David, they begin prophesying. This prompts Saul to go himself and he begins to prophesy. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:jealous]], [[:en:obe:kt:save]] and [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])
