\v 7 The Philistines were afraid; they said, "God has come into the camp." They said, "Woe to us! Nothing like this has happened before!
\v 8 Woe to us! Who will protect us from the strength of this mighty God? This is the God who attacked the Egyptians with many different kinds of plagues in the wilderness.
\v 9 Take courage, and be men, you Philistines, or you will become slaves to the Hebrews, as they have been slaves to you. Be men, and fight."

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Who will protect us from the strength of this mighty God?** - AT: "There is no one who can protect us from this mighty God." This question is an expression of deep emotion.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **be men**  - This is another way of saying be strong and fight.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
    * **you will become slaves to the Hebrews** - AT: "the Hebrews will make you their slaves by defeating you in battle."
    * **you will become slaves** - "You" means the Philistines themselves. They are rallying themselves by addressing themselves as if they were others.
