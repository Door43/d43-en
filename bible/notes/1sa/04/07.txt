\v 7 The Philistines were afraid; they said, "God has come into the camp." They said, "Woe to us! Nothing like this has happened before!
\v 8 Woe to us! Who will deliver us from the strength of this mighty God? This is the God who struck the Egyptians with
many different kinds of plagues in the wilderness.
\v 9 Take courage, and be men, you Philistines, or you will become slaves to the Hebrews, as they have been slaves to
you. Be men, and fight."
