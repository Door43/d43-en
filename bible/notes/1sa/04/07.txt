\v 7 The Philistines were afraid; they said, "A god has come into the camp." They said, "Woe to us! Nothing like this has happened before!
\v 8 Woe to us! Who will protect us from the strength of these mighty gods? These are the gods who attacked the Egyptians with many different kinds of plagues in the wilderness.
\v 9 Take courage, and be men, you Philistines, or you will become slaves to the Hebrews, as they have been slaves to you. Be men, and fight."

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **they said ... They said** - The second clause clearly refers to what the Philistines said to each other. The first clause probably refers to what they thought, though it could also refer to what they said to each other. If possible, avoid stating who was spoken to. AT: "they said to themselves ... They said to each other" or "they said to each other ... They said to each other"
  * **A god has come** - The Philistines worshiped many gods, so they probably believed that one of those gods, or one whom they did not worship, had come into the camp. Another possible meaning is that they were speaking the proper name of the God of Israel: "God has come." Because 4:8 speaks of "gods," some translations read, "Gods have come," that is, "It is gods who have come." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]])
  * **Who will protect us from the strength of these mighty gods?** - This question is an expression of deep fear. It can be written as a statement. AT: "There is no one who can protect us from these mighty gods." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **these mighty gods ... the gods who attacked** - Because the word "god" (or "God") in 4:7 is singular, many translations read "this mighty god ... the god who attacked," referring to any one of many possible gods, or "this mighty God ... the God who attacked," using the proper name of the God of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]])
  * **be men** - "be strong and fight" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
