\v 7 The Philistines were afraid; they said, "A god has come into the camp." They said, "Woe to us! Nothing like this has happened before!
\v 8 Woe to us! Who will protect us from the strength of these mighty gods? These are the gods who attacked the Egyptians with many different kinds of plagues in the wilderness. 
\v 9 Take courage, and be men, you Philistines, or you will become slaves to the Hebrews, as they have been slaves to you. Be men, and fight."

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **The Philistines were afraid; they said** - The Philistines are speaking to themselves. They are rallying themselves by addressing themselves as if they were talking to someone else.
  * **Woe to us! Nothing like this has happened before! Woe to us! Who will protect us from the strength of this mighty God?** - This is parallelism in which the second sentence strengthens the meaning of the first. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Who will protect us from the strength of this mighty God?** - This question is an expression of deep fear. It can be written as a statement. AT: "There is no one who can protect us from this mighty God." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **be men** - This is another way of saying be strong and fight. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
