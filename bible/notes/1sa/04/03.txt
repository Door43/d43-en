\v 4 So the soldiers did that.

\v 3 When the people came into the camp, the elders of Israel said, "Why has Yahweh defeated us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the testimony of Yahweh here from Shiloh, that it may be here with us, that it might keep us safe from the power of our enemies."
\v 4 So the people sent men to Shiloh; from there they carried the ark of the testimony of Yahweh of hosts, who sits above the cherubim.  The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the testimony of God.
