===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **He had eight sons** - Here the word "He" refers to Jesse.
    * **Jesse was an old man...advanced in years among men** - The two phrases mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **second to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah** - This phrase shows birth order. AT: "Abinadab the second born, and Shammah the third born"
