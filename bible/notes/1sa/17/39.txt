\v 39 David strapped his sword on his armor. But he was not able to walk, because he had not trained with them. Then David said to Saul, "I cannot go out to fight with these, for I have not trained with them." So David put them off.
\v 40 He took his staff in his hand and chose five smooth stones out of the brook; he put them in his shepherdâ€™s pouch. His sling was in his hand as he approached the Philistine.
