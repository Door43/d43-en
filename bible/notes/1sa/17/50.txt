===== translationNotes: =====


  * **He hit the Philistine and killed him** - This is a summary statement. The details are that he first used a sling and then used a sword in. Some languages do not use summary statements like this. In those situations, translators may restructure the verses as they are in the UDB.
  * **took his sword** - Here "his" refers to Goliath.
