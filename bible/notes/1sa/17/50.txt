===== translationNotes: =====


  * **David defeated ... He hit ... killed ... There was no sword in David's hand** - Verse 50 is a summary of David's amazing victory over Goliath. The details about how he hit and killed Goliath are in [[en:bible:notes:1sa:17:48|17:49]] and 17:51. Some languages do not use summary statements like this. In those situations, translators may restructure the verses as they are in the UDB.
  * **Then David ran and stood over the Philistine** - David did this after Goliath fell to the ground in [[en:bible:notes:1sa:17:48|17:49]].
  * **took his sword** - "took the Philistine's sword." Here the word "his" refers to Goliath.
