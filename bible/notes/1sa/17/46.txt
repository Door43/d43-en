\v 46 Today Yahweh will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you and remove your head from your body. Today I will give
the dead bodies of the Philistine army to the birds of the heavens and to the wild beasts of the earth, so that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,
\v 47 and that all this gathering may know that Yahweh does not deliver with sword or spear. For the battle is Yahweh's, and he
will give you into our hand."
