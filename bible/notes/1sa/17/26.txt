\v 26 David talked to some of the men who were standing near him. He said, "This Philistine—this uncircumcised man—should not be mocking the all-powerful God. What will be given to the person who kills this Philistine and stops him from shaming us Israelites?"

\v 27 The men told him the same thing that the other men had said, about what the king would do for anyone who killed Goliath.

\v 26 David said to the men who stood by him, "What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the disgrace from Israel? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?"
\v 27 Then the people repeated what they had been saying and told him, "So it will be done for the man who kills him."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **What will be done ... the disgrace from Israel?** - David asks this question to confirm the truth of what the men said in the previous verse.
  * **Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?** - This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "This uncircumcised Philistine certainly has no power that he should defy the armies of the living God!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **this uncircumcised Philistine** - This phrase as an insult and indicates that Goliath does not belong to the living God.
