\v 28 But when David's oldest brother Eliab heard David talking to the men, he was angry. He said to David, "Why have you come down here? Is someone taking care of those few sheep that you left in the desert? I know you are just a smart-aleck\f + \ft Or: brat \f*! You just want to watch the battle!"
\p
\v 29 David replied, "Have I done something wrong? I was merely asking a question!"
\v 30 Then he walked over to another man and asked him the same question, but the man gave him the same answer. Each time he asked someone, he received the same answer.

\v 28 Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men. Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, "Why did you come down here? With whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride, and the mischief in your heart; for you have come down here so that you might see the battle."
\v 29 David said, "What have I done now? Was it not just a question?"
\v 30 He turned away from him toward another, and spoke in the same way. The people answered the same thing as before.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Eliab's anger was kindled against David** - Here anger is spoken of as if it were a fire that could be kindled.  AT: "Eliab became angry with David" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Why did you come down here?** - Eliab uses this question to show that he is angry that David came down. He was probably implying that David did not have a good reason for coming. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **With whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness?** - Eliab uses this question to insult David by making his work seem unimportant and by accusing him of not taking care of his father's sheep. AT: "You simply had the responsibility of watching over a few sheep in the wilderness. You could not even carry out that simple responsibility!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **your pride, and the mischief in your heart** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **What have I done now? Was it not just a question?** - David used these questions to express his frustration and to justify himself. AT: "I have done nothing wrong. I was only asking a question." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **He turned away from him** - "He" refers to David and the word "him" refers to Eliab.
