\v 43 He said to David, "Are you coming to me with a stick because \add you think that\add* I am a dog?" Then he called out to his gods to harm David.

\v 41 The Philistine came and approached David, with his shield bearer in front of him.
\v 42 When the Philistine looked around and saw David, he despised him, for he was only a boy, and ruddy, with a handsome appearance.
\v 43 Then the Philistine said to David, "Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?" And the Philistine cursed David by
his gods.
