\v 42 he looked at David closely. He saw that David had a handsome face and healthy body, but that he was only a young man. So he sneered at David.
\v 43 He said to David, "Are you coming to me with a stick because \add you think that\add* I am a dog?" Then he called out to his gods to harm David.

\v 41 And the Philistine came on and drew near to David; and the man that bare the shield went before him.
\v 42 And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and withal of a
fair countenance.
\v 43 And the Philistine said to David, Am I a dog, that you come to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by
his gods.
