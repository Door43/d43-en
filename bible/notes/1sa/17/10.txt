===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I challenge the ranks of Israel** - Here "ranks" is a synecdoche that refers to any solider. This is an insulting boast that challenges any soldier in the army of Israel to battle. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **they were discouraged and greatly afraid** - The words "discouraged" and "greatly afraid" mean basically the same thing and emphasize the intensity of their fear. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
