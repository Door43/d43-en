===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **I challenge the ranks of Israel** - This is an insulting boast that challenges any soldier in the army of Israel to battle.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
    * **they were discouraged and greatly afraid** - The words "discouraged" and "greatly afraid" mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
