\v 8 Please be kind to me. Yahweh heard you when you made a solemn agreement with me that you and I will always be good friends. But if I deserve to be punished, you should kill me yourself, rather than allow your father to punish me."
\p
\v 9 Jonathan replied, "I will never do that! If I ever find out that my father is determined to harm you, I will certainly tell you."

<usfm>
\v 8 Therefore deal kindly with your servant. For you have brought your servant into a covenant of Yahweh with you. But if there is sin in me, kill me yourself; for why then should you bring me to your father?"
\v 9 Jonathan said, "Far be it from you! If I learned my father decided harm to come upon you, would I not tell you?"

===== Translation Notes: =====

David continues speaking to Jonathan.

  * **you have brought your servant into a covenant of Yahweh with you** - AT: "you have made a covenant with me, your servant, with Yahweh as witness"
  * **for why then should you bring me to your father?** - AT: "then there would be no reason for you to bring me to your father." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Far be it from you!** - AT: "This will never happen to you!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **would I not tell you?** - Jonathan uses this question to emphasize that he would tell David if Saul wanted to harm him. AT: "I would certainly tell you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
