<usfm>
\v 14 If I am still alive, will you not show me the covenant faithfulness of Yahweh, that I may not die?
\v 15 Do not cut off your covenant faithfulness from my house foreverâ€”not even when Yahweh cuts off every one of the enemies of David from the face of the earth."
\v 16 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David and said, "May Yahweh require an accounting from the hand of the enemies of David."
