\v 20 I will come out and shoot three arrows as though I were trying to shoot at a target. \add The arrows will hit the ground\add* close to the pile of stones.
\v 21 Then I will send a boy to bring the arrows back to me. If you hear me say to him, 'They are closer to me', then as surely as Yahweh lives, you will know that everything is fine, \add and that you will not be killed\add*.

<usfm>
\v 20 I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I were shooting at a target.
\v 21 And I will send my young man and say to him, 'Go find the arrows.' If I say to the young boy, 'Look, the arrows are on this side of you; get them," then come; for there will be safety for you and not harm, as Yahweh lives.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jonathan continues to speak to David.

  * **to the side of it** - Here the word "it" refers to the stone by which David is hiding.
  * **my young man...the young boy** - These refer to the same person.
  * **Look** - AT: “Listen” or “Pay attention to what I am about to tell you”
  * **then come** - "then you, David, come"
