\v 20 I will come out and shoot three arrows as though I were trying to shoot at a target. \add The arrows will hit the ground\add* close to the pile of stones.

<usfm>
\v 20 I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I were shooting at a target.
\v 21 And I will send my young man and say to him, 'Go find the arrows.' If I say to the young boy, 'Look, the arrows are on this side of you; get them," then come; for there will be safety for you and not harm, as Yahweh lives.
