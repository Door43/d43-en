\p
\v 1 Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah and came and said to Jonathan, "What have I done? What is my iniquity? What is my sin before your father, that he seeks to take my life?"
\v 2 Jonathan said to David, "Far from it; you will not die. My father does nothing either great or small without telling it to me.  Why should my father hide this thing from me? It is not so."
