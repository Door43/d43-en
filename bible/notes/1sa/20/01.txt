\v 2 Jonathan replied, "My father is surely not trying to kill you! He always tells me before he does anything that he is planning.

\p
\v 1 Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah and came and said to Jonathan, "What have I done? What is my iniquity? What is my sin before your father, that he seeks to take my life?"
\v 2 Jonathan said to David, "Far from it; you will not die. My father does nothing either great or small without telling it to me.  Why should my father hide this thing from me? It is not so."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **What have I done? What is my iniquity? What is my sin before your father, that he seeks to take my life?** - These three questions mean basically the same thing. David uses them to emphasize that he has done nothing wrong to Saul. AT: "I have done nothing wrong. I have not committed any iniquity. I have not sinned against your father, that he seeks to take my life." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **that he seeks to take my life?** - AT: "that he is trying to kill me?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Far from it** - AT: "This is certainly not true" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **nothing either great or small** - AT: "nothing at all" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **Why should my father hide this thing from me?** - Jonathan uses this question to emphasize that Saul would have told him if he planned to kill David. AT: "My father has no reason to hide this thing from me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **It is not so** - "It is not true"
