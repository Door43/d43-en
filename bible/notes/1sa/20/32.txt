\v 32 Jonathan answered Saul his father, "For what reason should he be put to death? What has he done?"
\v 33 Then Saul threw his spear at him to kill him. So Jonathan knew that his father was determined to put David to death.
\v 34 Jonathan got up from the table in fierce anger and ate no food the second day of the month, for he was grieved over David, because his father had dishonored him.
