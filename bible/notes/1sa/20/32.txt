\v 32 And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, Wherefore should he be put to death? what has he done?
\v 33 And Saul cast his spear at him to strike him; whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to put David to
death.
\v 34 So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no food the second day of the month; for he was grieved for
David, because his father had done him shame.
