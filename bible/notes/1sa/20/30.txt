\v 30 Then Saul’s anger burned against Jonathan, and he said to him, "You son of a perverse, rebellious woman! Do I not
know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness?
\v 31 For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Now then,
send and bring him to me, for he must surely die."
