\v 28 Jonathan answered Saul, "David earnestly asked permission from me to go to Bethlehem.
\v 29 He said, 'Please let me go. For our family has a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has ordered me to be there. Now, if I have found favor in your eyes, please let me go and see my brothers.' For this reason he has not come to the king's table."
