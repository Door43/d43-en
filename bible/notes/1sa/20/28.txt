\v 28 Jonathan answered Saul, "David earnestly asked permission from me to go to Bethlehem.
\v 29 He said, 'Please let me go. For our family has a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has ordered me to be there. Now, if I have found favor in your eyes, please let me go and see my brothers.' For this reason he has not come to the king's table."

  * **the king's table** - Jonathan speaks of Saul as if he is another person to show that he respects Saul. AT: "your table" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]])
