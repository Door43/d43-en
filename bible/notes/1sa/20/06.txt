\v 6 If your father asks why I am not there at the festival, say to him, 'David requested me to allow him to go to his home in Bethlehem, where his family will offer the sacrifice that they offer every year.'
\v 7 If your father says 'That is okay', then I know I will be safe. But if he becomes extremely angry, you will know that he is determined to harm me.

\v 6 If your father misses me at all, then say, 'David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city; because it is the yearly sacrifice there for the whole family.'
\v 7 If he says, 'It is well,' your servant will have peace. But if he is very angry, then know that he has decided on evil.
