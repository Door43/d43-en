\v 41 As soon as the young man was gone, David stood up from the south side, lay facedown on the ground, and bowed himself three times. They kissed one another and wept together, with David weeping the more.
\v 42 Jonathan said to David, "Go in peace, because we have both sworn in the name of Yahweh and said, 'May Yahweh be between you and me, and between my descendants and your descendants, forever.'" Then David stood up and left, and Jonathan returned to the city.

  * ** lay facedown on the ground, and bowed himself three times.** - David bowed before Jonathan who was still the King's son, worthy of such respect. Also, this was the last time David met with Jonathan.
  * **between you and me** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:1sa:20:22|v. 23]].
