\v 41 As soon as the young man was gone, David stood up from behind the mound, lay facedown on the ground, and bowed himself three times. They kissed one another and wept together, with David weeping the more.
\f + \ft The Hebrew text reads, \fqa David came out from beside the south. \fqa* Modern versions interpret this passage in different ways because the Hebrew text is difficult to understand. \f*
\v 42 Jonathan said to David, "Go in peace, because we have both sworn in the name of Yahweh and said, 'May Yahweh be between you and me, and between my descendants and your descendants, forever.'" Then David stood up and left, and Jonathan returned to the city.
