If he is saying good things about you, I will certainly send a message to you to tell that to you.
\v 13 But if he is planning to hurt you, I hope that Yahweh will punish me very severely if I do not tell you in advance and help you flee, so that you might go away in safety. I hope that Yahweh will be with you and help you like he has helped my father.

\v 12 Jonathan said to David, "May Yahweh, the God of Israel, be
witness. When I have questioned my father around this time tomorrow,
or the third day, see, if there is good will toward David, will I not then send to you and make it known to you?
\v 13 If it pleases my father to do you harm, may Yahweh do to Jonathan and more also if I do not make it known to you and
send you away, so that you may go in peace. May Yahweh be with you, as he has been with my father.
