\v 12 And Jonathan said to David, Jehovah, the God of Israel, be
witness: when I have sounded my father about this time to-morrow,
or the third day, behold, if there be good toward David, shall I not then send to thee, and disclose it to thee?
\v 13 Jehovah do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my father to do you evil, if I disclose it not to you, and
send you away, that you may go in peace: and Jehovah be with you, as he has been with my father.
