\v 17 One day Saul said to David, "I am ready to give you my oldest daughter, Merab, to be your wife. I will do that if you serve me bravely by fighting battles for Yahweh \add against the Philistines\add*". He said that because he thought, "I will not try to get rid of David by myself. I will allow the Philistines to do that."
\p
\v 18 But David said to Saul, "I am not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* a very important person, and my family is not very important, and my clan is not a very important Israelite clan. So I do not deserve to become your son-in-law." \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 17 Then Saul said to David, "Here is my oldest daughter Merab. I will give her to you as a wife. Only be courageous for me and fight Yahweh's battles." For Saul thought, "Let not my hand be on him, but let the hand of the Philistines be on him."
\v 18 David said to Saul, "Who am I, and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?"

  * **Let not my hand be on him, but let the hand of the Philistines be on him** - Here "hand" is a metonymy refers to not to harm him. "I will not harm him, but I will let the Philistines harm him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Who am I, and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel ... to the king?** - This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "I am nobody and neither my life nor my father's family is important enough in Israel ... to the king." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **be son-in-law to the king** - "be husband of the king's daughter"
