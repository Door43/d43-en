\v 17 One day Saul said to David, "I am ready to give you my oldest daughter, Merab, to be your wife. I will do that if you serve me bravely by fighting battles for Yahweh \add against the Philistines\add*". He said that because he thought, "I will not try to get rid of David by myself. I will allow the Philistines to do that."

\v 18 But David said to Saul, "I am not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* a very important person, and my family is not very important, and my clan is not a very important Israelite clan. So I do not deserve to become your son-in-law." \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 18 David said to Saul, "Who am I, and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?"
