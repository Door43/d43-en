\v 17 One day Saul said to David, "I am ready to give you my oldest daughter, Merab, to be your wife. I will do that if you serve me bravely by fighting battles for Yahweh \add against the Philistines\add*". He said that because he thought, "I will not try to get rid of David by myself. I will allow the Philistines to do that."
\p
\v 18 But David said to Saul, "I am not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* a very important person, and my family is not very important, and my clan is not a very important Israelite clan. So I do not deserve to become your son-in-law." \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 17 Then Saul said to David, "Here is my oldest daughter Merab. I will give her to you as a wife. Only be courageous for me and fight Yahweh's battles." For Saul thought, "Let not my hand be on him, but let the hand of the Philistines be on him."
\v 18 David said to Saul, "Who am I, and who are my relatives, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Let not my hand be on him, but let the hand of the Philistines be on him** - Harming someone is spoken of as if it were placing one's hand on that person. Here, Saul is referring to killing David. AT: "I will not be the one to kill him; I will let the Philistines kill him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **Who am I, and who are my relatives, or my father's family in Israel ... to the king?** - David uses this rhetorical question to emphasize that he is not worthy of being Saul's son-in-law. AT: "I am nobody and neither my relatives nor my father's family are important enough in Israel ... to the king." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **son-in-law to the king** - "husband of the king's daughter"
