\v 20 But Michal, Saul's daughter, loved David. They told Saul, and this pleased him.
\v 21 Then Saul thought, "I will give her to him, so that she can be a trap for him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him." So Saul said to David a second time, "You will be my son-in-law."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Michal ... loved David** - Here "loved" means she had romantic feelings for David. 
  * **They told Saul** - Here "they" refers to people who found out about Michal's feelings, not to David and Michal.
  * **the hand of the Philistines** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:1sa:18:17|18:17]].
  * **You will be my son-in-law** - "You will be the husband of my daughter"
