\v 10 The next day a harmful spirit from God rushed upon Saul. And he raved within the house. So David played his instrument, as he did each day. Saul had his spear in his hand.
\v 11 Saul threw the spear, for he thought, "I will pin David to the wall." But David escaped from Saul's presence twice in this way.
\v 12 Saul was afraid of David, because Yahweh was with him, but was no longer with Saul.
