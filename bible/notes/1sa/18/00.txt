====== 1 Samuel 18 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===
 
This is the first chapter of a section explaining why Saul wanted to kill David. 

Many translations set apart quotations, prayers or songs. 18:7 is a song praising David. It has been set apart in the ULB through the use of indentation.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Saul is jealous of David's popularity ==
Saul's son, Jonathan, loves David. David is successful in battling the Philistines and Saul is happy until the women give David more attention than they give him. He fears that David will replace him as king. This is potentially confusing because the author has already established that David will be the next king. It is probably that he feared David would kill him on order to be the next king sooner or that he did not really believe David would be the next king. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:love]])


=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Jonathan's love of David ==
Some scholars believe Jonathan loved David as a man loves his wife. There is no reason to translate this as if Jonathan was a "homosexual." Instead, treat this as a brotherly type of love.
