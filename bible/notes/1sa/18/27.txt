\v 27  Before those days had
expired, David went with his men and killed two hundred Philistines. David brought their foreskins,
and they gave them in full number to the king, so that he might be the king’s son-in-law. So Saul gave him Michal his daughter as his
wife.
\v 28 And Saul saw and knew that Yahweh was with David. Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved him.
\v 29 Saul was even more afraid of David. Saul was continually David’s enemy.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Before those days had expired** - David had a set amount of time to finish his task
    * **two hundred** - "200" (See: Translate Numbers)
    * **and they gave them in full number to the king** - Here "they" could refer to David's soldiers, but it is unclear. AT: "and gave them all to the king" (See: Ambiguity)
    * **son-in-law** See how you translated this in 18:18.
    * **saw and knew**  - These two words share similar meanings and are combined for emphasis. (See: Doublet)
    * **Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved him**  - See how you translated "loved" in 18:20.
