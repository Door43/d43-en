\v 20 \add It is as though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* you died with Christ. So \add you no longer have to obey\add* elementary regulations\f + \ft Or: rules \f* \add that are concerned merely with what is external\f + \ft Or: physical \f*, just like a dead person no longer has to do anything\add*. So, do not submit to regulations\f + \ft Or: rules \f*
\v 21 such as 'Do not handle \add certain things\add*,' 'Do not taste \add certain things\add*,' 'Do not touch \add certain things\add*,' as if you still had to obey such regulations\f + \ft Or: rules \f*.
\v 22 All those things are intended to cease to exist when we use them. \add And do not submit to such regulations\f + \ft Or: rules \f*\add*, because they are what mere human teachers command and teach.
\v 23 \add Do not obey such\add* regulations\f + \ft Or: rules \f* because they only cause people to do what their self-directed nature wants to do. \add Those regulations\add* seem to be wise because they \add urge people to\add* worship as mere human teachers have decided. \add They urge\add* that \add people\add* should humiliate themselves, and that \add people\add* should treat their bodies harshly. But those regulations\f + \ft Or: rules \f* do not help \add people\add* at all to not do the sinful things that their self-directed nature wants to do.

<usfm>
\v 20 God considers that you died with Christ when he died. So now the spirits and all the rules that people make for how to please God: none of these things rule you anymore. So why are you still living as if these things were real? Why do you still obey those things?
\v 21 These rules are such as: "Do not handle certain things. Do not taste certain things. Do not touch certain things." Do not think you still have to obey such regulations.
\v 22 These rules are all about things that perish in this world as people use them.
\v 23 These rules may seem to be good. But people made them because they were trying to honor God. That is why they often look so humble; that is why they often hurt their own bodies. But if we obey these rules, we do not really stop wanting to sin.

\p
\v 20 If you died together with Christ to the sinful belief systems of the world, why do you live in submission to the world's beliefs:
\v 21 "Do not handle, nor taste, nor touch"?
\v 22 These are the commandments and teachings of people about things that all perish with use.
\v 23 These rules have the "wisdom" of man-made religion and false humility and ascetic treatment of the body, but have no value against the indulgence of the flesh.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **If you died together with Christ to the sinful belief systems of the world**  - This metaphor shows that just as a person who dies physically no longer needs to obey the physical demands of this world (breath, eat, sleep), a person who dies spiritually with Christ no longer needs to obey the spiritual demands of the world system. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **why do you live in submission to the world's beliefs** - Paul used this question to rebuke the Colossians for following the false beliefs of the world. AT: "stop submitting yourself to the world's beliefs!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **live in submission to**  - "submit to" or "give in to" or "obey."
  * **perish**  - "decay"
  * **These rules have the "wisdom" of man-made religion and false humility and ascetic treatment of the body**  - "These rules seem wise from a human point of view by having the appearance of humility and harsh treatment of the body."
  * **ascetic**  - "severe" or "harsh" or "grim"
  * **have no value against the indulgence of the flesh **  - "they do not help you stop following your human desires."
