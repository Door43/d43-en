\v 13 And specifically, you \add who are non-Jews\add*, because of your sins, you were \add spiritually\add* dead \add before you trusted in Christ\add*. You were uncircumcised \add spiritually;\add* that is, your self-directed nature controlled you. Nevertheless, it was you whom God caused to become alive \add spiritually\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* with Christ. And specifically, God forgave us all our sins.
\v 14 \add It is just\add* as \add though\add* he canceled the document\f + \ft Or: paper \f* \add that stated\add* \add the charges\add* against us\f + \ft Or: the sins \add that we had committed\add* \f* for which \add God\add* will punish us. And \add it was just\add* as \add though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* it was that document, Or: paper that he removed by nailing it to the cross \add when they nailed Christ on the cross\add*.

\v 13 God viewed you as being dead, because you were sinning against him, and because you were not Jews, so you did not worship him. But he made you come alive together with Christ; he forgave us of all our sins.
\v 14 We have all sinned so much, but God has forgiven our sins. It is like a man might forgive people who owe him money, so he tears up the papers they signed when he loaned them the money. But as for God, it is as if he had nailed those papers on which he had written all our sins and all the laws that we had broken to the cross on which Christ died.
\v 15 Moreover, God defeated the evil spirit beings who rule people in this world, and he let everybody know that he had defeated them. It was just as if he had paraded them around in the streets as prisoners.

\v 14 He canceled the written record of debts that stood against us with its regulations. He took it away by nailing it to the cross.
\v 15 He disarmed the powers and authorities and made a public spectacle of them, by being victorious over them by the cross.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **When you were dead** - Paul speaks of unresponsiveness to God as if it were death. AT: "When you Colossian believers were unable to respond to God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you were dead ... he made you alive** - With this metaphor Paul speaks of coming into new spiritual life as if it were coming back to life physically. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **dead in your trespasses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh** - You were dead on two accounts: 1) you were spiritually dead, living a life of sin against Christ and 2) you were not circumcised according to the law of Moses.
  * **forgave us all of our trespasses** - "he forgave us, both us Jews and you Gentiles, of all our trespasses"
  * **He canceled the written record of debts that stood against us** - Paul speaks of the way God forgives our sins as if it were the way a person, to whom many people owe money or goods, destroys the record of that debt so they do not have to pay him back. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **made a public spectacle of them** - In Roman times, it was common practice for the Roman armies to have a victory parade when they returned home, displaying all the prisoners they had captured and goods they had obtained. God was victorious over the  evil powers and authorities. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **by the cross** - Here "the cross" stands for Christ's death on the cross. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
