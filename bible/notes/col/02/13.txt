\v 13 And specifically, you \add who are non-Jews\add*, because of your sins, you were \add spiritually\add* dead \add before you trusted in Christ\add*. You were uncircumcised \add spiritually;\add* that is, your self-directed nature controlled you. Nevertheless, it was you whom God caused to become alive \add spiritually\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* with Christ. And specifically, God forgave us all our sins.
\v 14 \add It is just\add* as \add though\add* he canceled the document\f + \ft Or: paper \f* \add that stated\add* \add the charges\add* against us\f + \ft Or: the sins \add that we had committed\add* \f* for which \add God\add* will punish us. And \add it was just\add* as \add though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* it was that document, Or: paper that he removed by nailing it to the cross \add when they nailed Christ on the cross\add*.
\v 15 And specifically, God defeated the \add evil\add* spirit beings that rule, and he demonstrated\f + \ft Or: showed \f* that publicly; that is, he triumphed over them as a result of what \add Christ did\add*.

\v 13 God viewed you as being dead, because you were sinning against him, and because you were not Jews, so you did not worship him. But he made you come alive together with Christ; he forgave us of all our sins.
\v 14 We have all sinned so much, but God has forgiven our sins. It is like a man might forgive people who owe him money, so he tears up the papers they signed when he lent them the money. But as for God, it is as if he had nailed those papers on which he had written all our sins and all the laws that we had broken to the cross on which Christ died.
\v 15 Moreover, God defeated the evil spirit beings who rule people in this world, and he let everybody know that he had defeated them. It was just as if he had paraded them around in the streets as prisoners!

<usfm>
\v 13 And when you were dead in your trespasses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, he made you alive together with him and forgave us all of our trespasses.
\v 14 He erased the written record of debts charged against us and the supporting regulations. He removed it all and nailed it to the cross.
\v 15 He removed the governments and authorities, and he openly exposed them and led them in a victory procession by means of his cross.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **When you were dead** - "When you Colossian believers were spiritually dead"
  * **dead in your trespasses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh ** -  you were dead on two accounts, 1) you were spiritually dead living a life of of sin against Christ and 2) you were not circumcised according to the law of Moses.
  * **he made you** - "Jesus Christ made you Colossian believers"
  * **forgave us all of our trespasses** - "Jesus Christ forgave us, both us Jews and you Gentiles, of all our trespasses"
  * **you were dead...he made you alive** - This metaphor shows how coming from a sinful life into a new spiritual life is like a dead person coming back to life physically. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **He erased the written record of debts charged against us and the supporting regulations** - This metaphor compares how God can take away our sins (debts) and pardon us for breaking God's laws (regulations) just as a person can erase items written on a paper list. (See:[[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **led them in a victory procession** - In Roman times, is was common practice for the roman armies to have a "victory parade" when they return home, displaying all the prisoners they captured and goods obtained.
