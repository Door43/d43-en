\v 18 Disregard those who say that God will punish you because \add you do not worship God in the way that\add* they say \add that you should\add*; that is, they insist that you should humiliate yourselves and that you should worship the angels. \add Disregard such people\add* since they base their authority on things that they have never seen, and since they are proud without reason because their self-directed nature \add controls\add* what they think,
\v 19 and since they do not teach the true teaching about Christ \f + \ft metaphor \f*\add . Christ is the one who causes all of his people to develop\f + \ft Or: grow \f* spiritually as God plans that they should develop\f + \ft Or: grow \f*, just like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a person's head directs how his body grows, as it is held together by its joints and ligaments.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 Do not let people prevent God from saving you by convincing you to believe what they say and that you must behave very humbly and worship angels. These people are always talking about visions they say God has made them see. They boast about these things because they think like people everywhere think who do not honor God.
\v 19 Such persons are not joined to Christ. But he is like the head of a body, and that body is all those who believe in him. The whole body depends upon the head. The bones and ligaments hold the body together, but it is God that makes it grow, and it is the head that gives it what it needs.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 Let no one be robbed of a prize by desiring a false humility and by worship of angels. Such a person obsesses about things he has seen and becomes proud without cause by his fleshly thinking.
\v 19 He does not hold on to Christ, the head, from whom the whole body is supplied and held together through joints and ligaments, and the body grows as God provides the growth.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Let no one be robbed of a prizeâ€‹**  - "Let no one be cheated out of their prize." This metaphor compares people who teach false humility and worshiping of angels to robbers who steal the Colossians' salvation. AT: "Do not let anyone steal someone's reward." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]], [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **false humility**  - "voluntary humility." Doing things that make you appear to be humble to others. AT: "pious self-denial."
  * **obsesses about things**  - Having thoughts that constantly control the mind or being excessively preoccupied with something.
  * **fleshly thinking**  - Thinking as a natural or sinful person rather than as a spiritual person.
  * **hold on to**  - "firmly grasp" or "cling to" just as a child firmly holds on to his parent.
  * **Christ, the head, from whom the whole body is supplied and held together through joints and ligaments**  -This metaphor compares the authority of Christ over the Church to a human head which controls and governs all of the body. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
