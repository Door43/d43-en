\v 18 Disregard those who say that God will punish you because \add you do not worship God in the way that\add* they say \add that you should\add*; that is, they insist that you should humiliate yourselves and that you should worship the angels. \add Disregard such people\add* since they base their authority on things that they have never seen, and since they are proud without reason because their self-directed nature \add controls\add* what they think,
\v 19 and since they do not teach the true teaching about Christ \f + \ft metaphor \f*\add . Christ is the one who causes all of his people to develop\f + \ft Or: grow \f* spiritually as God plans that they should develop\f + \ft Or: grow \f*, just like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a person's head directs how his body grows, as it is held together by its joints and ligaments.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 Do not let people prevent God from saving you by convincing you to believe what they say--that you must behave very humbly and worship angels. These people are always talking about visions they say God has made them see. They boast about these things because they think like people everywhere think who do not honor God.
\v 19 Such persons are not joined to Christ. But he is like the head of a body, and that body is all those who believe in him. The whole body depends upon the head. The bones and ligaments hold the body together, but it is God that makes it grow, and it is the head that gives it what it needs.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 Let no one be robbed of a prize by desiring a false humility and by worship of angels. Such a person obsesses about things he has seen and becomes proud without cause by his fleshly thinking.
\v 19 He does not hold on to Christ, the head, from whom the whole body is supplied and held together through joints and ligaments, and the body grows as God provides the growth.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **robbed of a prize​ **- This is a metaphor showing the loss of a spiritual reward can result from being deceived by false teachers just like someone <font 14px line-height: 19.6000003814697px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>on earth</font>    being disqualified from a contest because they did not follow the rules. (See metaphor)
  * **false humility **- This phrase indicates doing things that make you appear to be humble to others rather than true humility. The literal Greek translation is "voluntary humility" and it could be translated "pious self-denial".
  * **obsesses **- This word means thoughts that constantly control your mind or something you cannot stop thinking about.
  * **fleshly thinking **- Thinking as a natural person rather than as a spiritual person.
  * **hold on to **- Keeping the mind on Christ and his provision, just as a child holds on to their parent.
  * **Christ, the head, from whom the whole body is supplied and held together through joints and ligaments **- This is a metaphor to show that Christ provides for His church and holds it together just as the head of a physical body directs the functioning of the entire human body. (See metaphor)
