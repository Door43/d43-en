====== Colossians 02:6-7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 In a way that is consistent\f + \ft Or: in harmony \f* with \add the message that\add* you received about Christ Jesus, who is our Lord, conduct yourselves as you should, since you have a close relationship with such a one as he is.
\v 7 Specifically, continue believing and practicing \f + \ft metaphor, doublet \f* what you were first taught about Christ. Continue to do this more and more; continue to be sure about all the true teaching, just like \add Epaphras\add* taught it to you. And continue thanking \add God, our Father\add*, very much \add for all that he has done for you\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 You began to believe in Christ Jesus the Lord by trusting in him, so also live by trusting him.
\v 7 You should rely completely on Christ Jesus the Lord, just like a tree spreads its roots deep into the ground. You learned to trust Christ very much in this way, like men build a house on a good foundation. And you should always give thanks to God.

\v 6 As you received Christ the Lord, walk in him.
\v 7 Be firmly planted in him, be built on him, be established in faith just as you were taught, and abound in thanksgiving.
