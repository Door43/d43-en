====== Colossians 02:10-12 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 And \add make sure of it\add* because you are spiritually complete because you have a close relationship with Christ, who rules over every being that rules.
\v 11 Specifically, because of your close relationship with him, it is as though \f + \ft metaphor \f* you were circumcised \f + \ft Or:Christ circumcised you \f* \add spiritually\add*. This does not mean that someone circumcised you physically \f + \ft metonymy \f*, but it means that Christ completely removed your entire self-directed nature.
\v 12 And specifically, when you were baptized, \add it was as though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* you \add had died and\add* were buried with Christ, and \add it was as though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* God caused you to live again with Christ as a result of your believing that God acted powerfully, specifically, by your believing that God raised Christ from among dead people.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 Now God has given you everything you need because he has joined you to Christ, and he rules over every other person, spirit, and angel.
\v 11 It is as if God has also circumcised you. But he did not remove any flesh from you. Instead, Jesus took away the thing that made you sin.
\v 12 Because they have baptized you, God considers that when men buried Christ, they buried you along with him. He considers that when he made Christ come alive again, he made you come alive also, because you trusted that he could make you live again.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 In him, who is the head of all rule and authority, you are completely fulfilled. 
\v 11 In him God circumcised you with a circumcision not performed by human  hands, but by the removal of a sinful body of flesh through the circumcision of Christ.
\v 12 You were buried with him in baptism, and you were raised up with him through faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead.

  * **completely fulfilled** - "made complete"
