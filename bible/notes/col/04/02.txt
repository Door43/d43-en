\v 2 Pray to God persistently, and as you pray be alert and be thanking God.
\v 3 Since I am in prison \f + \ft metonymy \f* because \add I declared the message about Christ\add* that God has now revealed, pray also for me that God will give me opportunities \f + \ft metonymy \f* to speak, in order that I might declare it.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 2 Keep praying without stopping. Do not be lazy, but instead keep praying and thanking God.

Watch for the needs you should pray about, and pray thanking God for his care and his answers.
\v 3 Pray together for us too, so that God will make it possible for us to freely explain the Good News, the secret about Christ that God is now revealing everywhere--it is for proclaiming this Good News that I am now in prison.
\v 4 Pray that I might be able to fully explain the Good News.
