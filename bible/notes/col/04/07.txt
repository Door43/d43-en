===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul closes with special instructions about certain people as well as greetings to and from individual believers.

  * **make known to you everything concerning me** - "tell you everything that has been happening to me" (UDB)
  * **make known to you** - The "you" refers to the Colossian believers.
  * **fellow slave** - "fellow servant." Though Paul is a freeman, he sees himself as a servant of Christ and sees Tychicus as a fellow servant.
  * **might know the matters about us** - The word "us" refers to Paul and his co-workers but not the Colossian believers. AT: "so that you might have our news"
  * **may encourage your hearts** - The heart was thought to be the center of many emotions. AT: "may encourage you" (See: [[:en:obe:other:heart]], [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Onesimus** - Onesimus was a slave of Philemon in Colossae. He stole money from Philemon and ran away to Rome where he became a Christian through the ministry of Paul. Now Tychicus and Onesimus are the ones bringing Paul's letter to Colossae.
  * **the faithful and beloved brother** - Paul considers Onesimus a fellow Christian and servant of Christ.
  * **They will tell** - "Tychicus and Onesimus will tell"
  * **everything that has happened here** - They will tell the Colossian believers all that is taking place where Paul is currently living. Tradition says Paul was in Rome under house arrest or in prison.
