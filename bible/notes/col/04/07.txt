===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul closes with special instructions about certain people as well as greetings to and from individual believers.
  * **General Information:** - Onesimus was a slave of Philemon in Colossae. He had stolen money from Philemon and run away to Rome where he became a Christian through the ministry of Paul. Now Tychicus and Onesimus are the ones bringing Paul's letter to Colossae.

  * **the things concerning me** - "everything that has been happening to me" 
  * **fellow slave** - "fellow servant." Though Paul is a free man, he sees himself as a servant of Christ and sees Tychicus as a fellow servant.
  * **about us** - These words do not include the Colossians. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **may encourage your hearts** - The heart was thought to be the center of many emotions. AT: "may encourage you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the faithful and beloved brother** - Paul calls Onesimus a fellow Christian and servant of Christ.
  * **They will tell** - "Tychicus and Onesimus will tell"
  * **everything that has happened here** - They will tell the Colossian believers all that is taking place where Paul is currently living. Tradition says Paul was in Rome under house arrest or in prison at this time.
