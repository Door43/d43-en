===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Give to your servants **  - The word "your" refers to Colossian believers that are slave owners.
  * **right and fair** - This is an expression for owners to do what is right and what is fair toward their slaves. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hendiadys]])
  * **master in heaven** - God is their master implying that 1) "God will treat slave owners as they treated their earthy slaves" or 2) "as you treat your earthy slaves God, your master will treat you in the same way."
