<usfm>
\v 22 Slaves, obey your masters according to the flesh* in all things, not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but with a sincere heart that fears the Lord.
\v 23 Whatever you do, work from the soul* as to the Lord and not as to men,
\v 24 and know that you will receive from the Lord the payback--the inheritance. You are serving the Lord Christ.
\v 25 Anyone who does unrighteousness will receive the unrighteousness that he did, and no one is exempt.
