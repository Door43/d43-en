<usfm>
\v 22 Slaves, obey your masters in this world in every way. Do not obey your masters only when they are watching you, like those who merely want their masters to think they always obey. Instead, obey your masters sincerely from the heart because you honor the Lord Jesus.
\v 23 Whatever work you do, work wholeheartedly for the Lord Jesus rather than for people. Do not work like those who are working merely for their human masters,
\v 24 because you know the Lord will repay you; you will receive your share of what the Lord has promised you. Jesus Christ is the real master whom you are serving.
\v 25 But God will judge each person in the same way; he will punish those who do wrong as they deserve.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 Slaves, obey your masters according to the flesh in all things, not with eyeservice as people pleasers, but with a sincere heart that fears the Lord.
\v 23 Whatever you do, work from the soul as to the Lord and not as to people.
\v 24 You know that you will receive from the Lord the reward of the inheritance. You are serving the Lord Christ.
\v 25 For anyone who does unrighteousness will receive the penalty for the unrighteousness that he did, and there is no partiality.
