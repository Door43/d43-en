<usfm>
\v 1 You now are alive \add spiritually\add*, and \add it is as though you were raised\add* \f + \ft Or:\add God caused you to become alive\add* \f* when he caused Christ to become alive again. So be constantly wanting what is associated with heaven \f + \ft metonymy \f*, where Christ is. There God has given him supreme authority and the highest honor.
\v 2 Be constantly wanting the blessings that God has prepared for you in heaven \f + \ft metonymy \f*. Do not be constantly wanting \add to do the evil deeds that people on\add* earth do \f + \ft metonymy \f*,
\v 3 because you have \add ceased to behave as you formerly did. You are like people who have\add* died. You now live \add spiritually\add* together with Christ in \add the presence of\add* God; and \add people\add* cannot see that.
\v 4 When Christ, who causes you to live \add spiritually\add*, is publicly revealed, then God will also reveal you publicly together with Christ, \add and you together with Christ will be\add* glorious.

\v 1 God considers that he made you alive again when he made Christ alive after he died. And Christ is in heaven and is sitting at God's right side, the place for the person of greatest honor and power. You also should try to live here as if you were already there.
\v 2 Desire what Jesus is keeping in heaven to give you; do not desire the things here on earth.
\v 3 For God considers that you have died and no longer belong to this world. He considers that he has hidden you with Christ to keep you safe.
\v 4 When God reveals Christ to everyone on earth in his shining light, then he will also reveal you in that same light, because Christ makes you live!

\p
\v 1 If then God has raised you with Christ, seek the things above, where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God.
\v 2 Think about what is above, not about what is on earth,
\v 3 for you have died and God has hidden your life in Christ.
\v 4 When Christ—your life—is revealed, then you will also be revealed with him in glory.

  * **has raised you** - The word "you" refers to the Colossian believers.
  * **the things above** - "the heavenly things" or "the godly things"
  * **what is on earth** - "earthly things" or "the things of earth"
  * **for you have died** - As Christ actually died, so God counts the Colossian believers as having died with Christ. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **God has hidden** - "God has concealed"
  * **with him in glory** - The word "him" refers to Christ.
