====== Colossians 03:9-11 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 Do not lie to one another. Do not do those things, because you have disposed of\f + \ft Or: stopped obeying \f* your former evil nature and stopped doing what you did when you had that former \add evil\add* nature,
\v 10 and because you have received a new nature. God is causing your new nature to become more and more like his own nature. He created your new nature in order that \add you might get to\add* know \add God\add* truly.
\v 11 As a result of that, it is not \add important whether anyone is a\add* non-Jew or a Jew, or \add whether anyone is\add* circumcised or not, or \add whether anyone is\add* a foreigner, or even uncivilized, or \add whether anyone is\add* a slave or not a slave. But \add what is important is\add* Christ, who is supremely important in every way.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 And do not lie to one another. Do not do any of these things, because you have become a new person now, a person who does not do these evil things any more.
\v 10 You are a new person, and God is always making you new so you can know him better, the one who created you as a new person like himself.
\v 11 God has made us into new persons joined to Christ, and he is always making us new. So it is no longer important whether anyone is a non-Jew or a Jew, or whether anyone is circumcised or is not circumcised, or whether anyone is a foreigner, or even uncivilized, or whether anyone is a slave or not a slave. But instead what is important is Christ, who is all things in all of you.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 Do not lie to one another, for you have stripped off your old self with its practices,
\v 10 and you have put on your new self, which is being renewed in the knowledge of his image, the image of the one who created your new self.
\v 11 In this knowledge, there is no Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but instead Christ is all things and in all things.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **you have stripped off** - The word "you" refers to the Colossian believers.
  * **you have stripped off your old self with its practices, and you have put on your new self ** - This metaphor contrasts the Christian who is to remove ungodly behavior and to begin acting godly to that of the person who removes dirty clothes and puts on new clean clothes. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **his image**  - This is a metonym for Jesus Christ. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the knowledge of his image ** -  To know and understand Jesus Christ. 
  * **there is no Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman ** - This is saying that God sees every person alike; not race, religion, nationality or caste (social status). AT: "Here race, religion, culture and social status do not matter".
  * **Christ is all things and in all things** - Nothing is excluded or left out of the existence of Christ. AT: "Christ is all important."
