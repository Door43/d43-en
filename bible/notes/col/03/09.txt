====== Colossians 03:9-11 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 Do not lie to one another. Do not do those things, because you have disposed of\f + \ft Or: stopped obeying \f* your former evil nature and stopped doing what you did when you had that former \add evil\add* nature,
\v 10 and because you have received a new nature. God is causing your new nature to become more and more like his own nature. He created your new nature in order that \add you might get to\add* know \add God\add* truly.
\v 11 As a result of that, it is not \add important whether anyone is a\add* non-Jew or a Jew, or \add whether anyone is\add* circumcised or not, or \add whether anyone is\add* a foreigner, or even uncivilized, or \add whether anyone is\add* a slave or not a slave. But \add what is important is\add* Christ, who is supremely important in every way.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 And do not lie to one another. Do not do any of these things, because you have become a new person now, a person who does not do these evil things any more.
\v 10 You are a new person, and God is always making you to know him better and better and to be like him, as he created you to be.
\v 11 God has made us into new persons joined to Christ, and he is always making us new. So it is no longer important whether anyone is a non-Jew or a Jew, or whether anyone is circumcised or is not circumcised, or whether anyone is a foreigner, or even uncivilized, or whether anyone is a slave or not a slave. But instead what is important is Christ, who is all things in all of you.

===== ULB: =====
<usfm>
\v 9 Do not lie to one another, since you have taken off the old man with its practices,
\v 10 and you have put on the new man that is being made new in knowledge according to the image of the one who created it.
\v 11 This is where there is no Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all, and is in all.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul continues to tell the believers how to live and reminds them that Christians should treat everyone according to the same standard.

  * **you have taken off the old man with its practices, and you have put on the new man** - Here Paul is speaking of a Christian's rejecting his old sinful life as if it were an old garment that he takes off in order to put on a new garment. It was very common for Israelites such as Paul to speak of moral qualities as if they were pieces of clothing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the image** - This refers to Jesus Christ. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **there is no Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman** - These terms are examples of the categories of people that Paul says do not matter for God. God sees every person alike, not by race, religion, nationality, or social status. AT: "race, religion, culture, and social status do not matter" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **barbarian** - a foreigner who does not know local customs
  * **Scythian** - This is someone from the land of Scythia, which was outside the Roman Empire. Greeks and Romans used this word for someone who grew up in a place where everyone did wicked things all the time. 
  * **Christ is all, and is in all** - Nothing is excluded or left out of the rule of Christ. AT: "Christ is all important and lives in all his people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
