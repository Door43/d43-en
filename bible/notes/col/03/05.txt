\v 5 \add Get rid of your evil practices\f + \ft Or: deeds \f*\add* \f + \ft metaphor, metonymy \f* \add as though they were enemies whom\add* you were killing \f + \ft Or: \add Get rid of doing evil\add* \f + \ft metaphor, metonymy \f*, just as dead people do not do what is evil \f*. Specifically, do not practice sexual immorality. Do not commit unnatural sexual acts. Do not desire to act like that, and do not desire \add to do anything that is\add* evil. Do not desire to have more things than you need, because, if you do that, you are worshipping material things instead of worshipping God\f + \ft Or: making material things to become your god \f*.
\v 6 \add Do not behave like that\add* since God will punish \f + \ft metonymy \f* those who disobey him, because they act like that.
\v 7 You also formerly behaved like that when you were disobeying God.
\v 8 Now, however, as for you, do not do any of these evil deeds: Do not get angry in any way \f + \ft doublet \f*. Do not act maliciously. Do not slander\f + \ft Or: talk evil about \f* people. Do not talk abusively to people.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Therefore, all the evil things you want to do in this world--think of them as enemies that must die. You must execute them: Do not try to do sexually immoral or impure acts. Do not think in lustful or evil ways. And do not be greedy, because that is the same as worshiping idols.
\v 6 It is because people do things like these that God is angry with them, for they do not obey him.
\v 7 You yourselves also formerly lived like that when you were participating with those who behaved like that.
\v 8 But now you must stop doing these things. Do not be angry at each other; do not try to make trouble for each other. Do not insult each other or talk in shameful, disgusting ways.

\v 5 Put to death, therefore, your sinful desires of earth--fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and greed, which is idolatry.
\v 6 It is for these things that the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.
\v 7 It is in these things that you also once walked when you lived by them.
\v 8 But now you must get rid of all these things--wrath, anger, evil intentions, insults, and shameful, obscene speech from your mouth.
