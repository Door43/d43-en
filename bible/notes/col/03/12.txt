<usfm>
\v 12 Because God has chosen you and set you apart as his people, and because he loves you, serve others compassionately and mercifully and with kindness. Humbly and gently care for one another with patience
\v 13 and bear with each other. If anyone complains against someone else, forgive one another. Just as the Lord Jesus has forgiven you, so also you must forgive each other.

\v 12 Put on, then, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, intestines of mercy, kindness, lowliness, meekness, and patience.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Put on...intestines of mercy** - As a person puts on clothing when getting dressed, believers are to put on "intestines of mercy" and other qualities in their behavior toward each other. The lower intestines were often thought to be the center of emotions of mercy and compassion. Since Israelites often spoke of moral qualities as if they were clothing, Paul is able to say, "Put on...intestines of mercy." Translators will probably have to change this figure of speech in their own versions (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Put on then** - "Then" is used to specify an action or behavior change based on the preceding discussion or teaching. (See: [[:en:ta:workbench:discourse:home]])
  * **as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved** - "as God's holy and dearly loved chosen ones" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **kindness** - "goodness" or "gentleness"
  * **lowliness** - "humbleness of mind" or "lowliness of mind"
  * **meekness** - "gentleness." Calmness of the soul toward God rather than outward expression of feelings
  * **Bear with one another** - "Endure each another"
  * **has a complaint against** - "complains against" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **which is the bond of perfection** - "which binds us perfectly together"
