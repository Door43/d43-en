\v 24 At the present time I am rejoicing that I am suffering for your benefit; that is, I am completing what Christ \add decided\add* that I should suffer physically for the benefit of all believers, \add who are as dear to him as\add* his own body.
\v 25 I myself became one who serves God's people, because I was appointed \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* appointed me \f* to be responsible to \add help\add* you \add who are non-Jews\add*. I became one who serves God's people in order that I should make known to you non-Jews the whole message from, Or: about God.
\v 26 \add We did not know this message previously; that is, God\add* concealed it from \add the people who lived in all\add* the previous ages, but he has now revealed it to his people.
\v 27 That is, God decided to reveal to them this message, which declares that he will greatly bless the non-Jews. Specifically, this message declares that Christ, \add by his Spirit\add*, will live in you who are non-Jews, with the result that you confidently expect that you will share in \add God's\add* glory.

\v 24 Now I rejoice that I am suffering for your benefit. Yes, in order to help the church, which is like Christ's body, I suffer things that must still happen.
\v 25 God made me his servant and gave to me special work to do, which is to proclaim the full message of God to non-Jewish people like you.
\v 26 From ancient times, for generations, God did not tell this good news, but now he has revealed this mystery to those whom he has set apart for himself.
\v 27 It is to these people—Jews and non-Jews like yourselves just as much—that God planned to tell this wonderful secret. It is this: Christ will live in you and make you confidently expect to share in God's glory!

\v 24 Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is lacking of the afflictions of Christ for the sake of his body, which is the church.
\v 25 It is of this church that I am a servant, according to the responsibility from God that was given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God.
\v 26 This is the secret truth that was hidden for ages and for generations. But now it has been revealed to those who believe in him.
\v 27 It is to them that God wanted to make known the riches of the glory of this secret truth among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I fill up in my flesh what is lacking of the afflictions of Christ** - Paul speaks about the suffering that he continues to experience. He may be acknowledging here that there is much suffering that he and all other Christians must endure before Christ comes again, and that Christ in a spiritual sense joins with them in experiencing these hardships. Paul certainly does not mean that Christ's sufferings alone were not enough to provide salvation for the believers. 
  * **I fill up in my flesh** - Paul speaks of his body as if it were a container that could hold suffering. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **for the sake of his body, which is the church** - Paul often speaks of the church, the group of all Christian believers, as if it were Christ's body. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to fulfill the word of God** - This means to bring about the purpose of God's gospel message, which is that it be preached and believed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **This is the secret truth that was hidden** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "This is the secret truth that God had hidden" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **for ages and for generations** - The words "ages" and "generations" refer to the time period from the creation of the world until the time when the gospel was preached. 
  * **now it has been revealed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "now God has revealed it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])

  * **Christ is in you** - Paul speaks of the believers as if they were actual containers in which Christ is present. This is one of his ways of expressing the union of the believers with Christ. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
