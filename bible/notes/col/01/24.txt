\v 24 At the present time I am rejoicing that I am suffering for your benefit; that is, I am completing what Christ \add decided\add* that I should suffer physically for the benefit of all believers, \add who are as dear to him as\add* his own body.
\v 25 I myself became one who serves God's people, because I was appointed \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* appointed me \f* to be responsible to \add help\add* you \add who are non-Jews\add*. I became one who serves God's people in order that I should make known to you non-Jews the whole message from, Or: about God.
\v 26 \add We did not know this message previously; that is, God\add* concealed it from \add the people who lived in all\add* the previous ages, but he has now revealed it to his people.
\v 27 That is, God decided to reveal to them this message, which declares that he will greatly bless the non-Jews. Specifically, this message declares that Christ, \add by his Spirit\add*, will live in you who are non-Jews, with the result that you confidently expect that you will share in \add God's\add* glory.

\v 24 Now I rejoice that I am suffering for your benefit.Yes, in order to help the Church, which is like Christ's body, I suffer  things that must still happen.
\v 25 God made me his servant and gave to me special work to do, which is to proclaim the Good News to non-Jewish people like you.
\v 26 From ancient times, for generations, God did not tell this Good News, but now he has revealed this mystery to those whom he has set apart for himself.
\v 27 It is to these people--Jew and non-Jew alike, like yourselves--that God planned to tell this wonderful secret. It is this: Christ will live in you and make you confidently expect to share in God's glory!

\v 24 Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up in my flesh what is lacking of the afflictions of Christ for his body’s sake, which is the church.
\v 25 I serve the church according to the working of God that was given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God
\v 26 --the secret truth--that was hidden for ages and for generations but now that has been revealed to his holy ones,
\v 27 to whom God wanted to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the confidence of glory.
