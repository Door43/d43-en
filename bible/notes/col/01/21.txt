====== Colossians 01:21-23 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 21 As for you, \add although\add* formerly God \add considered you his\add* enemies \f + \ft Or: \add God considered you\add* as alienated \add from him\add* \f* and \add although\add* you were formerly hostile \add to God\add* because you thought evil thoughts and because you did evil deeds,
\v 22 nevertheless, God our Father has now reconciled you \add to himself. He did that\add* as a result of his Son dying physically. He did it in order that you should be completely holy when he brings you into his presence.
\v 23 But he wants you to continue \f + \ft doublet \f* to believe the message about Christ; specifically, he wants you to continue to be stable\f + \ft Or: steadfast \f* and to continue to confidently expect to receive that which you heard about when you heard that message. That message has been proclaimed \f + \ft Or:They have proclaimed that message \f* to people in very many places \f + \ft hyperbole \f*; and I, Paul, have also become one who tells it to people.

\v 21 Before you believed in Christ, God considered you his enemies, and you were unfriendly to God because you thought evil thoughts and because you did evil deeds.
\v 22 But now God has offered peace between yourselves and himself and has made you his friends. He did this when Jesus gave up his body and life for us by dying. This made it possible for us to belong to God; he finds nothing wrong in us now, nothing to blame us for.
\v 23 But you must continue to trust Christ completely; then you will be like a house that they built on solid rock. Do not for any reason stop believing in what God has promised to do for you in the good news that people all over the world have heard. This is the same good news that I, Paul, am serving God by proclaiming to people.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 21 At one time, you also were strangers to God and were his enemies in mind and in evil deeds.
\v 22 But now he has reconciled you by his physical body through death. He did this in order to present you holy, blameless, and above reproach before him,
\v 23 if you continue in the faith, established and firm, not moved away from the certain hope of the gospel that you heard. This is the gospel that was proclaimed to every person created under heaven. This is the gospel of which I, Paul, became a servant.
