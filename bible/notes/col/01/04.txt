\v 4 because we have heard that you believe in Christ Jesus, and that you love all God's people.
\v 5 You do that because you confidently expect to receive that which God is reserving\f + \ft Or: keeping safe \f* for you in heaven, which you heard about previously when you heard the true message, that is, the message \add about Christ\add*.
\v 6 \add People\add* proclaimed it \f + \ft personification \f* to you, just like \add people\add* have proclaimed it in many different countries \f + \ft hyperbole, idiom \f*. The true message is changing more and more people's lives, just like it changed your lives because you heard it and you truly experienced that God acts kindly towards us in ways we do not deserve.

\v 4 because we have heard that you trust in Christ Jesus and that you love all those whom God has set apart for himself.
\v 5 You love our fellow believers because you confidently are waiting for the things God is reserving for you in heaven. You first heard about these things when you heard the true message, the good news about Christ.
\v 6 Believers are proclaiming this good news that you heard in Colossae to everyone in the world. It is just as it has worked in you also, from the first day you heard it and understood how truly kind God is. The good news is like a field planted with crops that are growing and will give much a very large harvest.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 We have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love that you have for all those set apart for God,
\v 5 because of the confident expectation reserved for you in the heavens. You first heard about this confident expectation in the word of truth, the gospel,
\v 6 which has come to you, as it also is bearing fruit and is growing in all the world, just as in you also, from the day you heard it and came to know the grace of God in truth.
