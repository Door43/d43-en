\v 4 because we have heard that you believe in Christ Jesus, and that you love all God's people.
\v 5 You do that because you confidently expect to receive that which God is reserving\f + \ft Or: keeping safe \f* for you in heaven, which you heard about previously when you heard the true message, that is, the message \add about Christ\add*.
\v 6 \add People\add* proclaimed it \f + \ft personification \f* to you, just like \add people\add* have proclaimed it in many different countries \f + \ft hyperbole, idiom \f*. The true message is changing more and more people's lives, just like it changed your lives because you heard it and you truly experienced that God acts kindly towards us in ways we do not deserve.

\v 4 We give God thanks because we have heard that you trust in Christ Jesus and that you love all those whom God has set apart for himself.
\v 5 You love our fellow believers because you confidently are waiting for the things God is reserving for you in heaven. You first heard about these things when you heard the true message, the good news about Christ.
\v 6 Believers are proclaiming this good news that you heard in Colossae to everyone in the world. It is just as it has worked in you also, from the first day you heard it and understood how truly kind God is. The good news is like a field planted with crops that are growing and will give a very large harvest.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 We have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love that you have for all those set apart for God.
\v 5 You have this love because of the certain hope reserved for you in heaven. You heard about this confident expectation before in the word of truth, the gospel,
\v 6 which has come to you. This gospel is bearing fruit and is growing in all the world. It has been doing this in you also from the day you heard it and learned about the grace of God in truth.

  * **your faith in Christ Jesus** - "your belief in Christ Jesus"
  * **because of the confident expectation reserved for you in heaven** - Here "confident expectation" stands for what the believer can confidently expect, that is, the things that God has promised to do for all believers.

AT: "because you are certain that God, who is in heaven, will do the many good things that he has promised you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **This gospel is bearing fruit and is growing** - Paul is speaking here of the gospel as if it were a tree or plant that grows and produces food. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
