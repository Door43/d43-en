===== translationNotes: =====

  * **We pray** - The word "we" refers to Paul and Timothy but not to the Colossians. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **into all perseverance and patience** - Paul speaks of the Colossian believers as if God would move them into a location of perseverance and patience. In reality, he is praying that they will never stop trusting in God and that they will be completely patient as they honor him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **has made you able to have a share** - "has allowed you to share"
  * **has made you able** - Here Paul is focusing on his readers as receivers of God's blessings. But he does not mean that he himself has no share in those blessings.
  * **inheritance** - Receiving what God has promised believers is spoken of as if it were inheriting property and wealth from a family member. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in light** - This idea is opposite to the idea of the dominion of darkness in the next verse. AT: "in the glory of his presence"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
