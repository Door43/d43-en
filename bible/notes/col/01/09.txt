  * **Because of this love** - "Because the Holy Spirit has enabled you to love other believers"
  * **from the day we heard this** - "from the day Epaphras told us these things"
  * **we heard** - This refers to Paul and Timothy but not the Colossian believers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **we have not stopped praying** - "we have prayed often and sincerely to God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
  * **that you will be filled with the knowledge of his will** - Paul speaks of the Colossian believers as if they were containers. AT: "that God will fill you with the knowledge to do his will" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in all wisdom and spiritual understanding** - "wisdom and understanding given by the Holy Spirit"
  * **that you will walk worthily of the Lord** - Walking here signifies behavior in life. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
