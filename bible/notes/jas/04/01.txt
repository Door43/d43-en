\v 1 Now I will tell you why you are fighting among yourselves and quarreling with each other. It is because each of you wants to do the evil things that you enjoy doing, things that do not please your fellow believers.
\v 2 There are things that you very much desire to have, but you do not get those things, so you want to kill those who hinder you from getting them. You desire what other people have, but you are unable to get what you desire, so you quarrel and fight with one another. You do not have what you desire because you do not ask God for it.
\v 3 Even when you do ask him, he does not give you what you ask for because you are asking for the wrong reason. You are asking for things in order that you may use them just to enjoy yourselves in bad ways.

\v 1 Where does the quarreling and disputing among yourselves come from?  Does it not arise out of your evil desires that war among your fellow believers?
\v 2 You desire what you do not have. You kill and you chase after what you are not able to have. You fight and quarrel, yet you do not obtain because you do not ask God.
\v 3 You ask and do not receive because you ask for bad things, in order that you may spend them on your evil desires.
