<usfm>
\v 11 My fellow believers, stop speaking evil against one another, \add because\add* those who speak evil against a fellow believer and \add thus\add* condemn \add one who is like\add* a brother \add to them\add* are really speaking against the law \add that God gave us to obey\add*. \add In this law, God commanded\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add us to love others\add*, and those who speak evil against fellow believers, \add it is as though\add* they are saying \add by what they do\add* that we do not have to do what \add God\add* commanded. If you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* say that you do not have to do what God commanded, you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* are not obeying God's law. Instead, you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* are claiming that you \add have the authority\add* to condemn \add others\add*.
\v 12 \add But in fact\add*, there is only one who \add has the authority to\add* tell \add people\add* what is right to do and to condemn \add them, and that is God\add*. He alone is able to save \add people\add* or to destroy people\add . So\add*, \bd you\bd*\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* certainly have no right to decide how God should punish other people.\f + \ft Or: who are you to decide how God should punish other people? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 11 My brothers and sisters, stop speaking evil against one another, because those who speak evil against a fellow believer and thus condemn one who is like a brother or sister to them are really speaking against the law that God gave us to obey. If you speak against his law, you are acting like a judge who condemns it.
\v 12 But in fact, there is only one who has the authority to forgive our evil and to condemn people, and that is God. He alone is able to save people or to destroy people. You certainly have no right to take God's place and judge others.

\v 11 Do not speak against one another, brothers. The person who speaks against a brother or judges his brother speaks against the law and judges God's law. If you judge the law, you are not obeying the law, but are a judge of it.
\v 12 Only one is the lawgiver and judge, God, the one who is able to save and to destroy. Who are you who judge your neighbor?
