\v 8 Come near spiritually to God. If you do, he will come near to you. You who are sinners, turn away from doing what is wrong and do only what is good. You who cannot decide whether you will commit yourselves to God, stop thinking wrong thoughts, and think only his thoughts.
\v 9 Be sorrowful and weep because of the wrong that you have done. Do not laugh, enjoying only what you selfishly desire. Instead, be sad because you have done what is wrong.
\v 10 Humble yourselves before the Lord; if you do, he will honor you.

\v 8 Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
\v 9 Grieve, mourn, and cry!  Turn your laughter into sorrow and your joy to gloom.
\v 10 Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **near to you** - The word "you" refers to James' audience. But more specifically to those who were proud of spirit as a call to repentance. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded** - The phrase "Cleanse your hands" is stated another way as "purify your hearts" and "you sinners" is restated as "you double-minded." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Cleanse your hands** - Possible meanings are 1) for a person clean up their behavior or actions or 2) for a person to repent and confess their sinful behavior or actions. AT: "behave in a way that honors God." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **purify your hearts** - Here "hearts" refers to a person's thoughts and emotions. AT: "let your thoughts honor God."
  * **double-minded** - The word "double-minded" refers to a person's thoughts when he is unable to make a decision. AT: "double-minded people" or "people who cannot decide if they want to obey God."
  * **Grieve, mourn, and cry** - The words "Grieve" and "mourn" mean basically the same thing. James uses them together to emphasize that the people should grieve deeply. The word "cry" shows that the people are grieving." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Turn your laughter into sorrow and your joy to gloom** - This is saying the same thing in different ways for emphasis. AT: "Immediately stop all your laughing and start telling God you are sorry." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synonparallelism]])
  * **Humble yourselves before the Lord** - "Be humble toward God"
  * **he will lift you up** - AT: "he will give you honor" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
