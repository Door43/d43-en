\v 8 Come near spiritually to God. If you do, he will come near to you. You who are sinners, turn away from doing what is wrong and do only what is good. You who cannot decide whether you will commit yourselves to God, stop thinking wrong thoughts, and think only his thoughts.
\v 9 Be sorrowful and weep because of the wrong that you have done. Do not laugh, enjoying only what you selfishly desire. Instead, be sad because you have done what is wrong.
\v 10 Humble yourselves before the Lord; if you do, he will honor you.

<usfm>
\v 8 Come close to God, and he will come close to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
\v 9 Grieve, mourn, and cry! Let your laughter turn into sadness and your joy into gloom.
\v 10 Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The word "you" here is plural and refers to the scattered believers to whom James writes. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **Come close to God** - Here the idea of coming close stands for becoming honest and open with God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded** - These are two phrases in parallel with each other. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Cleanse your hands** - This expression is a command for people to do righteous acts instead of unrighteous acts. AT: "Behave in a way that honors God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **purify your hearts** - Here "hearts" refers to a person's thoughts and emotions. AT: "honor God with your thoughts" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **double-minded** - The word "double-minded" refers to a person who cannot make a firm decision about something. AT: "double-minded people" or "people who cannot decide if you want to obey God or not" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Grieve, mourn, and cry** - These three words have similar meanings. James uses them together to emphasize that the people should be truly sorry for not obeying God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclamations]])
  * **Let your laughter turn into sadness and your joy into gloom** - This is saying the same thing in different ways for emphasis. The abstract nouns "laughter," "sadness," "joy," and "gloom" can be translated as verbs or adjectives. AT: "Stop laughing and be sad. Stop being joyful and be gloomy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Humble yourselves before the Lord** - "Be humble toward God." Actions done with God in mind are often spoken of as being done in his physical presence. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he will lift you up** - James indicates that God will honor the humble person by saying God will pick that person up off the ground physically from where that person had prostrated himself in humility. AT: "he will honor you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
