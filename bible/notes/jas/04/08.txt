\v 8 Come near spiritually to God. If you do, he will come near to you. You who are sinners, stop doing what is wrong and do only what is good. You who cannot decide
whether you will commit yourselves to God, stop thinking wrong thoughts, and think only his thoughts.
\v 9 Be sorrowful and weep because of the wrong that you have done. Do not laugh, enjoying only what you selfishly desire. Instead, be sad because you have done what is wrong.
\v 10 Humble yourselves before the Lord; if you do, he will honor you.

\v 9 Grieve and mourn and cry!  Turn your laughter into sorrow and your joy to gloom.
\v 10 Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **near to Youâ€¦**  - The word "you" refers to James' audience. But more specifically those who were proud of spirit as a call to repentance. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you doubleminded** - The phrase "Cleanse you hands" is stated another way as "purify your hearts" and "you sinners" is restated as "you doubleminded." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Cleanse your hands**  - Possible meanings are 1) for a person clean up their behavior or actions or 2) for a person to repent and confess their sinful behavior or actions. It could be translated as "behave in a way that honors God." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
  * **purify your hearts**  - Here, "hearts" is a metonym that refers to a person's thoughts and emotions. This could be translated as "let your thoughts honor God."
  * **doubleminded**  - The word "doubleminded" is a metonym that refers to a person's thoughts when he is unable to make a decision. Here it can be also translated as "doubleminded people" or "people who cannot decide if you want to obey God or not."
  * **Grieve and mourn and cry** - The words "Grieve" and "mourn" mean basically the same thing. James uses them together to emphasize that the people should grieve deeply. The word "cry" shows that the people are grieving. AT: "Grieve deeply and cry" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Turn your laughter into sorrow and your joy to gloom**  - This is saying the same thing in different ways for emphasis. This could be translated as "Immediately, stop all your laughing and start telling God you are sorry."
  * **Humble yourselves before the Lord -**  "Be humble toward God"
  * **he will lift you up**  - This is an idiom that can be translated as "he will give you honor." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom|Idiom]])
