\v 8 Come near spiritually to God. If you do, he will come near to you. You who are sinners, turn away from doing what is wrong and do only what is good. You who cannot decide whether you will commit yourselves to God, stop thinking wrong thoughts, and think only his thoughts.
\v 9 Be sorrowful and weep because of the wrong that you have done. Do not laugh, enjoying only what you selfishly desire. Instead, be sad because you have done what is wrong.
\v 10 Humble yourselves before the Lord; if you do, he will honor you.

\v 8 Come close to God, and he will come close to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
\v 9 Grieve, mourn, and cry! Let your laughter turn into sadness and your joy into gloom.
\v 10 Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The word "you" here refers to the scattered believers to whom James wrote.

  * **Come close to God, and he will come close to you** - Here the idea of coming close stands for becoming honest and open with God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded** - These are two phrases in parallel with each other. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Cleanse your hands** - This expression is a command for people to do righteous acts instead of unrighteous acts. AT: "Behave in a way that honors God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **purify your hearts** - Here "hearts" refers to a person's thoughts and emotions. AT: "honor God with your thoughts" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **double-minded** - The word "double-minded" refers to a person who cannot make a firm decision about something. AT: "double-minded people" or "people who cannot decide if they want to obey God or not" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Grieve, mourn, and cry** - These three words have similar meanings. James uses them together to emphasize that the people should be truly sorry for not obeying God. James states this like it was a command. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclamations]])
  * **Let your laughter turn into sadness and your joy into gloom** - This is saying the same thing in different ways for emphasis. Laughter is spoken of as if it were an object that could be transformed into sadness. It is the same with joy and gloom. AT: "Immediately stop all your laughing and start telling God you are sorry" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]], [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Humble yourselves before the Lord** - "Be humble toward God." Actions done with God in mind are often spoken of as being done in his physical presence. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he will lift you up** - James speaks of God honoring the humble person as if God would pick that person up off the ground physically, where that person had prostrated himself in humility. AT: "he will honor you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
