\v 13 Listen, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will go into this town, and spend a year there, and trade, and make a profit."
\v 14 Who knows what will happen tomorrow, and what is your life anyway? For you are like a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **spend a year** - This is an idiom that can be translated as "stay there for a year." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Listen, you who say -**  "Someone might say"
  * ** Who knows what will happen tomorrow** - This is a rhetorical question that James uses to scold his audience. It can be translated as a statement: "No one knows what will happen tomorrow." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **and what is your life anyway** - This is a rhetorical question that James uses to teach his audience about physical life. It can be translated as a statement and as a new sentence: "Think about your physical lives."
  * **For you are like a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.** - This is a simile that compares how quickly physical lives are quickly end to a mist that appears then quickly goes away. This could be translated as "You live for only a short amount of time, and you do not know when you will die." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
