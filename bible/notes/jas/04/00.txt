====== James 04 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Adultery ==
Adultery is a common metaphor in Scripture. It is always used negatively and indicates a child of God is acting in an ungodly manner. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]] and [[:en:obe:kt:ungodly|ungodly]])

== Law ==
It is unclear whether this is a reference to the law of Moses. It is probably a reference to the "law" of God in general. This is the general standard of righteousness based on the character of God. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|law of Moses]] and [[:en:obe:kt:righteous|righteousness]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical Questions ==
James uses many rhetorical questions as a way to teach his readers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical questions]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "The humble" ==
This is probably not a reference to those who act humbly, but a reference to those who humble themselves and trust in Jesus for their salvation. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:salvation|Salvation]])
