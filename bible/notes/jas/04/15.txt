<usfm>
\v 15 Instead of \add what you are saying\add*, you should say, "If the Lord wills\f + \ft Or: desires \f*, we will live and do this or that."
\v 16 But what you are doing is boasting about all the things that you arrogantly \add plan to do\add*. Your boasting like that is evil.
\p
\v 17 So if anyone knows the right thing that he should do, \add but\add* he does not do it, he is sinning.

\v 15 Instead of what you are saying, you should say, "If the Lord is willing, we will live and do such and such."
\v 16 But what you are doing is boasting about all the things that you plan to do. Your boasting like that is evil.

\v 17 So if anyone knows the right thing that he should do, but he does not do it, he is sinning.

<usfm>
\v 15 Instead you should say, "If the Lord allows, we will live and we will do this or that."
\v 16 But now you are boasting about your plans. All such boasting is evil.
\v 17 Therefore, to him who knows to do good but does not do it, to him it is sin.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **we will live** - The word "we" does not directly refer to James or his audience but is an example of how James' audience should behave.
  * **we will do this or that** - AT: "do what we have planned to do"
  * **to him who knows** - James is not addressing anyone directly by the word "him," but to anyone who should do good but does not.
