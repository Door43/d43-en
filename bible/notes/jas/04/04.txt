\v 4 Like a woman who is unfaithful to her husband, you are being unfaithful to God and not obeying him anymore. Those who behave as evil people do belong to this world and are enemies against God. Perhaps you do not realize that.
\v 5 Surely you do not think that it is for no reason that God told us in the Scriptures that the human spirit that God placed in humans now deeply desires evil things, like envying and jealousy.

\v 4 You adulteresses! Don't you know that friendship with the world is hostility against God? Therefore, whoever decides to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.
\v 5 Or do you think the scripture is useless when it says that the human spirit God placed in us is now filled with envy?

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **You adulteresses!** - This is a metaphor that compares believers who do not obey God with a wife who has sex with a man that is not her husband. This could be translated as "You are not being loyal to God!" (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor|Metaphor]])

  * **is hostility against God** To be part of the world's value system is to be against God. Alternated translation: "to act like those who dishonor God is to be someone who opposes God." 
  * **to be a friend of the world** - "to act like those who dishonor God"
  * **Or do you think the scripture is useless**  - This is a rhetorical question James uses to exhort his audience. It can be translated as a statement: "Scripture is true."
