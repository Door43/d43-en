\v 4 Like a woman who is unfaithful to her husband, you are being unfaithful to God and not obeying him anymore. Those who behave as evil people do belong to this world and are enemies against God. Perhaps you do not realize that.
\v 5 Surely you do not think that it is for no reason that God told us in the scriptures that the Spirit he placed in us yearns for us to live our lives in ways that please him.

\v 4 You adulteresses! Do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility against God? Therefore, whoever decides to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.
\v 5 Or do you think the scripture is without meaning when it says that the Spirit he placed within us is deeply jealous for us?

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **You adulteresses!** - This compares believers who do not obey God with a wife who sleeps with a man who is not her husband. AT: "You are not being loyal to God!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Do you not know...God?** - James uses this question to teach his audience. AT: "You know...God!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **friendship with the world** - This phrase "friendship with the world" refers to identifying with or participating in the world's value system and behavior. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]).
  * **friendship with the world is hostility against God** - To be part of the world's value system is to be against God. AT: "to act as those who dishonor God is to be someone who opposes God." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Or do you think the scripture is without meaning** - This is a rhetorical question James uses to exhort his audience. AT: "Scripture is true."
  * **the Spirit he placed within us** - Some versions render this as "the spirit" to refer to human spirit, which is a possible meaning in the original text. We suggest that you use the meaning that is presented in other translations used by your readers.
