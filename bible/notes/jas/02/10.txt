\v 10 Do not forget that those who disobey only one of God's laws, even if they obey all \add his other\add* laws, \add God considers them\add* to be \add as guilty as anyone who has disobeyed\add* all \add of\add* God's\add laws\add*.
\v 11 For example, \add God\add* said, "Do not commit adultery," but he also said, "Do not murder anyone." \add So\add* if you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* do not commit adultery but you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* murder someone, you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* have become a person who disobeys \add God's\add* laws.

\v 10 Those who disobey only one of God's laws, even if they obey all his other laws, God considers to be as guilty as anyone who has disobeyed all of his laws.
\v 11 For example, God said, "Do not commit adultery," but he also said, "Do not murder anyone." So if you do not commit adultery but you murder someone, you have become a person who disobeys God's laws.

\v 10 For whoever obeys the whole law, yet stumbles in just one point, he has become guilty of breaking all the law!
\v 11 For God who said, "Do not commit adultery," also said, "Do not murder." If you do not commit adultery, but you do commit murder, you have broken God's law.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **for whoever obeys **- "for anyone who obeys"
  * **yet stumbles in … he has become**- As stumbling is falling down while one is trying to walk, so is disobeying one point of the law is being guilty of breaking the whole law. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **Do not commit…**  - to "commit" is to do the action.
  * **…If you…But you…you have…**  - Though James was writing to many Jewish believers, in this case he wrote as if he was writing to each person individually. This can be translated as "each one of you" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you|Forms of 'You']])
