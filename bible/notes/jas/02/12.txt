But when we \add are\add* merciful \add to others, we can rejoice\add*, because \add our being\add* merciful \add shows\add* that \add we are acting like people whom God\add* has mercifully saved from being judged \f + \ft Or: \add we can rejoice\add* because \add God\add* will judge us mercifully \f*.

<usfm>
\v 12 Always speak and act toward others as people should whom God will judge using the law that frees us from being punished for our sins.
\v 13 Because when God judges us, he will not act mercifully toward those who do not act mercifully toward others. But if we are merciful to others, then we will not fear God when he judges us.

\v 12 So speak and obey as those who are about to be judged by the law of liberty.
\v 13 For judgment comes without mercy to those who have shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment!
