\v 1 My fellow believers, \add because\add* you trust our Lord Jesus Christ, the one who is glorious\f + \ft Or: wonderful \f*, stop honoring some people more than others.
\v 2 \add For example\add*, suppose that a person who wears gold rings and fine clothes enters your meeting place. Then suppose that a poor person who wears shabby\f + \ft Or: ragged \f* clothes also comes in.
\v 3 And \add suppose\add* that you show special attention to\f + \ft Or: treat better \f* the one who is dressed in fine clothes by saying, "Sit here in this good seat!" and you say to the poor one, "Stand there or sit on the floor \f + \ft metonymy \f*!"
\v 4 Then you have obviously \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* caused divisions in the congregation \f + \ft Or: you are clearly treating one better than the others, and you are using evil \add motives( Or: reasons )\add* to \add evaluate people\f + \ft Or: decide whether people are important or not\add* \f* \f*.

\v 1 My brothers and sisters, because you trust our Lord Jesus Christ, the one who is greater than anything, stop honoring some people more than others.
\v 2 For example, suppose that a person who wears gold rings and fine clothes enters your meeting place. Then suppose that a poor person who wears shabby clothes also comes in.
\v 3 And suppose that you show special attention to the one dressed in fine clothes by saying, “Please sit here in this nice seat!” and you say to the poor one, “You stand over there or sit on the floor!"
\v 4 You have then judged one another for wrong reasons.

\c 2
\p
\v 1 My brothers, do not follow the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, by favoring certain people.
\v 2 If someone enters your meeting wearing gold rings and fine clothes, and there also enters a poor man in dirty clothes,
\v 3 and you focus attention upon the person wearing fine clothes, and say, "Please sit here in a nice place," but you say to the poor man, "You stand over there," or, "Sit at my feet,"
\v 4 are you not making judgments among yourselves, and becoming judges with evil thoughts?
