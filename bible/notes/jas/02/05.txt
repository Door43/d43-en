\v 5 Listen to me, my brothers and sisters whom I love. God has chosen poor people who seem to have nothing of value, to trust in him very much. So he will give them great things when he rules everyone everywhere. This is what he has promised to do for everyone who loves him.
\v 6 But you dishonor the poor people. Think about it! It is the rich people, not the poor people, who are causing you to suffer! It is the rich people who forcibly take you to court to accuse you in front of judges!
\v 7 And they are the ones who speak evil against the Lord Jesus Christ, the one who is worthy of praise, to whom you belong!

\v 5 Listen, my beloved brothers, did not God choose the poor of the world to be rich in faith and inherit the kingdom he promised to those who love him?
\v 6 But you have dishonored the poor! Is it not the rich who oppress you, and are they not the ones who drag you into court?
\v 7 Do not the rich blaspheme the good name by which you are called?
