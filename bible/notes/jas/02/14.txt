\v 14 My fellow believers, \add there are some people who say\add*, "I believe \add in the Lord Jesus Christ\add*," but they do not do good deeds \add to other people\add*. Their saying that will certainly not do them any good!\f + \ft Or: What good will their saying that do for them? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add God\add* will certainly not save \add people like that who say that they believe, but do not do good deeds\add*!\f + \ft Or: Will God save \add people like that who say that they believe, but do not do good deeds\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 15 \add To illustrate\add*, suppose that fellow believers, either men or women, are continually lacking clothing or lacking food for each day.
\v 16 And suppose that one of you says to them, "May \add God\add* bless you and supply the clothing and food that you need!" but you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* do not give them the things that they need. That would be no help \add to them\add*!\f + \ft Or: What help is that \add to them\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 17 Similarly, \add those who do\add* not do good deeds \add to help others, what they have said about\add* their believing \add in Christ\add* is \add as useless\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add as\add* a dead person \add is useless\add*! They do not \add really believe in Christ\add*.

\v 14 My brothers and sisters, some people say, "I believe in the Lord Jesus Christ," but they do not do good things. What they say will do them no good. If they only believe with words, God will certainly not save them.
\v 15 To illustrate, suppose that a brother or sister is continually lacking clothes or food for each day.
\v 16 And suppose one of you says to them, "Do not worry, go away, get warm, and find the food you need!" But if you do not give them the things that they need for their bodies, then that will be no help to them!
\v 17 Similarly, if you do not do good deeds to help others, what you say about believing in Christ is as useless as a dead person! You do not really believe in Christ.

\v 14 What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith, but he has no works? Can that faith save him?
\v 15 Suppose that a brother or sister is badly clothed and lacks food for the day.
\v 16 Suppose that one of you says to them, "Go in peace, stay warm and be filled." If you do not give them the things necessary for the body, what good is that?
\v 17 In the same way faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - James encourages the scattered believers to show their faith before others, just as Abraham showed others his faith by his works.

  * **What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith, but he has no works?** - James is using a rhetorical question to teach his audience. AT: "It is no good at all, fellow believers, if someone says he has faith, but he has no works." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **if someone says he has faith, but he has no works** - The can be restated to remove the abstract nouns "faith" and "works." AT: "if someone says he believes in God but he does not do what God commands" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Can that faith save him?** - James is using a rhetorical question to teach his audience. This can be restated to remove the abstract noun "faith." AT: "That faith cannot save him." or "If a person does not do what God commands, then just saying he believes in God will not save him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **save him** - "spare him from God's judgment"
  * **stay warm** - This means either "have enough clothes to wear" or "have a place to sleep." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **be filled** - The thing that fills them is food. This can be stated explicitly. AT: "be filled with food" or "have enough to eat" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **for the body** - to eat, to wear, and to live comfortably (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **what good is that?** - James uses a rhetorical question to teach his audience. AT: "that is not good." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **brother or sister** - a fellow believer in Christ, whether male or female
  * **faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead** - James speaks of faith as if it were alive if one does good works, and of faith as if it were dead if one does not do good deeds. This can be restated to remove the abstract nouns "faith" and "works." AT: "a person who says he believes God, but does not do what God commands, does not really believe God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
