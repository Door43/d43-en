\v 25 Similarly, it was certainly \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add because of\add* what Rahab did, that \add God\add* considered her to be a righteous, \add obedient\add* person. Rahab was \add previously\add* a prostitute, but she cared for the Israelite men who came \add to\add* \add spy out the land\f + \ft Or: see what that area was like\add* \f* and she \add helped them to escape by\add* sending them home on a different road\add from the one that they came on\add*.
\p
\v 26 Remember that when our spirits \add permanently leave our\add* bodies, \add our bodies\add* are dead \add and useless\add*. Similarly \f + \ft simile \f*, \add if someone says\add*, "I trust \add in God\add*," but does not do \add things to help others, what that person says about trusting in God\add* is useless."

\v 25 Similarly, it was certainly because of what Rahab did that God considered her to be good. Rahab had been a prostitute, but she cared for the messengers who came to spy out the land, and she helped them to escape by sending them home on a different road from the one that they came on.
\p
\v 26 Just as when a person no longer breathing is dead and his body is useless, in the same way, someone who says he trusts in God but does nothing good trusts in God uselessly.

\v 25 In the same way also, was not Rahab the prostitute justified by works, when she welcomed the messengers and sent them away by another road?
\v 26 For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, likewise also, faith apart from works is dead.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **In the same way also ... justified by works** - James says that what was true of Abraham was also true of Rahab. Both were justified by works.
  * **was not Rahab the prostitute justified by works ... another road?** - James is using this rhetorical question to instruct his audience. AT: "it was what Rahab the prostitute did that justified her ... another road." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Rahab the prostitute** - The woman Rahab is from an Old Testament story that James expected his audience to know.
  * **justified by works** - James speaks of works as something to possess. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **messengers** - people who bring news from another place
  * **sent them away by another road** - "then helped them escape the city"
  * **For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, likewise also, faith apart from works is dead** - James is speaking of faith without works as if it were a dead body without the spirit. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
