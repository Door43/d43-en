\v 25 Similarly, it was certainly \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add because of\add* what Rahab did, that \add God\add* considered her to be a righteous, \add obedient\add* person. Rahab was \add previously\add* a prostitute, but she cared for the Israelite men who came \add to\add* \add spy out the land\f + \ft Or: see what that area was like\add* \f* and she \add helped them to escape by\add* sending them home on a different road\add from the one that they came on\add*.
\p
\v 26 Remember that when our spirits \add permanently leave our\add* bodies, \add our bodies\add* are dead \add and useless\add*. Similarly \f + \ft simile \f*, \add if someone says\add*, "I trust \add in God\add*," but does not do \add things to help others, what that person says about trusting in God\add* is useless."

\v 25 Similarly, it was certainly because of what Rahab did that God considered her to be good. Rahab had been a prostitute, but she cared for the messengers who came to spy out the land, and she helped them to escape by sending them home on a different road from the one that they came on.
\p
\v 26 Just as when a person no longer breathing is dead and his body is useless, in the same way, someone who says he trusts in God but does nothing good--that person trusts in God uselessly.

\v 26 For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, likewise faith apart from works is dead.
