\v 21 It was certainly\add because of\add* what our \add revered\add* ancestor Abraham did, when he \add prepared to\add* sacrifice his son Isaac, that he was considered \add by God\add* \f + \ft Or:that \add God\add* considered him \f* to be a righteous, \add obedient\add* person.\f + \ft Or: Was it not \add because of\add* what our \add revered\add* ancestor Abraham did, when he \add prepared to\add* sacrifice his son Isaac, that he was considered \add by God\add* \f + \ft Or:that \add God\add* considered him \f* to be a righteous, \add obedient\add* person? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 22 You\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* can realize that he was not only trusting \add in God\add*, but he was also doing \add what God told him to do\add*, and \add you\f + \ft singular \f* can realize\add* that he was able to trust \add in God more\add* completely because of having done \add what God told him to do\add*.
\v 23 And \add so it happened as it is written in the\add* Scriptures: 'Because Abraham truly trusted in God, he was considered \add by God\add* to be \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* considered that he was \f* righteous.' And \add God also\add* said \add about Abraham\add*, "He is my friend."
\v 24 \add From the example of Abraham\add*, you can realize that it is because people do good deeds that \add God\add* considers them to be righteous, and not only because they trust \add in him\add*.

\v 21 We all honor Abraham, our ancestor. He tried to obey what God told him to do; he tried to give his son Isaac to God on the altar. God considered Abraham to be a righteous person for trying to obey him.
\v 22 In this way, Abraham trusted in God and obeyed him. When he obeyed him, he finished doing what he was trusting God for.
\v 23 And so it happened as it is written in the scriptures, "Because Abraham truly trusted in God, God viewed him as someone who did the right thing." God also said about Abraham, "He is my friend."
\v 24 From the example of Abraham you can realize that it is because people do good deeds that God considers them to be righteous, and not only because they trust in him.

<usfm>
\v 21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?
\v 22 You see that faith worked with his works, and that by works his faith was fully developed.
\v 23 The scripture was fulfilled that says, "Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness." And he was called a friend of God.
\v 24 You see that it is by works that a man is justified, and not only by faith.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Since these were Jewish believers, they knew the story of Abraham, about whom God had told them long ago in his word.

  * **Was not Abraham our father justified** - This rhetorical question is used to rebut the foolish man's arguments from  [[:en:bible:notes:jas:02:18|2:18]], who refuses to believe that faith and works go together. AT: "Abraham our father was certainly justified" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * ** justified by works** - James speaks of works as if it were an object that one can own. AT: "justified by doing good deeds" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **father** - Here "father" is used in the sense of "ancestor."
  * **You see** - The word "you" is singular, referring to the hypothetical man. James is addressing his whole audience as if they were one person.
  * **You see** - The word "see" is a metonym. AT: "understand" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **faith worked with his works** - James speaks of faith as if it does good works. Abraham's faith in God regarding Isaac enabled Abraham to obey God when it was difficult. By obeying God, Abraham's faith matured. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **by works his faith was fully developed** - Abraham's trusting in God is spoken of as if it were something that could be brought to its finest state so that it could fulfill its complete purpose. AT: "because Abraham obeyed God, he came to trust in God completely" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **The scripture was fulfilled** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "This fulfilled the scripture" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **it was counted to him as righteousness** - "God regarded his faith as righteousness." Abraham's faith and righteousness were treated as if they were able to be counted as having value. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **You see** - James again addresses his audience directly by using the plural form of "you."
  * **it is by works that a man is justified, and not only by faith** - "actions and faith are what justify a person, and not only faith." James speaks of works as if it were an object to obtain. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
