\v 18 But someone may say \add to me\add*, "\add God saves\add* some people only \add because\add* they trust \add in him\add*, and \add he saves\add* others \add because\add* they do good deeds \add to people\add*." \add I would answer that person\add*, "\add You\f + \ft singular \f* cannot\add* prove to me that people truly trust \add in God if\add* they do not do good deeds \add to others\add*! But by doing good deeds \add to others\add* I will prove to you that I truly trust \add in God\add*!
\v 19 \add Think about it\add*! You believe that there is only one God, and you are right \add to believe that\add*. But the demons also believe that, but they tremble \add because they know that God is going to punish them\add*.
\v 20 Also, you foolish person, I will \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* prove to you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* that \add if someone says\add*, 'I trust \add in God\add*,' but he does not do good deeds, \add what that person says\add* will not benefit him.

\v 18 But someone may say to me, "God saves some people only because they trust in him, and he saves others because they do good deeds for people." I would answer that person, "You cannot prove to me that people truly trust in God if they do not do good deeds for others! But by doing good deeds for others I will prove to you that I truly trust in God!
\v 19 Think about it! You believe that there is only one real God who truly lives, and you are right to believe that. But the demons also believe that, and they tremble because they also know that God truly lives, and that He will punish them.
\v 20 Also, you foolish person, I will prove to you that if someone says, "I trust in God," but that if he does not do good deeds, what that person says will not help him.

\v 18 Yet someone will say, "You have faith, and I have works." Show me your faith without works, and I will show you my faith by my works.
\v 19 You believe that there is one God; you are right. But the demons also believe that and tremble.
\v 20 Do you even want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is useless?
