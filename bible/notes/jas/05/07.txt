\v 7 So, my brothers and sisters, although rich people cause you to suffer, be patient until the Lord Jesus Christ comes back. Remember that when farmers plant a field, they wait for their valuable crops to grow. They must wait patiently for the rain that comes at the planting season and for more rain that comes just before the harvest season. They wait for the crops to grow and mature before they can harvest them.
\v 8 Similarly, you also should wait patiently and trust the Lord Jesus firmly, because he is coming back soon and will judge all people fairly.

\v 7 Therefore be patient, brothers, until the coming of the Lord, like the farmer awaits the valuable harvest of the earth, waiting patiently for it, until the early and late rains fall.
\v 8 You too be patient; fix your hearts, because the coming of the Lord is near.
