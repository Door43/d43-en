\v 1 Now I have something to say to the rich people who do not believe in Christ and who oppress you! Listen to me, you rich people! You should weep and wail loudly because you will experience terrible troubles!
\v 2 Your wealth is worthless, as though it were rotted. Your fine clothes are worthless, as though termites had ruined them.
\v 3 Your gold and silver are worthless, as though they were corroded. When God judges you, this worthless wealth of yours will be evidence that you are guilty of being greedy, and as rust and fire destroy things, God will severely punish you. You have in vain stored up wealth in a time when God is about to judge you.

\v 2 Your riches have rotted and your clothes are moth-eaten.
\v 3 Your gold and your silver have become worthless, and their corrosion will testify against you and consume your flesh like fire. You have hoarded your treasure in the last days.
