\v 1 Now I have something to say to the rich people who do not believe in Christ and who oppress you! Listen to me, you rich people! You should weep and wail loudly because you will experience terrible troubles!
\v 2 Your wealth is worthless, as though it were rotted. Your fine clothes are worthless, as though termites had ruined them.
\v 3 Your gold and silver are worthless, as though they were corroded. When God judges you, this worthless wealth of yours will be evidence that you are guilty of being greedy, and as rust and fire destroy things, God will severely punish you. You have in vain stored up wealth in a time when God is about to judge you.

\v 1 Come now, you who are rich, cry out loud because of the miseries coming upon you.
\v 2 Your riches have rotted and your clothes are moth-eaten.
\v 3 Your gold and your silver have become worthless, and their corrosion will testify against you and consume your flesh like fire. You have hoarded your treasure in the last days.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **you who are rich -**  This is not the rich group of believers as in 1:10. Here, James is talking to rich people who do not honor God. This can be made explicit: "you who are rich and do not honor God." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the miseries coming upon you** - When this is coming upon the rich people can be made explict: "the terrible things coming to you when God judges everyone."
  * **Your riches have rotted and your clothes are moth-eaten. Your gold and your silver have become worthless** - James does not mean these riches and clothes are already ruined physically.  He is showing they have no spiritual value in the present and they will certainly only last for a little while. This could be translated as "all the things you thought were valuable and made you important are worthless and will only last for a little while."
  * **and their corrosion will testify against you** - Here, "will testify against your" describes these ruined treasures as a person who goes before a judge and accuses a person of breaking the law.  This could be translated as "and when God judges you all of your ruined treasures will be like a person accusing you." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  *  **and consume your flesh like fire** - Here, the ruined treasures are compared to a fire that destroys everything. Also, "fire" is a metaphor that refers to God's punishment. This could be translated as "and they will be the reason God punishes you." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **hoarded your treasure** - "you have kept all these treasures to yourself and would not share with others"
  * **in the last days** - This is a metonym that refers to the time right before God comes to judge all people. This could be translated as "when God is about to judge you" (UDB) (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
