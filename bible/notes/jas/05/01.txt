\v 1 Now I have something to say to the rich people who do not believe in Christ and who oppress you! Listen to me, you rich people! You should weep and wail loudly because you will experience terrible troubles!
\v 2 Your wealth is worthless, as though it were rotted. Your fine clothes are worthless, as though moths had ruined them.
\v 3 Your gold and silver are worthless, as though they were corroded. When God judges you, this worthless wealth of yours will be evidence that you are guilty of being greedy, and as rust and fire destroy things, God will severely punish you. You have in vain stored up wealth in a time when God is about to judge you.

\v 1 Come now, you who are rich, weep and wail because of the miseries coming on you.
\v 2 Your riches have rotted, and your clothes have become moth-eaten.
\v 3 Your gold and your silver have corroded. Their corrosion will be a witness against you. It will consume your flesh like fire. You have stored up your treasure for the last days.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - James warns the believers against caring about pleasure and riches.

  * **you who are rich** - Here James is talking to rich people who do not honor God. AT: "you who are rich and do not honor God." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **because of the miseries coming on you** - Here James speaks of the fact that these people will suffer terribly in the future. He speaks about this as if their sufferings were objects that were coming toward them. AT: "because you will suffer terribly in the future" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Your riches have rotted, and your clothes have become moth-eaten. Your gold and your silver have corroded** - James speaks of these events and conditions as if they had already happened. He is implying that these riches have no spiritual value in the present, and that they will last for only a little while. Corrosion is similar to rust, except that rust happens to iron and steel, whereas corrosion happens to copper and some other metals. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pastforfuture]]) AT: "your riches are as good as rotten, and your clothes are as good as moth-eaten," "your riches and your clothes are already worthless"
  * **riches ... clothes** - These things are mentioned as examples of everything that is valuable to wealthy people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Their corrosion will be a witness against you** - Corrosion is the name given to the natural destruction of certain kinds of metal. James is speaking of this destruction as if it were a person in a courtroom accusing the wicked of their crimes. AT: "and when God judges you, all of your ruined treasures will be like someone who accuses you in court." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **will consume ... like fire** - Here the corrosion is spoken of as if it were a fire that will burn up their owners. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **fire** - The idea of fire here is meant to lead people to remember that fire often stands for God's punishment that will come on all the wicked. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **your flesh** - Here, "your flesh" stands for "your body." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **for the last days** - This refers to the time right before God comes to judge all people. The wicked think they are storing up riches for the future, when they will need them. But they do not know that it is in the future when God will judge them. AT: "when God is about to judge you" (UDB).  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
