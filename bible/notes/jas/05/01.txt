\v 1 Now I have something to say to you rich people who say you believe in Christ. Listen to me! You should weep and wail loudly because you will experience terrible troubles!
\v 2 Your wealth is worthless, as though it were rotted. Your fine clothes are worthless, as though moths had ruined them.
\v 3 Your gold and silver are worthless, as though they were corroded. When God judges you, this worthless wealth of yours will be evidence that you are guilty of being greedy, and as rust and fire destroy things, God will severely punish you. You have in vain stored up wealth in a time when God is about to judge you.

\v 1 Come now, you who are rich, weep and wail because of the miseries coming on you.
\v 2 Your riches have rotted, and your clothes have become moth-eaten.
\v 3 Your gold and your silver have become tarnished and their rust will be a witness against you. It will consume your flesh like fire. You have stored up your treasure for the last days.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - James warns rich people about their focus on pleasure and riches.

  * **you who are rich** - Possible meanings are 1) James is giving a strong warning to wealthy believers or 2) James is talking about wealthy unbelievers. AT: "you who are rich and say you honor God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **because of the miseries coming on you** - James states that these people will suffer terribly in the future and writes as if their sufferings were objects that were coming toward them. The abstract noun "miseries" can be translated as a verb. AT: "because you will suffer terribly in the future" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Your riches have rotted, and your clothes have become moth-eaten. Your gold and your silver have become tarnished** - Earthly riches do not last nor do they have any eternal value. James speaks of these events as if they had already happened. AT: "Your riches will rot, and your clothes will be eaten by moths. Your gold and silver will become tarnished" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pastforfuture]])
  * **riches ... clothes ... gold ... silver** - These things are mentioned as examples of things that are valuable to wealthy people.
  * **have become tarnished ... their rust** - These phrases are used here to describe how gold and silver are ruined. AT: "are ruined ... their ruined condition" or "are corroded ... their corrosion"
  * **their rust will be a witness against you. It** - James wrote of their valuable things being ruined as if they were a person in a courtroom accusing the wicked of their crimes. AT: "and when God judges you, your ruined treasures will be like someone who accuses you in court. Their corrosion" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] )
  * **will consume ... like fire** - Here the corrosion is spoken of as if it were a fire that will burn up their owners. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **your flesh** - Here "flesh" stands for the physical body. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **fire** - The idea of fire here is meant to lead people to remember that fire often stands for God's punishment that will come on all the wicked. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **for the last days** - This refers to the time right before God comes to judge all people. The wicked think they are storing up riches for the future, but what they are doing is storing up judgment. AT: "for when God is about to judge you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
