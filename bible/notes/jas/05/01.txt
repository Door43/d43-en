\v 1 Now I have something to say to you rich people who say you believe in Christ. Listen to me! You should weep and wail loudly because you will experience terrible troubles!
\v 2 Your wealth is worthless, as though it were rotted. Your fine clothes are worthless, as though moths had ruined them.
\v 3 Your gold and silver are worthless, as though they were corroded. When God judges you, this worthless wealth of yours will be evidence that you are guilty of being greedy, and as rust and fire destroy things, God will severely punish you. You have in vain stored up wealth in a time when God is about to judge you.

\v 1 Come now, you who are rich, weep and wail because of the miseries coming on you.
\v 2 Your riches have rotted, and your clothes have become moth-eaten.
\v 3 Your gold and your silver have corroded. Their corrosion will be a witness against you. It will consume your flesh like fire. You have stored up your treasure for the last days.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - James warns rich people about thier focus on pleasure and riches.

  * **you who are rich** - Possible meanings are 1) James is giving a strong warning to wealthy believers or 2) James is talking about wealthy unbelievers. AT: "you who are rich and say you honor God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **because of the miseries coming on you** - James states that these people will suffer terribly in the future and as if their sufferings were objects that were coming toward them. AT: "because you will suffer terribly in the future" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Your riches have rotted, and your clothes have become moth-eaten. Your gold and your silver have corroded** - James speaks of these events as if they had already happened. James states that earthly riches do not last nor do they have any eternal value.  AT: "your riches are as good as rotten, your clothes are as good as moth-eaten, and your gold and silver are as good as corroded" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pastforfuture]])
  * **riches ... clothes ... gold** - These things are mentioned as examples of everything that is valuable to wealthy people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Their corrosion will be a witness against you** - "Corrosion" is the generic term that describes the natural decomposition of metal. James is speaking of this destruction as if it were a person in a courtroom accusing the wicked of their crimes. AT: "And when God judges you, all of your ruined treasures will be like someone who accuses you in court" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **will consume ... like fire** - Here the corrosion is spoken of as if it were a fire that will burn up their owners. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **your flesh** - Here "flesh" stands for the physical body. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **fire** - The idea of fire here is meant to lead people to remember that fire often stands for God's punishment that will come on all the wicked. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **for the last days** - This refers to the time right before God comes to judge all people. The wicked think they are storing up riches for the future, but what they are doing is storing up judgment. AT: "for when God is about to judge you"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
