\v 13 Is anyone among you suffering? He must pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praise.
\v 14 Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let the elders pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord,
\v 15 and the prayer of faith will deliver the sick person, and the Lord will raise him up. If he has committed sin, God will forgive him.
