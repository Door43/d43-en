\v 13 Is anyone among you suffering hardship? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praise.
\v 14 Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him. Let them anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord.
\v 15 The prayer of faith will heal the sick person, and the Lord will raise him up. If he has committed sins, God will forgive him.
