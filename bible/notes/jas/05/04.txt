\v 4 Think about what you have done. You did not pay the wages you promised to the workmen who harvested your fields for you. The pay you kept for yourself shows me your guilt and how unfair you were to them. The workers cry out to God, for how you treat them. And God, the all-powerful Lord, listens to their loud cries.
\v 5 You have bought anything you wanted so you could live like kings. Just like cattle fatten themselves, not realizing that they will be slaughtered, you have lived just to enjoy things, not realizing that God will severely punish you.
\v 6 You have arranged for others to condemn innocent people. You have arranged for others to kill people, even though those people had not done anything wrong. They were not able to defend themselves against you. My brothers and sisters, that is what I say to the rich people who oppress you.

\v 4 Look, the pay of the laborers—those you have not paid for harvesting your fields—cries out! And the cries of those who harvested your crops have reached the ears of the Lord of Armies.
\v 5 You have lived in luxury on the earth and indulged yourselves. You have fattened your hearts for a day of slaughter.
\v 6 You have condemned and killed the righteous man, the one who does not resist you.

===== Translation Notes: =====

James continues his rebuke toward the rich Jews who think they are believers but are not acting as true believers.

  * **the pay of the laborers who harvested your fields—those you have not paid** - The attention is first given to the pay or wages that was was not paid. AT: "the fact that you did not pay those you hired to work in your field, it is an indictment against you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **And the cries of the reapers** - AT: "you have not paid the laborers who harvested your fields and they cry out for their pay"
  * **reached the ears of the Lord of Armies**- AT: "and the Lord of Armies has heard the cries of those who worked in your fields" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **You have fattened your hearts for a day of slaughter**  - This compares the rich person's greed and desire for more things to a cow that eats until it is fat enough to be killed for food. AT: "Your greed has only prepared you for harsh eternal judgment." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **the righteous man** - "the one who does what is right"
  * **does not resist you** - "does not oppose you"
