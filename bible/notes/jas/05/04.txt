\v 4 Think about what you have done. You have not paid wages to the workmen who have harvested your fields for you. Now those reapers are crying out to God for him to help them. And God, the all-powerful Lord, has heard their loud cries.
\v 5 You have bought anything you wanted so you could live like kings. Just like cattle fatten themselves, not realizing that they will be slaughtered, you have lived just to enjoy things, not realizing that God will severely punish you.
\v 6 You have arranged for others to condemn innocent people. You have arranged for others to kill people, even though those people had not done anything wrong. They were not able to defend themselves against you. My brothers and sisters, that is what I say to the rich people who oppress you.

\v 4 Look, the pay of the laborers who harvested your fields, whom you have not paid, cries out! And the cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord of Armies.
\v 5 You have lived in luxury on the earth and indulged yourselves. You have fattened your hearts for a day of slaughter.
\v 6 You have condemned and killed the righteous man, the one who does not resist you.

===== Translation Notes: =====
James continues his rebuke towards the rich Jews who think they are believers but are not acting as true believers.

  * **Look** - The word “look” here adds emphasis to what follows. AT: "Think about this."
  * **the pay of the laborers…cries out** - Here, "the pay" is refers to a person who cries out. AT: "the laborers…cry out." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **the pay of the laborers...cries out!** - AT: "you have not paid the laborer who harvested your fields and they cry out for their pay" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_order]])
  * **And the cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord of Armies.** - AT: "And the Lord of Armies have heard the cries of the reapers." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the ears of the Lord of Armies** - James use the phrase "the ears" to refer to the Lord. AT: "The Almighty Lord has heard the cries of the reapers." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **You have lived in luxury on the earth and indulged yourselves** - "You have more money and possessions than anyone could ever need."
  * **You have fattened your hearts for a day of slaughter**  - This compares the rich person's greed and desire for more things to a cow that eats until it is fat enough to be killed for food. AT: "Your greed has only prepared you for harsh eternal judgment." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the righteous man**  - "the one who does what is right"
  * **does not resist you** - "does not oppose you"
