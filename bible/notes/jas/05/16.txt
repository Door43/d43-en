\v 16 Therefore confess your sins to one another, and pray one for another, that you may be healed. The prayer of the righteous produces great effects.
\v 17 Elijah was a man with feelings just like us. He prayed fervently that it would not rain, and it did not rain in the land for three years and six months.
\v 18 And again Elijah prayed, and the heavens poured rain on the land and the earth produced the harvest.
