\v 12 Also, my fellow believers, \add I want to say\add* something important \add about how you talk\add*. \add If you say that you will do something\add*, do not say, "If I do not do it, may \add God in\add* heaven \f + \ft metonymy \f* punish me." Do not even say, "If I do not do it, may \add someone here on\add* earth \f + \ft metonymy \f* punish me." Do not say anything like that. Instead, if you say 'Yes,' then \add do what you said that you would do\add*. If you say 'No,' then do not \add do it\add*. Otherwise, \add God\add* will condemn you.

\v 12 Also, my brothers and sisters, I want to say something important about how you talk. If you say that you will do something, do not say, "If I do not do it, may God in heaven punish me." Do not even say, "If I do not do it, may someone here on earth punish me." Do not say anything like that. Instead, if you say "yes," then do what you said that you would do. If you say "no," then do not do it. Otherwise, God will judge you.

\v 12 Above all, my brothers, do not swear, either by heaven or by the earth, or by any other oath. Instead, let your "Yes" mean "Yes" and your "No" mean "No," so you do not fall under judgment.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Above all** - "This is important" or "Especially"
  * **my brothers** - "my fellow believers"
  * **do not swear** - To "swear" is to say that you will do something, or that something is true, and to be held accountable by a higher authority. AT: "do not make an oath" or "do not make a vow"
  * **either by heaven or by the earth** - The words "heaven" and "earth" refer to the spiritual or human authorities that are in heaven and earth. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **your "Yes" mean "Yes" and your "No" mean "No,"** - AT: "do what you say you will do without making an oath"
  * **so you do not fall under judgment** - Being condemned is spoken of as if one had fallen, crushed by the weight of something heavy. AT: "so God will not punish you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
