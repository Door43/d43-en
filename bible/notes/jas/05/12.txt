\v 12 Also, my fellow believers, \add I want to say\add* something important \add about how you talk\add*. \add If you say that you will do something\add*, do not say, "If I do not do it, may \add God in\add* heaven \f + \ft metonymy \f* punish me." Do not even say, "If I do not do it, may \add someone here on\add* earth \f + \ft metonymy \f* punish me." Do not say anything like that. Instead, if you say 'Yes,' then \add do what you said that you would do\add*. If you say 'No,' then do not \add do it\add*. Otherwise, \add God\add* will condemn you.

\v 12 Also, my brothers and sisters, I want to say something important about how you talk. If you say that you will do something, do not say, "If I do not do it, may God in heaven  punish me." Do not even say, “If I do not do it, may someone here on earth punish me.” Do not say anything like that. Instead, if you say "yes," then do what you said that you would do. If you say "no," then do not do it. Otherwise, God will judge you.

\v 12 Above all, my brothers, do not swear, either by heaven or by the earth, or by any other oath. But let your "Yes" mean "Yes" and your "No" mean "No,"  so you will not fall under judgment.
