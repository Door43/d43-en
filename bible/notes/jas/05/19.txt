\v 19 My fellow believers, if anyone of you stops obeying the true message \add from God\add*, someone from among you should persuade that person to once again do \add what God has told us to do\add*. \add If he stops doing what is wrong\add*,
\v 20 the one \add who persuaded him\add* should realize that \add because\add* he has enabled the person who was sinning to stop doing what is wrong, \add God\add* will save that person from \add spiritual\add* death\f + \ft Or: being separated from him forever \f*, and will forgive \add his\add* many sins.

\v 19 My brothers and sisters, if anyone of you stops obeying the true message from God, some other person among you should persuade that person to once again do what God has told us to do. If he stops doing what is wrong,
\v 20 all of you should remember that because of that other person, God will save the sinner from spiritual death and will forgive his many sins.

\v 19 My brothers, if anyone among you wanders from the truth, and someone brings him back,
\v 20 that person should know that whoever turns a sinner from his wandering way will save him from death, and will cover over a great number of sins.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **brothers** - Here this word probably refers to both men and women. AT: "fellow believers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_gendernotations]])
  * **if anyone among you wanders from the truth, and someone brings him back** - A believer who stops trusting in God and obeying him is spoken of as if he were a sheep that wandered away from the flock. The person who persuades him to trust in God again is spoken of as if he were a shepherd who went to search for the lost sheep. AT: "whenever anyone stops obeying God, and another person helps him start obeying again" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **whoever turns a sinner from his wandering way ... will cover over a great number of sins** - James means that God will use the actions of this person to persuade the sinner to repent and be saved. But James speaks as if it were this other person who actually saved the sinner's soul from death. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **will save him from death, and will cover over a great number of sins** - Here "death" refers to spiritual death, eternal separation from God. AT: "will save him from spiritual death, and God will forgive the sinner for all of his sins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **will cover over a great number of sins** - Possible meanings are 1) the person who brings back the disobedient brother will have his sins forgiven or 2) the disobedient brother, when he returns to the Lord, will have his sins forgiven. Sins are spoken of as if they were objects that God could cover so that he would not see them, so that he would forgive them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
