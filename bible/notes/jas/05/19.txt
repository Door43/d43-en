\v 19 My brothers and sisters, if anyone of you stops obeying the true message from God, someone from among you should persuade that person to once again do what God has told us to do. If he stops doing what is wrong,
\v 20 the one who persuaded him should realize that because he has enabled the person who was sinning to stop doing what is wrong, God will save that person from spiritual death, and will forgive his many sins.

\v 19 My brothers, if anyone among you strays from the truth, but someone leads him back,
\v 20 let him know that whoever leads a sinner out of the error of his way will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **brothers** - "fellow believers"
  * **if anyone among you strays from the truth, but someone leads him back** - This is a metaphor that compares a believer who stops obeying God with a sheep that walks off the road and goes a different direction than the flock. The fellow believer who helps him start obeying again is the shepherd who brings the sheep back to the correct road. AT: "if anyone stops obeying God, but another person helps him start obeying again." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **let him know** - "let the one who leads him back know"
  * **leads a sinner out of the error of his way** - "helps a sinner stop living in a way that does not honor God"
  * **will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins** - Here James uses the word "soul" to show this "death" is more than just physical death. The word "soul" refers to the person who is sinning. Here "death" refers to spiritual death. AT: "will save the sinner from spiritual death, and God will forgive the sinner for all of his sins." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
