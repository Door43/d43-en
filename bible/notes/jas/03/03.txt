===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 3 To illustrate, if we put a small metal bit into the mouth of a horse in order to cause the horse to obey us, we can turn the horse's large body and cause it to go where we want it to. \v 4 Think also about ships. Although a ship may be very large and although it can be moved by strong winds, by turning a very small rudder people can direct the ship wherever they want it to go. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 3 Now if we put the horses’ bits into their mouths they obey us, and we can turn their whole bodies. \v 4 Notice also that ships, although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot desires to turn. </usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Now if we put the horses' bits** - James compares These are two metaphors that describe how small things can have power over something bigger. James is using these metaphors to show how what people say affects their lives and the lives of everyone they know. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **Now if**  - "if" or "when"
  * **the horses' bits into their mouths**  - "bits into horses' mouths"
  * **horse **- This is a large animal used to carry things.
  * **bits**  - A small piece of metal placed in the horse's mouth to control where it goes.
  * **Notice also that ships**- A "ship" is like a truck that floats on water.
  * **they are so large**  - The word "they" refers to the ships.
  * **are driven by strong winds**  - This can be translated as an active clause: "strong winds push them" (See: [[:en:ta:translate:active|Active or Passive]])
  * **are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot desires to turn**  - This can be translated as an active clause: "have a small rudder that a person can use to control where the ship goes"
  * **rudder **- a small piece of wood or metal at the back of a ship used to control where it goes. It can also be translated as "tool."
