\v 3 To illustrate, if we put a small metal bit into the mouth of a horse in order to cause the horse to obey us, we can turn the horse's large body and cause it to go where we want it to.
\v 4 Think also about ships. Although a ship may be very large and although it can be moved by strong winds, by turning a very small rudder people can direct the ship wherever they want it to go.

\v 3 Now if we put the horses' bits into their mouths they obey us, and we can turn their whole bodies.
\v 4 Notice also that ships, although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot desires to turn.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Now if we put the horses' bits**  - James compares a person's tongue to a bit. A bit is a small piece of metal that is placed in a horse's mouth to control where it goes. This describes how small things can have power over something bigger. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Now if**  - "if" or "when"
  * **if we put the horses' bits into their mouths**  - A "horse" is a large animal used to carry things. AT: "if we put bits into horses' mouths."
  * **Notice also that ships…are steered by a very small rudder**- Next, James compares a person's tongue with a rudder on a ship. A "ship" is like a truck that floats on water. A "rudder" is a small piece of wood or metal at the back of the ship used to control where it goes. The word "rudder" could also be translated as "tool." James is making the same point as he was with the horse's bit. A small thing can have power over something much bigger.
  * **they are so large**  - The word "they" refers to the ships.
  * **are driven by strong winds** - AT: "strong winds push them" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot desires to turn** - AT: "have a small tool that a person can use to control where the ship goes"
