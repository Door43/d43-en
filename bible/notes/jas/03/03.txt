\v 3 To illustrate, if we put a small metal bit into the mouth of a horse in order to cause the horse to obey us, we can turn the horse's large body and cause it to go where we want it to.
\v 4 Think also about ships. Although a ship may be very large and although it can be moved by strong winds, by turning a very small rudder people can direct the ship wherever they want it to go.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Now if we put bits into horses' mouths for them to obey us, we can also direct their whole bodies.
\v 4 Notice also that ships, although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, are steered by a very small rudder to wherever the pilot desires.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - James is developing an argument for small things controlling big things.

  * **Now if we put bits into horses' mouths** - James speaks about horses' bits. A bit is a small piece of metal that is placed into a horse's mouth to control where it goes. 
  * **Now if** - "If" or "When"
  * **horses** - A horse is a large animal used to carry things or people.
  * **Notice also that ships ... are steered by a very small rudder** - A ship is like a truck that floats on water. A rudder is a flat board or metal at the back of the ship used to control where it goes. The word "rudder" could also be translated as "tool." 
  * **are driven by strong winds** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "strong winds push them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **are steered by a very small rudder to wherever the pilot desires** - "have a small tool that a person can use to control where the ship goes"
