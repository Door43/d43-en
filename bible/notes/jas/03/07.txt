===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 Although people are able to tame all kinds of wild animals, birds, reptiles and creatures that live in the water, and people have tamed them,
\v 8 no one is able to control what he says. The words we speak are an uncontrolled evil. Our words can do great harm, just like poison that kills.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 For every kind of wild animal, bird, reptile, and sea creature is being tamed and has been tamed by mankind.
\v 8 But no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For every kind of ... mankind** - The phrase "every kind" is a general statement referring to all or many kinds of wild animals. This can be stated in active form. AT: "People have learned to control many kinds of wild animals, birds, reptiles, and sea creatures" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **reptile** - This is an animal that crawls on the ground. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **sea creature** - an animal that lives in the sea
  * **But no human being can tame the tongue** - James speaks of the tongue as if it were a wild animal. Here "tongue" represents a person's desire to speak evil thoughts. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison** - James speaks of the harm that  people can cause by what they say as if the tongue were an evil and poisonous creature that can kill people. AT: "It is like a restless and evil creature, full of deadly poison" or "It is like a restless and evil creature that can kill people with its venom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
