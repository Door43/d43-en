===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 Although people are able to tame all kinds of wild animals, birds, reptiles and creatures that live in the water, and people have tamed them,
\v 8 no one is able to control what he says. The words we speak are an uncontrolled evil. Our words can do great harm, just like poison that kills.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 For every kind of wild animal, bird, reptile, and sea creature is being tamed and has been tamed by mankind.
\v 8 But as for the tongue, no one among man is able to tame it. It is an uncontrollable evil, full of deadly poison.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For every kind of ... mankind** - The phrase "every kind" is a general statement referring to all or many kinds of wild animals. This can be stated in active form. AT: "People have learned to control many kinds of wild animals, birds, reptiles, and sea creatures" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **reptile** - This is an animal that crawls on the ground. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **sea creature** - This is an animal that lives in water.
  * **But as for the tongue, no one among man is able to tame it** - James speaks of the tongue as if it were a wild animal. Here "tongue" represents a person's desire to speak evil thoughts. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **an uncontrollable evil** - The tongue is spoken of as if it were like evil, which no one can control. James is referring to a person's desire to speak evil thoughts.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **full of deadly poison** - James refers to one's ability to speak evil as if it were a poisonous snake or plant. The poison is the harm those words can inflict on another person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
