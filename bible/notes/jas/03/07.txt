\v 7 Indeed, although people are able to tame all kinds of wild animals, birds, reptiles and creatures that live in the water, and people have tamed them,
\v 8 no person on his own is able to control what he says. And when people speak evilly, it shows that they do evil things without controling themselves. As the poison of a snake kills people, we can harm others by what we say.

===== ULB: =====

\v 7 Every kind of wild animal, bird, reptile, and sea creature is being tamed and has been tamed by mankind,
\v 8 but no one among man is able to tame the tongue; it is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Every kind of wild animal, bird, reptile, and sea creature is being tamed and has been tamed by mankind**  - The phrase "every kind" is a hyperbole that means "many kinds." This can be translated as an active clause: "People have learned to control many kinds of wild animals, birds, reptiles, and sea creatures." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:hyperbole|Hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:translate:active|Active or Passive]])
  * **reptile **- This is an animal that crawls on the ground. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:translateunknowns|How to Translate Unknowns]])
  * **sea creature**  - This is an animal that lives in water.
  * **no one among man is able to tame the tongue**  - Here, the word "tongue" is a metonym that refers to what a person says. The full meaning can be stated explicitly: "no person without God's help can control the tongue." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metonymy|Metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]])
  * **restless evil, full of deadly poison**  - This is a metaphor which describes how a person can use their spoken words to hurt someone. It can be translated as "like an evil creature that never sleeps and it is ready to attack." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor|Metaphor]])
