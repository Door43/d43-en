\v 1 My brothers and sisters, not many of you should desire to become teachers of God's word, because you know that God will judge us teachers more severely than he will judge other people.
\v 2 In many ways we do what is wrong. But those who control what they say will be all that God intends them to be. They will be able to control all their actions.

\v 1 Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive greater judgment.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **many of you** - The word "you" refers to James' audience. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]]).
  * **my brothers **- "my fellow believers"
  * **knowing that** - "because"
  * **we will receive greater judgment**  - The reason God will judge teachers can be translated with additional explicit information as "God will judge us more severely because we have no excuses when we sin since we know and understand his word better than other people." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **we will receive** - James is grouping those who teach the scriptures with him. Though some of the believers who would receive this letter would be teachers of the scripture, most would not. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **For we all stumble** - James is back to including all of his audience. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
  * **stumble in various ways**  - This is a metaphor which compares a person's moral failures to a person falling down as he walks down a road. This could be translated as "fail" or "sin." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **does not stumble in his words** - "does not sin in the words he speaks"
  * **he is a perfect man** - "he is spiritually mature"
  * **control his whole body** - James is referring to his heart, emotions, his actions. It can be translated as " control his behavior" or "control his action." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
