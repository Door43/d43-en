\v 15 Those who think like this are not wise as God wants them to be. Instead, they are only thinking and acting as people who do not honor him. They think and act according to their own evil desires. They do what the demons want them to do.
\v 16 Remember that people who think like this do not control themselves. They envy other people and act as if what they were doing were right, but it is wrong. They do every sort of evil.
\v 17 God in heaven makes us wise. First of all, he teaches us to be morally pure. He teaches us how to make peace with others. He teaches us to be kind to others and to help them. He teaches to be kind to those who do not deserve it. He teaches us to do good things that have lasting results. He teaches us to never stop doing what is right and to be honest.
\v 18 Those who act peacefully toward others cause them to also act peacefully, with the result that they all live together and act in the right way.

\v 15 This is not the wisdom that comes down from above. Instead, it is earthly, unspiritual, demonic.
\v 16 For where there are jealousy and ambition, there is confusion and every evil practice.
\v 17 But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peace-loving, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere.
\v 18 The fruit of righteousness is sown in peace among those who make peace.
