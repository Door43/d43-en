\v 5 Similarly, \add although\add* our tongues are very small, \add if we do not control them\add*, we can \add harm\add* many people by what we proudly say \f + \ft metonymy \f*.

\v 5 Similarly, although our tongues are very small, if we do not control them, we can harm people by talking big. Think also about how just a small flame of fire can cause a large forest to burn.
\p
\v 6 Just like a fire burns a forest, when we say things that are evil, we can destroy many people. What we say reveals that there is much evil within us. What we say contaminates all that we think and do. Just like a flame of fire easily causes the whole surrounding area to burn, what we say can cause sons and daughters and their descendants to want to do evil for the rest of their lives. It is the devil himself who influences us to speak what is evil.

\v 5 Likewise the tongue is a small body part, yet boasts great things. Notice how great a forest is kindled by a spark!
\v 6 The tongue is also a fire, a world of sinfulness set among our body parts, which defiles the whole body and sets on fire the road of life, and itself is set on fire by hell.

  * [[en:obe:kt:boast|boasts]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sinfulness]]
  * [[en:obe:other:defile|defiles]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:hell|hell]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Likewise** - "In the same way." This compares the tongue to the horses' bits and the ships' rudders in the previous verses.
  * **boasts great things** - "a person can use it to speak very evil things"
  * **Notice how great**- "Think about how great"
  * **how great a forest is kindled by a spark!** - This can be translated as an active clause: "a small flame can start a fire that burns many trees!" (See:[[en:ta:translate:active]])
  * **tongue is also a fire** - Just as a fire consumes and destroys all it burns, the tongue, referring to what a person says (metonymy) can deeply hurt people (metaphor). Alternate translation: "the tongue is like a fire." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]] and [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]]) 
  * **a world of sinfulness set among our body parts** - Alternate translation: "It is a small part of our body but it is capable of sinning in all kinds of ways."
  * **which defiles the whole body** - This can be translated as a new sentence. "It can make us completely unpleasing to God" or "It can make us unacceptable to God." 
  * **and sets on fire the road of life** - The phrase "road of life" is a metaphor that refers to a person's entire life. This could be translated as "and it can ruin a person's entire life."
  * **and itself is set on fire by hell** - The word "itself" refers to the tongue. Also, here "hell" is a metonym that refers to the powers of evil or to the Devil. This could be translated as an active clause: "because the Devil uses it for evil."
