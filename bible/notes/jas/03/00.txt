====== James 03 General Notes ======


=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphors ==
The author uses many different [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|metaphors]] to convict his readers and to encourage them to display [[:en:obe:kt:godly|godliness]] in the way they speak.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Implicit information ==
The way a person speaks can be telling of their spiritual state. This is because it is an external behavior seen by other people. If a person is unable to control their actions when they are seen by others, they will not be able to control their actions when no one is looking. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]).
