\v 13 If any of you thinks that you are wise and know much, you should always act in a good way to show people that your good deeds are the result of your being truly wise. Being wise helps us to act gently toward others.
\v 14 But if you are very envious of other people  and lie against them and do them wrong, you should not pretend that you are wise. By boasting like that you are saying that what is true is actually false.
