\v 11 Surely bitter water and good water do not come out of the same spring!
\v 12 My brothers and sisters, a fig tree cannot produce olives. Nor can a grapevine produce figs. Neither can a salty spring produce good water. Similarly, we should speak only what is good, and we should not speak what is evil.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - After James stresses that the words of believers should not both bless and curse, he give examples from nature to describe this.

  * **Does a spring pour out both fresh and bitter water?** - James uses a rhetorical question to teach the readers about the logical order of nature. AT: "A spring does not pour out both fresh and bitter water." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **brothers** - "fellow believers"
  * **can a fig tree grow olives, or a grapevine grow figs?** - James uses another word picture to teach the readers about the logical order of nature. AT: "a fig tree cannot grow olives, nor can a grapevine grow figs." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
