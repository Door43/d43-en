===== Translation Notes: =====
After James stressed that our speech should not both bless and curse, he give examples from nature that do not do both.

  * **Does a spring pour out both fresh and bitter water?**  - James is using a rhetorical question to teach the readers about the logical order of nature. Alternate translation: "A spring does not pour out both fresh and bitter water." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **brothers**  - "fellow believers"
  * **can a fig tree grow olives, or a grapevine grow figs?**  -James uses another rhetorical question to teach the readers about the logical order of nature. Alternate translation: "a fig tree cannot grow olives, nor can a grapevine grow figs."
