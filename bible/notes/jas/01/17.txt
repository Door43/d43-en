\v 17 \add The truth is that God\add*, our heavenly Father \f + \ft metonymy \f*, does only what is good \f + \ft doublet \f* \add for us, in order to help us become\add* all that he intends us to be. He is not like all the things \add in the sky\add* that he created to give light\add , because they\add* change\add ; that is, they do not shine the same all the time\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 Every truly good and perfect gift comes from God the Father, who is in heaven. He is the true God who gives us light. God does not change like created things change, like shadows that appear and disappear. God never changes and He is always good!
\v 18 God chose to give us spiritual life when we trusted in his true message. So now believers in Jesus have become the first people to have true spiritual life, which only Jesus can give.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights. He does not change like shifting shadows. 
\v 18 God chose to give us life by the word of truth, so that we would be like firstfruits among his creatures.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Every good gift and every perfect gift** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. James uses them to emphasize that anything good that a person has comes from God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **from above ** - "from heaven"
  * **the Father of lights** - God is the creator of all the lights in the sky (sun, moon, and stars).
  * **He does not change like shifting shadows** - This is a simile that compares the unchanging God being a constant light to the changing and moving lights in the sky (sun, moon, and stars). AT: "God does not change like shadows that appear and disappear." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **to give us** - The word "us" refers to James and his audience (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]]). 
  * **give us life** - "give us spiritual life" (UDB)
  * **the word of truth** - "the Gospel" or "the teachings of Jesus"
  * **like firstfruits** - James is emphasizing that just like the first fruit of a crop, his audience was among the first believers of what would be many believers in the future. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **among his creatures** - "among his people"
