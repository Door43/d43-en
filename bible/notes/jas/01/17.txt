===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 Every truly good and perfect gift comes from God the Father, who is in heaven. He is the true God who gives us light. God does not change like created things change, like shadows that appear and disappear. God never changes and He is always good!
\v 18 God chose to give us spiritual life when we trusted in his true message. So now believers in Jesus have become the first people to have true spiritual life, which only Jesus can give.

\v 17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights. He does not change like shifting shadows. 
\v 18 God chose to give us life by the word of truth, so that we would be like firstfruits among his creatures.
