\v 14 But everyone wants to do evil, and so they do it, just as if they are falling into a trap.
\v 15 After that, their evil thoughts lead them to commit sin, and this sin takes over their minds until it destroys them.

Then, when evil desires come together, sin is born, which means the person commits sin and can only be forgiven by Jesus. And when sin produces its final result, death comes, both the death of the body and the death of the spirit, meaniing the sinner is separated from God forever. Only Jesus can save us from this final death.


\p
\v 16 My fellow believers whom I love, stop deceiving yourselves.

<usfm>
\v 14 But each person is tempted by his own desire, which drags him away and entices him.
\v 15 Then after the desire conceives, it gives birth to sin, and after the sin is full grown, it gives birth to death.
\v 16 Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **each person is tempted by his own desire** - A person's desire is spoken of as if it were someone else who was tempting him to sin. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **which drags him away and entices him** - Evil desire continues to be spoken of as if it were a person who could drag away someone else. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **entices** - attracts, persuades someone to do evil
  * **Then after the desire conceives, it gives birth to sin, and after the sin is full grown, it gives birth to death** - Desire continues to be spoken of as a person, this time clearly as a woman who becomes pregnant with a child. The child is identified as sin. Sin is another female baby that grows up, becomes pregnant, and gives birth to death. This chain of metaphors is a picture of someone who ends up dying both spiritually and physically because of his evil desires and his sin. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Do not be deceived** - "Do not let anyone deceive you" or "Stop deceiving yourselves"
