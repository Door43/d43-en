\v 14 But everyone wants to do evil, and so they do it, just as if they are falling into a trap.
\v 15 After that, their evil thoughts lead them to commit sin, and this sin takes over their minds until it destroys them.

Then, when evil desires come together, sin is born, which means the person commits sin and can only be forgiven by Jesus. And when sin produces its final result, death comes, both the death of the body and the death of the spirit, meaniing the sinner is separated from God forever. Only Jesus can save us from this final death.


\p
\v 16 My fellow believers whom I love, stop deceiving yourselves.

<usfm>
\v 14 Each person is tempted by his own evil desires which entice and drag him away.
\v 15 Then after sinful desires conceive, sin is born, and after sin is full grown it results in death. 
\v 16 Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers.

  * [[:en:obe:kt:tempt]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:evil]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:sin]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:death]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:deceive]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:beloved]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Each person is tempted by his own evil desires** - The desires to do evil are inside each person.
  * **which entice and drag him** - "which entice and lead him away"
  * **after sinful desires conceive, sin is born, and after sin is full grown it results in death** - "sinful desires," "sin," and "death" are given human attributes. Here "sinful desires" are being described as a female lover who leads a man away to sleep with her. "Sin" is their baby. "Death" results when the baby becomes a full-grown man. This also shows how evil desires give pleasure at first, but that pleasure turns into sin and eventually leads to both physical and spiritual death. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Do not be deceived** - "Do not let anyone deceive you" or "Stop deceiving yourselves" (UDB)
