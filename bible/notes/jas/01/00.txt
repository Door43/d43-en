====== James 01 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Temptation and testing==
These two words have a lot of overlap in their meaning. The translator should be aware that there are some significant differences between the meaning of "temptation" here ([[:en:bible:notes:jas:01:12|1:13]]) and God "testing" man ([[:en:bible:notes:heb:11:17|Hebrews 11:17]]). 

== Crowns ==
Crowns are a significant image used in Scripture. There are several Greek words translated as "crowns" in English. The crown referenced here is a type of reward. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:reward]])

== Light ==
Light is an important image used in Scripture. It is always used in a positive manner.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphors ==
James uses many metaphors in this chapter. They help to give his instructions a gentle, pastoral tone. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "God is not tempted" ==
This phrase can be difficult to understand in light of the fact that Jesus, true man and true God, was tempted in the wilderness. While Satan tried to tempt Jesus, he was not successful in persuading Jesus to sin. 

== "To the twelve tribes in dispersion" ==
It appears the author wrote this letter to Christians, but he also uses this phrase, which is more typically understood in reference to Jews. There is uncertainty as to its meaning. Since the author gives many practical instructions for holy living, it is likely that he is referring to Jews who are also Christians. When this letter was written the church was exclusively made up of Jews.
