<usfm>
\v 26 If anyone thinks himself to be religious, but if he does not control his tongue, he deceives his heart, and his religion is worthless.
\v 27 Clean and spotless religion before our God and Father is this: To help the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself spotless from the world.
