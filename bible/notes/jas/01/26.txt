<usfm>
\v 26 If anyone thinks himself to be religious, but if he does not control his tongue, he deceives his heart, and his religion is worthless.
\v 27 Religion that is pure and unspoiled before our God and Father is to help the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.
