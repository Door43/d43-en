<usfm>
\v 26 If anyone thinks himself to be religious, but he does not control his tongue, he deceives his heart and his religion is vain.
\v 27 Pure and undefiled religion before our God and Father is this, to help the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to protect oneself from the world's corruption.
