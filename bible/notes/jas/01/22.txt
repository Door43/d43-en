\v 22 Do \add what God commands in\add* his message. Do not only listen \add to it, because people who only listen to it and do not obey it\add* think wrongly \add that God will save them\add*.
\v 23 Some people hear God's message but do not do \add what it says\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. They are like someone who looks at his face in a mirror \f + \ft simile \f*.
\v 24 Although he looks at himself, he goes away \add from the mirror\add* and immediately forgets what he looks like.
\v 25 But other people look closely at \add God's\add* message, which is perfect and which sets people free \add to voluntarily do what God wants them to do\add*. And if they continue \add to examine God's message\add* and do not just hear it and then forget it, but do \add what God tells them to do\add*, God will bless them because of what they do.

<usfm>
\v 22 Obey the word, do not only hear it, deceiving your own selves.
\v 23 For if anyone hears the word and does not do it, he is like a man examining his natural face in a mirror.
\v 24 He examines his face, and goes away and soon forgets what he looked like.
\v 25 But the person who looks carefully into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and continues obeying it, not just being a hearer who forgets, this man will be blessed as he does it.
