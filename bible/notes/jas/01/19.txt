\v 19 My fellow believers whom I love, you know that every one of you should be eager to pay attention to God's true message. You should not quickly speak your own thoughts, nor quickly get angry,
\v 20 because when we get angry we cannot do the righteous things that God wants us to do.


\p
\v 21 So stop doing all kinds of evil, and humbly accept the message that God planted in your inner beings, because he is able to save you if you accept his message.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 You know this, my beloved brothers. Every man must be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger,
\v 20 for the anger of man does not work the righteousness of God.
\v 21 Therefore put away all sinful filth and the evil that is everywhere, and in humility receive the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **You know this** - Possible meaning are 1) "know this" as a command to pay attention to what I am about to write or 2) "You know this" as a statement that I am about to remind you of something that you already know.
  * **Every man must be swift to hear, slow to speak** - People should first listen intently, and then consider carefully what they say. 
  * **slow to anger ** - "do not get angry easily"
  * **the anger of man does not work the righteousness of God** - When a person gets angry he does not behave the way God desires. 
  * **put away all sinful filth and the evil** - Here the words "sinful filth" and "evil" share similar meanings. James uses them to emphasize how bad sin is. AT: "stop doing every kind of sinful behavior" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **in humility** - "without pride" or "without arrogance"
  * **receive the implanted word** - The word "implant" means to place one thing inside of another. This is a metaphor describing God's word as something planted inside of a person. AT: "obey the message God has spoken to you." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **save your souls**  - Here, the word "souls" is a synecdoche and refers to the entire person. Also, what a person is saved from can be made explicit. AT: "save you from God's judgment." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
