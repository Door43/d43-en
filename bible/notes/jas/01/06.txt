\v 6 But when you ask God, trust him to answer you. Do not doubt that he will answer and always help you, because people who keep doubting God cannot follow him, like a wave of the sea that is blown back and forth by the wind and thus cannot continue in the same direction.
\v 7 Indeed, people who doubt should not think that the Lord God will do anything that they request him to do.
\v 8 For they are people who cannot decide whether they will follow Jesus or not follow Jesus. These people do not do what they say they will do.

\v 6 But ask in faith, without doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave in the sea, driven by the wind and tossed around.
\v 7 For that person must not think that he will receive his request of the Lord;
\v 8 such a person is a doubleminded person, unstable in all his ways.
