===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 \add God\add* is pleased with the people who bravely\f + \ft Or: patiently \f* endure difficulties. And when, \add by bravely enduring difficulties\add*, they have proved \add that they truly trust him\add*, he will give them \add eternal\add* life. That is the reward \f + \ft metaphor \f* that he has promised to give to those who love him.


\p
\v 13 If people are tempted to do what is evil, they should not think that it is God who is tempting them, because \add God is totally\f + \ft Or: completely \f* good\add*. He never tempts anyone \add to do what is evil\add*, nor can he ever be tempted to \add do anything\add* evil.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 God honors those who endure hard trials, because God will reward them by making them live forever, as he has promised to do for all who love him.


\p
\v 13 When we are tempted to sin, we must not think it is God who is tempting us, because God never wants to do evil, and he never tempts anyone to do evil.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 Blessed is the man who endures testing, for after he has passed the test, he will receive the crown of life, which has been promised to those who love God.
\v 13 No one should say when he is tempted, "This temptation is from God," because God is not tempted by evil, and God himself does not tempt anyone.
