\v 9 Believers who are poor should be glad because God has honored them.
\v 10 And believers who are rich should be glad that God has humbled them, which helps them trust in Jesus Christ, because they and their riches will pass away, just as wild flowers wither.
\v 11 When the sun rises, the scorching hot wind dries the plants and causes the flowers to fall and no longer be beautiful. Like the flower that dies, rich people will die while they are earning money.

<usfm>
\v 9 Let the poor brother boast of his high position,
\v 10 but the rich man of his low position, because he will pass away as a wild flower in the grass.
\v 11 For the sun rises with burning heat and dries up the grass. The flower falls off, and its beauty perishes. In the same way, the rich man will fade away in the middle of his journey.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the poor brother** - "the believer who does not have much money"
  * **boast of his high position** - Someone whom God has honored is spoken of as if he were standing in a high place.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **but the rich man** - "but the man who has a lot of money." Possible meanings are 1) the rich man is a believer or 2) the rich man is an unbeliever.
  * **of his low position** - A rich believer should be happy if God brings him suffering. AT: "should be happy that God has given him that position" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **he will pass away as a wild flower in the grass** - Rich people are spoken of as being similar to wild flowers, which are alive for only a short time. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **the rich man will fade away in the middle of his journey** - Here the flower simile is probably continued. As flowers do not die suddenly but instead fade away over a short time, so also the rich people may not die suddenly but instead take a little time to disappear. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **in the middle of his journey** - A rich man's activites in daily life are spoken of as if they were a journey that he was making. This metaphor implies that he has given no thought to his coming death, and that it instead takes him by surprise. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
