<usfm>
\v 9 Believers who are poor should be glad because God has honored them.
\v 10 And believers who are rich should be glad that God has humbled them, which helps them trust in Jesus Christ, because they and their riches will pass away, just like wild flowers wither.
\v 11 When the sun rises, the scorching hot wind dries the plants and causes the flowers to fall and no longer be beautiful. Like the flower that dies, rich people will die while they are earning money.

<usfm>
\v 9 The poor brother should glory in his high standing,
\v 10 while the rich brother in his humility, because he will pass away like a wild flower in the field passes.
\v 11 The sun rises with scorching heat and dries up the plant, and the flower falls off and its beauty dies. In the same way the rich people will fade away in the middle of their activities.
