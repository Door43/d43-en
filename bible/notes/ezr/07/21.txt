\v 21 I, King Artaxerxes, make a decree to all the treasurers in the Province Beyond the River, that anything that Ezra asks from you should be given in full,
\v 22 up to one hundred silver talents, one hundred cors of grain, one hundred baths of wine, and one hundred baths of oil, also salt without limit.
\v 23 Anything that comes from the decree of the God of Heaven, do it with devotion for his house. For why should his wrath come upon the kingdom of me and my sons?

  * **that anything that Ezra asks from you should be given in full** - This can be expressed in active form. "Give Ezra in full anything he asks of you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **should be given in full** - The phrase "in full" here represents whatever quantity necessary to do the work. AT: "should be given as much as he needs" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **one hundred silver talents** - "100 talents of silver." You may convert this to a modern measure. AT: "3,300 kilograms of silver" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bweight]])

AT: "For we do not want God's wrath to come upon the the kingdom of me and my sons." or "For if you do not do these things, God's wrath will come upon the kingdom of me and my sons." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
