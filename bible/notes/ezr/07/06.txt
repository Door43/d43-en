\v 6 I am a man who knows very well the laws that Moses \add wrote\add*. Those were the laws that Yahweh, the God whom we Israelite people \add worship\f + \ft Or: belong to\add* \f*, had given to us Israelite people.

\v 7 Some of the priests, some descendants of Levi, some singers, some gatekeepers\f + \ft Or: men who guarded the gates of the temple \f*, and some men who worked in the temple, and some other \add Israelite\add* people came up with me here to Jerusalem.

\v 6 Ezra was a man who knew the laws that Moses wrote very well. Those were the laws that Yahweh, the God of Israel, had given to the Israelite people. He left Babylon after the king had told people
to give him anything he requested. Indeed, Yahweh helped Ezra very much in all these matters.
\v 7 Some of the priests, some descendants of Levi, some singers, some gatekeepers, and some men who worked in the temple, and some other Israelite people went up with Ezra to 
Jerusalem. That was during the seventh year that Artaxerxes was the king of Persia.

\v 6 Ezra left from Babylon. He was a skilled scribe in the law of Moses that Yahweh the God of Israel, had given. The king gave him anything he asked since the hand of Yahweh was with him.
\v 7 Some of the descendants of Israel and the priests, Levites, temple singers, gatekeepers, and those assigned to serve in the temple also went up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes.
