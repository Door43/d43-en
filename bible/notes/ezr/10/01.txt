\v 1 As Ezra prayed and confessed, he wept and threw himself down before God's house. A very great assembly of Israelite men, women, and children gathered to him, for the people were weeping very greatly.
\v 2 Shekaniah son of Jehiel of the descendants of Elam said to Ezra, "We ourselves have committed treason against our God and have lived with foreign women from the people of the other lands. But now there is hope for Israel concerning this.
