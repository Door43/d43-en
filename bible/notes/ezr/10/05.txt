<usfm>
\v 5 So I stood up and demanded that the leaders of the priests, the descendants of Levi, and all the other Israelite people solemnly declare that they would do what Shecaniah said that they should do. So they all solemnly promised to do that.
\v 6 Then I went away from being in front of the temple and went to the room where Jehohanan lived. I stayed there that night, but I did not eat or drink anything. I was still sad because some of the Israelites who had returned \add from Babylonia\add* had not faithfully \add obeyed God's laws\add*.

\v 5 So Ezra rose and made the priestly officials, the Levites, and all of Israel promise to act in this way. They promised.
\v 6 Then Ezra rose from before God's house and went to the rooms of Jehochanan son of Eliashib. He did not eat any bread or drink any water, since he was 
mourning concerning the faithlessness of those who had been in captivity.
