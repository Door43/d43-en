===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 So I stood up and demanded that the leaders of the priests, the descendants of Levi, and all the other Israelite people solemnly declare that they would do what Shecaniah said that they should do. So they all solemnly promised to do that.
\v 6 Then I went away from being in front of the temple and went to the room where Jehohanan lived. I stayed there that night, but I did not eat or drink anything. I was still sad because some of the Israelites who had returned \add from Babylonia\add* had not faithfully \add obeyed God's laws\add*.

\v 5 So Ezra arose and made the officials of the priests, the Levites, and all of Israel promise to do according to this word. They promised.
\v 6 Then Ezra arose from before the house of God and went to the halls of Jehochanan the son of Eliashib. So he went there. He did not eat bread or drink water, since he was 
mourning concerning the treason of those who had been in captivity.
