===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 So I stood up and demanded that the leaders of the priests, the descendants of Levi, and all the other Israelite people solemnly declare that they would do what Shecaniah said that they should do. So they all solemnly promised to do that.
\v 6 Then I went away from being in front of the temple and went to the room where Jehohanan lived. I stayed there that night, but I did not eat or drink anything. I was still sad because some of the Israelites who had returned \add from Babylonia\add* had not faithfully \add obeyed God's laws\add*.

\v 5 Then arose Ezra, and made the chiefs of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they would obey this word. So they swore.
\v 6 Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib. And when he came there, he ate no bread, and he drank no water, because he grieved because of the unfaithfulness of the exiles.
