\v 8 Let the king know that we went to Judah to the house of the great God. It is being built with large stones and timbers set in the walls. This work is being done thoroughly and is going forward well in their hands.
\v 9 We asked the elders, 'Who gave you a decree to build this house and these walls?'
\v 10 We also asked them their names so you might know the name of each man who led them.
