<usfm>
\v 13 You punished us because we were very guilty for having done wicked things. But you have not punished us as much as we deserve to be punished. \add I say this because\add* you, our God, have allowed some of us to survive.
\v 14 However, some of us are again disobeying your commands, and we are marrying women who do those detestable things. If we continue to do that, surely you will get rid of all of us \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*, with the result that none of us will remain alive.

\v 13 But you punished us because we were very guilty for having done wicked things. Still, you have not punished us as much as we deserve to be punished. I say this because you, our God, 
have allowed some of us to survive.
\v 14 However, some of us are again disobeying your commands, and we are marrying women who do those detestable things. If we continue to do that, surely you will get rid of all of us, with 
the result that none of us will remain alive.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 Yet after everything that came on us for our evil practices and our great guilt—since you, our God, have held back what our iniquities deserve and left us survivors—
\v 14 should we again break your commandments and make mixed marriages with these abominable people? Will you not be angry and annihilate us so there will be no one left, no one to escape?

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **our evil practices and our great guilt** - Israel did not utterly destroy the people practicing evil before God. Israel began marrying them and following their religious practices being led astray from God.
  * **since you...have held back what our iniquities deserve and left us survivors** - This is an example of God's mercy in action.
  * **should we again break your commandments ** - This was exactly what some of the returnees have done. They broke God's commands by marrying the people of the land and worshiping their gods.
  * **Will you not be angry and annihilate us** - God destroyed all of Israel before and Ezra feared that He would do it again and then there would no one left.
