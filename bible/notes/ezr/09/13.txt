\v 13 You punished us because we were very guilty for having done wicked things. But you have not punished us as much as we deserve to be punished. \add I say this because\add* you, our God, have allowed some of us to survive.
\v 14 However, some of us are again disobeying your commands, and we are marrying women who do those detestable things. If we continue to do that, surely you will get rid of all of us \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*, with the result that none of us will remain alive.

<usfm>
\v 13 Yet after all that came upon us for our evil practices and our great guilt—since you our God have held back less than our iniquities deserve and gave us a survivor like this—
\v 14 should we return to breaking your commandments and form mixed marriages with the people of these abominations? Will you not be angry with us to annihilate us so there is 
no remnant or survivor?
