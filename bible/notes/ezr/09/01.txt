\v 1 Some time later, the Jewish leaders came to me and said, "Many Israelites, and even some priests and other men who are descendants of Levi \add who work in the temple\add*, have not kept themselves from \add doing what\add* the other people who are living in this land \add do\add*. They are practicing the detestable things that the Canaan, Heth, Periz, Jebus, Ammon, and Amor people-groups, and the people from Moab and Egypt do.
\v 2 \add Specifically, some\add* Israelite men have married women who are not Israelites, and they have allowed their sons to do the same thing. So we, God's sacred people, have become contaminated\f + \ft Or: impure in God's sight \f*. And some of our leaders and officials have been the first, Or: worst ones to do this."

\v 1 And as these things were completed, the officials approached me and said, “The people of Israel, the priests, and the Levites have not divided themselves from the people 
of the lands with their abominations: Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites.
\v 2 For they have taken up for themselves from their daughters and their sons, and have mixed the holy seed with the people of the land! And the hand of the officials and 
functionaries has been first in this treachery!”
