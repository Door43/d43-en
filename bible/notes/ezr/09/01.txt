\v 1 Some time later, the Jewish leaders came to me and said, "Many Israelites, and even some priests and other men who are descendants of Levi \add who work in the temple\add*, have not kept themselves from \add doing what\add* the other people who are living in this land \add do\add*. They are practicing the detestable things that the Canaan, Heth, Periz, Jebus, Ammon, and Amor people-groups, and the people from Moab and Egypt do.
\v 2 \add Specifically, some\add* Israelite men have married women who are not Israelites, and they have allowed their sons to do the same thing. So we, God's sacred people, have become contaminated\f + \ft Or: impure in God's sight \f*. And some of our leaders and officials have been the first, Or: worst ones to do this."

\v 1 "When these things were done, the officials approached me and said, 'The people of Israel, the priests, and the Levites have not separated themselves from the people of the other lands and their abominations: Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites.
\v 2 For they have taken some of their daughters and sons, and have mixed the holy people with the people of other lands. And the officials and leaders have been first in this faithlessness.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the officials approached me** - "Officials" in this case is more likely to refer to the Jewish princes who returned earlier with Zerubbabel.
  * **have not separated themselves** - They have married people from other lands and have adopted their religion.
  * **and their abominations** - The real issue was that when they married outsiders, they abandoned God. 
  * **have mixed the holy people with the people of other lands** - God's law has provision for Israel marrying people who choose to follow Yahweh as their God. However, in this case the outsiders were leading the Israelites into their mix of religion. 
  * **the officials and leaders** - The people with specific authority in the government.
