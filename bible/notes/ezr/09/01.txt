\v 1 Some time later, the Jewish leaders came to me and said, "Many Israelites, and even some priests and other men who are descendants of Levi \add who work in the temple\add*, have not kept themselves from \add doing what\add* the other people who are living in this land \add do\add*. They are practicing the detestable things that the Canaan, Heth, Periz, Jebus, Ammon, and Amor people-groups, and the people from Moab and Egypt do.
\v 2 \add Specifically, some\add* Israelite men have married women who are not Israelites, and they have allowed their sons to do the same thing. So we, God's sacred people, have become contaminated\f + \ft Or: impure in God's sight \f*. And some of our leaders and officials have been the first, Or: worst ones to do this."

\p
\v 1 Now when these things were done, the princes drew near to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, with their detestable practices, like people groups of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.
\v 2 For they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy seed have mingled themselves
with the peoples of the lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this trespass.
