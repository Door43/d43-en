\v 10 Our God, what more can we say now \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? In spite of \add all that you have done for us\add*, we have disobeyed your commands.
\v 11 They are commands that you gave to your servants, the prophets, to tell to us. They said that the land that we would occupy was polluted because of the detestable\f + \ft Or: disgusting \f* things that were done by the people who lived there. They said that the land was filled from one end to the other with people who did immoral\f + \ft Or: shameful \f* things.
\v 12 They said, 'Do not allow your daughters to marry their sons! Do not allow your sons to marry their daughters! Do not even try to cause things to go well for those people-groups! If you obey these instructions, your nation will be strong, and you will enjoy the good crops that grow on the land, and the land will belong to your descendants forever.'

\v 10 But now, our God, what can we say after this, since we have forgotten your commands?
\v 11 The commands that you gave to your servants the prophets, when you said, ‘This land that you are entering to possess is an unclean land. It is contaminated by the people 
of the lands with their abominations that they have filled from one end to the other with their uncleanness.
\v 12 So now, do not give your daughters to their sons; do not take their daughters for your sons, and do not seek their ongoing peace and welfare, so that you will be 
strong and eat the good of the land, so you will cause your children to possess it for all time.’
