\v 10 Our God, what more can we say now \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? In spite of \add all that you have done for us\add*, we have disobeyed your commands.
\v 11 They are commands that you gave to your servants, the prophets, to tell to us. They said that the land that we would occupy was polluted because of the detestable\f + \ft Or: disgusting \f* things that were done by the people who lived there. They said that the land was filled from one end to the other with people who did immoral\f + \ft Or: shameful \f* things.
\v 12 They said, 'Do not allow your daughters to marry their sons! Do not allow your sons to marry their daughters! Do not even try to cause things to go well for those people-groups! If you obey these instructions, your nation will be strong, and you will enjoy the good crops that grow on the land, and the land will belong to your descendants forever.'

<usfm>
\v 10 And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken your commandments,
\v 11 which you have commanded by your servants the prophets, saying, The land, to which you go to possess it, is an unclean
land through the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, through their abominations, which have filled it from one end to
another with their filthiness:
\v 12 now therefore give not your daughters to their sons, neither take their daughters to your sons, nor seek their peace
or their prosperity for ever; that you may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your
children for ever.
