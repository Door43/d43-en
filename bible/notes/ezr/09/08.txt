\v 8 Yet now for a short time, mercy from Yahweh our God has come to leave us a few survivors and to give us a foothold in his holy place. This was for our God to enlighten our eyes and to give us a little relief in our slavery.
\v 9 For we are slaves, but our God has not forgotten us but has extended covenant faithfulness to us. He has done this in the sight of the king of Persia in order to give us new strength, so we could rebuild our God's house and raise its ruins. He did this so that he could give us a wall of safety in Judah and Jerusalem.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **mercy from Yahweh our God has come** - God deciding to be merciful is spoken of as if mercy were a person who could move. AT: "Yahweh our God has decided to be merciful to us and" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **but has extended covenant faithfulness to us** - The abstract noun "faithfulness" can be stated as "faithful" or "loyal." See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:ezr:07:27|7:28]]. AT: "but he as been faithful to us" or "he has been loyal to us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **in the sight of the king of Persia** - The king could not literally see the temple, but he did know about what was happening in Jerusalem. Here "sight" is a metonym for what a person knows. AT: "so that the king of Persia knows about it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **God's house** - the temple
  * **could give us a wall of safety** - The wall that keeps people safe is a metaphor for Yahweh protecting his people. AT: "could keep us safe" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
