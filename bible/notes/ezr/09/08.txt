\v 8 Yet now for a short time, mercy from Yahweh our God has come to leave us a few survivors and to give us a foothold in his holy place. This was for our God to enlighten our eyes and 
to give us a little relief in our slavery.
\v 9 For we are slaves, but our God has not forgotten us but has extended covenant faithfulness to us. He has done this in the sight of the king of Persia in order to give us new strength so we could rebuild  
our God's house and raise its ruins. He did this so that he could give us a wall of safety in Judah and Jerusalem.
