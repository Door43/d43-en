\v 5 But at the evening offering I arose from my position of humiliation in my torn clothes and robe, and knelt down and spread my hands to Yahweh my God.
\v 6 I said, 'My God, I am ashamed and too humiliated to raise my face to you, for our iniquities increase over our head, and our guilt grows to the heavens.
