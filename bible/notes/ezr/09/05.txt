\v 5 But at the evening offering I arose from my humiliating activity and in my torn clothes and robe, and knelt down on my knees and spread out my hand to Yahweh my God,
\v 6 and I said, “My God, I am ashamed and too humiliated to raise my face to you, my God, since our iniquities increase over our head and our guilt grows to the heavens!
