\v 3 And they set the altar upon its base; for fear was upon them because of the peoples of the countries: and they offered burnt offerings thereon to Jehovah, even burnt offerings morning and evening.
\v 4 And they kept the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number, in keeping with the decree, as the duty of every day required;
\v 5 and afterward the continual burnt-offering, and the offerings
of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of Jehovah that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a
free will offering to Jehovah.
