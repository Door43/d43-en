Before they started to lay the foundation of Yahweh's temple, \add the priests\add* started to burn sacrifices to Yahweh \add on the altar\add*. They offered sacrifices every morning and every evening. Fifteen days after \add they started to offer these sacrifices\add*, the people celebrated the Festival of Shelters, as \add Moses\add* had commanded them to do in the laws \add that God gave to him\add*. Each day the priests offered the sacrifices that were required for that day. In addition, they presented the regular burned offerings and the offerings that were required for the New Moon Festivals and the other festivals that they celebrated each year \add to honor\add* Yahweh. They also brought other offerings only because they desired to bring them, \add not because they were required to bring them\add*.
