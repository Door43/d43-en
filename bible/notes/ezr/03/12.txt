<usfm>
\v 12 But many of the priests, Levites, chief patriarchs, and old people who had seen the first house—when this house's foundations were laid before their eyes, wept loudly. But many had shouts of joy with gladness and an excited sound.
\v 13 As a result, people were not able to distinguish the joyful and glad sounds from the sound of the people's weeping, for the people were crying out with great joy, and the sound was heard from far away.
