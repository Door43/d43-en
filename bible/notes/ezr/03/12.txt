\v 12 But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers’ houses, the old men that had seen the first house,
when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:
\v 13 so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people; for the
people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.
