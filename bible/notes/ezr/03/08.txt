\v 8 Then in the second year after they came to the house of God in Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak and the rest of 
their brothers—the priests, the Levites, and all those who came from captivity to Jerusalem—began, and they established the Levites of twenty-years old and upwards to oversee the 
work of the house of Yahweh.
\v 9 And Jeshua set his sons and his brothers, Kadmiel and his sons, and the children of Judah as one to oversee the ones doing the work on the house of God: the children of 
Henadad, their children, and their brothers the Levites.
