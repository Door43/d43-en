\v 6 But even though they started bringing burned offerings to Yahweh at the beginning of autumn, they had not yet started building the temple building.
\v 7 So the Israelites hired masons and carpenters, and they bought logs from cedar trees from the people of Tyre and Sidon. They gave those people food, wine, and olive oil as payment. 
They brought the logs down from the mountains in Lebanon to the Mediterranean seacoast and then floated them along the coast of the sea to Joppa. King Cyrus permitted them to do that.
