\v 10 The builders laid a foundation for Yahweh's temple. This enabled the priests to stand in their garments with trumpets, and the Levites, sons of Asaph, to 
praise Yahweh with cymbals, just as the hand of David, king of Israel had commanded.
\v 11 They sang with praise and thankfulness to Yahweh, “He is good! His covenant faithfulness to Israel lasts forever.” All the people cried out with a great shout of joy 
in praise of Yahweh because the temple's foundations had been laid.
