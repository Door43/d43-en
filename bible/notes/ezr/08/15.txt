We set up our tents there and stayed there for three days. \add During that time\add* I checked the lists of names and found out that there were priests \add going with us\add*, but no descendants of Levi \add who could help them in the temple\add*.
\v 16 So I summoned Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, two men whose names were Elnathan, Jarib, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, who were all leaders \add of the people\add*. I also summoned Joiarib and another Elnathan, who were wise.

\v 15 Ezra said, "I gathered together all of Jews at the canal that goes from Babylon to Ahava. We set up our tents there and stayed there for three days. During that time I read the lists of names
and found out that there were priests going with us, but no other descendants of Levi who could help them in the temple.
\v 16 So I summoned Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, another man named Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, who were all leaders of the people. I also summoned Joiarib and yet another man named Elnathan (three in all), who were teachers.

\p
\v 15 I gathered the travelers at the canal that goes to Ahava, and we camped there three days. I examined the people and priests, but could not find any descendants of Levi there.
\v 16 So I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, and Elnathan and Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam—who were leaders—and for Joiarib and Elnathan—who were teachers.
