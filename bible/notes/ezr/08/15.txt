\v 15 And I gathered them together to the river that runs to Ahava; and there we encamped three days: and I viewed the
people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi.
\v 16 Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and
for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, who were teachers.
