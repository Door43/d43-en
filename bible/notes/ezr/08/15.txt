\v 16 So I summoned Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, two men whose names were El-Nathan, Jarib, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshulam, who were all leaders of the people. I also summoned Joiarib 
and another El-Nathan, who were teachers.

\v 15 I gathered them to the river that goes to Ahava, and we camped there three days. I evaluated the people and priests, but could not find any descendants 
of Levi there.
\v 16 So I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, El nathan, Jarib, and El nathan and Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshulam—chiefs—and for Joarib and El Nathan—instructors.
