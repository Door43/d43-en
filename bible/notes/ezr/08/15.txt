and found out that there were priests going with us, but no other descendants of Levi who could help them in the temple.
\v 16 So I summoned Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, El Nathan, Jarib, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshulam, who were all leaders of the people. I also summoned Joiarib

\v 15 I gathered them at the canal that goes to Ahava, and we camped there three days. I examined the people and priests, but could not find any descendants 
of Levi there.
\v 16 So I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, and Elnathan and Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshulam—who were leaders—and for Joarib and El Nathan—who were teachers.
