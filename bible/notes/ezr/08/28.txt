\v 28 I said to those priests, "You belong to Yahweh, the God whom our ancestors worshiped\f + \ft Or: also belonged to \f*, and these valuable things also belong to him. The people themselves gave these things to be offerings to Yahweh voluntarily\f + \ft Or: because they wanted to \f*.
\v 29 So guard them carefully, and \add when we arrive\add* in Jerusalem, weigh them in the presence of the priests, the descendants of Levi \add who will help the priests\add*, and the other Israelite leaders there. They will then put them in the storerooms in the new temple."
\v 30 So the priests and descendants of Levi took from me all the gifts of silver and gold and the other valuable items, in order to carry them to the temple in Jerusalem.

\v 28 I said to those priests, 'You are specially set apart for Yahweh, the God whom our ancestors worshiped, and these valuable things are special to him in the same way. The people themselves gave these things to 
be offerings to Yahweh voluntarily.
\v 29 So guard them carefully, and when we arrive in Jerusalem, weigh them in the presence of the priests, the descendants of Levi who will help the priests, and the other Israelite leaders there. 
They will then put them in the storerooms in the new temple.'
\v 30 So the priests and descendants of Levi took from me all the gifts of silver and gold and the other valuable items, in order to carry them to the temple in Jerusalem.

\v 28 Then I said to them, 'You are consecrated to Yahweh, and these objects also. And this silver and gold are a freewill offering to Yahweh, your ancestors' God.
\v 29 Watch over them and keep them until you weigh them out before the priestly officials, Levites, and leaders of the ancestors' clans of Israel in Jerusalem in the rooms of God's house.'
\v 30 The priests and the Levites accepted the weighed silver, gold, and the objects in order to take them to Jerusalem, to our God's house.
