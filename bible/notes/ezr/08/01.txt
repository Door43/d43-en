===== Translation Notes: =====

There is an apparent shift in authorship beginning here. Chapters 1-7 were written as if the author was writing about Ezra. Chapter 8 was written as if the author was Ezra.

This section contains a list of names of people (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])

    * **Parosh**  - See how you translated this in  [[en:bible:notes:ezr:02:03|2:03]]. 
    * **150 males**  - number of men and boys (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
