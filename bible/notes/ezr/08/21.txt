====== Ezra 08:21-23 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 21 There alongside the Ahava Canal, I told them that we all would fast\f + \ft Or: abstain from eating food \f* and pray. I also told them that we should humble ourselves in the presence of our God. We prayed that God would protect us while we traveled, and also protect our children and our possessions, Or: belongings.
\v 22 Previously we had told the king that our God takes care of all those who truly trust in him, but that he becomes very angry with those who refuse to obey him. So I would have been ashamed if I had asked the king to send soldiers and men riding on horses to protect us from our enemies while we were traveling along the road.
\v 23 So we fasted\f + \ft Or: abstained from eating food \f* and requested God to protect us, and he answered our prayers\f + \ft Or: did what we requested. \f*

\v 21 Then I proclaimed a fast at the Ahava Canal to humble ourselves before God, to seek a straight path from him for us, our little ones, and all our possessions.
\v 22 I was embarrassed to ask the king for an army or horsemen to protect us against enemies along the way since we had said to the king, “The hand of our God 
is on all who seek him for good, but his might and wrath are on all who forget him.”
\v 23 So we fasted and sought God about this, and we pled to him.
