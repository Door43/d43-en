<usfm>
\v 21 There alongside the Ahava Canal, I told them that we all would fast\f + \ft Or: abstain from eating food \f* and pray. I also told them that we should humble ourselves in the presence of our God. We prayed that God would protect us while we traveled, and also protect our children and our possessions, Or: belongings.
\v 22 Previously we had told the king that our God takes care of all those who truly trust in him, but that he becomes very angry with those who refuse to obey him. So I would have been ashamed if I had asked the king to send soldiers and men riding on horses to protect us from our enemies while we were traveling along the road.
\v 23 So we fasted\f + \ft Or: abstained from eating food \f* and requested God to protect us, and he answered our prayers\f + \ft Or: did what we requested. \f*

\v 21 Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek of him a
straight way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.
\v 22 For I was ashamed to ask of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way, because we
had spoken to the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them that seek him, for good; but his power and his wrath is
against all them that forsake him.
\v 23 So we fasted and implored our God for this: and he was entreated of us.
