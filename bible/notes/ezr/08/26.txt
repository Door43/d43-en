===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **talent**  - a measurement of money based on it's weight.
    * **one thousand darics** - 1000 darics. A "daric" was a small gold coin used by the Persian Empire. (See: [[en:obe:other:biblicalmoney]])
    * **bronze vessels** - bronze is a copper alloy that is stronger than pure copper. Bronze by itself is not valuable. But as artwork, it can be quite valuable.
