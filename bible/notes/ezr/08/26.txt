  * **talents** - A talent is 34 kilograms. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bweight]])
  * **one thousand darics** - "1,000 darics." A "daric" was a small gold coin that people in the Persian Empire used. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bmoney]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **bronze vessels** - Bronze is a copper alloy that is stronger than pure copper. Bronze by itself is not valuable. But as artwork, it can be quite valuable.
