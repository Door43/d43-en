\v 62 The people in that group searched in the documents that had the names of the ancestors of all the clans, but these men's names were not found. So they were not permitted do the work that priests did.
\v 63 The governor told them that they would need to ask a priest to consult Yahweh by casting the sacred lots\f + \ft Or: throwing the sacred stones that had been marked \f*, to determine if those men were truly Israelites.

\v 61 And of the priest's descendants: 
The descendants of Habaiah, Hakkoz, Barzillai (who took his wife from the women of Barzillai of Gilead and was called by their name).
\v 62 They tried to find their geneology in the register, but could not be found since they had defiled their priesthood.
\v 63 So the governor told them they must not eat some of the holy sacrifices until a priest with Urim and Thummim approved.
