\v 62 The people in that group searched in the documents that had the names of the ancestors of all the clans, but these men's names were not found. So they were not permitted do the work that priests did.

\v 61 The descendants of the priests in this group included people belonging to Habaiah's clan, Hakkoz's clan, and Barzillai's clan. Barzillai had married a woman who was a descendant of Barzillai from the region of Gilead, and he had taken for himself the name of his father-in-law's clan.

\v 61 Also, from the priest's descendants: the descendants of Habaiah, Hakkoz, and Barzillai (who took his wife from the daughters of Barzillai of Gilead and was called by their name).
\v 62 They searched for their genealogical records, but could not find them, so they were excluded from the priesthood as unclean. 
\v 63 So the governor told them they must not eat any of the holy sacrifices until a priest with Urim and Thummim approved.
