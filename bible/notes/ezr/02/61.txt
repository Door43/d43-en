\v 61 Hobaiah's clan, Hakkoz's clan, and Barzillai's clan also returned. Barzillai had married a woman who was a descendant of Barzillai from the Gilead \add region\add*, and he had taken for himself the name of his father-in-law's clan.

\v 62 The people in that group searched in the documents that had the names of the ancestors of all the clans, but these men's names were not found. So they were not permitted do the work that priests did.
\v 63 The governor told them that they would need to ask a priest to consult Yahweh by casting the sacred lots\f + \ft Or: throwing the sacred stones that had been marked \f*, to determine if those men were truly Israelites. When the priests did that, \add if the stones showed that those men were Israelites\add*, they would be permitted to eat the shares of the sacrifices that were given to the priests.

\v 61 And of the priest's descendants: 
The descendants of Habaiah, Hakkoz, Barzillai (who took his wife from the women of Barzillai of Gilead and was called by their name).
\v 62 They tried to find their geneology in the register, but could not be found since they had defiled their priesthood.
\v 63 So the governor told them they must not eat some of the holy sacrifices until a priest with Urim and Thummim approved.
