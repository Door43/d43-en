===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 In the past, powerful kings ruled in Jerusalem, and they also ruled over the whole province west of the Euphrates River. They forced the people there to pay them all kinds of taxes.
\v 21 So you must command that the people must stop rebuilding the city. Only if I tell them that they may rebuild it will they be allowed to continue.
\v 22 Do this immediately, because I do not want those people to do anything to harm the things about which I am concerned."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 Mighty kings have ruled over Jerusalem and had power over everything beyond the river. Tribute and taxes were paid to them.
\v 21 Now, make a decree for these men to stop and not build this city until I make a decree.
\v 22 Be careful not to neglect this. Why should damage increase to injure kings?"
