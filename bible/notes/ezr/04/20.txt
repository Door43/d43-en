<usfm>
\v 20 Mighty kings have been over Jerusalem, and had power over everything beyond the river and contributions of tribute and taxes were given to them.
\v 21 Now—make a decree for these vigorous men to stop and this city must not be built until a decree has been made by me.
\v 22 And be careful not to neglect doing this. Why should damage increase to injure kings?”
