===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Jeshua**  - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:ezr:02:03|2:06]].
  * **It is not you, but we who must build** - possible meanings are 1) the Jewish leader felt that only they were authorized by Cyrus to build the temple or 2) building the temple was the exclusive work of the Jews, no non-Jew would be permitted to contribute to the work. There was strong objection to the non-Jews participating regardless of the reason.
