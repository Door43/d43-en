\v 14 Now, because we are loyal to you, and because we do not want you to be humiliated, we are sending this information to you.
\v 15 And, we suggest that you order your officials to search among the records kept by your ancestors. If you do that, you will find out that the people in this city have always rebelled against the 
government. You will also find out that from long ago these people caused trouble for kings and for rulers of provinces. They have always revolted against those who ruled them. That is the 
reason that this city was destroyed by the Babylonian army.
\v 16 We want you to know that if they rebuild this city and finish building its walls, you will no longer be able to control the people in this province west of the Euphrates River."

\v 14 Surely because we have eaten the palace salt, it is not fitting for us to see any dishonor happen to the king. It is because of this that we are informing the king
\v 15 to search your father's record and to verify that this is a rebellious city that will harm kings and provinces. It has caused many problems to the kings and provinces. It has been a center for rebellion from long ago. It was for this reason that the city was destroyed.
\v 16 We are informing the king that if this city and wall are built, then there will be nothing remaining for you beyond the Great River.‚Äù

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **eaten the palace salt**  - This is a figure of speech describing the support they get from the palace. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
    * **there will be nothing remaining for you beyond the Great River** - "There will be no taxes for you to collect beyond the Euphrates river." These men are seeking to incite the King against the Jews by exaggerating the impact one small rebuilt town would have on their tax revenue. (See [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
