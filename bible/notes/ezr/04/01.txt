\v 1 Now some enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the people who had been exiled were now building a temple for Yahweh the God of Israel.
\v 2 So they approached Zerubbabel and the heads of their ancestors' clans. They said to them, "Let us build with you, for, like you, we seek your God and have sacrificed to him since the days when Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, brought us to this place."
