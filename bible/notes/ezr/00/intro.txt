====== Introduction to Ezra ======

===== Part 1: General Introduction =====

=== Outline of Ezra ===

  - The first Jewish exiles return to Jerusalem from Persia (1:1–2:70)
  - The rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem and reestablishment of temple worship (3:1–6:22)
  - More exiles return, and Ezra leads religious reformation and implementation of the Law of Yahweh (7:1–10:44)

=== What is the Book of Ezra about? ===

The Book of Ezra is about how the people of Israel returned from Babylon and tried to worship Yahweh again as the Law required. This included the rebuilding of the [[:en:obe:kt:temple|temple]] for sacrifices, the affirmation of the covenant with Yahweh, and the political restoration of the nation. 

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

The Book of Ezra is named for the priest Ezra who led the first return of Jews to Judah from exile. Translators might choose to make the title clearer, for example, "The book about Ezra." 

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== Why were Israelites not allowed to marry people from other nations? ===

Yahweh knew that marrying foreign wives would cause the people of Israel to worship other [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod|gods]].

=== Did all of the people of Israel return to their homeland? ===

Most of the Jews remained in Babylon instead of returning to the [[:en:obe:kt:promisedland|Promised Land]]. They had built successful lives in Babylon and desired to remain there. On the other hand, they were unable to participate in the temple worship as their ancestors had done. 



===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== How does the Book of Ezra use the term "Israel"? ===

The Book of Ezra uses the term "Israel" to refer to the kingdom of Judah, which was composed mostly of the two tribes of Judah and Benjamin. The other ten tribes had ended their loyalty to any kings descended from David. After sinking into idolatry and corruption, they had been conquered by the Assyrian Empire, taken away, and entirely absorbed into other ethnic groups. 

=== Do the events in the Book of Ezra proceed in chronological order? ===

Parts of Ezra do not follow a strict chronological sequence. Translators should pay attention to notes that signal when events are probably out of order with each other.
