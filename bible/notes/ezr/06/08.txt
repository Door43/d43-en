\v 8 Moreover I make a decree what you shall do to these elders of the Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king’s goods, even of the tribute beyond the River, expenses be given with all diligence to these men, that they be not hindered.
\v 9 And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for burnt offerings to the God of heaven; also wheat, salt, wine, and oil, which are supplied in order to meet the needs of the priests that are in Jerusalem. Let it be given to them each day, without interruption,
\v 10 so they may offer sacrifices of sweet savor to the God of heaven, and so they may pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.
