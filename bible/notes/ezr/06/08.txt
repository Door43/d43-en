\v 8 I am ordering that you must do this for these Jewish elders who build this house of God: The treasures of the king's tribute beyond the River will be paid 
to these men so they will not stop.
\v 9 Whatever thing that is needed—offspring of a bull, ram, or a lamb—for the burnt offerings to the God of Heaven—grain, salt, wine, and oil according to the command
