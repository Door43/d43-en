\v 11 I am ordering that if anyone violates this decree, a beam must be pulled from his house and he must be impaled on it. His house must then be turned into a rubbish heap because of this.
\v 12 May the God who lives there overthrow any king and people who violates this house of God in Jerusalem. I, Darius, am ordering this. Let it be done diligently!"
