===== translationNotes: =====

  * **a stronghold ... those who take refuge in him** - Nahum speaks of Yahweh as if he were a place where people can be safe from those who wish to harm them, and of those who trust Yahweh to protect them as if they were taking refuge inside that safe place. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **in the day of trouble** - "in times of trouble" or "when troubles happen." The word "day" here refers to a general period of time.
  * **he will make a full end to his enemies** - The idiom "make a full end" refers to causing his enemies to die. AT: "he will completely destroy his enemies" or "he will kill all his enemies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **with an overwhelming flood** - Nahum speaks of Yahweh destroying his enemies in such a way that they will be powerless to avoid death as if Yahweh caused them to drown in a great flood of water. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he will pursue them into darkness** - Here the word "darkness" represents the place of the dead, which is characterized as a dark place. Nahum speaks of Yahweh killing his enemies as if he were chasing them into this dark place. AT: "he will cause all his enemies to die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
