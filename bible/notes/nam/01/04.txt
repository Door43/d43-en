Nahum continues to describe the power of Yahweh over the whole world

    * **Bashan languishes, and Carmel also; the flowers of Lebanon languish**  - This means that the cities of Bashan and Carmel lose their prominence and the beauty of Lebanon fades. These cities looked lifeless, like withered grass and flowers
    * **The mountains shake; the hills melt; .....**  - This shows the amazing power of Yahweh's presence. In his presence, it is like the mountains shake, the hills melt, the earth collapses, and everyone shakes in respect for his power.
