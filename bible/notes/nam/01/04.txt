<usfm>
\v 4 When he commands oceans and rivers to become dry,
 they dry up.
 He causes the grass to wither in the fields in the region of Bashan and on the slopes of Mount Carmel,
 and causes the flowers in Lebanon to fade.
\v 5 When he appears, it is as though the mountains shake and the hills melt;
 the earth quakes, and the people on the earth tremble.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 4 He rebukes the sea and makes it dry; he dries up all the rivers.
\q Bashan is weak, and Carmel also; the flowers of Lebanon are weak.
\q
\v 5 The mountains shake in his presence, and the hills melt;
\q the earth collapses in his presence, indeed, the world and all people who live in it.
</usfm>
