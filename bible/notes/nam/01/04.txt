===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 He rebukes the sea and makes it dry; he dries up all the rivers. Bashan languishes, and Carmel also; the flowers of Lebanon languish.
\v 5 The mountains shake in his presence, and the hills melt; the earth collapses in his presence, indeed, the world and all people who live in it.
