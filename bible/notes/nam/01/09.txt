\v 9 What are you people plotting against Yahweh? He will make a full end to it; trouble will not rise up a second time.
\v 10 For they will become tangled up like thornbushes; they will be saturated in their own drink; they will be completely devoured by fire like dry stubble.
\v 11 Someone emerged from you, Nineveh, who planned evil against Yahweh, someone who promotes wickedness.
