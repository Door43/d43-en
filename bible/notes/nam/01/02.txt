===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Nahum begins to describe Yahweh coming to judge his enemies and to save his people. The vision is full of metaphorical language and uses different kinds of parallelism. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **Yahweh** - This is the name of God that he revealed to his people in the Old Testament. See the translationWord page about Yahweh concerning how to translate this.
  * **full of wrath** - "very angry"
  * **he continues his anger for** - "continues to be angry with"
  * **slow to anger** - "slow to become angry"
  * **he will by no means declare his enemies innocent** - This emphatic negative statement can be translated positively. AT: "he will always punish his enemies"
  * **Yahweh makes his way in the whirlwind and the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet** - The biblical writers often associated Yahweh's presence with powerful storms. Here Yahweh rides in strong storm winds and his feet are creating clouds by kicking up dust as he is coming to judge the people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the dust of his feet** - "the dust that his feet kick up"
