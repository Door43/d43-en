<usfm>
\p
\v 2 Yahweh is a jealous God and avenges; Yahweh avenges and is full of wrath; Yahweh takes vengeance on his adversaries, and he maintains anger for his enemies.
\v 3 Yahweh is slow to anger and great in power; he will by no means declare his enemies innocent. Yahweh makes his way in the whirlwind and the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.
