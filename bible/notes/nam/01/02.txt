\v 2 The LORD is a jealous God and avenges; the LORD avenges and is full of wrath; The LORD takes vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserves wrath for his enemies.
\v 3 The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, and will by no means clear the guilty: the Lord has his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.
