===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Huzzab** - This name probably is either the name of Assyria's queen or the name of an Assyrian idol. If it refers to the queen, then the passage means that the attacking soldiers stripped her of her clothes in order to humiliate her. If it refers to an idol, then the passage means that the attackers stripped the gold and silver off the image. 
  * **her female servants moan like doves** - "the female servants of the queen sound like doves as they moan" to mourn her loss of power (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
