===== Translation Notes: =====

Nahum continues describing the destruction of Nineveh in poetry that began in [[:en:bible:notes:nam:01:01|1:1]]. (See: UDB and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **He who will dash you to pieces** - The picture is of someone breaking a pot. Alternate translation: "He who will destroy you" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]).
  * **He who will dash** - Who this is is not clear, so translate using a general term: "Someone who will break you to pieces."
  * **Man the city walls, guard the roads, make yourselves strong, assemble your armies.** - prepare for war
  * **Man the city walls** - "Set guards on the walls for protection"
  * **For Yahweh is restoring the majesty of Jacob, like the majesty of Israel** - This means that Yahweh will make Jacob and Israel great, and people will admire them again.
  * **plunderers** - people who steal things by force, usually in war
  * **emptied them out** - taken away everything, meaning 1) poured water out of a pot or 2) stripped the leaves off a tree or vine
