===== translationNotes: =====

  * **lions' den** - Nineveh is being compared to a lion's den because it is a place where killers live and a place where they bring back what they have stolen from the people they have killed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **strangled** - "choked." Lions bite their victims' throats to prevent them from breathing.
  * **filled his cave with victims, his dens with torn carcasses** - These two phrases are saying the same thing in different ways. A lion's den, its hiding place, is often in a cave. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
