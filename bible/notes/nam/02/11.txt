<usfm>
\v 11 Where now is the lions' den, the place where the young lion cubs feed, the place where the lion and lioness walked, with the cubs, where they were afraid of nothing?
\v 12 The lion tore his victims to pieces for his cubs; he strangled victims for his lionesses, and filled his cave with victims and his dens with his prey.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **lion's den** - Nineveh is being compared to a lion's den because it is a place where killers live and a place where they bring back what they have stolen from the people they have killed. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **strangled** - "choked." Lions bite their victims' throats to prevent them from breathing.
  * **filled his cave with victims and his dens with his prey** - These two phrases are saying the same thing in different ways. A lion's den would be in a cave and the prey are the animal victims the lion has killed. "filled his home with those he has killed" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
