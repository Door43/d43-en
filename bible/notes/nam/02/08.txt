\v 8 Nineveh is like a pool of water, with its people fleeing away like rushing water. Others shout, "Stop, stop," but no one looks back.
\v 9 Take the silver plunder, take the gold plunder, for there is no end to it, to the glory of all the beautiful things.
\v 10 Nineveh is empty and ruined. One's heart melts, the knees strike together, and anguish is in everyone; their faces are all pale.
