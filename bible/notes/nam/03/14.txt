<usfm>
\v 14 Go draw water for the siege; strengthen your fortresses; go into the clay and tread the mortar; repair the brick walls.
\v 15 Fire will devour you, and the sword will cut you off. It will devour you like the locusts.  Multiply yourselves like locusts, like grasshoppers.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Nahum speaks to the people of Nineveh as though they were the city itself. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])

    * **It will devour you like the locusts**  - there will be nothing left. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
    * **It** - the "fire" and "sword"
    * **Multiply yourselves like locusts, like grasshoppers** - "Multiply yourself like locusts! Multiply yourself like grasshoppers!" These words seem to go more with [[:en:bible:notes:nam:03:16|3:16]] than with 3:15.
    * **Multiply...like locusts** - This means they would become a very large city with many people and destroy many lands. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
