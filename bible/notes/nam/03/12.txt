<usfm>
\v 12 Your enemies will cause the walls around your city to fall down
 like the first figs that fall right into your mouths when you shake the tree.
 This is how easily your city will be captured.
\v 13 Look at your soldiers!
 They will be like weak women!
 The gates of your city will be opened wide
 to allow your enemies to enter them,
 and then the bars of those gates will be burned.
\b

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 12 All your fortresses will be like fig trees with the earliest ripe figs:
\q if they are shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater.
\q
\v 13 See, the people among you are women;
\q the gates of your land have been opened wide to your enemies;
\q fire has devoured their bars.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Nahum speaks to the people of Nineveh as though they were the city itself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])

  * **fortresses** - This term, which could also be rendered as "strongholds" refers to all of Nineveh and the Assyrian empire. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **All your fortresses will be like fig trees with the earliest ripe figs: if they are shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater** - The city of Nineveh will be easy to take like fruit from a tree. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **the people among you are women** - "your people are weak and cannot defend themselves" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **their bars** - large beams of wood that give the gates strength and do not allow it to be opened from outside the city. Burning these would make it impossible to close the city again.
