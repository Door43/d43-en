===== Translation Notes: =====

Nahum speaks to the people of Nineveh as though they were the city itself. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])

  * **fortresses** - This term, which could also be rendered as "strongholds" refers to all of Nineveh and the Assyrian empire. (See:[[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **All your fortresses will be like fig trees with the earliest ripe figs: if they are shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater** - The city of Nineveh will be easy to take like fruit from a tree. (See:[[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **the people among you are like women** - "your people are weak and cannot defend themselves" (See:[[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **bars of...gates** - large beams of wood that give the gates strength and do not allow it to be opened from outside the city. Burning these would make it impossible to close the city again.
