\v 3 Look at their flashing swords and glittering spears as the horsemen race forward! Many people of Nineveh will be killed; there will be piles of corpses, so many that the attackers will stumble over them.
\v 4 All that will happen because Nineveh is like a beautiful prostitute
 who lures men to where they will be ruined;
 Nineveh is a beautiful city
 that has attracted people of other nations to come there.
 The people of Nineveh taught those people of other nations rituals of magic,
 and caused them to become their slaves.

\q
\v 3 There are attacking horsemen,
\q flashing swords, glittering spears,
\q heaps of corpses, great piles of bodies.
\q There is no end to the bodies; their attackers stumble over them.
\q
\v 4 This is happening because of the lustful actions of the beautiful prostitute, the expert in witchcraft,
\q who sells nations through her prostitution, and peoples through her acts of witchcraft.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **heaps of corpses, great piles of bodies. There is no end to the bodies** - The author is stressing a great depth of slaughter against Nineveh since it was stated 3 times.
  * **corpses** - bodies of people who have died
  * **There is no end to the bodies** - "There are a great many bodies"
  * **beautiful prostitute ... expert in witchcraft** - As prostitutes sell physical pleasure and witches sell knowledge and power gained through magic, the people of Nineveh sell people they have taken in war and take profit from their sin. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
