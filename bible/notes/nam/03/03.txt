\v 3 The sight of attacking horsemen, the flashing sword, the glittering spear, heaps of corpses, and a great pile of bodies. There is no end of the bodies; their attackers stumble over the bodies.
\v 4 This is happening because of the lustful actions of the beautiful prostitute, the expert in witchcraft, who sells nations through her prostitution, and peoples through her acts of witchcraft.
