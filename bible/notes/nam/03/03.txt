\q
\v 3 There are attacking horsemen,
\q flashing swords, glittering spears,
\q heaps of corpses, great piles of bodies.
\q There is no end to the bodies; their attackers stumble over them.
\q
\v 4 This is happening because of the lustful actions of the beautiful prostitute, the expert in witchcraft,
\q who sells nations through her prostitution, and peoples through her acts of witchcraft.

  * **corpses** - bodies of people who have died
  * **There is no end to the bodies** - The words "no end" are an exaggeration for the great number of bodies that the attackers piled into heaps. AT: "There are too many bodies to count" or "There are a great number of bodies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
