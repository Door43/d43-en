===== translationNotes: =====

  * **your shepherds are asleep; your rulers are lying down resting** - These two lines share similar meanings. Nahum speaks of the leaders of Assyria as if they were shepherd who are to care for their sheep. He speaks of the shepherds and rulers dying as if they had fallen asleep. AT: "your leaders who are like shepherds are dead; your rulers are all dead" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Your people are scattered on the mountains** - Nahum speaks of the people of Nineveh as if they were sheep that scatter after the shepherds have died. AT: "Your people are scattered like sheep on the mountains" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **No healing is possible for your wounds. Your wounds are severe** - Nahum speaks of the certainty of the destruction of Nineveh and the defeat of its king as if the king had suffered an incurable wound. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **No healing is possible for your wounds** - The word "healing" can be translated with a verbal phrase. AT: "No one is able to heal your wounds" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Who has escaped your constant wickedness?** - This rhetorical question emphasizes the negative answer that it anticipates. All of the nations that were near Assyria had suffered because of Assyria's constant wickedness. AT: "No one has escaped your constant wickedness." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
