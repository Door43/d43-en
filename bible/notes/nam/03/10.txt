Nahum speaks to the people of Nineveh as though they were the city itself. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])

  * **Thebes** - the former capital of Egypt, which the Assyrians had conquered
  * **she...her** - Thebes.
  * **dashed in pieces** - The invaders killed the children of Thebes as easily as one breaks a clay pot. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **bound in chains** - put into slavery. AT: "became slaves" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
