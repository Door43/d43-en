\q
\v 10 Yet Thebes was carried away; she went into captivity;
\q her young children were dashed in pieces at the head of every street;
\q her enemies threw lots for her honorable men,
\q and all her great men were bound in chains.
\q
\v 11 You also will become drunk; you will try to hide,
\q and you will also look for a refuge from your enemy.
