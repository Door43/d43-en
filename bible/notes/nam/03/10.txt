    * **she... her**  - refer to Thebes.

    * **threw lots** - means that the invaders gambled or played a game in which the winner took a prize. 
    * **were bound in chains** - refers to being put into slavery.  Alternate translation: "became slaves" (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
    * **You**  - refers to Nineveh.
    * **you will try to hide; you also will look for a refuge from your enemy** - The word "refuge" refers to a safe place.  These two phrases are saying the same thing.  The thought is mentioned twice to add emotion to the words.  (See: [[en:ta:translate:parallelism]])
