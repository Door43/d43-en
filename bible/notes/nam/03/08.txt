\v 8 Nineveh, are you better than Thebes, that was built on the Nile River, that had water around her, whose defense was the ocean, whose wall was the sea itself?

===== Translation Notes: =====

Nahum speaks to the people of Nineveh as though they were the city itself. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])

  * **are you better than Thebes...?** - AT: "you are not better than Thebes...." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Thebes** - the former capital of Egypt, which the Assyrians had conquered
  * **whose defense was the ocean, whose wall was the sea itself** - The Nile River surrounded Thebes and made attacking it difficult. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **defense...wall** - Ancient cities had a main "wall" to keep attackers out, and an outer line of "defense" to keep attackers from the wall.
  * **ocean...sea** - If these words are the same in your language, use a general term for a large body of water for "sea."
