\v 8 Your city is certainly no safer than the city of Thebes was.
 Thebes was an important city beside the Nile River;
 the river was like a wall around her.
\v 9 The rulers of Ethiopia and Egypt helped Thebes;
 there was no limit to their power.
 The governments of the nearby countries of Put and Libya were also allies of Thebes.

===== ULB: =====

\q
\v 8 Nineveh, are you better than Thebes, that was built on the Nile River, that had water around her,
\q whose defense was the ocean, whose wall was the sea itself?
\q
\v 9 Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and there was no end to it;
\q Put and Libya were allies to her.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Nahum speaks to the people of Nineveh as though they were the city itself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])

  * **are you better than Thebes ... itself?** - AT: "you are not better than Thebes ... itself." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Thebes** - the former capital of Egypt, which the Assyrians had conquered
  * **whose defense was the ocean, whose wall was the sea itself** - These two phrases share similar meanings. The words "ocean" and "sea" both refer to the Nile River which ran near the city and made attacking it difficult. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **defense ... wall** - Ancient cities had a main "wall" to keep attackers out, and an outer line of "defense" to keep attackers from the wall.
