<usfm>
\q
\v 16 You have multiplied your merchants more than the stars in the heavens; but they are like young locusts: they plunder the land and then fly away.
\q
\v 17 Your princes are as many as the full-grown locusts, and your generals are like swarms of them 
\q that camp in the walls on a cold day.
\q But when the sun rises they fly away to no one knows where.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Nahum speaks to the people of Nineveh as though they were the city itself. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])

  * **You have multiplied your merchants more than the stars in the heavens**  -  The merchants of Nineveh are as impossible to count as the stars in the sky. AT: "You have more merchants than anyone could count." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **merchants** - "traders" or "ones who buy and sell things" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]]) 
  * **princes**  - Use a word for political "leaders" (UDB).
  * **generals**  - Use a word for military "leaders" or other government authorities. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
