\v 16 You have multiplied your merchants more than the stars in the heavens; but they are like locusts: they plunder the land and then fly away.
\v 17 Your princes are as many as the locusts, and your generals are like grasshopper swarms, that camp in the walls on a cold day—but when the sun rises they fly away to no one knows where.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Nahum speaks to the people of Nineveh as though they were the city itself. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])

    * **merchants** - could also be "traders" or "ones who buy and sell things." (See: [[en:ta:translate:translateunknowns]]) 
    * **multiplied your merchants more than the stars in the heavens**  -  The merchants of Nineveh are as impossible to count as the stars in the sky. Alternate translation: "increased the number of your merchants to be more than a person could count" (See:[[en:ta:translate:hyperbole]])
    * **they**  - refers to the merchants of Nineveh.
    * **they are like locusts: they plunder the land and then fly away**  - There are many merchants from Nineveh. When Nineveh falls these merchants will leave the valuable things of the city they have collected. (See:[[en:ta:translate:simile
]])
    * **Your princes are as many as the locusts**  - Nineveh has many lower kings. (See:[[en:ta:translate:simile
]])
    * **your generals are like grasshopper swarms**  - Nineveh has many military leaders. (See:[[en:ta:translate:simile
]])
    * **camp in the walls on a cold day—but when the sun rises they fly away to no one knows where.**  - Locust cannot fly when they are cold, so they rest when it is cold or night. The leaders of Nineveh felt safe and were at peace inside the walls of the city.  Once the sun comes up and locusts are warm, they leave as if they have never been there.  In the same way, when war comes to Nineveh, the leaders whose job was to protect the people, went away and left the people of the city without protection. Alternate translation: "find protection in the city walls but run away when trouble comes and no one knows where they have gone.
