<usfm>
\v 16 You have multiplied your merchants more than the stars in the heavens; but they are like locusts: they plunder the land and then fly away.
\v 17 Your princes are as many as the locusts, and your generals are like grasshopper swarms, that camp in the walls on a cold day—but when the sun rises they fly away to no one knows where.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Nahum speaks to the people of Nineveh as though they were the city itself. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])

    * **You have multiplied your merchants more than the stars in the heavens**  -  The merchants of Nineveh are as impossible to count as the stars in the sky. AT: "You have more merchants than anyone could count." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
    * **merchants** - "traders" or "ones who buy and sell things" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]]) 
    * **princes**  - Use a word for political "leaders" (UDB).
    * **generals**  - Use a word for military "leaders" or other government authorities. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
