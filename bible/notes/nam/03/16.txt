\v 16 In your city there are now very many merchants;
 more than stars.
 But when your city is being destroyed, those merchants will take the valuable things and disappear
 like locusts that strip the leaves from plants and then fly away.
\v 17 Your leaders are also like a swarm of locusts
 that crowd together on the fences on a cold day,
 and then fly away when the sun comes up,
 and no one knows where they have gone.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 16 You have multiplied your merchants more than the stars in the heavens; but they are like young locusts: they plunder the land and then fly away.
\q
\v 17 Your princes are as many as the full-grown locusts, and your generals are like swarms of them
\q that camp in the walls on a cold day.
\q But when the sun rises they fly away to no one knows where.
