\v 5 "See, I am against you", says Yahweh of hosts; "I will raise up your skirt over your face and show your private parts to the nations, your shame to the kingdoms.
\v 6 I will throw disgusting filth on you and make you vile; I will make you someone that everyone will look at.
\v 7 It will come about that everyone who looks at you will flee from you and say, 'Nineveh is destroyed; who will weep for her?' Where can I find anyone to comfort you?"
