====== 1 Corinthians 02:10-11 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 God has caused his Spirit to reveal those things to us\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* believers. His Spirit can do that because he knows thoroughly the meaning of all things. He even knows the things about God that are very difficult to understand.
\v 11 Only a person himself \f + \ft Or: a person's spirit \f* knows what he is thinking. Similarly, only God's Spirit knows what God is thinking.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 These are the very things that God has shown us by the Spirit. For the Spirit sees everything and he knows everything. He even knows the deepest and hidden secrets that only God knows about himself.
\v 11 No one except the spirit of the person knows what he is thinking. So it is that no one knows the hidden things of God except the Spirit of God.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 These are the things that  God has revealed to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the deep things of God.
\v 11 For who knows a person's thoughts except the spirit of the person in him? So also, no one knows the deep things of God except the Spirit of God.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **These are the things** - the truths about Jesus and the cross.
  * **For who knows a person's thoughts except the spirit of the person in him?** - Paul used this question to emphasize that no other man knows what a person is thinking except the person himself. AT: "No one knows what a person is thinking except that person's spirit" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **spirit of the person** - Note this "spirit" refers to the unclean or evil spirit in man that is distinct from the Spirit of God.
