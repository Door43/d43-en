\v 8 None of those who rule this world knew that wise plan. If they had known it, they would not have nailed our wonderful Lord to the cross.
\v 9 But  \add we believers need to remember these words that a prophet\add* wrote  \add in the Scriptures\add*:
\q Things that no one has ever seen,
\q things that no one ever heard,
\q things that no one ever thought could happen,
\q those are the things that God has prepared for those who love him.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 None of those who rule this world knew about God's wise plans. If they had understood them, they never would have nailed the Lord to the cross, but they should have honored Christ instead.
\v 9 But in the Scriptures it says:
\q "Things that no one has seen,
\q no one has heard,
\q no one could imagine,
\q these are the things that God has prepared for those who love him."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 None of the rulers of this age knew this wisdom, for if they had understood it at that time, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
\v 9 But as it is written,
\q "Things that no eye has seen, 
\q1 no ear has heard,
\q no mind imagined,
\q1 the things that God has prepared for those who love him."
