===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 None of those who rule this world knew that wise plan. If they had known it, they would not have nailed our wonderful Lord to the cross.
\v 9 But  \add we believers need to remember these words that a prophet\add* wrote  \add in the Scriptures\add*:
\q Things that no one has ever seen,
\q things that no one ever heard,
\q things that no one ever thought could happen,
\q those are the things that God has prepared for those who love him.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 None of those who rule this age knew about God's wise plans and purposes. Their purposes did not go along with the reign of God over all, and so they nailed the Lord of glory to the cross.
\v 9 But in the scriptures it says:
\q Things that no eye has seen,
\q no ear has heard,
\q no mind imagined,
\q these are the things God has prepared for those who love him.

<usfm>
\v 8 None of the rulers of this age knew this wisdom, for, if they had understood it at that time, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
\v 9 But as it is written,
\q "Things that no eye has seen, 
\q no ear has heard,
\q no mind imagined,
\q the things God has prepared for those who love him."
