====== 1 Corinthians 02:14-16 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 Those who are unbelievers reject the truths that  \add God's\add* Spirit teaches us\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add*, because they  \add consider those truths to be\add* foolish. They cannot understand them, because it is God's Spirit who enables us to evaluate those truths correctly, \add and those people do not have God's Spirit\add*.
\v 15 We who have God's Spirit can judge correctly the  \add value of\add* all truths  \add that the Spirit reveals\add*, but  \add unbelievers\add* cannot evaluate us correctly.
\v 16 As  \add one of our prophets wrote:
\add*
\q No human \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* has known what the Lord is thinking. 
\q No human \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* is able to instruct him.
\q But we believers are able to think about things \f + \ft metonymy \f* in the way that Christ thinks about them,

\v 14 The one who does not know God cannot accept the insights that come from the Spirit of God. To that person they sound like the lessons of fools. Only people who have the wisdom that comes from God can understand these things.
\v 15 The one who knows God makes judgments about all matters, but he does not have to come under the judgment of other people.
\v 16 As one of our prophets wrote:
\q "It is impossible for anyone to know all that is in the mind of the Lord.
\q No one is able to teach God."
\m
But we can know the very thoughts of Christ.

<usfm>
\v 14 The unspiritual person does not receive the things that belong to the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him. He cannot know them because they are spiritually discerned.
\v 15 The one who is spiritual judges all things, but he is not subject to the judgment of others.
\v 16 
\q "For who can know the mind of the Lord, that he can instruct him?"
\m But we have the mind of Christ.
