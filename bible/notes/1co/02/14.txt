====== 1 Corinthians 02:14-16 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 Those who are unbelievers reject the truths that  \add God's\add* Spirit teaches us\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add*, because they  \add consider those truths to be\add* foolish. They cannot understand them, because it is God's Spirit who enables us to evaluate those truths correctly, \add and those people do not have God's Spirit\add*.
\v 15 We who have God's Spirit can judge correctly the  \add value of\add* all truths  \add that the Spirit reveals\add*, but  \add unbelievers\add* cannot evaluate us correctly.
\v 16 As  \add one of our prophets wrote:
\add*
\q No human \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* has known what the Lord is thinking. 
\q No human \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* is able to instruct him.
\q But we believers are able to think about things \f + \ft metonymy \f* in the way that Christ thinks about them,

\v 14 The unbeliever will not accept the insights that come from the Spirit of God. To that person they sound like the lessons of fools. Spiritual lessons can be understood and treasured only when they are judged by people who have spiritual wisdom.
\v 15 And the person who has spiritual discernment has the ability to judge spiritual matters. But he is under the judgment of no other person.
\v 16 As one of our prophets wrote:

\q "Is it possible for anyone to know all that is in the mind of the Lord?
\q Is anyone qualified to be God's advisor?"
\m
But we can think the thoughts of Christ, because he lives within us.

<usfm>
\v 14 The unspiritual person does not receive the things that belong to the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him. And he cannot know them, because they are spiritually discerned.
\v 15 The one who is spiritual discerns all matters, but he himself is judged by no one.
\v 16 
\q "For who could know the mind of the Lord, so that he should instruct him?"
\m But we have the mind of Christ.
