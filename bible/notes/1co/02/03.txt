====== 1 Corinthians 02:3-5 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Furthermore, when I was with you, I felt that I was not adequate  \add to do what Christ wanted me to do\add*. I was afraid  \add that I would not be able to do it\add*, and because of that I was trembling very much.
\v 4 When I taught you and preached to you, I did not speak words that  \add unbelievers would consider\add* \f + \ft irony \f* wise in order to convince them that my message was true. Instead, \add God's\add* Spirit showed that it was true by  \add enabling me to\add* powerfully  \add perform miracles\add*.
\v 5  \add I taught and preached that way\add* in order that you might believe  \add my message\add*, not because you heard words that people  \add considered to be\add* \f + \ft irony \f* wise, but  \add because you realized\add* God's power.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 When I was with you, you know how physically weak I was. You know that fear filled my heart, and that you saw me trembling in terror because of my enemies.
\v 4 But you heard my message, and you know that when I spoke to you I did not give carefully planned speeches. Instead, the Spirit of God showed you that I was speaking the truth because of the power of the miracles he did through me.
\v 5  I taught this way so you might trust in God because of his power, and not because of anything having to do with human wisdom.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.
\v 4 And my word and my proclamation were not with persuasive words of wisdom, but they were with the demonstration of the Spirit and of power,
\v 5 so that your faith might not be in the wisdom of humans, but in the power of God.
