<usfm>
\v 1 If we could speak  \add all\add* the various languages \f + \ft metonymy \f* that people  \add in the world speak\add* and even speak  \add the language\add* that angels  \add speak\add*, if we did not love  \add others, speaking those languages\add* would be  \add as useless as beating\add* a brass gong or clanging cymbals  \add together\add*.
\v 2 If we had the ability to speak messages that come directly from God, and if we could understand the plans that he has not yet revealed  \add to others\add*, and if we could know everything  \add about everything\add*, and if we believed in God so strongly that we could  \add do impossible things like\add* causing mountains to move, if we did not love  \add others, God would consider all that\add* to be worthless.
\v 3 If we would give everything that we own to poor people, and if we would let others kill us in order that we could boast about  \add sacrificing our\add* own bodies, if we did not love  \add others\add*, we would not get any reward  \add from God\add*.

\v 1 If I could speak so that I could amaze and persuade people to do what I wanted, or if I could speak with angels— but if I did not love people, I would be worth less than a gong or a cymbal, which does nothing but make noise.
\v 2 If I could proclaim messages for God, and if I could explain secret truths about God, and if I trusted in God so much that I could move a mountain—but if I did not love people, I would be worth nothing.
\v 3 If gave away all I own to feed the poor, or if I sacrificed myself to be burned to rescue someone else—but if I do not love people, I would gain nothing.

\c 13
\p
\v 1 If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but if I do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.
\v 2 And if I have the gift of prophecy and understand all hidden truths and  knowledge; and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.
\v 3 And if I give all I own to feed the poor and if I give my body to be burned, but do not have love, I gain nothing.
