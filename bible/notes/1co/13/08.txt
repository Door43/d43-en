====== 1 Corinthians 13:8-10 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 We should never \f + \ft personification \f* let anything stop us from continuing to love  \add others\add*. As for the ability to speak messages that come directly from God, some day that will come to an end. As for the ability to speak languages \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that we have not learned\add*, that will  \add also\add* come to an end some day. And as for the ability to know things that God reveals to us, that will come to an end some day  \add because it will not be necessary anymore\add*.
\v 9 God does not reveal everything to us, and we cannot know everything that he knows.
\v 10 But when everything is perfect  \add after Christ returns\add*, things which are not perfect  \add now\add*, \add such as the abilities which God's Spirit gives us\add*, will be abolished\f + \ft Or: come to an end \f*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 If you truly love, you will not stop loving. Those who are able to speak God's messages, speak in strange language, or know hidden truths, do these things only for a while. One day they will stop doing these things.
\v 9 Now, in this life, we know only a small part of all there is to know. Those who proclaim God's messages do so only partially.
\v 10 But when things that are perfect happen, everything that is partial or incomplete will end.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Love never ends. If there are prophecies, they will pass away; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will pass away.
\v 9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part,
\v 10 but when the perfect comes, that which is incomplete will pass away.
</usfm>
