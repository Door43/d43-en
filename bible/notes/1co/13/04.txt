\v 4 What is love? Love is not in a hurry, it can wait for others and never be annoyed or become cross because you waited; and it is understanding and tender, it says what needs to be spoken, and no more, it can bring a word of encouragement, just when it is needed, and it can enter any difficulty and do what is needed for the good of everyone. Love want what belongs to others and doesn't want them to lose what they have. Love is alien to envy. Love takes away the need to brag about accomplishments, and it can say nothing at all about good things I have done. Love has no need to boast. Love is not haught and self-promoting,
\v 5 and it cannot say anything to hurt another or by demanding attention and wanting people to pay attention to me. Love does not take action for the service of the self, it is not quickly angry and it keeps no score of the bad things that have come nor remember who caused them.
\v 6 Love cannot find any joy when injustice is done or when wickedness gains the upper hand. But love finds every way to celebrate the truth.
\v 7 Love puts up with everything that happens. Love trusts God in every trial or sorrow, in every blessing or display of God's control. Love has hope for every promise of God, and is assured they will all prove true. Love can guide me through every difficulty and pain, it is sure about the end of the journey.

\v 4 Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant
\v 5 or rude. It is not self-serving, it is not easily-angered, nor does it keep a count of wrongs.
\v 6 It does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices in the truth.
\v 7 Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, and endures all things.
