\v 4 If you truly love others, you will endure hardships with joy. If you truly love, you will be kind to others. If you truly love, you will not resent that other people possess things you do not have. If you truly love, you will not boast about yourself or be proud.
\v 5 If you truly love others, you will not abuse them. You will not live to please yourself. No one will be able to make you angry quickly. You will not keep track of the wrong things people have done.
\v 6 If you truly love others, you will not be happy if anyone does wicked things; instead, you will be happy when people are faithful to God.
\v 7 If you truly love others, you will endure everything that happens. You will trust that God will do the best things for people. You will trust in God regardless of what happens. You will obey God regardless of what hardships you are facing.

<usfm>
\v 4 Love is patient and kind. Love does not envy or boast. It is not arrogant
\v 5 or rude. It is not self-serving. It is not easily angered, nor does it keep a count of wrongs.
\v 6 It does not rejoice in unrighteousness. Instead, it rejoices in the truth.
\v 7 Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, and endures all things.
