\v 11 When we were children, we talked like children talk, we thought like children think, we reasoned like children reason. But when we grew up, we got rid of our childish ways \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add Similarly\add*, \add you need to get rid of your childish thinking about the abilities that the Spirit has given you\add*.
\v 12 In this life we do not understand everything fully. It is like \f + \ft metaphor \f* looking at something indirectly by seeing it in a mirror. But  \add when we get to heaven\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*, we will  \add understand everything clearly. It will be like\add* talking to someone face-to-face.

\v 11 When I was a small child, I talked like a child talks, I thought like a child thinks, and I made decisions like a child. But when I became an adult, I stopped acting like a child, and I started acting like an adult.

\v 11 When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I thought as a child, I reasoned as a child. When I became an adult, I put away childish things.
\v 12 For now we see in a mirror, as in a dark image, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully just as I have been fully known.
\v 13 But now these three remain: faith, confidence, and love; but the greatest of these is love.
