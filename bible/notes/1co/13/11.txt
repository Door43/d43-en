\v 11 When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child. Now that I am a man, I have put away childish things.
\v 12 For now we see in a mirror, darkly; but then face to face. Now I know in part; but then shall I know fully even as I was fully known.
\v 13 But now remains faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love.
