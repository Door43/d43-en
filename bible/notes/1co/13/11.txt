\v 11 When we were children, we talked like children talk, we thought like children think, we reasoned like children reason. But when we grew up, we got rid of our childish ways \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add Similarly\add*, \add you need to get rid of your childish thinking about the abilities that the Spirit has given you\add*.
\v 12 In this life we do not understand everything fully. It is like \f + \ft metaphor \f* looking at something indirectly by seeing it in a mirror. But  \add when we get to heaven\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*, we will  \add understand everything clearly. It will be like\add* talking to someone face-to-face. Now we know only part  \add of everything that God wants us to know\add*. Then we will know everything completely, just like  \add God\add* knows us completely.
\v 13 So now there are three things  \add that we must\add* continue  \add to do\add*: To trust  \add in God\add*, to confidently expect  \add to receive what he will give us\add*, and to love  \add others\add*. But the greatest of those three things is loving  \add others\add*.

\v 11 When I was a small child, I talked as a child talks, I thought as a child thinks, and I made decisions as a child makes decision. But when I became an adult, I stopped acting like a child, and I started acting like an adult.
\v 12 What we understand about Christ now, we understand very imperfectly, not well at all. But when Christ returns, we will see him face to face. Now we know only part of what is true. But then we will know him fully, just as he knows us fully.
\v 13 It is important that we trust in Christ now. It is important that we are certain that he will do for us everything that he has promised. And it is important that we love him and each other. But the greatest of these three things is love.

\v 11 When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became an adult, I put away childish things.
\v 12 For now we see indirectly in a mirror, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully just as I have been fully known.
\v 13 But now these three remain: faith, future confidence, and love. But the greatest of these is love.
