===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 Think about the people of Israel. Those who eat the sacrifices at the altar share in the altar.
\v 19 So am I saying that an idol is something real, or that it is important not to eat food sacrificed to an idol? Not at all.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 Look at the people of Israel: are not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar?
\v 19 What am I saying then? That an idol is anything? Or that food sacrificed to an idol is anything?
