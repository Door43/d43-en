\v 25 \add This is what you should do\add*: Eat any \add food\add* that is sold \f + \ft Or:that people sell \f* in the market. Do not ask questions \add to find out if that food has been offered\add* \f + \ft Or:\add someone offered that food\add* \f* \add to idols, just\add* because you think it would be wrong \add to eat such food\add*.
\v 26 \add Remember that the Psalmist wrote\add*, "Everything on the earth belongs to \add the\add* Lord \add God because he created it!\add*" \add So, food that has been offered to idols belongs to the Lord, not to the idols, and you may eat it\add*.
\v 27 If a non-believer invites you to a meal, go if you want to, and eat any food that is set \f + \ft Or:that \add he\add* sets \f* before you. Do not ask \add whether it was offered to idols, just\add* because you think that it would be wrong \add to eat such food\add*.

\v 25 The rule for eating food sold in idol temples is that you may eat whatever is sold there in the market, and you don't have to ask questions about the place your food had in the idol's service. Just get the food you need.
\v 26 As the psalmist says, "The earth is the Lord's and the fulness of it."
\v 27 If an pagan unbeliever invites you to eat a meal, and you desire to be friends, go and eat whatever he serves to you. You are not under any obligation to ask him about where he purchased the food. Just enjoy the meal.
