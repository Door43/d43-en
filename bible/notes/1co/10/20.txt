\v 20 No! Instead, I mean that what people sacrifice \add to idols\add*, they are sacrificing to demons, not to God. So, \add if you eat food that has been sacrificed to idols, you are participating in worshipping the demons that the idols represent\add*. And I do not want you to participate in worshipping demons!
\v 21 When you drink the \add grape juice\f + \ft Or: wine \f* in\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* the cup \add at the Lord's Supper\add*, you cannot participate in the \add blessings that\add* the Lord \add Jesus\add* brought to us and at the same time drink the \add wine in the\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* cup that people offer to demons! When you eat at the Lord's table, you cannot participate in the blessings the Lord provided \f + \ft metonymy \f* when he died for us and at the same time participate in the things that represent demons \add by eating food that has been sacrificed to idols\add*!
\v 22 \add If you participate in honoring demons in that way\add*, you will certainly make the Lord very angry.\f + \ft Or: will not you make the Lord very angry? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* Remember that you are certainly not stronger than he is.\f + \ft Or: Do you think that you are stronger than he is? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add Certainly not, so you will not escape his punishing you if you honor demons in that way!\add*

\v 20 When the pagans offer their sacrifices to idols, they are really offering them to demons and not to God. But you already know that you must not have any interaction with demons and certainly not to engage in their worship.
\v 21 You must not drink the communion cup of the Lord along and then turn and drink the cup of demons. You must not have communion with Christians at the table of the Lord and then, later that day, have a pagan worship service at the table of demons!
\v 22 To do so would provoke the Lord to anger and it would test his holy  jealousy. Do not think for an instant that you are stronger than he is!

\v 20 But I say, that the things the Gentile pagans sacrifice, they offer these things to demons and not to God. I do not wish that you be participants with demons!
\v 21 You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot have fellowship at the table of the Lord and the table of demons.
\v 22 Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he is?
