\v 20 But I say, that the Gentiles sacrifice things to demons, and not to God. But I wish that you would not have fellowship with demons.
\v 21 You cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons. You cannot share in the table of the Lord, and in the table of demons.
\v 22 Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than him?
