\v 11 All those things \add that happened to our ancestors long ago\add* are examples for us. \add Moses\add* wrote those things to warn us \add who are living now\add*. We are the people for whom God has fulfilled \add the things that he purposed in\add* the previous periods of time.
\v 12 So \add I say this to\add* all those who confidently \add think that they will always\add* steadfastly continue to \add believe what God said and will never disobey what he commanded\add*: Be careful that you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* do not sin \add when you are tempted\add*.
\v 13 \add Remember that\add* your desires to sin are the same desires that other people have. But when you are tempted to sin, you can trust God \add to help you\add*. He will not permit you to be tempted \f + \ft Or:anything to tempt you \f* more than you are able to resist. Instead, when you are tempted \f + \ft Or:things tempt you \f*, he will also provide a way \add for you\add* to endure it \add without sinning\add*.

\v 11 Now these things happened to our ancestors; they were written so we could learn from them—we, who are living very close to when the world will end.
\v 12 And so the lesson is this: If you think you are strong and are standing strong, be very careful, because this is just when you may fall.
\v 13 Every temptation you have fought against is shared by us all, but God has given us his promise and he will not permit the temptation to be greater than your ability to fight against the sin. When the temptation comes, God will provide a way for you to get free of it, so you may endure the temptation to sin.

\v 11 Now these things happened to them as examples for us. They were written for our instruction—for us on whom the end of the ages has come.
\v 12 Therefore let anyone who thinks he stands be careful that he does not fall.
\v 13 No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to all humanity. Instead, God is faithful. He will not let you be tempted beyond your ability. With the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, so that you may be able to endure it.
