====== 1 Corinthians 10 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. Many English translations indent the line of 10:7, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.  

Paul first uses the exodus as a warning to people not to sin.  Then he returns to discussing meat offered to idols using the Lord's Super as an example.                               

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

Paul uses the experiences of Israel leaving Egypt and roaming the desert as a warning to the believers. Although they all followed Moses and were baptized, as it were, in the cloud and sea, they all died on the way and none of them reached God’s promised land. Some worshipped an idol, some tested Christ and some grumbled. This is a warning for us not to sin and no temptation is irresistible because God provides a way of escape for us.
 

Then Paul returns to the discussion of meat offered to idols. Just as cthere was ommunion bread and wine is sharing with Christ, meat offered to idols can be sharing with demons.  We are allowed to eat but it may not help others. So when buying meat or eating with a friend, do not ask if it has been offered to idols; but if someone tells you it has been offered to idols, don’t eat it for the sake of that person. Do not offend anyone but seek to save them.
