<usfm>
\v 1 My fellow believers, I want to remind you that all our \add Jewish\add* ancestors were under the cloud \add by which God miraculously led them and protected them when they left Egypt with Moses\add*. All those ancestors crossed the Red Sea \add after God miraculously made the water separate so that they could walk through it\add*.
\v 2 God caused all of them to begin to live under the authority of \f + \ft metonymy \f* Moses \add when they walked\add* under that cloud and \add walked through the Red\add* Sea.
\v 3 All \add those ancestors of ours ate the same food that God\add* miraculously \add provided\add*.
\v 4 They all drank water that \add God\add* miraculously\add provided\add*. That is, they all drank water that God miraculously made come out of the rock. That rock was \add a symbol of\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* Christ, who went with them. \add So we conclude that God helped all of those people in many ways\add*.

\v 2 And all were baptized to Moses in the cloud and in the sea;
\v 3 Also all ate the same spiritual food.
