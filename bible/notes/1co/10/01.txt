====== 1 Corinthians 10:1-4 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 My fellow believers, I want to remind you that all our \add Jewish\add* ancestors were under the cloud \add by which God miraculously led them and protected them when they left Egypt with Moses\add*. All those ancestors crossed the Red Sea \add after God miraculously made the water separate so that they could walk through it\add*.
\v 2 God caused all of them to begin to live under the authority of \f + \ft metonymy \f* Moses \add when they walked\add* under that cloud and \add walked through the Red\add* Sea.
\v 3 All \add those ancestors of ours ate the same food that God\add* miraculously \add provided\add*.
\v 4 They all drank water that \add God\add* miraculously\add provided\add*. That is, they all drank water that God miraculously made come out of the rock. That rock was \add a symbol of\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* Christ, who went with them. \add So we conclude that God helped all of those people in many ways\add*.

\v 1 I want you to remember, brothers and sisters, that our Jewish ancestors were following God, who led them out of Egypt by means of a cloud during the day, and that they passed through the Sea of Reeds on dry land.
\v 2 And as we have been baptized into Christ, so the Israelites were to follow Moses as he followed God in the cloud and across the sea.
\v 3 They all ate the supernatural manna that God gave them from heaven,
\v 4 and they all drank the supernatural water that God gave them when Moses struck the rock. The rock was Christ.

\v 1 I want you to know, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea.
\v 2 All were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea,
\v 3 and all ate the same spiritual food.
\v 4 All drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from a spiritual rock that followed them, and that rock was Christ.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul reminds them of the example of their ancient Jewish fathers' experiences with immorality and idolatry.

  * **our fathers** - Paul is referring to the time of Moses in the book of Exodus when Israel fled through the Red Sea as the Egyptian army pursued them. The word "our" refers to himself and the Corinthians and is inclusive. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
  * **passed through the sea** - This sea is known by two names, the Red Sea and the Sea of Reeds.
  * **passed through** - "walked through" or "traveled through"
  * **All were baptized into Moses** - "All followed and were committed to Moses"
  * **in the cloud** - by the cloud that represented the presence of God and led the Israelites during the day
  * **drank the same spiritual drink ... spiritual rock** - "drank the same water that God supernaturally brought out of the rock ... supernatural rock"
  * **that rock was Christ** - The "rock" was a literal, physical rock, so it would be best to translate this literally. If your language cannot say that a rock "was" a person's name, treat the word "rock" as a metonym for the power of Christ that worked through the rock. AT: "It was Christ who worked through that rock" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
