====== 1 Corinthians 10:28-30 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 But if someone says to you, "This is food that was sacrificed \add to an idol\add*," do not eat it, for the sake of the person who told that to you, and also because someone may think that it is wrong \add to eat such food\add*.
\v 29 I do not mean that you \add should be concerned about whether it is all right to eat such food\add*. What I mean is that you should be concerned about others who may think that it is wrong to eat such food. Since I know that I am free\f + \ft Or: have the right \f* \add to eat such food without God punishing me\add*, no one should \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* say that what I am doing is wrong just because he himself thinks that it is wrong.
\v 30 If I thank \add God\add* for the food when I eat \add food that has been offered to an idol\add*, no one should criticize me for eating food for which I have thanked God \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*!

<usfm>
\v 28 But if someone says to you, "We bought this food at the idol temple and it was sacrificed to the gods," then do not eat the food, for the good of the person who served it, and so as not to cause conflict in the sense of right and wrong.
\v 29 This is not being careful about how you yourself think about right and wrong, but about how that other person thinks about it. My personal choices are not to be changed by what another person believes is right or wrong.
\v 30 If I enjoy the meal with thanksgiving, I should not permit someone else to condemn me.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 But if someone says to you, "This food was from a pagan sacrifice," do not eat it. This is for the sake of the one who informed you, and for the sake of conscience.
\v 29 I do not mean your own conscience, but the other person's conscience. For why should my freedom be judged by another's conscience?
\v 30 If I partake of the meal with gratitude, why am I vilified for that for which I gave thanks?
