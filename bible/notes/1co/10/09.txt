====== 1 Corinthians 10:9-10 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 We should not try to see how much we can sin without the Lord punishing us. Some of them did that, and as a result they died because \add poisonous\add* snakes \add bit them\add*.
\v 10 We should not complain \add about what God does\add*. Some of them did that, and as a result an angel destroyed them. \add So God will certainly punish us if we sin like they did\add*.

\v 9 Let us not test the authority of Christ by disobeying him, as some of our ancestors did, and poisonous snakes killed them.
\v 10 Do not grumble about what God provides, as some our ancestors did, and an angel destroyed them.
