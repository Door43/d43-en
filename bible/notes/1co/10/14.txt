\v 14 So, \add I say to\add* you people whom I love, \add avoid\add* worshipping idols \add just like you would\add* run away from \add anything that is dangerous\add*.
\v 15 It is to people who \add think that they\add* are wise that I write. So, you, as wise people, judge whether what I am writing \add is true\add*.
\v 16 \add During the Lord's Supper, after we ask God to\add* bless the \add wine\add*\f + \ft Or: the \add grape juice\add* \f* \add in the\add* cup, we give thanks for it \add and drink it\add*. By doing that, we certainly are \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* sharing in what Christ \add did for us when\add* his blood \add flowed from his body when he died. During the Lord's Supper, when we break\add* the bread\add and eat it\add*, we are certainly sharing in \f + \ft metonymy \f* what Christ \add did for us when\add* his body \add suffered for us on the cross\add*.\f + \ft Or: are we not sharing in ( metonymy ) what Christ \add did for us when\add* his body \add suffered for us on the cross?\add* \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 17 Because it is one loaf of bread that we \add break and eat during the Lord's Supper, it symbolizes that\add* we who are many are one group, because we all eat from the one loaf.

\v 14 Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.
\v 15 I speak to you as wise men, so judge what I say.
\v 16 Is not the cup of blessing which we bless a communion of the blood of Christ? Is not the bread which we break a communion of the body of Christ?
\v 17 Because there is one loaf of bread and we who are many are part of the one loaf.
