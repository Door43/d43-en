<usfm>
\v 14 So, \add I say to\add* you people whom I love, \add avoid\add* worshipping idols \add just like you would\add* run away from \add anything that is dangerous\add*.
\v 15 It is to people who \add think that they\add* are wise that I write. So, you, as wise people, judge whether what I am writing \add is true\add*.
\v 16 \add During the Lord's Supper, after we ask God to\add* bless the \add wine\add*\f + \ft Or: the \add grape juice\add* \f* \add in the\add* cup, we give thanks for it \add and drink it\add*. By doing that, we certainly are \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* sharing in what Christ \add did for us when\add* his blood \add flowed from his body when he died. During the Lord's Supper, when we break\add* the bread\add and eat it\add*, we are certainly sharing in \f + \ft metonymy \f* what Christ \add did for us when\add* his body \add suffered for us on the cross\add*.\f + \ft Or: are we not sharing in ( metonymy ) what Christ \add did for us when\add* his body \add suffered for us on the cross?\add* \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 17 Because it is one loaf of bread that we \add break and eat during the Lord's Supper, it symbolizes that\add* we who are many are one group, because we all eat from the one loaf.

\v 14 Therefore, my loved ones, run away as fast as you can from idol worship.
\v 15 I speak to you as people who consider carefully how you live; think about what I am saying here.
\v 16 When we drink the cup of wine that we bless, we share in the blood of Christ. When we break the bread, we share in the body of Christ.
\v 17 There is only one loaf of bread, and we, although we are many, all make up just one body together, and we all take and eat from the one loaf of bread together.

\v 14 Therefore, my loved ones, run away from idolatry.
\v 15 I speak to you as thoughtful people, so you may judge what I say.
\v 16 The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a sharing in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a sharing in the body of Christ?
\v 17 Because there is one loaf of bread, we who are many are one body, and we all take of one loaf of bread together.
