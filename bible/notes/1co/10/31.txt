\v 32 Do not do anything that would hinder Jews or Greeks \add from becoming believers\add*, and do not do things that would encourage members of God's congregations to sin.
\v 33 \add Do as I do\add*. I try to please everyone in every way. I do this by not seeking to benefit myself. Instead, I try to benefit many others, in order that they may be saved \f + \ft Or:that \add God\add* may save them \f* \add from the guilt of their sins\add*.

<usfm>
\v 31 The rule here is that whether you eat a meal or drink something offered to you, or whatever you do, do everything in a way so that you give praise to God.
\v 32 Do not be offensive to Jews or to Greeks, nor even to those in the church of God, about matters such as these.
\v 33 I make it my duty to please everyone I can, in every way that is possible. I do this by not seeking my own good. Instead, I try to build up other people by helping them, so that God might save them.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 31 Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
\v 32 Give no offence to Jews or to Greeks, or to the church of God,
\v 33 just as I try to please all people in all things, not seeking my benefit, but that of the many, that they may be saved.
