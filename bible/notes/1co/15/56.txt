===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 56 It is because we sin \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add that we die, and it is because we\add* have God's laws that we \add know that we\add* have sinned.
\v 57 But because of what our Lord Jesus Christ \add has done\add*, he enables us to be free \add from having to obey God's laws to be saved and to be free of being afraid to die\add*. We should thank God for that!
