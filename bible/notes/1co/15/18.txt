\v 18 And those people who died \f + \ft euphemism \f* \add while they were trusting\add* in Christ will go to hell.
\v 19 In this life \add many of us have suffered much for Christ\add* because we confidently expect \add that he will reward us in heaven\add*. If we have confidently expected this in vain, people should pity us more than they pity anyone else!

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 If that is the case, then all those who have died trusting in Christ have also died with no hope of resurrection.
\v 19 If in this life only we have hope in Christ, and we expect him to do nothing for us after we die, then of all people, we most deserve the pity of others, for we have believed in a lie.
