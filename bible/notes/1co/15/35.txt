====== 1 Corinthians 15:35-36 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 35 But some of you are asking, "How will dead people be raised \f + \ft Or:How will \add God\add* cause dead people to become alive \f* again? What kind of bodies will they have?"
\v 36 \add Anyone who asks such questions is\add* foolish. You \add know that\add* a seed that is planted in the ground must completely change its form \f + \ft metaphor \f* before it sprouts.
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 35 Someone may ask you, "How can the dead rise? What kind of body could they ever have?"
\v 36 You know nothing! You do not think about the fact that any seed you plant in the ground will not start to grow until it dies.
</usfm>

\v 35 But someone will say, "How are the dead raised? And with what kind of body will they come?"
\v 36 You are so ignorant! What you sow will not start to grow unless it dies.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **But someone will say, "How are the dead raised? And with what kind of body will they come?"** - AT: "But some will say that they cannot imagine how God will raise the dead, and what kind of body God would give them in the resurrection." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **someone** - AT: "anyone who would question the resurrection"
  * **kind of body** - type of body: spiritual or physical or shape and substance 
  * **you are so ignorant** - AT: "you don't know about this at all."
  * **What you sow will not start to grow unless it dies** - A seed will not grow unless it is first buried  underground. In the same way, a person has to die before God can resurrect him. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
