====== 1 Corinthians 15:29-30 ======

<usfm>
\v 29 \add Now think about this: Some among you\add* are being baptized \f + \ft Or: are baptizing people \f* on behalf of those who died \add before someone baptized them\add* \f + \ft Or: who died \add before they became believers\add* \f*. If, \add as some people say, believers\add* will not be raised \add from the dead\add* \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* will not cause \add believers\add* to become alive again \f*, what is the value in those people doing that?\f + \ft Or: there is no value in those people doing that! \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* If \add God\add* will not cause any \add believers\add* to become alive again, it is senseless to be baptized \f + \ft Or:baptize anyone \f* on behalf of someone who has died.\f + \ft Or: why would someone be baptized ( Or:baptize anyone ) on behalf of someone who has died? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 30 Furthermore, \add if God will not cause us believers to become alive again\add*, it is \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* very foolish for me and the other apostles to be constantly \add putting ourselves\add* in danger \add because we tell people God's good message\add*!

<usfm>
\v 29 If all this were not true, then why do some Christians get others to baptize them for dead people? This would make no sense, if God will not raise the dead again.
\v 30 And it would make no sense for us apostles to continually risk our lives to proclaim the good news.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 29 Or else what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then are they baptized for them?
\v 30 And why are we in danger every hour?

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Or else what will those do who are baptized for the dead?** - AT: "Otherwise it would be useless for Christians to receive baptism for the dead" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **be baptized for the dead** - "receive baptism on behalf of dead people" 
    * **And why are we in danger every hour?** - If Jesus did not rise from the dead, then there is no justification for Paul & other christians to be in danger regarding their beliefs and teachings.
