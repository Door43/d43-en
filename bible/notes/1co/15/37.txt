====== 1 Corinthians 15:37-39 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 37 A seed, such as a wheat seed, is very different from the plant that sprouts from it.
\v 38 God gives everything that lives the form that he desires. He gives each seed its own form.
\v 39 \add Similarly\add*, people, animals, birds, and fish all have flesh, but each one has a different kind of flesh.
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 37 And when you die, the body you plant is not the same body that will come up. It is only a bare seed; it will change into something entirely different.
\v 38 God will give it a new body just as he chooses, and to each seed put into the ground, he will give a different body.
\v 39 Not all living creatures are the same. There are human beings, and there are animals on the land of many kinds, and there are the birds and fish. All of them are different.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 37 And what you sow is not the body that will be, but a bare seedâ€”it may become wheat or something else.
\v 38 But God will give it a body as he chooses, and to each seed its own  body.
\v 39 Not all flesh is the same, but there is one flesh of human beings, and another flesh for animals, and another flesh for birds, and another for fish.
</usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **what you sow is not the body that will be** - The metaphor of the seed is again used, meaning that the dead body of the believer will be resurrected, and will not appear as it was. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])  
  * **God will give it body as he chooses** - AT: "God will decide what kind of body"
