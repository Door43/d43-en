====== 1 Corinthians 15:37-39 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 37 A seed, such as a wheat seed, is very different from the plant that sprouts from it.
\v 38 God gives everything that lives the form that he desires. He gives each seed its own form.
\v 39 \add Similarly\add*, people, animals, birds, and fish all have flesh, but each one has a different kind of flesh.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 37 And what you sow when you die is not the body that will be raised up, but only a bare seed--it will be changed into something else entirely.
\v 38 But God will give this seed that is sown, a new body, just as he chooses, and to each individual seed, he gives its own body.
\v 39 All living creatures are not the same. There are human beings, and animals of many kinds, and birds and fish. All of them are different kinds.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 37 And what you sow is not the body that will be, but a bare seed—it may become wheat or something else.
\v 38 But God will give it a body as he chooses, and to each seed its own  body.
\v 39 Not all flesh is the same, but there is one flesh of human beings, and another flesh for animals, and another flesh for birds, and another for fish.
</usfm>
