====== 1 Corinthians 15:12-14 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 So now \add let me ask you this\add*: Since \add we\add* have all preached to you that Christ was raised again \f + \ft Or:that \add God\add* caused Christ to become alive \f* after he died, no one among you should be saying that \add God\add* will not cause \add believers\add* to become alive again after they die!\f + \ft Or: why do some of you say that \add God\add* will not cause \add believers\add* to become alive again after they die? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 13 If \add it is true that God\add* will not cause anyone to become alive again, that situation would mean that Christ was not raised from the dead \f + \ft Or:\add he\add* did not cause Christ to become alive again \f*!
\v 14 And if Christ was not raised from the dead \f + \ft Or:if \add God\add* did not cause Christ to become alive again \f*, then what we preached to you was useless, and your believing \add in Christ\add* is useless.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 Now some of you are saying that those who are now dead will not rise anymore. This cannot be true, because we have announced to you that Christ rose from the dead.
\v 13 If no one rises from the dead, then God certainly has not raised Christ.
\v 14 And if he has not raised Christ from the dead, then what we preach makes no sense at all, and what you believe about Christ can do nothing for you in your life or in your death.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 12 Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead ones, how can some of you say there is no resurrection of the dead?
\v 13 But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised.
\v 14 And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain, and your faith also is in vain.
