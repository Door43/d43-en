\v 27 \add In the Scriptures the Psalmist wrote that\add* God will cause everything to be under Christ's \add authority\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. But it is clear that the word 'everything' here does not include God, because God is the one who will cause everything to be under Christ's \add authority\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 28 After everything is put under \add the authority of\add* God's Son, then he will put himself completely under \add the authority of\add* God, the one who gave him that authority. Then God will be completely in control of everything \f + \ft idiom \f*, everywhere.

\v 27  For the Scriptures say, "God has placed everything under his feet," that is, Christ's feet. But it is clear that this does not include God himself.
\v 28 After God has placed all things into Christ's power, then the Son, also, will place himself in the power of God the Father, so that God may be the same in relation to everyone and everything.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 27 For, "he has put everything under his feet." But when it says "he has put everything," it is clear that this does not include the one who put everything in subjection to himself.
\v 28 When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will be subjected to the one who subjected everything to him, that God the Father may be all in all.
