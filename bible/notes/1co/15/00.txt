====== 1 Corinthians 15 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

**Resurrection**

The Greek peole did not believe that a person could live after he died. So some people in Corinth did not believe that people would be resurrected from the dead. In this chapter, Paul defends the resurrection of Christ and of all those who believe in him.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

**Resurrection**

Paul said that the Good News was that Christ died for our sins and God brought him back to life. It is proven true because many people who were still alive when Paul wrote this, and Paul himself saw him alive after his death. Christ is the first of many who will be raised to life. Paul was so sure of this that he was willing to risk his life every day to preach the Gospel. Death is not the end of life.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

This chapter is filled with figures of speech. 

** metaphor**

There are many [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]s in this chapter. “First fruits” were the first crops to ripen for harvesting. 
“God will put all of Christ’s enemies under his feet” means he will completely defeat them. 
A body that dies is “planted”/buried but come up not able to die.
cannot, “The sting of death” is sin, 

**simile**

"we have been like the man of dust, we will also be like the man of heaven" is a [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]].

**metonymy** 

“Flesh and Blood” is a [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] for human body. 
“inherit the kingdom of God” for get to heaven, “this perishable must put on imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality” all speaking about the believer’s bodies, all are metonymies.


**apostrophe**

"Death, where is your victory?, Death, where is your sting?" is an [:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]].


**hyperbole**

"I die daily", "I fought with beasts at Ephesus," What you sow will not start to grow unless it "dies" are all [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]]s.


=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

Or else what will those do who are baptized for the dead? The Church does not practice this any more.

Contrary to fact conditionals: One of the favorite proofs the Greek people used is the contrary to fact conditional. It suggests a fact that is not true and then says that if it were true then it would have this result. Since it does not have that result they conclude that the “if” statement is also untrue. May language do not use this type of proof so it can be difficult to understand. In this passage Paul uses seven contrary of fact conditionals in a row. One way of translate a contrary to fact conditional is to turn the sentence around and make a true statement using “since” out of it. For example: “if the dead are not raised then Christ is not raised” restructured as “since Christ has been raised, the dead are indeed raised.”   A restructuring of 15:13-18 Reversal: "Since Christ has been raised, we know that people can be raised from the dead, your sins are gone, your faith in Christ is well founded, believers that have already died will be raised and we have been shown not to be liars for telling you that Christ was raised from the dead.”
