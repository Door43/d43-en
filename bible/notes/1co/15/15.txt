====== 1 Corinthians 15:15-17 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 \add If it is true that\add* no one will be raised from the dead \f + \ft Or:\add that God\add* will not cause anyone to become alive again after he dies \f*, we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* have been guilty of lying to you about God, because we told you that God caused Christ to become alive again.
\v 16 But if it were really true that no one who has died will raised \f + \ft Or:that \add God will\add* not cause anyone who has died to become alive \f* again, then Christ was not raised \f + \ft Or:\add he\add* did not cause Christ to become alive \f* again either!
\v 17 If it were true that Christ was not raised \f + \ft Or:that \add God\add* did not cause Christ to become alive \f* again after he died, you have believed in Christ for nothing, \add because\add* God will still \add punish\add* you for \f + \ft metonymy \f* your sins.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 In addition, people will see that we have told lies about God, if the dead really do not rise again.
\v 16 Again I say, if no one rises from the dead, then God has not even raised Christ.
\v 17 And if he has not raised Christ, then what you believe is useless, and God still condemns you because you have sinned.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 And we are found to be false witnesses about God; because we testified against God, saying he raised up Christ, when he did not.
\v 16 For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised.
\v 17 And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is in vain and you are still in your sins.
</usfm>
