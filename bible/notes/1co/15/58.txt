===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - While they work for the Lord, Paul wants believers to remember the changed, resurrected bodies that God is going to give them.

  * **be steadfast and immovable** - AT: Paul speaks of someone who lets nothing stop him from carrying out his decisions as if he could not be physically moved. AT: "be determined" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Always abound in the work of the Lord** - Paul speaks of efforts made in working for the Lord as if they were objects that a person could acquire more of. AT: "Always work for the Lord faithfully" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
