===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 Because of what Adam did, all \add of us who are descended\add* from him die. Similarly, because of what \add Christ did\add*, all of us who have a close relationship with him will be made \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* will make all of us who have a close relationship with Christ \f* alive \add after we die\add*.
\v 23 But we must all take our turn. \add God raised\add* Christ first \f + \ft metaphor \f*. And when Christ returns\add , God will cause\add* those who belong to Christ to become alive again.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 Because, just as all die because Adam sinned, in the same way, all will live again because of Christ has done.
\v 23 But they will rise from the dead in a certain order: Christ is the first to have risen from the dead; then those who are joined to Christ will live again when he returns to earth.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ will all be made alive.
\v 23 But each in his own order: Christ, the firstfruits; then those who belong to Christ will be made alive at his coming.
</usfm>
