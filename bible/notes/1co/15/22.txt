\v 22 Because, just as all die because Adam sinned, in the same way, all will live again because of Christ has done.
\v 23 But they will rise from the dead in a certain order: Christ is the first to have risen from the dead; then those who are joined to Christ will live again when he returns to earth.

\v 22 For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ will all be made alive.
