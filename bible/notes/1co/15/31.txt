====== 1 Corinthians 15:31-32 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 31 My fellow believers, every day I \add am in danger of\add* being killed \f + \ft Or:people killing me \f*! That is as true as it is that I am pleased with you because of your close relationship with Christ Jesus our Lord.
\v 32 \add If God will not cause us believers to become alive again after we die\add*, I will receive no benefit at all \add from having opposed those who attacked me so strongly\add* in Ephesus \add city\add*.\f + \ft Or: what will I gain \add from having opposed those who attacked me so strongly\add* in Ephesus \add city\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* They were \add fighting me like\add* wild beasts! If we \add believers\add* will not be raised \add from the dead\add* \f + \ft Or:If \add God\add* will not cause us \add believers\add* to live again \f*, we might as well say \add as people often say\add*: "Tomorrow we are going to die, so we might as well enjoy now everything that we can. We might as well feast and get drunk!"

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 31 My brothers and sisters, I am so proud of you; you are like my possessions that I show off to Christ Jesus our Lord. But I tell you that I die every day!
\v 32 If God will not raise the dead, then I fought with those wild animals at Ephesus for nothing. What the poets wrote would in that case be true: "Let us eat food and drink wine today, because we will die tomorrow."
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 31 I die daily. That is what I declare by my boasting in you, brothers, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.
\v 32 What do I gain, from a human point of view, if I fought with beasts at Ephesus, if the dead are not raised? "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."
</usfm>

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I die daily. That is what I declare by my boasting in you** - "I boast about you, so everyone knows that I am telling the truth when I say that I die daily"
  * **I die daily** - Possible meanings are that Paul is speaking of (1) daily identifying with Christ's death for sin by killing his own desire to sin or 2) living each day knowing that people are trying to physically kill him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **my boasting in you** - "the way I tell other people how good you are"
  * **brothers** - Many translations omit this word.
  * **What do I gain ... if I fought with beasts at Ephesus ... not raised?** - Paul wants the Corinthians to understand without him having to tell them. This can be a statement. AT:"I gained nothing ... by fighting with beasts at Ephesus ... not raised." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **I fought with beasts at Ephesus** - Paul is referring to something that he actually did. Possible meanings are 1) Paul was speaking figuratively about his arguments with learned pagans or other conflicts with people who wanted to kill him (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) or 2) he was actually put into the arena to fight against dangerous animals.
  * **Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die** - Paul concludes that if there is no further life after death, it is better for us to enjoy this life as we can, for tomorrow our life will end without any further hope.
