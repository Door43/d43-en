====== 1 Corinthians 15:31-32 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 31 My fellow believers, every day I \add am in danger of\add* being killed \f + \ft Or:people killing me \f*! That is as true as it is that I am pleased with you because of your close relationship with Christ Jesus our Lord.
\v 32 \add If God will not cause us believers to become alive again after we die\add*, I will receive no benefit at all \add from having opposed those who attacked me so strongly\add* in Ephesus \add city\add*.\f + \ft Or: what will I gain \add from having opposed those who attacked me so strongly\add* in Ephesus \add city\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* They were \add fighting me like\add* wild beasts! If we \add believers\add* will not be raised \add from the dead\add* \f + \ft Or:If \add God\add* will not cause us \add believers\add* to live again \f*, we might as well say \add as people often say\add*: "Tomorrow we are going to die, so we might as well enjoy now everything that we can. We might as well feast and get drunk!"

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 31 My brothers and sisters, I am so proud of you; you are like my possessions that I show off to Christ Jesus our Lord. But I tell you that I die every day!
\v 32 If God will not raise the dead, then I fought with those wild animals at Ephesus for nothing. What the poets wrote would in that case be true: "Let us eat food and drink wine today, because we will die tomorrow."
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 31 Every day I face death! This is as sure as my boasting in you, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.
\v 32 What do I gain, from a human point of view, if I fought with beasts at Ephesus, if the dead are not raised? "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."
</usfm>

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Every day I face death!** - Here "face death" represents knowing that he might die soon. He knew that some people wanted to kill him because they did not like what he was teaching.(See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **This is as sure as my boasting in you** - Paul uses this statement as evidence that he faces death every day. AT: "You can know that this is true, because you know about my boasting in you" or "You can know that this is true, because you know about how much I boast in you"
  * **my boasting in you, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord** - Paul boasted in them because of what Christ Jesus had done for them. AT: "my boasting in you, which I do because of what Christ Jesus our Lord has done for you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **my boasting in you** - "the way I tell other people how good you are"
  * **What do I gain ... if I fought with beasts at Ephesus ... not raised?** - Paul wants the Corinthians to understand without him having to tell them. This can be a statement. AT: "I gained nothing ... by fighting with beasts at Ephesus ... not raised." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **I fought with beasts at Ephesus** - Paul is referring to something that he actually did. Possible meanings are 1) Paul was speaking figuratively about his arguments with learned pagans or other conflicts with people who wanted to kill him or 2) he was actually put into the arena to fight against dangerous animals. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die** - Paul concludes that if there is no further life after death, it is better for us to enjoy this life as we can, for tomorrow our life will end without any further hope.
