====== 1 Corinthians 15:31-32 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 31 My fellow believers, every day I \add am in danger of\add* being killed \f + \ft Or:people killing me \f*! That is as true as it is that I am pleased with you because of your close relationship with Christ Jesus our Lord.
\v 32 \add If God will not cause us believers to become alive again after we die\add*, I will receive no benefit at all \add from having opposed those who attacked me so strongly\add* in Ephesus \add city\add*.\f + \ft Or: what will I gain \add from having opposed those who attacked me so strongly\add* in Ephesus \add city\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* They were \add fighting me like\add* wild beasts! If we \add believers\add* will not be raised \add from the dead\add* \f + \ft Or:If \add God\add* will not cause us \add believers\add* to live again \f*, we might as well say \add as people often say\add*: "Tomorrow we are going to die, so we might as well enjoy now everything that we can. We might as well feast and get drunk!"

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 31 My brothers and sisters, I am so proud of you; you are like my possessions that I show off to Christ Jesus our Lord. But I tell you that I die every day!
\v 32 If God will not raise the dead, then I fought with those wild animals at Ephesus for nothing. What the poets wrote would in that case be true: "Let us eat food and drink wine today, because we will die tomorrow."
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 31 Brothers and sisters, through my boasting in you, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I declare this: I die daily.
\v 32 What do I gain, from a human point of view, if I fought with beasts at Ephesus, if the dead are not raised? "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."
</usfm>

  * **I die daily** - Paul refers to denying the desires to sin.
  * **if I fought with beasts at Ephesus** - Possible meaning are 1) Paul was speaking figuratively about his arguments with learned pagans or 2) If he was to be put into the arena to fight against dangerous animals.
  * **Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die** - Paul concludes that if there is no further life after death, it is better for us to enjoy this life as we can for tomorrow our life will end without any further hope.
