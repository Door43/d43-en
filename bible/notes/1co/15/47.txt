\v 47 The first man, Adam, belonged to the earth, for he was made of the dust. But the second man, Christ, belongs to heaven.
\v 48 Just as Adam was made from the dust, so are all those who come from him are made from the dust. It is just as Christ, who is the man from heaven: those who belong to heaven are made like him.
\v 49 Just as God made us like the man who was made from dust, so he will also make us be like the man from heaven.

\v 47 The first man is of the earth, made of dust. The second man is from heaven.
\v 48 Just as the one is made from dust, so also are those who are made of the dust. And as is the man of heaven, so also are those who are of heaven. 
\v 49 Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we will also bear the image of the man of heaven.
