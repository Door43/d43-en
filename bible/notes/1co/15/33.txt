\v 33 Do not be deceived by the promises of bad people. "Bad company can stop good moral intentions and turns them into a terrible outcome, when we try to please our bad friends, they lead us only into shame for what we did at their suggestion."
\v 34 Wake up from your hang-over! Live by God's standard of righteousness! Do not keep sinning and sinning! Some who do not know God live better than you! I say this to your shame.
