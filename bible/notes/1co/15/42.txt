<usfm>
\v 42 And it is the same way \add with our bodies. The bodies that we will have when God causes us\add* to live again after we die \add will not be the same as the bodies that we have now\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add The bodies that we have now\add* will die and decay. \add The new bodies that we will have\add* will never die.
\v 43 We despise \add the bodies that we have now\add*, before we die. But our \add new bodies\add* will be glorious. The \add bodies that we have before we die\add* are weak. But our new bodies will be strong.
\v 44 The bodies that we have before we die are natural bodies. But \add our new bodies\add* will be ones that \add God's\add* Spirit \add controls\f + \ft Or: gives us\add* \f*. Just like there are natural bodies, there are bodies that \add God's\add* Spirit \add completely\add* controls \f + \ft Or: makes alive \f*.

<usfm>
\v 42 It is the same way when people rise from the dead. What goes into the ground has died, but what rises will never die again.
\v 43 When it goes into the ground, it has shame, but when God raises it again, it has honor and power.
\v 44 What goes into the ground belongs to this earth, but what rises from the dead has God's power. So, there are things that belong to this earth, and there are things that have God's power, which lasts forever.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 42 So also is the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable, and what is raised is imperishable.
\v 43 It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.
\v 44 It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.
