====== 1 Corinthians 07:12-14 ======

\v 12 Now I say this to the rest of you, \add to those who became believers after they were married. This is what\add* I \add am saying\add*, not what the Lord \add has commanded\add*. If someone has a wife who is not a believer, if she is willing to keep living with him, he must not divorce her.
\v 13 Similarly, if a woman has a husband who is not a believer, if he is willing to keep living with her, she must not divorce him.
\v 14 \add I say that\add* because God has set apart every woman's unbelieving husband \add for himself\add* because of his wife \add being a believer\add*, and God has set apart every man's unbelieving wife \add for himself\add* because of her husband \add being a believer\add*. If that were not true, \add God would consider\add* their children unacceptable. But, the fact is that \add God does consider\add* them acceptable to him.

\v 12 And I have this to say—and this is my advice, not the Lord's command—to you who have a wife who is not a believer: If she is content to stay with you, do not divorce her.
\v 13 And if you are a woman with a husband who does not believe, and if he is content to stay with you, do not divorce him.
\v 14 The unbelieving husband is set apart in a special way because the wife trusts in God. It is the same for an unbelieving woman with a husband who trusts in God. It is the same for your children: they are set apart in a special way to God, because one parent believes in Christ.

\v 12 But to the rest I say—I, not the Lord—that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever, and if she is content to live with him, he should not divorce her.
\v 13 If a woman has an unbelieving husband, and if he is content to live with her, she should not divorce him.
\v 14 For the unbelieving husband is set apart because of his wife, and the unbelieving wife is set apart because of the brother. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but actually they are set apart.
