\v 12 Now I say this to the rest of you, \add to those who became believers after they were married. This is what\add* I \add am saying\add*, not what the Lord \add has commanded\add*. If someone has a wife who is not a believer, if she is willing to keep living with him, he must not divorce her.
\v 13 Similarly, if a woman has a husband who is not a believer, if he is willing to keep living with her, she must not divorce him.
\v 14 \add I say that\add* because God has set apart every woman's unbelieving husband \add for himself\add* because of his wife \add being a believer\add*, and God has set apart every man's unbelieving wife \add for himself\add* because of her husband \add being a believer\add*. If that were not true, \add God would consider\add* their children unacceptable. But, the fact is that \add God does consider\add* them acceptable to him.

\v 14 I say that because God has set apart every woman's unbelieving husband for himself because of his wife being a believer, and God has set apart every man's unbelieving wife for himself because of her husband being a believer. If that were not true, God would consider their children unacceptable. But, the fact is that God does consider them acceptable to him.

\v 12 But to the rest I say, not the Lord, "If any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she is content to dwell with him, do not let him leave her.
\v 13 And the woman that has an unbelieving husband, and he is content to dwell with her do not let her leave her husband.
\v 14 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother.  Otherwise your children are unclean; but now they are holy.
