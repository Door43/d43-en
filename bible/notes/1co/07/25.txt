\v 25 Now \add I will answer your question\add* about women who have never married. There is nothing that the Lord has commanded me \add to write about them\add*, but I am writing this to tell you what I think \add is best\add*, because the Lord \add Jesus\add* has mercifully enabled what I \add say\add* to be reliable.
\v 26 There are a lot of distressing events \add happening\add* now \f + \ft Or: that will soon happen \f*, so I think that it is better for people to remain in the status that they now have.

\v 25 Regarding the question about those who have never married, I will give my views, but I have no specific commandment from the Lord on this question. But you can have confidence in my reply because, by the Lord's mercy, he confirms my trustworthiness in these matters.
\v 26 Therefore, because of the difficult times that seem to be coming upon us all, I think it is good for you to remain as you were when God called you.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Now concerning those who never married, I have no commandment from the Lord **- Paul knows no teaching of Jesus that speaks about this situation. AT: "I don't have a commandment from the Lord about people who have never married."
  * **my opinion** - Paul is emphasizing that these thoughts about marriage are his  - not a direct commandment from the Lord.
  * **Therefore**  - AT: "So" or "Because of this"
  * **impending crisis**  - AT: "disaster that is coming"
