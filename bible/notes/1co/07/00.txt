====== 1 Corinthians 07 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Paul begins to answer a series of questions, which may have been asked of him. The first question involves marriage. The second question is on changing ones status: a slave trying to become free, a Gentile becoming a Jew or a Jew becoming a Gentile. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Divorce ==
Christians should try not divorce. Believers married to unbelievers should not leave their husband or wife. If the unbelieving husband or wife leaves, this is not considered to be sin. Paul advises that, because of the difficult times and the nearness to the return of Jesus, remaining unmarried is an acceptable option. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:believe|Believers]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Euphemisms ==
There are many euphemisms used to describe sexual relations because this is often a taboo topic and many cultures do not wish to speak about openly about these matters. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism|Euphemisms]])
