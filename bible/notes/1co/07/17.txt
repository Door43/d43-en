====== 1 Corinthians 07:17-20 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 However, each person should continue in the status that the Lord gave him, the status that he had when the Lord called him \add to belong to him\add*. That is the rule that I tell people in all the congregations \add where I speak\add*.
\v 18 If a man had already been circumcised \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* when he became a Christian, he should not \add try to pretend that he is not\add* circumcised. If a man had not been circumcised \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* before he became a Christian, he should not become circumcised.
\v 19 \add You should not try to change your status that way\add*, because it means nothing \add to God\add* whether someone is circumcised or not. What is important is that we obey what God has commanded.

\v 17 We must live the life the Lord has assigned us to live, and to obey the call God gave us. This is the principle in all the churches.
\v 18 If a man was circumcised before he became a Christian, he should not try to remove those marks. If you were not circumcised when God saved you, you should not let anyone circumcise you.
\v 19 Circumcision or uncircumcision—these are not important to us. But what is important is that we obey what God commands us to do.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 Only let each one live the life the Lord has assigned them, and to which God called them.  This is my rule in all the churches.
\v 18 Was anyone circumcised when he was called to believe? He should not try to remove the marks of his circumcision. Was anyone uncircumcised when he was called to faith? He should not be circumcised. 
\v 19 For it is neither circumcision nor uncircumcision that matters. What matters is obeying the commandments of God.
