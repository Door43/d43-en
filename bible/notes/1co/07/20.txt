====== 1 Corinthians 07:20-24 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 \add Generally\add*, each person should remain in the status that he had when he became a Christian.
\v 21 If one of you was a slave when you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* became a Christian \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*, do not be concerned about it. However, if you get an opportunity to be free, do \add what you need to do to become free\add*!
\v 22 \add Do not worry about your previously being a slave\add*, because those who were slaves before they became Christians, the Lord has freed them \add from Satan's control\add*. Similarly, those who were not slaves before they became Christians, \add it is as though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* they are Christ's slaves \add because they must do what he tells them to do\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 23 \add Christ\add* paid a price to buy you \add when he died for you\add*. So do not \add act as if you are evil people's\add* slaves \add by doing the evil things that they tell you to do\add*.
\v 24 My fellow believers, \add I repeat that in general\add* each believer, being in fellowship with God, should continue in the status that he had before he became a Christian.

\v 20 So continue to live and work as you did when God called you to trust in Christ.
\v 21 If you were a slave when God saved you, do not worry about it. Of course, if you have the chance to buy your freedom, take advantage of it and become free.
\v 22 This is because anyone who the Lord calls a slave is a free person because of the Lord. In the same way, you become God's slave when he calls you, even if you were never a slave to anyone.
\v 23 God bought you with the price of his Son; your freedom is precious. So do not become slaves of humans.
\v 24 Brothers and sisters in Christ, whatever you were when God called you, whether you were slave or free, remain in that same position.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 Each one should remain in the calling he was in when God called him to believe. 
\v 21 Were you a slave when God called you? Do not be concerned about it. But if you can become free, do so.
\v 22 For someone who is called by the Lord as a slave is the Lord's freeman. Likewise the one who was free when he was called to believe is Christ’s slave.
\v 23 You have been bought with a price, so do not become slaves of men.
\v 24 Brothers and sisters, in whatever life each of us was in when we were called to believe, let us remain like that.
