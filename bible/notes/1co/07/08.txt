====== 1 Corinthians 07:8-9 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Now I want to say this to you unmarried people and to you whose spouses have died: It would be good for you to remain \add unmarried\add* as I am.
\v 9 But if you cannot control your \add sexual desires\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f*, you should get married. It is better to be married \add so that you can satisfy your sexual desires with your spouse\add* than to constantly have a strong desire \f + \ft euphemism \f* \add for sexual relations\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 To those of you who have never married and those whose husbands have died, I say that it would be good if you continue to be single, like me.
\v 9 But if it is hard for you to control yourself, you should get married. It is better for you to marry than to suffer from strong sexual desires.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 To the unmarried and to widows I say that it is good for them if they remain unmarried, as I am.
\v 9 But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry. For it is better for them to marry than to burn with passion.
