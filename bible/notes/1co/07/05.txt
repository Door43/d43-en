====== 1 Corinthians 07:5-7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 You may refuse \add to have sexual relations with\add* each other \f + \ft euphemism \f* only if you both first agree to do that for a short time, in order that you may both have more time to pray. Then after that, begin having sexual relations again \f + \ft euphemism \f* in order that Satan will not be able to persuade you \add to have sex with someone else\add* because you are unable to control your sexual desires.
\p
\v 6 I am telling you these things to say that \add God\add* allows \add you to get married, but he\add* does not say that you must \add get married\add*.
\v 7 I myself wish that all people would stay \add unmarried\f + \ft Or: single \f*\add*, as I am. But God has enabled each person to live in different ways. He has enabled some people to \add live without getting married\add*, and he has enabled other people to \add get married\add*.

\v 5 So do not deprive one another of sleeping together, unless you both agree to abstain from it for a short period of time, so that you may pray. But after that time is over, come together again. Do not allow Satan to tempt you because you cannot control yourself.
\p
\v 6 I am not commanding you to get married, but I know that many of you are married or will wish to marry.
\v 7 My example is before you: I am single, and sometimes I wish that each of you were single in order to serve God. But God gives many different gifts to his children; he makes some able to be married, and others to remain single.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Do not deprive each other of sleeping together, except by mutual agreement and for a specific period of time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. And then you may come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
\p
\v 6 But I say these things to you more as concession and not as a command. 
\v 7 I wish that everyone was as I am. But each one has his own gift from God, one of this kind and another of that kind.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **do not deprive each other of sleeping together**  - AT: "do not refuse to sleep with your spouse"
  * **so that you may devote yourselves to prayer**  - They decide together to pass some days without sleeping together in order to have a period of especially deep prayer; in Judaism that might be a period of 1-2 weeks.
  * **devote yourselves**  - "commit yourselves"
  * **come together again** - AT: "sleep together again"
  * **because of your lack of self-control**  - AT: "because after some days, your sexual desires will be harder to keep under control"
  * **I say these things to you more as concession and not as command**  - Paul tells the Corinthians that they can take a short period of time to abstain from sleeping together for the purpose of prayer, but that this is a special case, not an continuing requirement.
  * **were as I am**  - were unmarried (formerly-married or never-married), as Paul is.
  * **But each one has his own gift from God, one of this kind and another of that kind**  - AT: "God gives one person a ability, and to another person some other ability."
