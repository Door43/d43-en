===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 27 To you who are married, I say: do not seek to be freed from your vow.
\v 28 But to the men who are single, I say, if you marry, you have committed no sin. I give the same advice to the single women: if you get  married, you have committed no sin. However, if you marry, you will find many troubles, so I advise you to remain single.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 27 Are you bound to a woman by a vow of marriage? Do not seek freedom from it. Are you free from a wife or are unmarried? Do not seek a wife.
\v 28 But if you do marry, you have not committed a sin. And if an unmarried woman marries, she has committed no sin. Yet those who marry will have many kinds of trouble while living, and I would like to spare you from them.
