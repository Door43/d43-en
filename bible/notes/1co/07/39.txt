\v 39 Women must remain married to their husbands while their husbands are still alive. But if a woman's husband dies, she is free to marry any \add unmarried\add* man whom she wants to marry, but he must belong to the Lord.
\v 40 However, I think that she will be happier if she does not marry again. And I believe that the Spirit of God is \add directing\add* me \add as I say that\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 39 The law of marriage is that a woman is bound to her husband as long as she lives; and if her husband dies, she is free from her vow and she may marry whoever she wishes to marry, with the qualification that she must marry only a Christian, that is, to marry only in the Lord.
\v 40 However, it is my judgment that the widow would be happier if she does not marry again. And I think the Spirit of God is directing me as I give this advice.
