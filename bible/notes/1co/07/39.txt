====== 1 Corinthians 07:39-40 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 39 Women must remain married to their husbands while their husbands are still alive. But if a woman's husband dies, she is free to marry any \add unmarried\add* man whom she wants to marry, but he must belong to the Lord.
\v 40 However, I think that she will be happier if she does not marry again. And I believe that the Spirit of God is \add directing\add* me \add as I say that\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 39 A woman must remain with her husband as long as he lives; if her husband dies, she is free to marry whomever she wishes, but she must marry only someone who has faith in the Lord.
\v 40 However, it is my judgment that a widow will be happier if she does not marry again. And I think that I, too, have the Spirit of God.
