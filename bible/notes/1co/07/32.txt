\v 32 But I desire you to be free from cares. He that is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord. He desires to seer how he may please the Lord.
\v 33 But he that is married is careful for the things of the world. He desires to see how he may please his wife,
\v 34 and has divided responsibilities. So also the woman that is unmarried and the virgin is careful for the things of the Lord in order that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she that is married is careful for the things of the world. She desires to see how she may please her husband.
