====== 1 Corinthians 07:32-34 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 32 \add Another reason why\add* I \add encourage you to remain unmarried is that\add* I desire that none of you be anxious \add about the everyday affairs of this life\add*. Unmarried men are \add able to be primarily\add* concerned about serving the Lord Jesus and trying to please him.
\v 33 But married men are \add often\add* greatly concerned about the affairs of this life. Specifically, they are concerned about pleasing their wives.
\v 34 So their thinking is divided. Unmarried women are \add able to be\add* concerned about serving the Lord. They want to set apart their minds and their bodies for the Lord. But married women are \add often\add* concerned about the affairs of this life. Specifically, they are concerned about how to please their husbands.

\v 32 I want you to be free from things to worry about. As you see, the unmarried man is concerned about the matters that are important to the Lord. He wants to serve the Lord and do what he wants.
\v 33 But the man who is married must also concern himself for the day to day matters of the world as well as serving and pleasing his wife.
\v 34 Those who are married have two kinds of concern that are pulling against each other. It is the same with widows and girls who have not married: as believing women, they are concerned to spend their time serving the Lord. They are thinking about how to live in the way that God has set them apart for himself. But married women are also concerned about the matters of the world that touch everyone else also. And in addition to that concern, they also want to please their husbands.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 32 I would like you to be free from worries. The unmarried man is concerned about the things of the Lord, how to please him. 
\v 33 But the married man is concerned about the things of the world, how to please his wife.
\v 34 He is divided. So also the unmarried person or the virgin is concerned about the things of the Lord, how to be holy in body and in spirit. But the married woman is also concerned about the things of the world, how to please her husband.
