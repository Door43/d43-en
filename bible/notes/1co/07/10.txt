\v 10 The Lord gives his own commands to you who are married:  "The wife should not separate from her husband."

\v 10 Now to the married I give this commandâ€”not I, but the Lord: "The wife should not separate from her husband."

  * **married** - having a spouse (husband or wife)
  * **should not separate** - Most Greeks did not distinguish between legal divorce and simple separation; "separation" for most couples meant that the marriage no longer existed.
  * **should not divorce** - This is the same as "should not separate", see note above. It may denote legal divorce or simple separation.
  * **be reconciled to him** - "she should resolve her issues with her husband and return to him" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]).
