\v 15 However, if the unbelieving spouse wants to leave you, you should let that person go. In this situation, the vow you took when you married is no longer binding on you. God has called us to peace.
\v 16 You do not know how God may work through the life you live before your unbelieving spouse. And you do not know whether your life may become a means by which God might save your husband or your wife.

\v 15 But if the unbelieving partner departs, let him go. In such cases, the brother or sister is not bound to their vows. God has called us to live in peace.
\v 16 For how do you know, woman, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, man, whether you will save your wife?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **In such cases, the brother or sister is not bound to their vows** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "In such cases, God does not require the believing spouse to continue to obey the marriage vow" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **do you know, woman ... you will save your husband ... do you know, man ... you will save your wife** - Paul is speaking to the Corinthians as if they were one person, so all instances of "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **how do you know, woman, whether you will save your husband?** - Paul uses a question to cause women to think deeply about what he is saying. AT: "you cannot know if you will save your unbelieving husband." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **how do you know, man, whether you will save your wife** - Paul uses a question to cause men to think deeply about what he is saying. AT: "you cannot know if you will save your unbelieving wife." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
