\v 15 However, if the unbelieving spouse wants to leave you, you should let that person go. In this situation, the vow you took when you married is no longer binding on you. God has called us to peace.
\v 16 You do not know how God may work through the life you live before your unbelieving spouse. And you do not know whether your life may become a means by which God might save your husband or your wife.

\v 15 But if the non-Christian partner departs, let him go. In such cases, the brother or sister is not bound to their vows. God has called us to live in peace.
\v 16 For how do you know, woman, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, man, whether you will save your wife?
