\v 15 There is another question about marriage, where one person in the marriage in not a Christian. If the unbelieving partner wants to leave the marriage and divorce, you should let them go. In such cases the Christian brother of sister is not constrained to keep the marriage vow. God has called us to peace, and sometimes peace comes when an unbelieving partner sees the need to go.
\v 16 God is working in these marriages. And you do not know whether God may save your husband or that God may save your wife. The counsel is that you should not marry a non-Christian, but if God saves you after you were married to a non-Christian, you should stay in the marriage, if you can.

\v 15 But if the non-Christian partner departs, let him go. In such cases, the brother or sister is not bound to their vows. God has called us to live in peace.
\v 16 For how do you know, woman, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, man, whether you will save your wife?
