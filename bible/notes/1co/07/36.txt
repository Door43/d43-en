====== 1 Corinthians 07:36-38 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 36 \add Some of you men have asked about your unmarried daughters\add*. \add I suggest that\add* if any man thinks that he may be treating his daughter unfairly \add by keeping her from marrying\add*, and if it is already past \add the right\add* time for her to get married, and if he thinks that she ought to be married, he should do what he wants to do. He should let her get married. He will not be sinning \add by doing that\add*.
\v 37 But if a man feels absolutely sure \add that it is better that his daughter not get married\add*, and if nothing is forcing \add her to get married\add*, and if he is free to do what he decides to do on the matter, if he decides that his daughter should not get married, he is doing what is right in \add keeping her from marrying\add*.
\v 38 So any man who decides that his daughter should get married is doing what is good, but if he decides that she should not get married, he is doing something even better. \f + \ft Or:

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 36 If a man has promised to marry a woman, but if he finds he is not treating her with respect because she is becoming too old to marry, he should get married. This is not a sin.
\v 37 But if he has decided that he does not desire to marry at the present time, and if he is in control of the situation, he makes a good decision not to marry.
\v 38 So the one who marries his fiancée does a good thing and does not sin; and the one who chooses not to marry also chooses something even better.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 36 But if anyone thinks that he is not treating his fiancée with respect—if she is beyond the age of marriage and it must be so—he should do what he wants. He is not sinning. They should marry.
\v 37 But if he is standing firm in his heart, if he is not under pressure but can control his own will, and if he has decided in his own heart to do this, to keep his own fiancée a virgin, he will do well.
\v 38 So the one who marries his fiancée does well, and the one who chooses not to marry will do even better.
