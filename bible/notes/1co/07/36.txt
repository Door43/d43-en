====== 1 Corinthians 07:36-38 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 36 \add Some of you men have asked about your unmarried daughters\add*. \add I suggest that\add* if any man thinks that he may be treating his daughter unfairly \add by keeping her from marrying\add*, and if it is already past \add the right\add* time for her to get married, and if he thinks that she ought to be married, he should do what he wants to do. He should let her get married. He will not be sinning \add by doing that\add*.
\v 37 But if a man feels absolutely sure \add that it is better that his daughter not get married\add*, and if nothing is forcing \add her to get married\add*, and if he is free to do what he decides to do on the matter, if he decides that his daughter should not get married, he is doing what is right in \add keeping her from marrying\add*.
\v 38 So any man who decides that his daughter should get married is doing what is good, but if he decides that she should not get married, he is doing something even better. \f + \ft Or:

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 36 Is a man is pledged to be married to his fiancée, but he is not able to restrain his sexual passions for her, if he asks her to marry him, and if she agrees, they should marry. It is not a sin.
\v 37 But if he has decided, for the reasons described here, that he does not desire to marry at the current time, and he can control his sexual passions, he makes a good decision not to marry, if that is what he desires.
\v 38 So the one who marries his fiancée does a good thing and does not sin; and the one who chooses not to marry also chooses a good thing, but they may have had more opportunity to serve the Lord in singleness.

\v 36 But if anyone thinks that he is not treating his fiancée with respect because his passions are too strong, let him marry her as he wishes. It is not a sin. 
\v 37 But if he has made a decision not to marry, and there is no sense of urgency, and he can control his passions, he will do well if he does not marry her.
\v 38 So the one who marries his fiancée does well, and the one who chooses not to marry will do even better.
