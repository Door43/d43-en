<usfm>
\v 36 \add Some of you men have asked about your unmarried daughters\add*. \add I suggest that\add* if any man thinks that he may be treating his daughter unfairly \add by keeping her from marrying\add*, and if it is already past \add the right\add* time for her to get married, and if he thinks that she ought to be married, he should do what he wants to do. He should let her get married. He will not be sinning \add by doing that\add*.
\v 37 But if a man feels absolutely sure \add that it is better that his daughter not get married\add*, and if nothing is forcing \add her to get married\add*, and if he is free to do what he decides to do on the matter, if he decides that his daughter should not get married, he is doing what is right in \add keeping her from marrying\add*.
\v 38 So any man who decides that his daughter should get married is doing what is good, but if he decides that she should not get married, he is doing something even better. \f + \ft Or:

\v 36 But if any man thinks that he treats his unmarried virgin daughter inappropriately because she is past the flower of her age, he does not sin to let her marry.   If the need so requires it, let him do what he will. 
\v 37 But if he that stands firm in his heart, not having a necessity for his virgin daughter to marry, and has the power in his own heart to keep her, he will do well.
\v 38 So then both he that gives his own virgin daughter in marriage does well; and he that does not give her in marriage will do better.
