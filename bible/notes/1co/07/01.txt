\v 1 You wrote to me about the matter of sexual purity within the Christian faith. This is my reply about those  matters. There may be times in which it is good to abstain from sexual relations in marriage. Sexual relations may be avoided during difficult times and for spiritual purposes. Marriage is never to be forbidden, but it should be honored. But those who marry and those who do not, need to be clear about their reasons for choosing either role.
\v 2 The world is filled with temptations to sin in sexual relations. Marriage is a strong defence against sexual sin, but not the only one. If every man had his wife and every wife had her husband, matters might be simpler.
