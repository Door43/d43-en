====== 1 Corinthians 11:7-8 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 Men should not wear coverings over their heads \add when they pray or speak messages that God gave them\add*, because they represent what God is like \f + \ft metaphor \f* and they show how great God is. But women show how great men \f + \ft Or: their husbands \f* are.
\v 8 \add Remember that God intends that men have authority over women. We know that\add* because \add God\add* did not make \add the first\add* man, \add Adam\add*, from the \add first\add* woman, \add Eve\add*. Instead, he made that woman \add from a bone that he took\add* from the man.
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 A man should not cover his head because God made him like himself, and the man reflects some of what God himself is like. But women reflect some of what men are like.
\v 8 For God did not make man Adam from the woman Eve; instead, he made the woman Eve from the man Adam.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 For a man should not have his head covered, since he is the image and glory of God. But the woman is the glory of the man.
\v 8 For man was not made from the woman, but the woman from the man.
