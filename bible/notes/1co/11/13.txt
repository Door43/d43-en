<usfm>
\v 13 Consider this for yourselves: Is it proper for \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* women to pray to God while they do not have coverings over their heads?
\v 14 Everyone senses that it is disgraceful for men to have long hair.\f + \ft Or: Do you not know naturally that it is disgraceful for men to have long hair? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 15 But it is very delightful if women have long hair, because \add God\add* gave them long hair to be like a \add beautiful\add* covering \add for their heads\add*.
\v 16 But whoever wants to argue \add with me about my saying that women should have a covering over their heads when they pray or speak a message from God should consider the fact that\add* we \add apostles\add* do not \add permit\add* any other custom, and the \add other\add* congregations of God do not have any other custom.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 Judge this for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God without a cover on her head?
\v 14 Nature itself teaches us that it is a disgrace for a man to have long hair,
\v 15 but they also teach that long hair for a woman is a display of her beauty. Her hair is given to her by God to cover her beauty.
\v 16 But if anyone in the church wishes to argue about this matter, we do not have any other custom than this, nor do any of the churches do anything different.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?
\v 14 Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace for him,
\v 15 but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her as a covering.
\v 16 But if anyone wants to argue about this, we do not have any other practice, nor do the churches of God.
