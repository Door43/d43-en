\v 13 Consider this for yourselves: Is it proper for \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* women to pray to God while they do not have coverings over their heads?
\v 14 Everyone senses that it is disgraceful for men to have long hair.\f + \ft Or: Do you not know naturally that it is disgraceful for men to have long hair? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 15 But it is very delightful if women have long hair, because \add God\add* gave them long hair to be like a \add beautiful\add* covering \add for their heads\add*.
\v 16 But whoever wants to argue \add with me about my saying that women should have a covering over their heads when they pray or speak a message from God should consider the fact that\add* we \add apostles\add* do not \add permit\add* any other custom, and the \add other\add* congregations of God do not have any other custom.

\v 13 Judge for yourselves, is it appropriate that a woman pray to God unveiled?
\v 14 Does not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him?
\v 15 But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her. For her hair is given  to her for a covering.
\v 16 But if any man is given to arguing, we do not allow  such behavior, neither do the churches of God.
