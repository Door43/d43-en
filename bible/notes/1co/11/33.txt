\v 33 My fellow believers, when you come together for the Lord's Supper, wait for one another.
\v 34 If one of you is hungry, eat at home—so that when you come together as the church, it will not be an occasion for God to discipline you.  
\p And when I come to you, I will give you instructions concerning the other matters you wrote me about.

\v 33 Therefore, my brothers and sisters, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.
\v 34 If any one is hungry, let him eat at home, so that when you come together it will not be for judgment. And about the other things you wrote, I will give directions when I come.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **come together to eat** - gather to eat a meal together before celebrating the Lord's Supper.
  * **wait for one another** - "allow the others to arrive before beginning the meal."
  * **let him eat at home** - AT: "let him eat before attending this gathering"
  * **it will not be for judgment** - AT: "the gathering should not produce judgment due to lack of self control."
  * **And about the other things you wrote** - "you wrote" is making explicit that Paul was addressing questions and concerns about which the Corinth believers had written to him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
