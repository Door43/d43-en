\v 33 My fellow believers, when you come together for the Lord's Supper, wait for one another.
\v 34 If one of you is hungry, eat at home—so that when you come together as the church, it will not be an occasion for God to discipline you.
\p And when I come to you, I will give you instructions concerning the other matters you wrote me about.
