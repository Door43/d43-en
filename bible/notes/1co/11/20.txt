\v 20 When you gather together, you \f + \ft irony \f* eat the meal \add that you say is to remember the death of\add* the Lord \add Jesus for us\add*.
\v 21 But \add what happens when\add* you eat is that each person eats his own meal before \add he thinks about sharing his food with anyone else\add*. As a result, \add when the meal is over\add*, some people are \add still\add* hungry and others are drunk! \add So it is not a meal that honors the Lord\add*.
\v 22 \add You act as though\add* you do not have your own houses in which you can eat and drink \add whatever you want to\add*!\f + \ft Or: Do you not have your own houses in which you can eat and drink \add whatever you want to\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* Do you not realize \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add that by acting selfishly in this way\add*, it is God's people whom you are despising, and it is the poor people \add in your group\add* whom you are treating as though they were not important? What shall I say to you about that \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? Do \add you expect\add* me to praise you\add about what you do\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? I certainly will not praise you!

\v 20 When you come together you are not eating the Lord's Supper.
\v 21 When you eat, one person brings an entire meal and eats it as soon as he arrives; he does not wait for anyone else. Another person goes hungry while other people drink so much wine that they get drunk.
\v 22 You act as though you didn't have houses to eat and drink in! You treat the church with dishonor, and you despise the purpose for which you gather. You humiliate those who are poor. I can say nothing good about this. This is a disgrace.

<usfm>
\v 20 For when you come together, it is not the Lord’s Supper that you eat.
\v 21 When you eat, each one eats his own food before the others have their meal. One is hungry, and another becomes drunk.
\v 22 Do you not have houses to eat and to drink in? Do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What should I say to you? Should I praise you? I will not praise you for this!
