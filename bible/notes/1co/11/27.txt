\v 27 So, those who eat that bread and drink that wine \f + \ft metonymy \f* in a way that is not proper \add for those who belong to the Lord\add* are guilty of \add acting in a way that is contrary to what\add* our \add Lord intended when he offered\add* his body \add as a sacrifice\add* and his blood \add flowed when he died\add*.
\v 28 Before any believer eats that bread and drinks that wine \f + \ft metonymy \f*, he should think carefully about \add what he is doing\add*,
\v 29 because if anyone eats \add the bread that represents Christ's body\add* and drinks \add the wine that represents his blood\add* without recognizing that all God's \add people should be united, God will\add* punish him \add for doing that\add*.
\v 30 Many people in your group are weak and sick, and several have died \f + \ft euphemism \f* because of \add the way they acted when they ate that bread and drank that wine\add*.

\v 27 This celebration of the Lord's supper should not be abused, and those who eat the bread and drink the cup must do so in a manner that is worthy of the Lord. Anyone who dishonors the bread and the cup in the communion service will be guilty of a sin against the very body and blood of the Lord.
\v 28 Therefore we should all examine ourselves before we take the communion. We should only eat the bread and drink the cup after we have examined our lives, our sins, and God's mercy.
\v 29 Anyone who eats and drinks the communion without personal examination, and taking time to confess his sin, is bringing God's judgment on himself, when he eats and drinks the communion.
\v 30 Many are physically sick and ill, and several have even died  because of the way they treated the communion with such contempt.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 27 Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drink the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.
\v 28 Let a person examine himself first, and in this way let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.
\v 29 For he who eats and drinks without discerning the body, eats and drinks judgment to himself.
\v 30 That is why many among you are sick and ill, and some of you have died.
