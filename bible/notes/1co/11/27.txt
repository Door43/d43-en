====== 1 Corinthians 11:27-30 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 27 So, those who eat that bread and drink that wine \f + \ft metonymy \f* in a way that is not proper \add for those who belong to the Lord\add* are guilty of \add acting in a way that is contrary to what\add* our \add Lord intended when he offered\add* his body \add as a sacrifice\add* and his blood \add flowed when he died\add*.
\v 28 Before any believer eats that bread and drinks that wine \f + \ft metonymy \f*, he should think carefully about \add what he is doing\add*,
\v 29 because if anyone eats \add the bread that represents Christ's body\add* and drinks \add the wine that represents his blood\add* without recognizing that all God's \add people should be united, God will\add* punish him \add for doing that\add*.
\v 30 Many people in your group are weak and sick, and several have died \f + \ft euphemism \f* because of \add the way they acted when they ate that bread and drank that wine\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 27 All who come to this celebration of the Lord's Supper should come to give honor to God in the way it is shared. Those who eat the bread and drink the cup must do so in a manner that honors the Lord. Anyone who dishonors the bread and the cup will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
\v 28 Therefore we should all examine ourselves before we take the communion. We should only eat the bread and drink the cup after we have examined ourselves.
\v 29 Anyone who eats and drinks this Supper and does not consider what is the Lord's body, eats and drinks the judgment of God on himself.
\v 30 Many among you are physically ill, and several have even died because of the way you have treated the Lord's body.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 27 Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.
\v 28 Let a person examine himself first, and in this way let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.
\v 29 For he who eats and drinks without discerning the body, eats and drinks judgment to himself.
\v 30 That is why many among you are weak and ill, and some of you have fallen asleep.

  * [[:en:obe:kt:body]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:blood]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:discernment]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord** - "eats the bread of the Lord or drinks the cup of the Lord"
  * **examine** - Paul speaks of a person looking at his relationship to God and how he has been living his life as if that person is looking over something he wants to buy. See how "test the quality" is translated in [[:en:bible:notes:1co:03:12|3:13]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **without discerning the body** - Possible meanings are 1) "and does not recognize that the church is the body of the Lord" or 2) "and does not consider that he is handling the Lord's body." 
  * **weak and ill** - These words mean almost the same thing and can be combined, as in UDB.
