====== 1 Corinthians 11:11-12 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11-12 However, remember that \add even though God created the first\add* woman from \add the first\add* man, \add now\add* it is women who \add give birth\add* to men. So men cannot be independent of women, nor can women be independent of men. But all things, \add including men and women\add*, come from God.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 So as we live joined to the Lord, women need men to help them, and men need women to help them.
\v 12 This is because the woman was made from the man, and the man is born from the woman. They are dependent on one another. But all things come from God.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 Nevertheless, in the Lord, the woman is not independent from the  man, nor is the man independent from the woman.
\v 12 For as the woman comes from the man, so does the man come from the woman. And all things come from God.
