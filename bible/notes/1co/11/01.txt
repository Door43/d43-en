\v 1 \add Follow my example\add*, just like I \add try to\add* follow Christ's example.


\p
\v 2 I praise you because you remember all the things \add that I taught you\add* and because you follow the instructions that I gave you. You have done just like I told you to do.
\v 3 \add Now\add*, I want you to know that the one who has authority over \f + \ft metonymy \f* every man is Christ, and the ones who have authority over women are men \f + \ft Or: their husbands \f*, and the one who has authority over Christ is God.
\v 4 \add So\add* if any man \add wears a covering over\add* his head when he prays or speaks a message God gave him, he disgraces himself \f + \ft synecdoche \f*.

<usfm>
\v 1 Follow my example, just like I follow the example of Christ.

\p
\v 2 I praise you because you remember me in all you do, and you hold tight to all the important teachings that I have passed down to you and you have kept them just as I taught them to you.
\v 3 I want you to understand that Christ has authority over every man, and that a man has authority over a woman, and that God has authority over Christ.
\v 4 So if any man covers his head when he prays or when he proclaims a message from God, he brings disgrace on himself.
