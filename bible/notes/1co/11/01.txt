===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 1 Follow my example, just like I follow the example of Christ.

\p \v 2 I praise you because you remember me in all you do, and you hold tight to all the important teachings that I have passed down to you and you have kept them just as I taught them to you. \v 3 I want you to understand that Christ has authority over every man, and that a man has authority over a woman, and that God has authority over Christ. \v 4 So if any man covers his head when he prays or when he proclaims a message from God, he brings disgrace on himself. </usfm>
