\v 5 Also, if any woman does not wear a covering over her head when she prays or speaks a message that God gave her, she disgraces herself \f + \ft Or: she dishonors her husband \f*. That would be acting like \f + \ft simile \f* \add women who are ashamed because\add* their heads have been shaved.
\v 6 So, if women do not wear coverings over their heads \add when they pray or speak messages that God gave them\add*, they should let someone shave their heads \add so that they will be ashamed\add*. But since women are ashamed if someone cuts their hair \add short\add* or shaves off their hair, they should wear coverings over their heads \add when they pray or speak messages that God gave them\add*.

\v 5 But if a woman prays or proclaims a message God gave her, with her head uncovered, she brings disgrace on herself. For it is exactly the same as if she had shaved her head.
\v 6 If a woman refuses to cover her head, then she should cut her hair short, like a man's. But you know that it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut short or to have her head shaved. So, instead, she should cover her head.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 But any woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head. For it is one and the same thing as if her head were shaved.
\v 6 For if a woman will not cover her head, she should cut her hair short. If it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or for her to shave her head, let her cover her head.
