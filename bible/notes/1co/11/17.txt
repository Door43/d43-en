====== 1 Corinthians 11:17-19 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 Concerning the matters \add about which I will instruct you now\add*, I do not praise you, because whenever you believers meet together, good \add things do not happen\add*. Instead, bad things \add happen\add*.
\v 18 First of all, people have told me that when you gather together as a group \add to worship God\add*, you divide into groups \add that are hostile to each other\add*. To some extent I believe that is true.
\v 19 It seems that you must divide into \add groups that despise each other\add* in order that it might be clear\f + \ft Or: evident \f* which people among you \add God\add* approves of!

\v 17 In these instructions, I cannot praise you for what you are doing about the Lord's supper. When you come together to eat, instead of encouraging and helping one another, you make the fellowship in the church much worse.
\v 18 The first matter of concern is that when you come together, you come with different groups and factions. This is what people have told me, and I believe that some of what they say is true.
\v 19 It appears that you need to have different groups among yourselves so that you can test and approve the ones that have places of honor, and others that do not.

\p
\v 17 But in the following instructions, I do not praise you. For when you come together, it is not for the better but for the worse.
\v 18 For in the first place, I hear that when you come together in the church, there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it.
\v 19 For there must also be factions among you, so that those who are approved may be recognized among you.

===== translationNotes: ===== 

  * **Connecting Statement:** - As Paul talks about communion, the Lord's supper, he reminds them to have right attitudes as well as unity. He reminds them that if they fail in those things when taking communion, they will become sick and die, as has already happened to some of them.

  * **in the following instructions, I do not praise you. For when** - Another possible meaning is "as I give you these instructions, there is something for which I cannot praise you: when"
  * **instructions** - "directions" or "policies"
  * **come together** - "gather together" or "meet"
  * **it is not for the better but for the worse** - "you do not help each other; instead, you harm each other"
  * **in the church** - "as believers." Paul is not talking about being inside a building.
  * **there are divisions among you** - "you divide yourselves into opposing groups"
  * **For there must also be factions among you** - Possible meanings 1) The word "must" indicates that that this situation is likely to happen. AT: "For there will probably be factions among you" or 2) Paul was using irony to shame them for having factions. AT: "For you seem to think that there must be factions among you" or "For you seem to think that you must divide yourselves" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **factions** - opposing groups of people
  * **so that those who are approved may be recognized among you** - Possible meanings are 1) "so that people will know the most highly regarded believers among you" or 2) "so that people can display this approval to the others among you." Paul may have been using irony, saying the opposite of what he wanted the Corinthians to understand, to shame them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **who are approved** - Possible meanings are 1) "whom God approves" or 2) "whom you, the church, approve."
