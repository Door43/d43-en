\v 9 It was not the man whom God created to help the the woman, but the woman to help the man.
\v 10 This is why women should cover their heads, as a sign of the authority, and because of the angels.

\v 9 For neither was man created for woman. Instead, woman was created for man.
\v 10 This is why the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For neither ... for man** - These words and all of [[:en:bible:notes:1co:11:07|11:8]] could be put in parentheses so that the reader can see that the word "this" in "this is why ... the angels" clearly refers back to the words "the woman is the glory of the man" in [[:en:bible:notes:1co:11:07|11:7]].
  * **have a symbol of authority on her head** - Possible meanings are 1) "to symbolize that she has man as her head" or 2) "to symbolize that she has the authority to pray or prophesy."
