===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 I do not want to see you just for a short time and then continue my trip. I am hoping to stay with you for a while, if the Lord \add Jesus\add* allows me to do that.
\v 8 But I will stay \add here\add* in Ephesus \add city\add* until \add after\add* the Pentecost \add festival\add*.
\v 9 \add I want to do that\add* because \add God\add* has given me a great opportunity \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add to proclaim his good message here\add*. \add As a result of my work here, he is producing\add* great results. I also want to stay here because there are many people here who oppose \add my work, and I need to oppose them\add*.

<usfm>
\v 7 I do not want to see you for only a short time. I hope that the Lord will allow me to spend enough time together that we can help each other.
\v 8 I want to stay in Ephesus until the Festival of Pentecost,
\v 9 because the Lord has opened a door for me there, although there are still many who oppose us.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 For I do not wish to see you now for only a passing visit. For I am looking forward to spending more time with you, if the Lord permits.
\v 8 But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost,
\v 9 for a wide door has opened for me, and there are many adversaries.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I do not wish to see you now** - Paul is stating that he wants to visit for a long time later, not just for a short time soon.
  * **Pentecost** - Paul would stay in Ephesus until this festival, which came in May or June, 50 days after Passover. He would then travel through Macedonia, and later try to arrive in Corinth before winter started in November.
  * **a wide door has opened** - Paul speaks of the opportunity God has given him to win people to the gospel as if it were a door that God had opened so he could walk through it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
