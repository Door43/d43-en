====== 1 Corinthians 16:7-9 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 I do not want to see you just for a short time and then continue my trip. I am hoping to stay with you for a while, if the Lord \add Jesus\add* allows me to do that.
\v 8 But I will stay \add here\add* in Ephesus \add city\add* until \add after\add* the Pentecost \add festival\add*.
\v 9 \add I want to do that\add* because \add God\add* has given me a great opportunity \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add to proclaim his good message here\add*. \add As a result of my work here, he is producing\add* great results. I also want to stay here because there are many people here who oppose \add my work, and I need to oppose them\add*.

<usfm>
\v 7 I do not want to see you for only a short time. I hope that the time will be long enough to help us both.
\v 8 I want to stay in Ephesus until the Festival of Pentecost,
\v 9 because the Lord has opened a door for me there, although there are still many who oppose us.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 For I do not wish to see you now for a short time, for I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits.
\v 8 But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost,
\v 9 for a wide door has opened for me, and there are many adversaries.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **I do not wish to see you now** - Paul is stating that he does not want to come for just a short visit now but for a longer period of time later.
    * **Pentecost**  - Paul would stay in Ephesus until this festival (May or June), later travel through Macedonia, and later try to arrive in Corinth before winter started in November.
    * **a wide door has opened**  - This means that the Lord had given him a good opportunity to win people to the gospel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
