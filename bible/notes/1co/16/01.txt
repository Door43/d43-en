\v 1 Now \add I will reply to another question that you asked. You asked\add* about the \add money you are\add* collecting \add to send\add* to God's people \add in Jerusalem\add*. Do what I told the congregations in Galatia to do.
\v 2 Every Sunday each of you should set aside \add at home\add* some funds \f + \ft euphemism \f* \add for this purpose\add*, in proportion to how much \add God\add* has prospered you. Then you should save it up, so that when I arrive there, you will not need to collect \add any more money. Choose some men whom you approve of, to take\add* this money to Jerusalem.

\v 1 Now to answer your question about the offering we are taking for the church in Jerusalem--I gave directions to the church in Galatia, and you are to do the same as I instructed them.
\v 2 Every Sunday, each of you should put some money aside, as you are able, so there will not be any collections when I come there.
