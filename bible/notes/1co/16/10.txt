===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 When Timothy arrives \add there in Corinth\add*, treat him respectfully \f + \ft litotes \f*, because he is working for the Lord just as I am.
\v 11 Do not let anyone despise him. And when he leaves there, give him some of the things that he needs \add for his trip\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f* \add here\add*, and also \add ask God to\add* bless him. I am waiting for him to come, along with the other fellow believers \add who have been traveling with him\add*.
\p
\v 12 \add You also asked\add* about our fellow believer, Apollos. I urged him strongly that he should go back to you with the three fellow believers \add who came here from Corinth\add*. He was not at all willing to go \add now\add*, but he will go later, when he has an opportunity.

\v 10 Now when Timothy comes, treat him kindly and see to it that he has nothing to be afraid of, for he is doing the Lord's work, just like I am doing.
\v 11 Do not let anyone be unkind to him. Help him on his way as much as you can; send him away in peace so that he may join me. I am expecting him to travel with other brothers who are coming my way. 
\p
\v 12 You asked about our brother Apollos. I urged him strongly that he should visit you when the other brothers came to you. He decided not to come now, but he will come to you later when he has opportunity.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **see that he is with you unafraid** -  AT: "see that he has no cause to fear being with you"
    * **Let no one despise him.** - Timothy being much younger than Paul may not be welcomed with the respect due him as a minister of the Gospel like that of Paul and Apollos.
    * **our brother Apollos** - Paul treats Apollos with the respect of a fellow believer and minister in Christ and by supporting his return to Corinth to minister to them.
