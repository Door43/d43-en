\v 10 Now when Timothy comes, treat him kindly and see to it that he has nice accomodations, for he is doing the work of the Lord, just like I am doing.
\v 11 Do not let anyone be unkind to him. Help him on his way as much as you can, send him in peace that he may come to me where I am. I am expecting him to travel with other brothers who are coming this way.
