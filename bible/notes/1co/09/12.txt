\v 12 If others use their authority over you, do we not have a right to do so even more? Nevertheless we did not use this right; but we endure all things so that we may cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ.
\v 13 Do you not know that they that minister the sacred things in the temple also eat some of them  and they that wait upon the altar receive a portion of the offerings to eat?
\v 14 Even so the Lord ordained that they that proclaim the gospel should be supported by the gospel.
