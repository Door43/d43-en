\v 12 Since other people \add who preached to you\add* had that right, certainly Barnabas and I have the same right.\f + \ft Or: do Barnabas and I not have the same right? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\p However, neither of us insisted \add that you give us the things that\add* we have a right \add to receive from you\add*. Instead, we were willing to endure anything in order that we not hinder \add anyone from believing\add* the message about Christ.
\v 13 You should keep in mind that \add the priests and servants\add* in the Temple eat \add some of the food that people bring to\add* the Temple.\f + \ft Or: Do you not know that \add the priests and servants\add* in the Temple eat \add some of the food that people bring to\add* the Temple? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* Specifically, the priests who work at the altar eat some of \add the food that the people bring to sacrifice on\add* the altar.
\v 14 So the Lord has commanded that those who proclaim the good message \add about him\add* should receive from \add those who hear that\add* message what they need to live on.

\v 12 If others received this kind of support from you, have we not proven that we are even more deserving because of the untiring labor and hard work you saw in us? 
\p However, we have not made use of this right, even though we were entitled to it. Instead, we endure all kinds of hardships so that we do not create any obstacle to hinder the effective spread of the gospel of Christ.
\v 13 Just like those in the temple, those who help with the sacrifices, receive some of the food that is made out of the sacrifices, as was is seen as a fair return to them for their service, and those who serve in the temple service at the altar are paid from some of the receipts of the contributions given from those who worship in the temple. They are paid because they are serving God, by God's people..
\v 14 The Lord has commanded that those who proclaim the gospel message are to receive their living wages from those who are touched by the gospel.

\v 12 If others exercised this right from you, do we not have even more? Nevertheless, we did not claim this right, but we endured everything rather than be a hindrance to the gospel of Christ.
\v 13 Do you not know that those who serve in the temple get their food from the temple, and those that serve at the altar share in the altar?
\v 14 Even so the Lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living from the gospel.
