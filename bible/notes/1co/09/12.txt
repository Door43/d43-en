\v 12 Since other people \add who preached to you\add* had that right, certainly Barnabas and I have the same right.\f + \ft Or: do Barnabas and I not have the same right? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\p However, neither of us insisted \add that you give us the things that\add* we have a right \add to receive from you\add*. Instead, we were willing to endure anything in order that we not hinder \add anyone from believing\add* the message about Christ.
\v 13 You should keep in mind that \add the priests and servants\add* in the Temple eat \add some of the food that people bring to\add* the Temple.\f + \ft Or: Do you not know that \add the priests and servants\add* in the Temple eat \add some of the food that people bring to\add* the Temple? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* Specifically, the priests who work at the altar eat some of \add the food that the people bring to sacrifice on\add* the altar.
\v 14 So the Lord has commanded that those who proclaim the good message \add about him\add* should receive from \add those who hear that\add* message what they need to live on.

\v 12 Others received this kind of help from you, and we have certainly proven that we deserve it even more than they do.
\p However, we have not accepted anything from you, even though we were entitled to it. Instead, we endure all kinds of hardships so that we do not make it more difficult for people to believe in the good news about Christ.
\v 13 Certainly you know that those who helped carry out the sacrifices offered to God in the temple received some of those offerings for their own needs. They received some of the food offered to God.
\v 14 In the same way, the Lord has commanded that those who proclaim the good news are to receive their living wages from the good news. They receive part of what is given to God for their needs.

\v 12 If others exercised this right from you, do we not have even more? But we did not claim this right. Instead we endured everything rather than be a hindrance to the gospel of Christ.
\v 13 Do you not know that those who serve in the temple get their food from the temple? Do you not know that those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar?
\v 14 In the same way, the Lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living from the gospel.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **If others exercised ... you, do we not have even more?** - Paul asks a question so that the Corinthians will think of what he is saying without him having to say it. Here "we" refers to Paul and Barnabas. AT: "Others exercised ... you, so you know without me telling you that we have this right even more." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **If others exercised this right** - Paul and the Corinthians both know that others exercised the right. "Since others exercised this right"
  * **others** - other workers of the gospel
  * **this right** - the right to have the believers at Corinth provide for the living expenses of those who told them the good news
  * **be a hindrance to** - "be a burden to" or "stop the spread of"
  * **Do you not know that those who serve in the temple get their food from the temple?** - Paul is reminding the Corinthians of what they know so he can add new information. AT: "I want to remind you that those who serve in the temple get their food from the temple." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Do you not know that those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar?** - Paul is reminding the Corinthians of what they know so he can add new information. AT: "I want to remind you that those who serve at the altar get some of the foods and meat that people offer on the altar." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **get their living from the gospel** - The words "the gospel" here are a metonym for 1) the people to whom they tell the gospel, "receive their food and other things they need from those to whom they teach the good news," or 2) the result of working to tell the gospel, "receive their food and other things they need because they work to tell the good news." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
