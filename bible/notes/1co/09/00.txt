====== 1 Corinthians 09 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. Many other English translations indent the line of 9:9, which is a quotation from the Old Testament. 

Chapters 8-10 form a single unit, answering the question: "Is it alright to eat meat that has been sacrificed to an idol?" In this chapter, Paul defends himself from the claim of trying make financial gains from the church. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Earning money from the church ==
People have accused Paul of just wanting money from the Church. Paul answers that he has a right to get money from the Church because the Old Testament taught that those who worked should get their living from their work. He and Barnabas purposefully never used this right and earned their own living. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphor ==
There are many metaphors in this chapter. These matephors teach complex truths. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphors]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Contextualization ==

This passage is important because Paul "contextualizes" his ministry in service of the gospel to different audiences. This means that Paul makes himself and the gospel  understandable without his actions hindering the gospel's reception. The translator may wish to take extra care in preserving aspects of this "contextualization" if possible. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:goodnews|Gospel]])
