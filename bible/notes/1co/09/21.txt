\v 21 When I was with non-Jews\f + \ft Or: those who do not know those laws \f*, I did the things that non-Jews \add think that people should do\add*, in order that I might convince some of them \add to trust in Christ\add*. I do not mean that I disobey God's laws. No, I obey the things that Christ commanded us to do.
\v 22 When I was with those who doubt \add whether God will permit them to do certain things that others\add* \add disapprove of\f + \ft Or: think it is not right to do\add* \f*, I \add avoided doing those things\add*, in order that I might convince some of them \add to trust in Christ\add*. In summary, I have done all the things \add that the people I have been with think that others should do\add*, in order that by every possible means I might convince some of them \add to trust in Christ\add*.
\v 23 I do all these things in order that \add more people will believe\add* the message about Christ, and in order that I, along with other believers, may receive the good things \add that God promises to give us\add*.

\v 21 And to them that are without law, as without law, not being without law to God, but under law to Christ, that I might gain them that are without law.
\v 22 To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak: I am become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some.
