====== 1 Corinthians 09:21-23 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 21 When I was with non-Jews\f + \ft Or: those who do not know those laws \f*, I did the things that non-Jews \add think that people should do\add*, in order that I might convince some of them \add to trust in Christ\add*. I do not mean that I disobey God's laws. No, I obey the things that Christ commanded us to do.
\v 22 When I was with those who doubt \add whether God will permit them to do certain things that others\add* \add disapprove of\f + \ft Or: think it is not right to do\add* \f*, I \add avoided doing those things\add*, in order that I might convince some of them \add to trust in Christ\add*. In summary, I have done all the things \add that the people I have been with think that others should do\add*, in order that by every possible means I might convince some of them \add to trust in Christ\add*.
\v 23 I do all these things in order that \add more people will believe\add* the message about Christ, and in order that I, along with other believers, may receive the good things \add that God promises to give us\add*.

\v 21 When I am with those who are pagans, those people live apart from religion and the traditions of worship and obedience, I became like them (though I do not live as a non-Christian and am careful about my life and purity before God, and I live by the law of Christ), so that I may win these people to Christ who live so far from the law and so far from the promises and covenants of God.
\v 22 To Christians who are weak in their faith and who are torn about matters of conscience and are easily confused by questions that the more mature in faith can resolve, I lay aside my need to be strong or to do anything that might harm their weak faith. I become as one who is weak as well, so that I may, by all means, save some of them.
\v 23 However I deal with people, people from all backgrounds and traditions, all I do is for the sake of the gospel, and I know I will participate in many blessings that come from sharing the gospel with all kinds of people.

\v 21 To those outside the Law, I became like one outside the Law, (though not being outside the Lawof God myself, but under the law of Christ), so that I may win those outside the Law.
\v 22 To the weak I became weak, that I may win the weak. I have become all things to all people, so that I may by all means save some.
\v 23 And I do all things for the gospel’s sake, so that I may participate in its blessings.
