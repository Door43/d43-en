<usfm>
\v 17 If I had decided by myself to proclaim it, \add God\add* would reward me. But I did not decide by myself to do that. I am simply doing the work that \add God\add* entrusted to me.
\v 18 So perhaps you wonder what my reward is.\f + \ft Or: are you wondering what my reward is? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add I will tell you\add*. When I proclaim the good message \add about Christ\add*, I do not ask people for financial help. It \add makes me very happy not to ask for help, and being happy is the\add* reward I get. I do not want to use the rights that I have \add when I proclaim\add* the good message.

\v 17 When I preach the good news freely, I have a great reward. But even if I did not preach it freely, I would still have to do it, because God trusted me to do this work for him.
\v 18 So what is the reward that God gives me? It is that when I preach the good news to people who do not support me, I offer it freely, without putting anyone under obligation to me. They receive the good news without costing them any money, and I do not receive from them anything they owe me.

\v 17 For if I do this willingly, I have a reward. But if not willingly, I still have a responsibility that was entrusted to me.
\v 18 What then is my reward? That when I preach, I may offer the gospel without charge and so not take full use of my right in the gospel.
