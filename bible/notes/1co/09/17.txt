\v 17 If I had decided by myself to proclaim it, \add God\add* would reward me. But I did not decide by myself to do that. I am simply doing the work that \add God\add* entrusted to me.
\v 18 So perhaps you wonder what my reward is.\f + \ft Or: are you wondering what my reward is? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add I will tell you\add*. When I proclaim the good message \add about Christ\add*, I do not ask people for financial help. It \add makes me very happy not to ask for help, and being happy is the\add* reward I get. I do not want to use the rights that I have \add when I proclaim\add* the good message.

\v 17 When I preach the good news because I want to, I have a great reward. But even if I only preached because someone forced me to preach, I would still have to preach, because God trusted me to do this work for him.
\v 18 So what is the reward that God gives me? It is that when I preach the good news, I offer it without anyone paying me for it. Instead, I offer it for free so that I can do it without receiving the payment the Lord would allow me to take.

\v 17 For if I do this willingly, I have a reward. But if not willingly, I still have a responsibility that was entrusted to me.
\v 18 What then is my reward? That when I preach, I may offer the gospel without charge and so not take full use of my right in the gospel.
