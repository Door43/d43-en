\v 24 When people run in a race, they all run, but only one of them wins the race and as a result gets a prize. You certainly know that.\f + \ft Or: Do you not know that? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* So, \add just like\add* runners \add exert themselves fully to win a race\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add you should exert yourselves fully to do the things that God wants you to do\add*, in order that you may receive the reward \add that God wants to give you\add*.
\v 25 All athletes exercise their bodies strenuously in many ways. They do that in order to receive a wreath \add as a reward to wear on their heads\add*. Those wreaths fade, but we will receive a reward that will last forever \f + \ft litotes \f*.
\v 26 For that reason, I \add try hard to please God\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add like a\add* runner who runs toward the goal \f + \ft litotes \f*. I \add try hard to accomplish what God wants me to accomplish, like\add* a boxer tries hard to hit his opponent, not to miss hitting him.
\v 27 I beat my body \add to make it do what I want it to do\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add as\add* slaves \add obey their masters\add*, in order that, after I have proclaimed \add God's message\add* to others, he will not \add say that I do\add* not deserve to receive a reward.

\v 24 You know when people run in a race, they all run, but only one of them wins the prize. So you also should run to win the prize.
\v 25 Every athlete is careful in how he trains. They are running for a wreath that quickly perishes and fades away. But we are running so we might receive a wreath that will last forever.
\v 26 Therefore, in everything I do, I do it for a purpose. I do not waste my effort or exhaust myself by striking the air like a boxer who has no opponent.
\v 27 I discipline my body and I make it obey my commands. I do not want to preach the good news to others and then lose my reward because I failed to fulfill what he commanded me to do.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 24 Do you not know that in a race all the runners run the race,  but only one receives the prize? So run to win the prize.
\v 25 An athlete exercises self-control in all his training. They do it to receive a wreath that is perishable, but we run so that we might receive an imperishable wreath.
\v 26 Therefore I do not run without purpose or box by beating the air.
\v 27 But I subdue my body and make it a slave, so that after I have preached to others, I myself may not be disqualified.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Do you not know that in a race all the runners run the race, but only one receives the prize? ** -  The expected (although unstated) response is an understanding of the facts of the question: "Yes, I know that 'Although all runners run the race, only one runner receives the prize.'" (See:  [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **run the race** - Paul compares living the Christian life and working for God to running a race and being an athlete. As in a race the Christian life and work require strict discipline on the part of the runner, and as in a race the Christian has a specific goal. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **run to win the prize** - running with commitment to success in the endeavor is compared to commitment to doing the things that God wants you to do.  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **wreath** - A wreath is a marker of success or completion, given by an authority over that event; the metaphor refers to the life lived honoring God, with God providing the permanent marker of salvation.  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I myself might not be disqualified** - The Passive form is rephrased to the Active form of the sentence. AT: "the judge might not disqualify me." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
