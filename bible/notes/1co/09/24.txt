\v 24 When people run in a race, they all run, but only one of them wins the race and as a result gets a prize. You certainly know that.\f + \ft Or: Do you not know that? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* So, \add just like\add* runners \add exert themselves fully to win a race\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add you should exert yourselves fully to do the things that God wants you to do\add*, in order that you may receive the reward \add that God wants to give you\add*.
\v 25 All athletes exercise their bodies strenuously in many ways. They do that in order to receive a wreath \add as a reward to wear on their heads\add*. Those wreaths fade, but we will receive a reward that will last forever \f + \ft litotes \f*.
\v 26 For that reason, I \add try hard to please God\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add like a\add* runner who runs toward the goal \f + \ft litotes \f*. I \add try hard to accomplish what God wants me to accomplish, like\add* a boxer tries hard to hit his opponent, not to miss hitting him.
\v 27 I beat my body \add to make it do what I want it to do\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add as\add* slaves \add obey their masters\add*, in order that, after I have proclaimed \add God's message\add* to others, he will not \add say that I do\add* not deserve to receive a reward.

\v 24 Do you not know that out of all that run in a race only one receives the prize? Even so run; that you may succeed.
\v 25 And every man that gives his utmost in the games exercises self-control in all things. Now they do it to receive a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.
\v 26 Therefore I do not run with hesitation. Neither do I fight by beating the air:
\v 27 But I subdue my body, and bring it into bondage unless after I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected.
