====== 1 Corinthians 09:19-20 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 I am not obligated to do what anyone else thinks that I should do. Nevertheless, when I have been with any group of people, I have made myself \add do what they believed that I should do, just like a slave does what his master wants him to do\add*. I have done that in order that I might convince more people \add to trust in Christ\add*.
\v 20 Specifically, when I was with fellow Jews, I did the things that Jews \add think that people should do\add*. I did that in order that I might convince some of them \add to trust in Christ\add*. Although I am now not obligated to obey the Jewish laws and rituals, when I was with those who believe that they are obligated to obey those laws, I did the things that they \add think that people should do\add*. I did that in order to convince some of them \add to trust in Christ\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 I am free from all obligations and I owe nothing to anyone. No one owns me anything, but I am a servant to everyone, so that I might persuade more and more people to trust in Christ.
\v 20 When working with Jewish people, I become like a Jew, so that I may win them to Christ. To those who are living under the Law (though I am not living my life by the Law's demands), I lived like they lived, in order that those living under the Law may trust in Christ like I have.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 For though I am free from all, I became a servant to all, in order that I might win more.
\v 20 To the Jews I became like a Jew, in order to win Jews. To those under the Law, I became like one under the Law (though not being under the law myself), in order to win those under the Law.
