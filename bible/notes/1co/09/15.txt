<usfm>
\v 15 However, I have not requested that you \add give me\add* those things that I have a right \add to receive from you\add*. Furthermore, I am writing this to you, not in order to request you to begin \add giving me financial help now\add*. I would rather die than to \add receive help from you\add*. I do not want anyone to prevent me from boasting \add about my proclaiming God's message to you without receiving financial help from you\add*.
\v 16 When I proclaim the message about Christ, I cannot boast \add about doing it\add*, because \add Christ\add* has commanded me \add to do it\add*. I would be very miserable \f + \ft Or: \add I am afraid that\add* God would punish me \f* if I did not proclaim that message.

\v 15 But I have not demanded this money for myself. And that is not why I am writing this to you now. I would rather die than for you to pay me. I will not demand this because I did not claim my right to be supported by you—my reason for boasting.
\v 16 If I proclaim the good news, I am not doing anything for which I should boast. I must preach the good news. I would grieve with many tears if I could not do what God called me to do.

\v 15 But I have not claimed any of these rights. And I do not write this so something might be done for me. I would rather die than anyone deprive me of this boast.
\v 16 For if I preach the gospel, I have no reason for boasting, because I must do this. And woe be to me if I do not  preach the gospel!
