\v 3 In order to defend myself, this \add is what I say\add* to those who criticize me \add by claiming that I do not act like an apostle\add*.
\v 4 As for Barnabas and me, we certainly have the right \add as apostles\add* to receive \add from you and other congregations\add* food and drink \add for our work\add*.\f + \ft Or: do we not have the right to receive \add from you and other congregations\add* food and drink \add for our work\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 5 \add We have the\add* same right\add that\add* the other apostles and the Lord Jesus' \add younger\add* brothers and \add especially\add* Peter have. They all take along a wife who is a believer \add when they travel various places in order to tell people about Christ. And they have a right that the people whom they work among will support their wives, too\add*. So Barnabas and I certainly have those same rights.\f + \ft Or: do not Barnabas and I have those same rights? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 6 It would be ridiculous to think that Barnabas and I are the only apostles who must work to earn money to pay our expenses \add while we are doing God's work!\f + \ft Or: Do you think that\add* Barnabas and I are the only apostles who must work to earn money to pay our expenses \add while we are doing God's work\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 3 This is how I answer those who say that I am not a true apostle because I do not live on money that you believers give me.
\v 4 Of course we have the right to live on such money.
\v 5 We can certainly travel with a believing wife, like the other apostles doâ€”like the Lord's brother and Cephas.
\v 6 No one made a rule that only Barnabas and I must work to support ourselves.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 This is my defense to those that examine me.
\v 4 Do we not have the right to eat and drink?
\v 5 Do we not have the  right to take along with us a wife who is a believer, as do the rest of the apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?
\v 6 Or is it only Barnabas and I who must work?
