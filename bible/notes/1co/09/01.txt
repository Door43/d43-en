\v 1 To people who criticize how I work, I reply like this: I am an apostle. I have seen Jesus our Lord. I am free. You are the result of the work I didâ€”you are my workmanship.
\v 2 Even if some others do not think I am a true apostle, I am a true apostle to you. By the Lord's stamp of approval, you are the proof that I am a true apostle.

\v 1 Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my workmanship in the Lord?
\v 2 If I am not an apostle to others , at least I am to you. For you are the proof of my apostleship in the Lord.
