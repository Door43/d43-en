<usfm>
\v 10 My fellow believers, by the authority of \f + \ft metonymy \f* our Lord Jesus Christ, I urgently appeal to all of you to agree with one another. What I mean is, stop dividing into groups. Instead, be united \f + \ft metaphor \f* concerning what you understand \add about spiritual matters\add* and be united in what you decide.
\v 11 My fellow believers, \add I urge this\add* because some members of Chloe's household have told me that you are quarreling among yourselves.

\v 10 My brothers and sisters, I beg you by the authority of Jesus, that you come to an agreement and that you settle this argument, and that there be no more divisions among you. Learn to see things from the same point of view as you work to settle this argument and then you will find that you have the same goals in mind.
\v 11 Those in Chloe's house reported to me that there had been divisions and disagreements among some of you.

\v 10 Now I urge you, brothers and sisters, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all agree, and that there be no divisions among you. I urge that you be joined together with the same mind and by the same purpose.
\v 11 But Chloe's people have reported to me that there are factions developing among you.
