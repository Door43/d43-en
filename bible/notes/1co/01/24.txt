\v 24 But to us whom God has chosen to belong to himself, both Jews and non-Jews, that message shows that God acted powerfully and wisely \add by sending\add* Christ \add to die\add* for us.
\v 25 \add Unbelievers may think\add* \f + \ft irony \f* \add that\add* God was \add acting\add* foolishly \add by doing that\add*, but \add the truth is that\add* he was acting more wisely than unbelievers who \add think that\add* \f + \ft irony \f* they are wise. And unbelievers may think that God was \add acting\add* weakly \add by sending his son to die\add*, but he was acting more powerfully than unbelievers who \add think\add* \f + \ft irony \f* \add that they\add* act powerfully.

\v 24 But for us, we whom God called so we can know him, that message shows that God acted powerfully and wisely by sending Christ to die for us. The good news is not tied to any race or philosophy; in Christ there is no distinction between Jews and all the other nations and races on earth.
\v 25 For the things of God that appears foolish are really wiser that the most brilliant ideas human beings can imagine. And the things of God that appear weakest are stronger than the strongest and greatest human being who ever lived.

\v 24 But to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, we preach Christ as the power and the wisdom of God.
\v 25 For the foolishness of God is wiser than people, and the weakness of God is stronger than people.

  * **the foolishness of God is wiser than people, and the weakness of God is stronger than people** - Possible meanings are 1) Paul is speaking ironically about God's foolishness and weakness. Paul knows God is not foolish or weak. AT: "what seems to be the foolishness of God is wiser than people's wisdom, and what seems to be the weakness of God is stronger than the people's strength" or 2) Paul is speaking from the point of view of the Greek people who may think God is foolish or weak. AT: "what people call God's foolishness is really wiser than what people call wisdom, and what people call God's weakness is really stronger than people's strength" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
