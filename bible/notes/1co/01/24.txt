\v 24 But to us whom God has chosen to belong to himself, both Jews and non-Jews, that message shows that God acted powerfully and wisely \add by sending\add* Christ \add to die\add* for us.
\v 25 \add Unbelievers may think\add* \f + \ft irony \f* \add that\add* God was \add acting\add* foolishly \add by doing that\add*, but \add the truth is that\add* he was acting more wisely than unbelievers who \add think that\add* \f + \ft irony \f* they are wise. And unbelievers may think that God was \add acting\add* weakly \add by sending his son to die\add*, but he was acting more powerfully than unbelievers who \add think\add* \f + \ft irony \f* \add that they\add* act powerfully.

\v 24 But for us, we whom God called so we can know him, Christ is his power to rescue from destruction and it is the wisdom to know God and to learn about him. The good news is not tied to any race or philosophy; in Christ there is no distinction between Jews and all the other nations and races on earth.
\v 25 For what appears foolish to God is wiser that the most brilliant ideas human beings can imagine. And the weakest part of God's nature is stronger than the strongest and greatest human being who ever lived.

\v 24 But to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, we preach Christ as the power and the wisdom of God.
\v 25 Because the foolishness of God is wiser than people, and the weakness of God is stronger than people.
