====== 1 Corinthians 01:14-16 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 I thank \add God\add* that Crispus and Gaius were the only ones from among you whom I baptized.
\v 15 As a result, no one \add there in Corinth except those two\add* can say, "Paul baptized me so that I would become his disciple\f + \ft Or: submissive to him \f*."
\v 16 \add Now I remember that\add* I also baptized the household of Stephanas, but I do not remember baptizing anyone else \add there\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 I thank God that I baptized only a few people there; among them I baptized Crispus and Gaius.
\v 15 It would not be true that I baptized them in my name.
\v 16 (Now I remember that I also baptized the household of Stephanas, but other than those people, I do not remember baptizing anyone else in Corinth.)

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 I thank God that I baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius.
\v 15 This was so that no one would say that you were baptized into my name.
\v 16 (I also baptized the household of Stephanas. Beyond that, I do not know if I baptized any others.)
