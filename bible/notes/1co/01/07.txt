\v 7 I pray for you that you would not lack any gift from the Spirit of God while you wait for the day when God will make the Lord Jesus Christ known and will show him to everyone.
\v 8 God will also make you strong so you can serve him to the very end, so you will bring no shame upon yourselves on the day that our Lord Jesus Christ returns to earth.
\v 9 God will keep his promise to do that. God called you, so you can know and love his Son, Jesus Christ, who is our Lord.
