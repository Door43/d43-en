\v 30 It is because of what God \add has done\add* that you have a close relationship with\f + \ft Or: belong to \f* Christ Jesus. God \add accomplished\add* his wise \add plan to save us\add* by what Christ did for us. As a result of what Christ did, God erases the record of our sins, sets us apart for himself, and frees us from our being guilty \add for our sins\add*.
\v 31 So, it is \bd the Lord\bd* whom we should boast about, \add not about one spiritual leader being better than another\add*. We should do as \add a prophet\f + \ft Or: Jeremiah\add* \f* wrote \add in the Scriptures that we should do\add*:
\q Those who boast should boast \add only\add* about what the Lord \add has done\add*.

\v 30  Because of what God has done, you are now joined to Christ Jesus, who has made clear to us how wise God is, he has put us right with God, he has set us apart for God, and he has rescued us and brought us to safety.
\v 31 So, as the Scriptures say: 
\q "The one who praises himself should praise himself only in what the Lord has done for him."

<usfm>
\v 30 Because of what God did, now you are in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from Godâ€”our righteousness, holiness, and redemption,
\v 31 so that, as scripture says, "Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord."
