\v 1 I, Paul, am writing this letter. Sosthenes, our fellow believer, is with me as I write it. God appointed me to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and God chose me to serve him.
\v 2 This letter is to the church of God in Corinth, to those whom Christ Jesus has set apart for God, with everyone else—everwhere—who calls on God to save them in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours.  
\p
\v 3 May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ love you and give you peace.
