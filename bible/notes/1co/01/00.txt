====== 1 Corinthians 01 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

The first paragraph of 2 Corinthians is the standard first century way of opening a letter. First the writer of the letter is named, then to whom the letter is sent and then the standard greetings “grace and peace” and finally the author’s prayer for the people receiving the letter. He thanks God for his grace to them and making them rich in speech and spiritual gifts.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

Paul mentions the trouble he had in the Provence of Asia was so bad that they did not expect to live through it. He had been wanting to visit them twice, once before going to Macedonia and again on the way from Macedonia to Jerusalem. He had not said he would come when he really planned not to come but he postponed his visit so as not to want to hurt them disciplining them. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

He uses two rhetorical questions [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] defending himself from a charge on insincerity. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===
