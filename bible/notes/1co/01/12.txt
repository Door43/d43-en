\v 12 That is, some of you say, "Paul is the one to whom we \add are loyal\add*," and others say, "Peter is the one to whom we \add are loyal\add*," and still others say, "Christ is the one to whom we \add are loyal\add*."
\v 13 \add It is ridiculous that\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add you are quarreling and\add* dividing up \add into groups instead of being loyal to\add* Christ alone. Christ certainly has not divided himself into parts and distributed those parts out \add to groups of people who oppose each other\add*!\f + \ft Or: Has Christ divided himself into parts and distributed those parts out \add to groups of people who oppose each other\add*? \f* \f + \ft metaphor, rhetorical question \f* I, Paul, certainly did not die on the cross for you!\f + \ft Or: Did I, Paul die on the cross for you? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* When you were baptized \f + \ft Or:When someone baptized you \f*, you certainly did not promise that you were submitting to me!\f + \ft Or: did you promise that you were submitting to me? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 12 This is the problem. Each of you claims to have loyalty to one leader or another. One says, "I am loyal to Paul." Another says, "I am loyal to Apollos."  Someone else says, "I am loyal to Peter." And the last one says, "But I am loyal to Christ."
\v 13 But Christ does not divide his loyalty. Paul was not crucified for you. The person who baptized you did not baptize you in the name of Paul.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 Now I mean this: Each one of you says, "I am with Paul," or "I am with Apollos," or "I am with Cephas," or "I am with Christ."
\v 13 Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized in the name of Paul?
