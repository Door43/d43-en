====== 1 Corinthians 01:22-23 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 The Jews want \add people to prove, by performing\add* miracles, \add that their message is true\add*. The non-Jews want to hear only messages consisting of talk that they consider to be very wise.
\v 23 As for us, we proclaim \add the message about what\add* Christ \add accomplished for us when\add* he was nailed \f + \ft Or:\add when they\add* nailed him \f* to the cross. That message offends Jews \add because they do not think that the Messiah will die, and\add* non-Jews think it is \f + \ft irony \f* a foolish message.
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 The Jews wanted public displays of miraculous power before they would follow anyone. The Greeks are looking for wisdom through new and fresh ways of thinking about spiritual ideas.
\v 23 But we proclaim a message about Christ, who died on a cross. For the Jews this message about the cross of Christ is something they cannot receive because death on a cross brings a curse with it. To the Greeks it is too foolish to deserve their attention.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 For Jews ask for miraculous signs and Greeks seek wisdom.
\v 23 But we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Greeks.
