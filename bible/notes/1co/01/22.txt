\v 22 The Jews want \add people to prove, by performing\add* miracles, \add that their message is true\add*. The non-Jews want to hear only messages consisting of talk that they consider to be very wise.
\v 23 As for us, we proclaim \add the message about what\add* Christ \add accomplished for us when\add* he was nailed \f + \ft Or:\add when they\add* nailed him \f* to the cross. That message offends Jews \add because they do not think that the Messiah will die, and\add* non-Jews think it is \f + \ft irony \f* a foolish message.
