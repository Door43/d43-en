<usfm>
\v 20 So, do you know \add what God thinks\add* about what \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* people who \f + \ft irony \f* consider themselves to be wise and scholars and philosophers say? \add He does not pay attention to what they say, because\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* he has shown clearly that what unbelievers \add think is\add* \f + \ft irony \f* wise is \add not wise at all\add*, but is really foolish.
\v 21 God, acting very wisely, made it impossible for unbelievers to know God by doing what they thought was \f + \ft irony \f* wise. Instead, he was happy to save those who trust \add in Christ\add* as the result of their hearing \add the message that\add* was proclaimed to them, a message that others consider to be foolish.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 Where are the wise people of this world? They did not understand anything  about God. Neither did the scholars, nor those skilled in debate. For God has shown that all their wisdom is foolishness.
\v 21 In the wisdom of God,  unbelievers did not come to know God by their own wisdom. So God was pleased to use a message that they thought was foolish. That is message we proclaimed and it had power to save all who believe it.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 Where is the wise person? Where is the scholar? Where is the debater of this world? Has not God turned the wisdom of the world into foolishness?
\v 21 Since the world in its wisdom did not know God, it pleased God through the foolishness of preaching to save those who believe.
