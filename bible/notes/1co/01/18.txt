<usfm>
\v 18 For those who are dead to the things of God cannot know him, the message about Christ dying on the cross is pointless to them. But for those of us whom God has rescued and brought to life, we know it is God's power working in us.
\v 19 A prophet wrote in the Scriptures: 
\p 
\q "The wisdom of those who think they are wise, 
\q I will destroy,
\q and I will make the brilliant plans of the intelligent 
\q to be utter failures."

\v 18 For the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are dying, but among those whom God is saving, it is the power of God.
\v 19 For it is written,
\q "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise;
\q I will frustrate the understanding of the intelligent."
