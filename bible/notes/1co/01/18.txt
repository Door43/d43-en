But to us who are being saved \f + \ft Or:whom \add God\add* is saving \f* \add spiritually because we believe that message\add*, it \add demonstrates that\add* God acts powerfully \add in order to save us\add*.
\v 19 \add It is like what God said that\add* a prophet wrote long ago,
\p \add By the things that I will do\add*, I will show that the ideas of those who \add think\add* \f + \ft irony \f* they are wise are completely useless. I will ignore the ideas that they think are \f + \ft irony \f* so smart.

\v 18 For those who are dead to the things of God cannot understand him. Christ died for them on the cross, but this message is pointless to them. However, for those of us whom God has rescued and brought to life, this message allows God to powerfully work in us.
\v 19 A prophet wrote in the scriptures:
\p
\q "The wisdom of those who think they are wise,
\q I will destroy,
\q and I will make the brilliant plans of the intelligent
\q to be utter failures."

\v 18 For the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are dying. But among those whom God is saving, it is the power of God.
\v 19 For it is written,
\q "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise.
\q I will frustrate the understanding of the intelligent."
