\v 11 As a result, you who know that \add idols are not really alive\add*, might cause that fellow believer, one for whom Christ died, to be ruined \add spiritually\add*\f + \ft Or: to stop believing \add in Christ\add* \f*.
\v 12 By sinning against your fellow believer by causing him to do something that he thinks God does not allow us to do, \add it is as though\add* you are sinning against Christ himself!
\v 13 So if \add I, Paul, think that by\add* eating a certain food I might cause a fellow believer to be ruined spiritually, I will never eat such food again. I do not want to cause any fellow believer to be ruined spiritually\f + \ft Or: to stop believing in Christ \f*. \add And you should\add* \add do as I do\f + \ft Or: imitate my example\add* \f*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 As a result, when you eat meat sacrificed to idols, and your weaker brother or sister sees what you do, it may cause them to fail in their faith. You may use your knowledge about idols as freedom to eat the meat from the idolatrous temple, but that freedom could cause your brother or sister, for whom Christ died, to be destroyed.
\v 12 So, you sin against your weaker brothers and sisters when you wound their consciences, because they have much to learn. But do not sin against Christ, by putting on them a burden so heavy it will crush their weak faith.
\v 13 Therefore, if  food causes my brother or sister to stumble into sin, I will never eat meat again! I will be patient with those who are weak in faith and I will never crush their faith by doing something that would cause them to stumble.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 So because of your understanding about true nature of idols, the weaker brother or sister, for whom Christ died, is destroyed.
\v 12 Thus, when you sin against your brothers and sisters and wound their weak consciences, you sin against Christ. 
\v 13 Therefore, if food causes my brother or sister to stumble, I will never eat meat again, so that I may not cause my brother or sister to fall into sin.
