\v 4 Therefore concerning therefore the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no God but one.
\v 5 For though there are those that are called gods and lords, whether in heaven or on earth and there are many of them;
\v 6 yet to us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we depend on him. And one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him.
