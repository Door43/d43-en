\v 4 So \add I will tell you\add* about eating meat that people have sacrificed to idols. We know that it is true, \add as you say\add*, that idols are not really alive. We also know that there is only one real God.
\v 5 It is true that there are gods whom people think live in the heavens or whom they think live on earth. Truly, there are many beings that \add people\add* call gods, and whom \add they\add* call lords.
\v 6 But for us \add believers\add* there is only one real God. He is \add our heavenly\add* Father who created everything. He is the one whom we \add worship and serve\add*. Also, for us believers Jesus Christ is the one and only Lord. He is the one whom \add God caused\add* to create everything. It is because of what he \add has done\add* that we have \add spiritual\add* life.

\v 4 The matter of eating food sacrified to idols concerns you because much of your food comes from temples of idolatry, where the food is prepared for sale. We begin with the priniciple that "idols in this world are nothing." We have no doubt that "there is only one God." So idols are not real gods, they are not living gods at all.
\v 5 There are many temples for idol worship everywhere, and people all over the world have names for many their gods. Those "so-called" gods and lords have names, and people address them and worship them as though the idols where alive and living in the heavens or on the earth. But we know there is only one God.  .
\v 6 Scripture says this clearly, 
\q "Yet for us there is one God, the Father,
\q1 from him are all things, and unto him we live, 
\q and one Lord, Jesus Christ, 
\q1 through him are all exist, and through him we live."

\v 4 So about eating food sacrificed to idols: we know that "an idol in this world is nothing," and that "there is no God but one."
\v 5 For though there are many so-called gods in heaven or on earth, just as there are many "gods and lords,"  
\v 6 
\q "Yet for us there is only one God the Father, 
\q1 from him are all things, and for whom we live, 
\q and one Lord Jesus Christ, 
\q1 through whom all things exist, and through whom we exist."
