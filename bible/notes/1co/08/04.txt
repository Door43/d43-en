\v 4 So \add I will tell you\add* about eating meat that people have sacrificed to idols. We know that it is true, \add as you say\add*, that idols are not really alive. We also know that there is only one real God.
\v 5 It is true that there are gods whom people think live in the heavens or whom they think live on earth. Truly, there are many beings that \add people\add* call gods, and whom \add they\add* call lords.
\v 6 But for us \add believers\add* there is only one real God. He is \add our heavenly\add* Father who created everything. He is the one whom we \add worship and serve\add*. Also, for us believers Jesus Christ is the one and only Lord. He is the one whom \add God caused\add* to create everything. It is because of what he \add has done\add* that we have \add spiritual\add* life.

\v 4 Now about eating food sacrificed to idols: Let us begin with this principle: just as some say, "Idols in this world do not actually exist," and, as Moses taught, "There is only one God." So idols are not real gods; they are not living gods at all.
\v 5 But I know that some people say that many gods and lords exist in the heavens or on the earth—after all, there are many supernatural beings who have real power.
\v 6 Yet even so, we say,
\q "There is one God, the Father,
\q1 from him come all things, and for him we live.
\q And there is only one Lord, Jesus Christ;
\q1 he made everything there is, and he is the one who gives us life."

\v 4 So about eating food sacrificed to idols: We know that "an idol in this world is nothing" and "that there is no God but one."
\v 5 For maybe so-called gods do exist, either in heaven or on earth, just as there are many "gods" and many "lords."
\p
\v 6 Yet for us,
\q "There is only one God the Father,
\q1 from him are all things, and for whom we live,
\q and one Lord Jesus Christ,
\q1 through whom all things exist, and through whom we exist."
