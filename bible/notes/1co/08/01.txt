====== 1 Corinthians 08:1-3 ======

<usfm>
\v 1 Now \add I will answer what you asked\add* about \add us believers\add* eating meat that has been sacrificed to idols. \add We know what some of you say, that God has enabled\add* all of us\add to\add* know \add the truth about things such as idols. But often we become\add* proud because we say that we know \add all those things\add*. But instead of being proud about what we know, we should show that we love \add our fellow believers by helping them to\add* become spiritually mature.
\v 2 Those who think that they thoroughly know something do not yet know it as they should.
\v 3 But as for those who love God, they know that they belong to him.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Now, about the question you asked regarding eating food that was offered to idols: We know that people say, "We all have knowledge." But if you think you know a lot, you can become very proud of yourself. If, however, when you love others, you help them grow strong in their faith.
\v 2 The truth is that if someone assumes he knows something, he has not yet learned the humbleness he needs to know.
\v 3 When you love God, God knows you.

\v 1 Now about food sacrificed to idols: We know that "we all have knowledge." Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.
\v 2 If anyone thinks he knows something, that person does not yet know as he should know.
\v 3 But if anyone loves God, that person is known by him.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul reminds the believers that though idols have no power, believers must be careful not to affect the weaker believers who might think they care about the idols. He tells believers to be careful with the liberty believers have in Christ.
  * **General Information:** - "We" means Paul and, though specifically writing to the Corinthian believers, includes all believers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])


  * **Now about** - Paul uses this phrase to move on to the next question the Corinthians had asked him.
  * **food sacrificed to idols** - Gentile worshipers would offer grain, fish, fowl, or meat, to their gods. The priest would burn a portion of it on the altar. Paul is speaking of the portion the priest would give back for the worshiper to eat or sell in the market.
  * **We know that "we all have knowledge."** - Paul is quoting a phrase that some Corinthians used. AT: "We all know, as you yourselves like to say, that 'we all have knowledge.'"
  * **Knowledge puffs up** - Paul speaks of what people know as if it were a person that can make another person larger than he should be. AT: "People who know much think that they are better than they really are" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **love builds up** - Paul speaks of love as if it were a person and helping people as if it were building a house. AT: "love truly helps people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **thinks he knows something** - "believes he knows everything about something"
  * **that person is known by him** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God knows that person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] )
