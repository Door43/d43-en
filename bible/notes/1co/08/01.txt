<usfm>
\v 1 Now \add I will answer what you asked\add* about \add us believers\add* eating meat that has been sacrificed to idols. \add We know what some of you say, that God has enabled\add* all of us\add to\add* know \add the truth about things such as idols. But often we become\add* proud because we say that we know \add all those things\add*. But instead of being proud about what we know, we should show that we love \add our fellow believers by helping them to\add* become spiritually mature.
\v 2 Those who think that they thoroughly know something do not yet know it as they should.
\v 3 But as for those who love God, they know that they belong to him.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Now, about the question you asked regarding eating food that was offered to idols: We know that people say, "We all have knowledge." But if you think you know a lot, you can become very proud of yourself. If, however, when you love others, you help them grow strong in their faith.
\v 2 The truth is that if someone thinks he knows something, he has not yet learned the things he needs to know.
\v 3 When you love God, God knows you.

\v 1 Now about food sacrificed to idols: We know that "we all have knowledge." Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.
\v 2 If anyone thinks he knows something, that person does not yet know as he should know.
\v 3 But if anyone loves God, that person is known by him.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Now about** - Paul uses this phrase to move to the next question that the Corinthians had asked him (see 7:1).
  * **food sacrificed to idols** - The pagan worshipers would offer grain, fish, fowl, or meat, to a god. The priests would burn a portion of it on the altar. Paul speaks about another portion, which would be returned to the worshiper or sold in the market.
  * **We know that "we all have knowledge"** - Perhaps Paul is quoting a phrase that some Corinthians used. Alternate meaning: "We all know, as you yourselves like to say, that 'we all have knowledge'".
  * **Knowledge puffs up -**  "Knowledge makes one proud" or "Knowledge makes one think more of themselves than they should"
  * **bold words** - explanation
  * **that person is known by him** - "God knows that person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]] )
