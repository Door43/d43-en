====== 1 Corinthians 08:7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 Nevertheless, some people do not understand \add that idols are not really alive\add*. In the past, some among you who are believers now were accustomed to believing that idols \add were really alive\add*. As a result, when they eat such meat \add now\add*, they still think that it was sacrificed to an idol \add that is alive\add*. They are not sure \add that God allows believers to eat meat that has been offered to idols\add*. So, \add when they eat such meat\add*, they think that they have sinned.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 But not everyone knows this. Some worshiped an idol in earlier times, and, now, if they eat food sacrificed to an idol, they worry that they are still worshiping a god. They are torn between two opinions, and they are weak in their faith in Christ, so they feel they are honoring an idol when they eat food that has been offered to it.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 However, this knowledge is not in everyone. Instead, some previously practiced idol worship, and they eat this food as if it were something sacrificed to an idol. Their conscience is thereby corrupted because it is weak.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Paul is speaking here of "weak" brothers, people who cannot separate food sacrificed to idols from the worship of those idols. If a Christian eats food that has been sacrificed to an idol, weak brothers might think that God will allow them to worship the idol by eating the food. Even if the eater has not worshiped the idol and is simply eating the food, he has still corrupted his weak brothers' conscience.

  * **everyone ... some** - "all people ... some people who are now Christians"
  * **corrupted** - "ruined" or "harmed"
