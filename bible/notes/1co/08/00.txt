====== 1 Corinthians 08 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 8:6, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.  

Chapters 8-10 form a single unit, answering the question: “Is it alright to eat meat that has been sacrificed to an idol?”

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

==Meat sacrificed to idols ==
Paul answers their question by saying that idols are not real gods and therefore there is nothing wrong with the meat. However someone who does not realize that may see you eating and be encouraged to eat as an act of worship to the idol.
