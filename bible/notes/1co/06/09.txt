\v 9 Surely you understand that God will never accept to rule over those who are wicked. Do not believe them when they tell you otherwise. The truth is that the sexually immoral, those who worship anything or anyone other than God, those who break their marriage vows, those who engage in perverse acts of so-called worship involving sex, and those who engage in the practice of homosexuality,
\v 10 those who steal, the ones who are greedy for more, those who get drunk, the ones tell lies about others, and those who steal from others who trust in them—God will never agree to rule over them.
\v 11 Some of you used to do these things. But God has made you clean from your sins, he has set you apart for himself, and he has made you right with himself. He has done all this through the power of the Lord Jesus Christ and the Spirit of our God.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not believe lies. The  sexually immoral, idolaters, adulterers, male prostitutes, those who practice homosexuality,
\v 10 thieves, the greedy, drunkards, slanderers, and swindlers—none of them will inherit the kingdom of God.
\v 11 And such were some of you. But you have been cleansed, but you have been made holy, but you have been made right with God in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.
