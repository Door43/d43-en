\v 9 Do you know understand that those who are unrighteous will never receive the inheritance of the kingdom of God? There are many who tell you who can enter the kingdom. Do not believe their lies. The truth is that the sexually immoral, those who worship anything or anyone other than God, those who break their marriage vows, those who engage in perverse acts of so-called worship of sex, and those who engage in the practice of homosexuality,
\v 10 those who steal, the ones who are greedy for more and hate it when others have more than they have, those who are enslaved to alcohol, the ones who tear others down and ruin lives with their cruel words, and those who use trust as a means to steal from those who are tricked by their schemes, all these and others like them will never inherit the kingdom of God.
\v 11 Those who did these things are the same as some you used to be. Some of you used to live this way. But God made you clean from your sins, and he  made you holy by his grace, and he reconciled himself to you and made you his own, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and you experience these gifts because he worked in you by the Spirit of our God.

\v 9 Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not believe lies. The  sexual immoral, idolaters, adulterers, male prostitutes, those who practice homosexuality.
\v 10 thieves, the greedy, drunkards, revilers, and swindlers will not inherit the kingdom of God.
\v 11 And such were some of you. But God washed you, God made you holy,  and God made you right with him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and by the Spirit of our God.
