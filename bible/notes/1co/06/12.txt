<usfm>
\v 12 \add Some of you may say\add*, "God allows us to do anything \add that he does not forbid\add*." But \add I would reply\add*, "\add That is true\add*, but not everything that God permits us to do helps us." \add Yes, as some of you say\add*, God permits us to do anything \add that he does not forbid\add*. But as for me, I will not let anything make me \add its slave; that is, I will not do anything that will gain control over me in such a way that I will not be able to stop doing it\add*.
\v 13 \add Some of you may also say\add*, "Food is just for \add us to put in\add* the stomach, and the stomach is just for \add us to put\add* food \add in\add*. And since God will do away with food and stomachs \add when he gives us our new bodies, what we do with our bodies sexually does not affect us anymore than eating food does." But what you have concluded is wrong, because\add* the Lord does not \add want us to use\add* our bodies to do sexually immoral things. Instead, the Lord \add wants us to use our bodies in ways that please him\add*. Also, the Lord \add wants us to do what is good\add* for our bodies.

\v 12 Some say this: "I am free to do anything I want, because I joined to Christ." Yes, but because something is permitted does not mean it is good for me. "I am free to do anything I want"—but I will not allow anything to become my master.
\v 13 People also say, "Food is made for a person to eat, and a person is made to eat food"—but God will soon do away with both food and people. Of course, these people are really talking about sex. However, God did not make our bodies so we could be sexually immoral. But the body is to serve the Lord, and the Lord will provide for the body.

\p
\v 12 "Everything is lawful for me"—but not everything is beneficial. "Everything is lawful for me"—but I will not be mastered by any of them.
\v 13 "Food is for the stomach, and the stomach is for food"—but God will do away with both of them. But the body is not intended for sexual immorality, but the body is for the Lord, and the Lord will provide for the body.
