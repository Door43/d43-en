====== 1 Corinthians 06:12-13 ======

<usfm>
\v 12 \add Some of you may say\add*, "God allows us to do anything \add that he does not forbid\add*." But \add I would reply\add*, "\add That is true\add*, but not everything that God permits us to do helps us." \add Yes, as some of you say\add*, God permits us to do anything \add that he does not forbid\add*. But as for me, I will not let anything make me \add its slave; that is, I will not do anything that will gain control over me in such a way that I will not be able to stop doing it\add*.
\v 13 \add Some of you may also say\add*, "Food is just for \add us to put in\add* the stomach, and the stomach is just for \add us to put\add* food \add in\add*. And since God will do away with food and stomachs \add when he gives us our new bodies, what we do with our bodies sexually does not affect us anymore than eating food does." But what you have concluded is wrong, because\add* the Lord does not \add want us to use\add* our bodies to do sexually immoral things. Instead, the Lord \add wants us to use our bodies in ways that please him\add*. Also, the Lord \add wants us to do what is good\add* for our bodies.

\v 12 "All things are permitted for me"--but because something is permitted does not mean it is good for me. "All things are permitted for me"--but I will not be imprisoned by any of them.
\v 13 "Food is made for the stomach, and the stomach is made for food"--but God will soon do away with them both. But we must be careful if we say that because the body is for sex, therefore it must be used for that purpose. The body is not made for the purpose of indulging in sexual immorality. Rather, the body is for serving the Lord and honoring him, and the Lord is for the body.

\v 12 "All things are lawful for me"--but not all things are beneficial. "All things are lawful for me"--but none of them control me. 
\v 13 "Food is for the stomach, and the stomach is for food"--but God will do away with both of them. But the body is not for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.
