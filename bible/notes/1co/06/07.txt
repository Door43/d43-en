\v 7 When you have any disputes between one another, it means that you have not done what you should have done. Allow a brother or sister to take advantage of you rather than you take them to court.
\v 8 Instead, you have wronged and cheated others, and the ones you cheated are your own brothers and sisters.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 The fact that there are any disputes at all between Christians is already a defeat for you. Why not rather suffer the wrong? Why not rather allow yourselves to be cheated?
\v 8 But you have wronged and cheated others, and these are your own brothers and sisters!
