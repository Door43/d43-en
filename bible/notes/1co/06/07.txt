\v 7 When you file law suits between one another it is already a defeat for you. Why not allow a brother or sister to take advantage of you, rather than parade the matter before an unbelieving judge? Why not rather be cheated, than to bring the matter to a civil court? The victory that could have been yours is lost to defeat when you sue one another.
\v 8 The real loss comes when you wrong and cheat each other, and you do this to your own brothers and sisters.

\v 7 The fact that there are any lawsuits at all between Christians is already a defeat for you. Why not rather suffer the wrong? Why not rather allow yourself to be cheated?
\v 8 But the greater wrong is that you wronged and cheated your own brothers and sisters!
