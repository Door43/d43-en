<usfm> \v 7 The fact that you have any lawsuits among you \add shows that\add* you have completely failed \add as Christians\add* \f + \ft Or: \add allowed Satan to\add* defeat you \f*. You should \add allow other believers\add* to wrong you \add without taking them to court!\add*\f + \ft Or: Why do you not \add allow other believers\add* to wrong you \add without taking them to court\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* You should not accuse them when \add they\add* cheat you!\f + \ft Or: Why do you accuse them when \add they\add* cheat you? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \v 8 But\add what is happening is that\add* some of you are cheating others and doing wrong to them. \add That is bad\add*. But you are doing that to fellow believers, \add and that is worse!\add* \p </usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 7 When you have any disputes between one another, it means that you have not done what you should have done. Allow a brother or sister to take advantage of you rather than you take them to court. \v 8 Instead, you have wronged and cheated others, and the ones you cheated are your own brothers and sisters.

\p </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 7 The fact that there are any disputes at all between Christians is already a defeat for you. Why not rather suffer the wrong? Why not rather allow yourselves to be cheated? \v 8 But you have wronged and cheated others, and these are your own brothers and sisters! </usfm>
