\v 4 Therefore, when you \add believers\add* have a dispute, you should certainly not choose as judges \add to decide your case\add* people whom the congregation cannot respect \add because those judges are not believers!\f + \ft Or: \add*why do you choose as judges \add to decide your case\add* people whom the congregation cannot respect \add because those judges are not believers\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 5 I am saying this to make you ashamed. Surely there is someone among you who is wise enough to judge disputes between believers!\f + \ft Or: Is there no one among you who is wise enough to judge disputes between believers? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 6 But instead, some believers \add among you\add* accuse other believers in a legal court. And what is worse, you let the cases be judged by unbelievers \f + \ft Or:unbelievers judge the cases \f*!

\v 4 And if you can settle matters that are important in this life, you should not find it necessary to hand off disputes between Christians to be settled by unbelievers.
\v 5 I say this to show how you have failed in this matter. There certainly must be someone in the church who is wise enough to settle these disputes when these sort of cases come up between Christian brothers and sisters.
\v 6 But instead, some believers among you accuse other believers in a civil court and you allow a judge who is an unbeliever to settle the matter!

\v 4 If then you have to make judgments that pertain to daily life, why do you lay such cases as these before those who have no standing in the church? 
\v 5 I say this to your shame. Is there not anyone among you wise enough to settle a dispute between brothers and sisters?
\v 6 But as it stands, one believer goes to court against another believer, and that case is placed before a judge who is an unbeliever!
