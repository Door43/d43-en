\v 14 God both raised the Lord and will also raise us up by his power.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **raised the Lord** - caused Jesus to be alive again
  * **Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ?** - The word translated as "members" refers to parts of a body. Our belonging to Christ is spoken of as if we were parts of his body. We belong to him so much that even our bodies belong to him. Paul uses this question to remind the people of something they should already know. AT: "You should know that your bodies belong to Christ" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Shall I then take away the members of Christ and join them to a prostitute? May it not be!** - Paul uses this question to emphasize how wrong it is for someone who belongs to Christ to go to a prostitute. AT: "I am part of Christ. I will not take my body and join myself to a prostitute!" or "We are parts of Christ's body. We must not take our bodies and join ourselves to prostitutes!"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **May it not be!** - "That should never happen!" or "We must never do that!"
