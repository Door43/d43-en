===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 \add Now another matter:\add* When any of you\add believers\add* accuses another believer about some matter, he takes that matter to judges who are not believers, \add for them to decide the case\add*, instead of asking God's people \add to decide it\add*. That is disgusting!\f + \ft Or: Why do you do that? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 2 \add I want\add* you to know that \add we who are\add* God's people will \add some day\add* judge those who are unbelievers.\f + \ft Or: Do you not know that \add we who are\add* God's people will \add some day\add* judge those who are unbelievers? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* So, since you will be judging unbelievers, you certainly are capable of judging between \add believers who disagree on\add* small matters!\f + \ft Or: are you not you capable of judging between \add believers who disagree on\add* small matters? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 3 You should keep in mind that we will even judge angels!\f + \ft Or: Do you not know that we will even judge angels? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* So we certainly should be able to judge about \add matters that relate to how we\add* conduct our lives here on earth!

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 When you have a dispute with another believer, you should not take that matter before a civil judge who is not a believer. Take the matter to fellow believers, whom God has set apart for himself.
\v 2 You should know that we who belong to God will judge the world. If you will judge the world one day, you should be able to settle matters that are less important.
\v 3 You should know that you will judge angels! Certainly you are able to judge matters in this life.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\c 6
\p
\v 1 When one of you has a dispute with another, does he dare to go to the civil court before an unbelieving judge, rather than before the saints?
\v 2 Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if you will judge the world, are you not able to settle unimportant matters?
\v 3 Do you not know that we will judge the angels? How much more, then, can we not judge matters of this life?

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **dispute** - AT: "disagreement" or "argument"
  * **civil court** - where a local, government judge considers cases and decides who is right
  * **does he dare to go to the civil court before an unbelieving judge rather than before the saints?** - Paul says that Christians must resolve disagreements among themselves. AT: "Do not bring your accusations against a fellow believer before an unbelieving judge. Fellow believers must resolve their disagreements among themselves." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Do you not know that the saints will judge the world?** - Note that the UDC and TFT emphasize the future aspect of this judging, that Paul is not speaking of such judgment in the current days, which is reserved to God (see 5:13: "some day" and "one day").   (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **if you will judge the world, are you not able to settle unimportant matters?** - Paul said that they will be given the responsibility and ability to judge the entire world in the future, so they should be able to judge lesser disputes among themselves now. AT: "You will judge the world in the future, so you can settle this matter now." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]).
  * **Do you not know that we will judge angels?** - "You know that we will judge angels." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **matters**  - "disputes" or "disagreements"
  * **How much more, then, can we not judge matters of this life?** - AT: "Because we will be given the responsibility and ability to judge the angels, we can certainly judge matters in this life." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **we** - Paul has been talking about himself as "I" and the Corinthians as "you".  Here he combines them into "we". (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
