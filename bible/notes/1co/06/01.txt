\v 1 \add Now another matter:\add* When any of you\add believers\add* accuses another believer about some matter, he takes that matter to judges who are not believers, \add for them to decide the case\add*, instead of asking God's people \add to decide it\add*. That is disgusting!\f + \ft Or: Why do you do that? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 2 \add I want\add* you to know that \add we who are\add* God's people will \add some day\add* judge those who are unbelievers.\f + \ft Or: Do you not know that \add we who are\add* God's people will \add some day\add* judge those who are unbelievers? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* So, since you will be judging unbelievers, you certainly are capable of judging between \add believers who disagree on\add* small matters!\f + \ft Or: are you not you capable of judging between \add believers who disagree on\add* small matters? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 3 You should keep in mind that we will even judge angels!\f + \ft Or: Do you not know that we will even judge angels? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* So we certainly should be able to judge about \add matters that relate to how we\add* conduct our lives here on earth!

\v 1 When you have a dispute with another believer, you should not have the audacity to take that matter before a civil judge who is not a believer. Take the matter to fellow believers, whom God has set apart for himself.
\v 2 You should know that we who belong to God will judge the world. If you will judge the world one day, you should be able to settle matters that are less important.
\v 3 You should know that you will judge angels! Certainly you are able to judge matters in this life.

\c 6
\p
\v 1 When one of you has a dispute with another, does he dare to go to the civil court before an unbelieving judge, rather than before the believers?
\v 2 Do you not know that the believers will judge the world? If then, you will judge the world, are you not able to settle matters of little importance?
\v 3 Do you not know that we will judge the angels? How much more, then, can we judge matters of this life?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul then explains how believers are to settle disagreements with other believers.

  * **dispute** - "disagreement" or "argument"
  * **does he dare to go ... believers?** - Paul is emphasizing that Christians must resolve disagreements among themselves. AT: "he should not dare to go ... believers!" or "he should be fear God and not go ... believers!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **civil court** - where a local government judge considers cases and decides who is right
  * **Do you not know that the believers will judge the world?** - Paul is shaming the Corinthians for acting like they do not know. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **If then, you will judge the world, are you not able to settle matters of little importance?** - Because they will be given greater responsibility later, they should be responsible for lesser things now. AT: "you will judge the world in the future, so you should be able to settle this matter now." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]).
  * **matters** - "disputes" or "disagreements"
  * **Do you not know that we will judge the angels?** - Paul is surprised that they do not seem to know. AT: "You know that we will judge the angels." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **we** - Paul includes himself and the Corinthians. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
  * **How much more, then, can we judge matters of this life?** - Because they will be given greater responsibility later, they should be responsible for lesser things now. AT: "Because we know we will judge the angels, we can also be sure that God will enable us to judge matters in this life." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
