\v 1 \add Now another matter:\add* When any of you\add believers\add* accuses another believer about some matter, he takes that matter to judges who are not believers, \add for them to decide the case\add*, instead of asking God's people \add to decide it\add*. That is disgusting!\f + \ft Or: Why do you do that? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 2 \add I want\add* you to know that \add we who are\add* God's people will \add some day\add* judge those who are unbelievers.\f + \ft Or: Do you not know that \add we who are\add* God's people will \add some day\add* judge those who are unbelievers? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* So, since you will be judging unbelievers, you certainly are capable of judging between \add believers who disagree on\add* small matters!\f + \ft Or: are you not you capable of judging between \add believers who disagree on\add* small matters? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 3 You should keep in mind that we will even judge angels!\f + \ft Or: Do you not know that we will even judge angels? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* So we certainly should be able to judge about \add matters that relate to how we\add* conduct our lives here on earth!

\v 1 When you have a dispute with another believer, you should not take that matter before a civil judge who is not a believer. Take the matter to fellow believers, whom God has set apart for himself.
\v 2 You should know that we who belong to God will judge the world. If you will judge the world one day, you should be able to settle matters that are less important.
\v 3 You should know that you will judge angels! Certainly you are able to judge matters in this life.

\c 6
\p
\v 1 When one of you has a dispute with another, does he dare to go to the civil court before an unbelieving judge, rather than before the saints?
\v 2 Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if you will judge the world, are you not able to settle unimportant matters?
\v 3 Do you not know that we will judge the angels? How much more, then, can we not judge matters of this life?
