=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Tongues ==

The gift of tongues is described as an inferior gift because it primarily serves an individual or a few people within the church and not the church as a whole. It is also very important that this gift is used in the proper way. Tongue is also described as a gift for unbelievers. The exact importance of this phrase is debated among scholars. 


== Prophecy ==

Prophecy is described as a superior gift because it can be used in service of the entire church, while some gifts are primarily helpful to an individual. Prophecy is described as a gift for believers. The exact importance of this phrase is debated among scholars. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet|Prophecy]])
