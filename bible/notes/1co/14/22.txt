\v 22 If we speak in languages \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that we have not learned\add*, unbelievers \add who are there will realize that the Spirit of God is truly among us\add*. That will warn them \add that they need to fear God\add*. But believers do not \add need such a warning\add*.
\v 23 Suppose during the worship service everyone started to speak in languages \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that they have not learned\add*. If unbelievers or people who do not know \add about the abilities that God's Spirit gives to believers\add* come in \add and hear that\add*, they will surely think that you are crazy.\f + \ft Or: will they not think that you are crazy? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 22 So if a believer speaks in a language that God has given him, this impresses the unbelievers who might be listening. But if a believer speaks a message from God, this impresses the other believers.
\v 23 You can seen how confusing it would be if all the believers met together and spoke in different languages. Any unbeliever who heard them would call them all crazy.

\v 22 Therefore tongues are a sign, not to believers, but to unbelievers. But prophesying is for a sign, not for unbelievers, but for believers.
\v 23 If, therefore, the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues, and outsiders and unbelievers come in, would they not say that you are insane?
