\v 17 You may be thanking God very well, but you are not helping them.
\v 18 I thank God that I speak in languages \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that I have not learned\add* more than any of you do.
\v 19 But during a worship service, \add in order that others will understand what I am saying\add*, I would prefer to speak five words using my mind, in order that I may teach others, rather than to speak ten thousand words in a language \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that is not understood by the congregation\add*.

\v 17 For if you give thanks in your spirit, that is well and good for you, but you are not helping the other believers.
\v 18 I thank God that I speak in tongues more than any of you do.
\v 19 But to the church I would rather speak five words with my mind, words with which I can teach others, than say ten thousand words in a language that God gives me.
