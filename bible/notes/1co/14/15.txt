\v 15 So I will tell you \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* what we should do. \add At times\add* we may pray, \add using\add* only our spirits, \add in languages we have not learned. And at other times\add* we should pray using our minds, \add thinking about the words that we are praying. Similarly\add*, at times we may sing using only our spirits, using languages that we have not learned, and at other times we should sing using our minds, \add thinking about the words that we are singing\add*.
\v 16 Suppose that any one of you praises God \f + \ft Or: thanks God for what he has done \f*, using only your\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* spirit \add and not using your mind\add*. Maybe some people \add will be present who\add* do not know about \add the abilities that God's Spirit gives to believers\add*. Because they do not know what you are saying, after you thank God, they will not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* know when to say "Amen!\f + \ft Or: I \f* agree!"

\v 15 Therefore, we should pray with our spirit, but also pray with our mind. And it is the same if we sing praise to God.
\v 16 If you insist on praising God only in your spirit, the outsider will never understand what you are saying, and will never be able to agree with the message.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 What am I to do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind. I will sing with my spirit, and I will also sing with my mind.
\v 16 Otherwise, if you praise God with the spirit, how will the outsider say "Amen" when you are giving thanks, if he does not know what you are saying?
