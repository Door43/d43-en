====== 1 Corinthians 14:5-6 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 I would like you all to have the ability to speak in languages \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add you have not learned\add*. But I would like even more for you to have the ability to speak messages that come directly from God. If people speak messages in a language that they have not learned, if there is no one there who can explain the meaning, that situation is not as helpful to the congregation as speaking messages that come directly from God \add in the language that the congregation knows\add*.
\p
\v 6 My fellow believers, suppose that I came to you and spoke to you in a language that none of you knows \add and I did not explain the meaning of what I told you\add*. Even if I told you something that God had revealed to me, or told you some message that had come directly from him, or taught you something that you needed to know, that certainly would not help you!\f + \ft Or: how would that help you? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Now I wish that all of you spoke in such languages, but it would be far better for the entire church if more and more of you had the gift of speaking God's messages. Anyone who speaks messages from God is helping to stregthen his fellow believers. For this reason, he is doing work that is more important than those who proclaim messages in various other languagesâ€”unless someone is able to interpret those messages.
\p
\v 6 If I come to you and am only speaking in languages given by the Spirit, how can that help you? That cannot help you unless I speak to you and help you know matters that were hidden from you, or unless I help you understand facts you did not know, or unless I proclaim to you some message you did not hear before, or unless I teach you some rule that you had never learned before.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Now I wish that you all spoke in tongues, but even more than that, I wish that you would prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues (unless someone interprets), so that the church may be built up.
\v 6 But now, brothers and sisters, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you, unless I speak to you with revelation, or knowledge, or prophecy, or teaching?
