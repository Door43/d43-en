====== 1 Corinthians 14:5-6 ======

\v 5 I would like you all to have the ability to speak in languages \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add you have not learned\add*. But I would like even more for you to have the ability to speak messages that come directly from God. If people speak messages in a language that they have not learned, if there is no one there who can explain the meaning, that situation is not as helpful to the congregation as speaking messages that come directly from God \add in the language that the congregation knows\add*.
\p
\v 6 My fellow believers, suppose that I came to you and spoke to you in a language that none of you knows \add and I did not explain the meaning of what I told you\add*. Even if I told you something that God had revealed to me, or told you some message that had come directly from him, or taught you something that you needed to know, that certainly would not help you!\f + \ft Or: how would that help you? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 5 Now I wish that all of you spoke in tongues, that spiritual language given by the Spirit; but it is far better for the entire church, if more and more of you had the gift of prophecy to explain the riches of God's word to his people.
\p
\v 6 If I come to you, and am only speaking tongues, just in a spiritual language as the Spirit gives me, it could not help you, unless there were a true interpretation into something you could understand. But if I teach  you what has been hidden, or give you a lesson filled with information that you need to know about God and his purposes, or even just a simple proclamation of the word of God that gives you a lesson to build up your faith, it will benefit you much more.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Now I wish that you all spoke in tongues, but even more than that, I wish that you would prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues (unless someone interprets), so that the church may be built up.
\v 6 But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you, unless I speak to you with revelation, or knowledge, or prophecy, or teaching?
