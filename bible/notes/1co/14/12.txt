====== 1 Corinthians 14:12-14 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 So \add I say this to\add* you: Because you are eager to have the abilities that God's Spirit gives, earnestly desire those abilities that will do the most to help \add all the believers in\add* the congregation.
\p
\v 13 So, those who have the ability to speak in languages \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that they have not learned\add* should pray that \add God will give them the ability to\add* explain the meaning of what they say.
\v 14 If they pray in a language \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that they have not learned\add*, their spirits are praying, but they are not using their minds.

===== UDB: =====

\v 12 It is important that people understand what you are saying. You are eager to see the Spirit of God working in and through you, giving you gifts that can be seen by others. In all this keep focused on those actions and works that build up the church. 
\p
\v 13 In that regard, make sure that those who hear what you say are given the meaning of the message. Make sure you interpret the message for them, so they understand it. Just like you would interpret a language to a foreigner, so he could understand in his own language what you said to him.
\v 14 Some things we do in our life with God cannot be translated into meaningful messages for other people.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 Likewise with you: since you are eager for the manifestations of the Spirit, be zealous to excel in building up the church.
\v 13 So the one who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret.
\v 14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.
