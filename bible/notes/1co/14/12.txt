====== 1 Corinthians 14:12-14 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 So \add I say this to\add* you: Because you are eager to have the abilities that God's Spirit gives, earnestly desire those abilities that will do the most to help \add all the believers in\add* the congregation.
\p
\v 13 So, those who have the ability to speak in languages \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that they have not learned\add* should pray that \add God will give them the ability to\add* explain the meaning of what they say.
\v 14 If they pray in a language \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that they have not learned\add*, their spirits are praying, but they are not using their minds.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 So because you want very much for the Spirit to work in you, try to help the believers in the church to trust Christ and obey him.
\p
\v 13 For that reason, pray that God will enable you to interpret what you say in a language that God has given you.
\v 14 If anyone prays in such a language, his spirit certainly prays, but his mind does not.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 So it is with you. Since you are eager for the manifestations of the Spirit, try to excel in the gifts that build up the church.
\v 13 So the one who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret.
\v 14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the manifestations of the Spirit** - "being able to do things that show that the Spirit controls you"
  * **try to excel in the gifts that build up the church** - Paul speaks of the church as if it were a house that one could build and of the work of building the church as if it were something one could harvest. AT: "to succeed greatly in making God's people more able to serve God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **interpret** - This means to tell what someone has said in a language to others who do not understand that language. See how this is translated in [[:en:bible:notes:1co:02:12|2:13]].
  * **my mind is unfruitful** - The mind not understanding what is being prayed and, therefore, receiving no benefit from the prayer is spoken of as if the "mind is unfruitful." AT: "I do not understand it in my mind" or "my mind does not benefit from the prayer, because I do not understand the words I am saying" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
