\v 31 For each of those who proclaim the messages of God should do so. But they must do so one by one, in order, so that all the believers can learn and receive courage to love God better.
\v 32 For those who truly speak God's messages control the spirit in which they do so.
\v 33 For God does not create confusion; instead, he makes peace.
