\v 31 You can all, one by one, speak messages that have come directly from God, in order that you can teach others and all be encouraged \f + \ft Or:encourage everyone \f*.
\v 32 Those who speak messages that come directly from God are in control of their own spirits, \add so they can wait for their turn to speak\add*.
\v 33 Remember that God does not desire that things be done in a disorderly way\add during your worship services\add*. Instead, he desires that everything be done in an orderly way.
\p Just like it happens in all the other congregations of believers,

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 31 For each of those who proclaim the messages of God should do so. But they must do so one by one, in order, so that all the believers can learn and receive courage to love God better.
\v 32 For those who truly speak God's messages control the spirit in which they do so.
\v 33 For God does not create confusion; instead, he makes peace.


\p This is what we do in all the churches of those whom God has set apart for himself:

\v 32 For the spirits of the prophets are under the control of the prophets.
