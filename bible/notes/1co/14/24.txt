===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 24 But if an unbeliever or someone who does not know \add about those abilities\add* comes in while all of you believers are \add one by one\add* speaking messages that come directly from God, everything that you \add say\add* will show that person that he is a sinner and that \add God\add* will punish him \add if he does not turn from his sinful behavior\add*.
\v 25 He will realize that \add God knows the evil things that he has done that\add* other people do not know. Then he will kneel down and worship God and say, "God is truly among you!"

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 24 But if you were all taking turns speaking true messages from God, any unbeliever would realize that he was guilty of sinning against God.
\v 25 God would tell the others there what this unbeliever was truly thinking. He would fall down with his face to the ground in wonder and fright, and he would praise God and say that God is truly with you.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 24 But if you all were prophesying and an unbeliever or an outsider came in, he would be convicted by all he hears, he would be judged by all that is said,
\v 25 and the secrets of his heart would be revealed so that, falling on his face, he would worship God and declare that God is really among you.
