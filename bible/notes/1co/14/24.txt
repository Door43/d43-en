===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 24 But if you were all taking turns speaking true messages from God, any unbeliever would realize that he was guilty of sinning against God.
\v 25 God would tell the others there what this unbeliever was truly thinking. He would fall down with his face to the ground in wonder and fright, and he would praise God and say that God is truly with you.

\v 24 But if you all were prophesying and an unbeliever or an outsider came in, he would be convicted by all he hears, he would be judged by all that is said,
\v 25 and the secrets of his heart would be revealed so that, falling on his face, he would worship God and declare that God is really among you.
