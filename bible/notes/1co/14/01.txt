====== 1 Corinthians 14:1-4 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 You must want to love others more \add than you want anything else\add*. But you should \add also\add* eagerly desire the abilities that \add God's\add* Spirit \add gives to believers\add*. And you should desire most of all to have the ability to speak messages that come directly from God \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 2-3 \add I say that\add* because those who speak messages that come directly from God \add are speaking in languages that they and the other believers in the congregation know, and thus\add* they are able to strengthen them \add spiritually\add* and to encourage and comfort them. But those who speak in languages \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that they have not learned\add* are not speaking to people. Instead, they are \add only\add* speaking to God. No one understands them. By \add the power\f + \ft Or: guidance \f* of God's\add* Spirit \f + \ft Or: From within \add their own\add* spirit \f* they speak things that others do not know.
\v 4 Those who speak in languages \add that they have not learned\add* are receiving a blessing for themselves, but those who speak messages that come directly from God are giving a blessing to \add all the believers in\add* the congregation \add because they are speaking in a language that the congregation knows\add*.

\v 1 You must ask God earnestly to enable you to love others. Ask him also to enable you to strengthen your fellow believers with gifts that the Spirit will give you; ask him especially to make you able to proclaim his messages that he gives you to say.
\v 2 When a person speaks in a language given by the Spirit, he is not speaking to people, because no one can understand him, but he is speaking to God. He is saying things to him as the Spirit leads him.
\v 3 On the other hand, the prophet who proclaims the messages from God speaks directly to people. He does this in order to help them by making them stronger, to help them be unshakable, and to give them comfort so they can be happy even in hardship.
\v 4 A person who speaks  in a language given by the Spirit builds himself up and gives himself help, but a person who proclaims the messages of God builds up everyone and helps everyone in the church to be stronger in their faith.

\c 14
\p
\v 1 Pursue love and be zealous for spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy.
\v 2 For the one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to God, for no one understands him because he speaks hidden things in the Spirit.
\v 3 But the one who prophesies, speaks to people to build them up, to encourage them, and to comfort them. 
\v 4 The one who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but the one who prophesies builds up the church.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **pursue love** - "follow after love" or "follow the way of love"
  * **especially that you may prophesy** - Paul continues to make an argument for why prophesy is better than one who speaks in tongues to God.
