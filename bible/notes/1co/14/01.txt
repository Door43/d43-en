\v 1 You must want to love others more \add than you want anything else\add*. But you should \add also\add* eagerly desire the abilities that \add God's\add* Spirit \add gives to believers\add*. And you should desire most of all to have the ability to speak messages that come directly from God \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 2-3 \add I say that\add* because those who speak messages that come directly from God \add are speaking in languages that they and the other believers in the congregation know, and thus\add* they are able to strengthen them \add spiritually\add* and to encourage and comfort them. But those who speak in languages \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that they have not learned\add* are not speaking to people. Instead, they are \add only\add* speaking to God. No one understands them. By \add the power\f + \ft Or: guidance \f* of God's\add* Spirit \f + \ft Or: From within \add their own\add* spirit \f* they speak things that others do not know.
\v 4 Those who speak in languages \add that they have not learned\add* are receiving a blessing for themselves, but those who speak messages that come directly from God are giving a blessing to \add all the believers in\add* the congregation \add because they are speaking in a language that the congregation knows\add*.

\p
\v 1 Follow after love; yet earnestly desire spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy.
\v 2 For he that speaks in another language does not speak to men, but to God; for no man understands hmi because when he speaks in the spirit, he speaks mysteries.
\v 3 But he that prophesies speaks to men that which edifies, and encourages, and consoles.
\v 4 He that speaks in another language edifies himself; but he that prophesies edifies the church.
