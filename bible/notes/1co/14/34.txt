<usfm>
\p As in all the churches of the saints,
\v 34 let the women keep silent in the churches. For it is not permitted for them to speak; but let them be in subjection, as  the law says.
\v 35 And if they would learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in the church.
\v 36 What? was it from you that the word of God went forth? Or did it come to you alone?
