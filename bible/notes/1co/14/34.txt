\v 34 Women should keep silent in church for they are not permitted to speak. They must not interrupt the one who is speaking God's message, but they should always obey their husbands, as also the law says.
\v 35 When women want to learn, instead of interrupting the worship, they should speak with their husbands at home. It dishonors her husband for a woman to interrupt the service.
\v 36 Were you the people by whom God gave us his word? Or are you the only ones to whom it came?

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p 
This is the rule in all the churches of the believers.
\v 34 The women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak. Instead, they should be in submission, as also the law says.
\v 35 If there is anything they desire to learn, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.
\v 36 Did the word of God come from you? Are you the only ones it has reached?
