\v 34 let the women keep silent in church, they are not permitted to speak. They must not interrupt the one who is prophesying, but they should be in submission to their husbands, as also the law says.
\v 35 When women are trying to learn, instead of interrupting the worship, they should speak with their husbands at home. It is dishonoring of her husband for a woman to interrrupt the service, as also the law says.
\v 36 Where you the channel by whom God gave us his word? Or are you the only ones to whom it came?
