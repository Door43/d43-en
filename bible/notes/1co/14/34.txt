\v 34 the women should not be permitted \f + \ft Or:do not permit the women \f* \add to interrupt the meeting by\add* asking \add questions\add*. They must keep quiet. They must be subject \add to their husbands\add*. What Moses wrote \f + \ft personification \f* \add about how God created the first two people\add* suggests \add that the women should do that\add*.
\v 35 If they want to know \add more\add* about something \add that a speaker said\add*, they should ask their husbands when they get home, for it is disgraceful for women to \add interrupt a service by\add* asking \add such questions\add*.
\v 36 \add If you do not agree with these things that I have been telling you\add*, remember that \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* the message from God did not first come from you \add people in Corinth\add*. Also, you are not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* the only ones who have heard it! \add Many others have heard it and accepted it, so you should act as the believers in other places act\add*.

\v 34 let the women keep silent in church; they are not permitted to speak. They must not interrupt the one who is speaking God's message, but they should always obey their husbands, as also the Law says.
\v 35 When women want to learn, instead of interrupting the worship, they should speak with their husbands at home. It dishonors her husband for a woman to interrupt the service.
\v 36 Were you the people by whom God gave us his word? Or are you the only ones to whom it came?
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p As in all the churches of the saints,
\v 34 the women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but they should be in submission, as also the Law says.
\v 35 If there is anything they desire to learn, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.
\v 36 Did the word of God come from you? Are you the only ones it has reached?

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **keep silent** - Possible meanings are 1) stop speaking, 2) stop speaking when someone is prophesying, or 3) be absolutely silent during the church service.
    * **Did the word of God come from you? Are you the only ones it has reached?** - Paul emphasizes that the Corinthians are not the only ones who understand what God wants Christians to do. AT: "The word of God did not come from you in Corinth; you are not the only people who understand God's will." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **come from you** - The word "you" is plural and refers to the Corinthian believers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
