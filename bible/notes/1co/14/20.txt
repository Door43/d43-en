<usfm>
\v 20 My fellow believers, stop being like little children in the way that you think \add about these abilities that God's Spirit gives\add*. Instead, think about them in a mature way. If you really want to be like little children, do as few wicked things as babies do!
\v 21 \add When the Jews long ago refused to obey God, he warned them about what would happen when he allowed their enemies to punish them\add*. In the Scriptures it is written \f + \ft Or:\add the prophet Isaiah\add* wrote \f* what the Lord \add God\add* said \add about that\add*,
\q \add They didn't listen to prophets speaking their own language, so I will send\add* people from foreign \add lands to attack\add* my people.
\q Those foreigners will speak languages that my people do not know \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\q \add In that way\add*, I will warn my people,
\q but they will still not pay attention to what I say.

\v 20 Brothers and sisters, you should think like adults. But when you think about evil things, you should think like small children. Your thinking should be sensible.
\v 21 In the law it is written that God says,
\q "I will speak to my people Israel
\q by foreigners, men who speak in strange languages;
\q but my people will still not understand me."

\v 20 Brothers, do not be children in your thinking. Rather, in regard to evil, be like infants. But in your thinking be mature.
\v 21 In the law it is written,
\q "By men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers
\q1 I will speak to this people.
\q Even then they will not hear me,"
\m says the Lord.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Paul tells them that speaking in different languages was told ahead of time by the prophet Isaiah many years before this speaking in other languages happened at the start of Christ's church.

  * **do not be children in your thinking** - Here "children" is a metaphor for being spiritually immature. AT: "do not think like children" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **In the law it is written,** - This can be stated in active form: AT: "The prophet wrote these words in the law:" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **By men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and are used together for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
