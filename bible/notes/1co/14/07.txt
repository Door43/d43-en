\v 7 \add It is like\add* lifeless \add musical instruments\add*, like flutes and harps for example. When they are played, if the notes are not played \f + \ft Or:if \add those playing those instruments\add* do not play the notes \f* clearly, no one will know what tune is being played \f + \ft Or:what tune they are playing \f*.\f + \ft Or: how will anyone know what tune is being played ( Or:what tune they are playing )? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 8 If someone playing the trumpet \add wants to signal that the soldiers should prepare to fight a battle\add*, \add the soldiers\add* certainly will not get ready if \add the call to battle\add* is not played \f + \ft Or:he does not play \add the call to battle\add* \f* clearly.\f + \ft Or: how will \add the soldiers\add* get ready if \add the call to battle\add* is not played \f + \ft Or:he does not play \add the call to battle\add* \f* clearly? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 9 It is the same with you! If you do not speak words that other people can understand, no one will know what you are saying.\f + \ft Or: how will anyone know what you are saying? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add It will be as though\add* you are just speaking to the air!

\v 7 If someone is playing the flute or harp (they are not living things), and if the notes on the flute or harp sounded no different from each other, no one would be able to tell which tune I was playing.
\v 8 And if a soldier blew the trumpet poorly, the army would not know whether to get ready for battle.
\v 9 This is what it is like when you say words that no one can understand: No one will know what you have said.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 If lifeless instruments are producing sounds—like the flute or the harp—and they do not produce different tones, how will anyone know what tune the flute or harp is playing?
\v 8 For if the trumpet is played with an uncertain sound, how will anyone know when it is time to prepare for battle?
\v 9 So it is with you. If you utter speech that is unintelligible, how will anyone understand what you have said? You will be speaking, and no one will understand you.
