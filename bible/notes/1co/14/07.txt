\v 7 \add It is like\add* lifeless \add musical instruments\add*, like flutes and harps for example. When they are played, if the notes are not played \f + \ft Or:if \add those playing those instruments\add* do not play the notes \f* clearly, no one will know what tune is being played \f + \ft Or:what tune they are playing \f*.\f + \ft Or: how will anyone know what tune is being played ( Or:what tune they are playing )? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 8 If someone playing the trumpet \add wants to signal that the soldiers should prepare to fight a battle\add*, \add the soldiers\add* certainly will not get ready if \add the call to battle\add* is not played \f + \ft Or:he does not play \add the call to battle\add* \f* clearly.\f + \ft Or: how will \add the soldiers\add* get ready if \add the call to battle\add* is not played \f + \ft Or:he does not play \add the call to battle\add* \f* clearly? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 9 It is the same with you! If you do not speak words that other people can understand, no one will know what you are saying.\f + \ft Or: how will anyone know what you are saying? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add It will be as though\add* you are just speaking to the air!

\v 7 If the flute or the harp are played--lifeless instruments they are--and if each one has no distinctive sounds, where one is not different from the other, how could anyone know which instrument is being played?
\v 8 If a trumpet is played poorly, and if what was sounded out by the trumpet player was unlike the trumpet call the army had been trained to listening for, the poor sound played badly on the trumpet might keep the army from preparing for battle.
\v 9 This is what it is like when you give a message that is unintellible to those who are listening. How can anyone understand when what you say makes no sense to them? Like the trumpet being played poorly, you can speak all you wish, but no one can understand you or know what to how to apply your message to their lives.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 If likewise lifeless instruments like the flute or the harp do not make sounds that are distinctive, how will anyone know which instrument is being blown or strummed?
\v 8 For if the trumpet is played with an uncertain sound, how will anyone know when it is time to prepare for battle?
\v 9 So it is with you: if you utter speech that is unintelligible, how will anyone understand what you have said? You will be speaking, and no one will understand you.
