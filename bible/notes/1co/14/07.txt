\v 7 How will anyone know the difference between lifeless things such as the sound of a pipe or harp if they all sound the same?
\v 8 For if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself for war?
\v 9 So unless your speech is easy to be understood, how shall it be known what you have spoken? For you will be speaking into the air.
