\v 26 So, my fellow believers, I will tell you \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* what I think that you should be doing. When you come together \add to worship God\add*, some of you may have a hymn to sing. Others may have something to teach \add the congregation\add*. Others may have \add something to say that God has\add* revealed to them. Others may give messages in languages \add that they have not learned\add*. Others will explain the meaning of those messages. Make sure that all of these things that you do will make the congregation become more mature spiritually.
\v 27 \add It is all right\add* if two people, or at the most three people, speak in languages \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that they have not learned\add*. But they must speak one at a time, and someone must explain the meaning of what the others have said.
\v 28 If \add those who want to speak in a language that they have not learned realize that\add* there is no one \add there\add* who will be able to explain the meaning \add of what they will say\add*, they should not speak in that language during the meeting. Instead, they should speak to God by themselves, \add somewhere else\add*.

\v 26 Brothers and sisters, it should be this way when you worship God together. Each of you should come with a psalm to sing, or something to teach from the scriptures, or something that God has told you, or with a message in a language that God has given, or with an interpretation of such a message. Everything you do together should encourage each other, for you are Christ's church.
\v 27 If there are any who wish to speak a message in a language from the Spirit, there should be no more than two or three such persons. They should speak one at a time, and someone should interpret the messages.
\v 28 However, if there is no one able to interpret those messages, then those who speak in languages from the Spirit should keep silent and speak only to God.

\v 26 What is next then, brothers? When you come together, each one has a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. Do everything so that you build up the church.
\v 27 If anyone speaks in a tongue, let there be two or at most three, and each one in turn, then someone should interpret what is said.
\v 28 But if there is no one to interpret, let each of them keep silent in the church. Let each one speak to himself alone and to God.

  * **interpret what is said** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "interpret what they said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
