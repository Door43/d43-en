\v 26 So, my fellow believers, I will tell you \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* what I think that you should be doing. When you come together \add to worship God\add*, some of you may have a hymn to sing. Others may have something to teach \add the congregation\add*. Others may have \add something to say that God has\add* revealed to them. Others may give messages in languages \add that they have not learned\add*. Others will explain the meaning of those messages. Make sure that all of these things that you do will make the congregation become more mature spiritually.
\v 27 \add It is all right\add* if two people, or at the most three people, speak in languages \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that they have not learned\add*. But they must speak one at a time, and someone must explain the meaning of what the others have said.
\v 28 If \add those who want to speak in a language that they have not learned realize that\add* there is no one \add there\add* who will be able to explain the meaning \add of what they will say\add*, they should not speak in that language during the meeting. Instead, they should speak to God by themselves, \add somewhere else\add*.

\v 26 What is it then, brothers? When you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has another language, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to edify.
\v 27 If any man speaks in another language, let it be by two, or at the most three, and do it in turn; and let one interpret.
\v 28 But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.
