\v 7 God makes it possible for each believer to show that he has some of the Spirit's power; God does this in order to help all believers together to trust him and honor him more.
\v 8 For the Spirit makes one person able to speak a message with great wisdom from God, and he makes another person able to pass on to others some knowledge from God. These different gifts come through the work of the same Spirit in each one who believes in Christ.
