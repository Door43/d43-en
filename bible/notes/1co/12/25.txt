\v 26 If one part of our body hurts, \add it is as though\add* all the parts of our body are hurting. If we pay special attention to one part of our body, \add it is as though\add* all the parts of our body feel pleasure \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\p
\v 27 \add Everything I have just said about how the parts of our bodies relate to each other applies to how\add* all of you who belong to Christ \add should relate to each other\add*. Each of you belongs to him, \add but you have not all been given the same abilities and work\add*.

<usfm>
\v 25 God honors the entire body in this way so there is no division in the church, and that members of the body of Christ might care for every member of the body with the same affection, no matter what their purpose or role, gifting or abililties.
\v 26 Because we are one body, when one member suffers, we all suffer. When one member is given honor for something they accomplished for Christ, the entire body rejoices together.
\p
\v 27 Now you are the body of Christ, and individually, you are all members of it.
</usfm>

\v 27 Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it.
