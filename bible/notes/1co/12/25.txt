\v 25 The purpose is that there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.
\v 26 And when one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or when one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.
\v 27 Now you are the body of Christ, and individually members of it.
