====== 1 Corinthians 12 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

== Gifts of the Holy Spirit ==

This chapter begins a new section. Chapters 12-14 discuss the use of the spiritual gifts within the church. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== The Church, the body of Christ == 

This is an important metaphor in Scripture. The Church has many different parts, each with different functions. They combine to make one church. All of the different parts are necessary. Each part is to have concern for all the other parts, even those that seem less important. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "No one can say, 'Jesus is Lord,' except by the Holy Spirit." ==
In reading the Old Testament, the Jews would have substituted the word "Lord" for the word "Yahweh." This probably means that no one can say that Jesus is Yahweh, God in the flesh without the Holy Spirit's influence drawing them to accept this truth. If this statement is translated poorly, it can have unintended theological consequences.
