\v 10 To others, he gives the power \add to perform\add* miracles. To others, he gives the ability to speak messages that come directly from God. To others, he gives the ability to tell \add if a message is really from God or not\add*. To others he gives the ability to speak messages in languages \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that they have not learned\add*.

\v 9 And to another believer the Spirit gives the gift of trusting God for wonderful things. And another person he gives the ability to pray for God to heal people. The Spirit gives a variety of gifts, but he is still the same Spirit of God.
\v 10 And to another Christian the Spirit gives the ability to work miracles so that people will praise God. And to another, the gift of speaking messages from God. And to another, the Spirit gives various kinds of languages, and to others the interpretation of those messages into our language.
\v 11 Again and again we see the many different gifts, but the one Spirit gives these gifts to individuals and he gives these gifts as he chooses.
