To others, he gives the ability to tell \add if a message is really from God or not\add*.

\v 9 To another believer the Spirit gives the gift of trusting God for wonderful things. To still another person he gives the ability to pray to God for him to heal people. The Spirit gives a variety of gifts, but he is still the same Spirit of God.
\v 10 The Spirit makes some believers able to do powerful deeds so that people will praise God. As for certain other believers, he makes them able to speak messages from God. The Spirit makes still other believers able to tell spirits who honor God from spirits who do not. To still others, the Spirit gives various kinds of languages in which to speak messages from God, and he makes others able to interpret those messages into our language.
\v 11 Again and again we see the many different gifts, but it is the same Spirit who gives these gifts to individuals,  as he chooses.

\v 9 To another he gives faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit,
\v 10 and to another deeds of power, and to another prophecy, to another the ability to distinguish between spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues.
