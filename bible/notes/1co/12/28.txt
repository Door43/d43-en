\v 28 God has also given people as gifts to the church. He gave to the church first apostles, second, prophets, third teachers, then those who do powerful deeds, those who perform healing, those who provide helps, those who do work of administration, and those who have various kinds of languages that the Spirit has given them. Those are the gifts God gave you, gifts of people who are members of the the local church. God gave them to you.
\v 29 Not everyone is an apostle. Not all are prophets. Only some of us are teachers. Only some do powerful deeds.
