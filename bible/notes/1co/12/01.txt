\v 1 Now, my fellow believers, \add I will answer what you asked\add* about the things God's Spirit \add enables believers to do\add*. I want you to know clearly \f + \ft litotes \f* \add about these things\add*.
\v 2 You know that before you became Christians, various things led you to \add worship\add* idols, which are unable to tell you \add any of God's message\add*.
\v 3 So \add the first thing\add* that I will tell you now is that it is not the Spirit of God who would cause anyone to say, "Jesus deserved to die," and that the Holy Spirit is the only one who can enable anyone to say, "Jesus is \add truly\add* the Lord."

\v 1 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I would not have you ignorant.
\v 2 You know that when you were heathens you were led away to those dumb idols, regardless how you might have been led.
\v 3 Therefore I make known to you, that no man speaking in the Spirit of God says, "Jesus is accursed;"  and no man can say, "Jesus is Lord," but in the Holy Spirit.
