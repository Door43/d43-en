\v 30 Can all of us heal the sick? Certainly not. Can all of us speak in special languages? Only some have that gift. Can all of us interpret messages into other languages? Only some can. We are all different in the gifts we have from God.
\v 31 But I want you to eagerly seek after the greater gifts, especially those gifts that encourage and strengthen the church. And now, I will show you a more excellent way.
