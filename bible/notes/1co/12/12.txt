\v 12 As the human body is a union of many parts, and every part of the body makes the whole, so it is with Christ.
\v 13 For it is by the Spirit of Christ that, when we were baptized, we were each joined togethers into the body of Christ. It made no difference what our background was, either Jew or Greek, slave or free, but each of us received the gift of the Holy Spirit.
