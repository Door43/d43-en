===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 Although a person's body has many parts, all the parts form just one body \f + \ft doublet \f*. It is like that \add with those who belong to\add* Christ.
\v 13 When we were baptized \f + \ft Or:When people baptized us \f*, the one \add Holy\add* Spirit caused us to become one group \add of believers\add*. It does not matter whether we are Jews or non-Jews. It does not matter whether we are slaves or not slaves. \add When we believed in Christ\add*, the one Spirit came to live \f + \ft metaphor \f* within all of us.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 As the human body is a union of many parts, and every part of the body makes the whole, so it is with Christ.
\v 13 For it is by the Spirit of Christ that, when we were baptized, we were each joined together into the body of Christ. It made no difference what our background was, either Jew or Greek, slave or free, but each of us received the gift of the Holy Spirit.

\v 12 For as the body is one and has many members and all are members of the same body, so it is with Christ.
\v 13 For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bound or free, and all were made to drink of one Spirit.
