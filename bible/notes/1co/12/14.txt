\v 14 Remember, the body is not just one part, but many parts working together to make up the entire body.
\v 15 If your foot spoke to you and said, "I am not the hand, therefore, I am not part of your body," it would not be less a part of your body because it wasn't like your hand.
\v 16 And if your ear said to you, "I am not an eye, therefore, I have no place in the body," it would not be less a part of your body because it wasn't an eye.
\v 17 If your whole body were an eye, you could not hear anything. If your whole body were just one big organ to let you hear, you would hear nothing.

\v 14 For the body is not a single member, but many.
\v 15 If the foot says, "Since I am not the hand, I am not part of the body," it is not any less a part of the body.
\v 16 And if the ear should say, "Because I am not an eye, I am not part of the body," it is not any less a part of the body.
\v 17 If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body was hearing, where would the sense of smell be?
