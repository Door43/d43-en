====== 1 Corinthians 12:18-20 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 But the truth is that God has put all the parts of our bodies together exactly as he wanted to put them.
\v 19 If \add our body\add* had only one part, it would not be a body.\f + \ft Or: how would it be a body? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 20 But the truth is that there are many parts \add in our body\add*, but it is still only one body.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 But God fitted each part of the body together, and it works just as he designed it. Every part is needed.
\v 19 If each of us were exactly like all the other parts, we would not have a body at all.
\v 20 We are all many members, but only one body.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 But God arranged each part of the body as he designed it.
\v 19 And if they were all the same member, where would the body be?
\v 20 So now they are many members, but only one body.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **all the same member** - As in if each part were a foot, then there would be no arm, hand, leg, chest, or head which is needed to constitute a body. We would all be a foot but not a body.
    * **where would the body be?** - AT: "there would be no body" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **So now they are many members, but** - AT: "They are many members, therefore, but"
