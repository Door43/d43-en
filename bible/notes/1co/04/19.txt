===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 But if the Lord wants me to come, I will come to you soon. Then I will not \add pay any attention to\add* what those proud people say. Instead, I will find out \add whether they have God's\add* power.
\v 20 Remember that God \add judges whether or not we are letting him\add* rule \add our lives\add*, not by \add listening to how we\add* talk, but \add by seeing whether his\add* power \add is present\add* \add among us\f + \ft Or: in our lives\add* \f*.
\v 21 So which do you prefer? Do you want me to come to you and punish you \add because you have not changed your ways\add*, or shall I come to you and act lovingly and gently toward you \add because you have done what I told you to do?\add*

\v 19 But if the Lord wants me to come, I will come to you soon. Then I will know not just the talk of these people, but I will find out whether they have God's power.
\v 20 God's kingdom is not about talk, it is shown in power.
\v 21 What would you want me to do? Should I come to punish you as with a rod, or should I come in love and with the spirit of gentleness?

\v 21 What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or with love in a spirit of gentleness?
