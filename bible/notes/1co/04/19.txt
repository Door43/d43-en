====== 1 Corinthians 04:19-21 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 But if the Lord wants me to come, I will come to you soon. Then I will not \add pay any attention to\add* what those proud people say. Instead, I will find out \add whether they have God's\add* power.
\v 20 Remember that God \add judges whether or not we are letting him\add* rule \add our lives\add*, not by \add listening to how we\add* talk, but \add by seeing whether his\add* power \add is present\add* \add among us\f + \ft Or: in our lives\add* \f*.
\v 21 So which do you prefer? Do you want me to come to you and punish you \add because you have not changed your ways\add*, or shall I come to you and act lovingly and gently toward you \add because you have done what I told you to do?\add*
</usfm>

<usfm>
\v 19 But if the Lord wants me to come, I will come to you soon. Then I will learn not only how these arrogant people talk, but I will find out whether they have God's power in them.
\v 20 God's kingdom is not about what you say; it is about God's power.
\v 21 What would you want me to do? Should I come to punish you with a rod, or should I come so you can see how much I love you by how gentle I am to you?
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills. Then I will know not merely the talk of these who are so arrogant, but I will see their power.
\v 20 For the kingdom of God does not consist in talk but in power.
\v 21 What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod or with love and in a spirit of gentleness?
