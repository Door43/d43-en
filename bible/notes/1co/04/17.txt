<usfm>
\v 17 That is why I sent Timothy to you. I love him, and he is my faithful child. He will remind you of how I live as I am joined to Christ. I teach the same things everywhere we go and in every church we visit. 

\p
\v 18 Some of you have become proud. You live as though I might not come back to you soon.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 That is why I sent you Timothy, my beloved and faithful child in the Lord. He will remind you of my ways in Christ, even as I teach them everywhere and in every church.
\v 18 Now some of you are so arrogant, acting as though I were not coming to you.
