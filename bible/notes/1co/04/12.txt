===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 We work with our hands to make a living. When others curse us, we bless them in return. When others make us suffer, we endure it.
\v 13 When people tell lies about us, we answer by being kind to them. And yet, they treat us like the garbage of the world and like the filth that people want to throw into a garbage heap.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 We work hard, working with our own hands. When we are reviled, we bless. When we are persecuted, we endure.
\v 13 When we are slandered, we speak with kindness. We had become, and are still considered to be, the refuse of the world and the filthiest of all things.
