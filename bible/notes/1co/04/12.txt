===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 We labor with all our effort, working with our hands to make a living. When we are cursed, we return a blessing. When we are persecuted, we endure it.
\v 13 When people tell lies about us, we respond with words of comfort and offer them kindness. And yet, we are treated like the garbage of the world and like the filth that people want to get rid of.

<usfm>
\v 12 We do work hard, working with our own hands. When we are reviled, we bless. When we are persecuted, we endure.
\v 13 When we are slandered, we speak with kindness. We were made, and are now considered as the refuse of the world and the filth of all things.
