====== 1 Corinthians 04:3-4 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 I am not concerned whether you or \add the judges in\add* some court decide whether I have done my work faithfully or not. I do not even judge myself \add about that\add*.
\v 4 I do not think that I have done anything wrong, but that does not prove that I have done nothing wrong. The Lord is the one who judges me.
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 If a human being, or even a court of law, judges my life, I think little about it. I am not able even to judge myself.
\v 4 I am not aware of anyone who accuses me of doing wrong. But that does not mean that I am innocent. It is the Lord who judges me.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 But for me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human court.  For I do not even judge myself.
\v 4 I am not aware of any charge being made against me, but that does not mean I am innocent. It is the Lord who judges me.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * ** it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you** - Paul is comparing the difference between human judgement and God's judgement. Man's judgment is trivial compared to God's true judgement upon man.
  * ** I am not aware of any charge being made** - AT: "I have not heard of any accusation." 
  * **that does not mean I am innocent. It is the Lord who judges me.** - "that lack of accusation does not prove I am innocent; the Lord knows if I am innocent or guilty."
