====== 1 Corinthians 04:3-4 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 I am not concerned whether you or \add the judges in\add* some court decide whether I have done my work faithfully or not. I do not even judge myself \add about that\add*.
\v 4 I do not think that I have done anything wrong, but that does not prove that I have done nothing wrong. The Lord is the one who judges me.
\v 5 So stop judging any of us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* before the time \add when God judges everyone\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*! Do not judge us before the Lord comes. He is the one who will reveal the sinful things that people have done secretly. He will even reveal what people have thought in their minds. At that time God will praise each person as\add each one of them deserves\add*.

\v 3 If a human being judged my life, I think little of it. I am not able even to judge myself.
\v 4 I am not aware of anyone bringing a charge against me, accusing me of something I have done. But that does not mean that I am acquitted of all wrong-doing. My life is open for you to examine. But it is not the judgment of human beings that concerns me. For me, it is only the Lord's judgment that matters.
\v 5 So then you should not judge anything before it is time for judgment. The time for judgment is when the Lord comes back. He is the only one qualified to judge. He is the one who can bring to light everything that is hidden, even things hidden in total darkness. And he can make a right judgment because he can see the hidden motives of hearts. When he comes, every one will receive whatever they deserve from the Lord.

\v 3 But for me it is a very small thing that I should you or a human should judge me.  Yes, even I am not able to judge myself.
\v 4 For I am not aware of any charge being made against me, but that does not mean I am innocent. It is the Lord who judges me. 
\v 5 Therefore do not pronounce judgment about anything before the time, before the Lord comes, who brings to light the hidden things of darkness and reveals the purposes of the heart. Then each will receive his commendation from God.
