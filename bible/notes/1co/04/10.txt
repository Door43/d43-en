Many people \add consider us\add* \f + \ft irony \f* to be unimpressive, but you \add proudly think that you\add* impress others. People respect you, but they do not respect us.
\v 11 Up to this present time we have often been hungry. We have often been thirsty. We have ragged clothes. Often we have been beaten \f + \ft Or:others have beaten us \f*. We \add have traveled so much that we\add* have no regular homes to live in.
