\v 8 \add It is disgusting that you act as though\add* \f + \ft irony \f* you have already received everything that you need \add spiritually\add*. You act as though \f + \ft irony \f* you were \add spiritually\add* rich \f + \ft Or: you had received all \add the spiritual gifts you need\add* \f*. You act as though \f + \ft irony \f* you had already begun to rule as kings with Christ. Well, I wish that you really were ruling \add with him\add*, in order that we \add apostles\add* might also rule with you!
\v 9 But it seems as though God has put us \add apostles\add* on display at the end of the line. We\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* are like men who have been condemned to die, who have been put in the arena where everyone can see \add the wild animals\add* killing them. And not only people, but even angels all over the world \add are watching us, as people\add* watch those who are performing a play \add in a theater\add*.

\v 8 Already you have everything you want! You are completely satisfied! You are reigning like kings without our help. I wish you really had become kings, then we could rule with you!
\v 9 But, it seems, God has put us apostles on display at the end of the line. We are like men who have been sentenced to death, we have become a spectacle to the world, we are watched over by angels and jeered at by people.

\v 8 Already you have all you could want.  Already you have become rich! You began to reign--and that apart from us!  And indeed, I wish you did reign, so that we could reign with you.
\v 9 For, I think, God has put us apostles on display as the last in line in a procession, and like men sentenced to death, we have become a spectacle to the world--to angels and to human beings.
