<usfm>
\v 8 \add It is disgusting that you act as though\add* \f + \ft irony \f* you have already received everything that you need \add spiritually\add*. You act as though \f + \ft irony \f* you were \add spiritually\add* rich \f + \ft Or: you had received all \add the spiritual gifts you need\add* \f*. You act as though \f + \ft irony \f* you had already begun to rule as kings with Christ. Well, I wish that you really were ruling \add with him\add*, in order that we \add apostles\add* might also rule with you!
\v 9 But it seems as though God has put us \add apostles\add* on display at the end of the line. We\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* are like men who have been condemned to die, who have been put in the arena where everyone can see \add the wild animals\add* killing them. And not only people, but even angels all over the world \add are watching us, as people\add* watch those who are performing a play \add in a theater\add*.

\v 8 But you act as if you have everything you want! You live as if you were rich! And you live as if you were reigning kings and queens—even without our help. Well, I wish you really had become kings queens, for then we could have ruled with you!
\v 9 But in reality, it seems that God has put us apostles on display at the end of a line of prisoners being paraded after a battle. We are like men who have been sentenced to death, we have been put on display for the whole world to see, both angels and human beings.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Already you have all you could want.  Already you have become rich! You began to reign—and that quite apart from us!  Indeed, I wish you did reign, so that we could reign with you.
\v 9 For I think God has put us apostles on display as the last in line in a procession and like men sentenced to death. We have become a spectacle to the world—to angels and to human beings.
