\v 6 My fellow believers, I have \add told you\add* all these things as illustrations of myself and Apollos. I have done this for your sake, in order that you may learn \add to live according to\add* the saying, "Do not act contrary to what is \f + \ft Or:what they have \f* written \add in the Scriptures\add*." If you follow that rule, you will not be proud of one \add spiritual leader\add* and despise another.
\v 7 No one has made any of you superior to others!\f + \ft Or: Why do any of you think that you are superior to others? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add All the abilities\add* that you have, you received\add from God\add*.\f + \ft Or: did you not receive them \add from God\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* So if you received them all \add from God\add*, you should not boast \add thinking\add*,  "I got these abilities \add from myself\add*, \add not from God\add*!"\f + \ft Or: why do you boast \add thinking\add*,  "I got these abilities \add from myself\add*, \add not from God\add*?" \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 6 Now, brothers and sisters, the rule we follow is "do not go beyond what is written." Apollos and I live by it. For your sakes we teach only in this way. This keeps you thinking about the word God that you are learning. It keeps you from being too proud about the people who are teaching it to you, whether it is I or Apollos.
\v 7 There is no difference between you and any other believers. All of you have received everything as a gift. None of you is better than any other. None of you should boast like you are different from all the rest. We are all just the same.

\v 6 Now, brothers and sisters, I applied these principles to myself and Apollos for your sakes, so that from us you might learn the meaning of the saying, 
\q  "Do not go beyond what is written,"
\m so that none of you may be puffed up in favor of one against the other.
\v 7 For who sees any difference between you and others? What do you have that you did not freely receive? If you have freely received it, why do you boast as if you had not done so?
