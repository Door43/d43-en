\v 6 Now these things, brothers, I have applied to myself and Apollos for your sakes. So that in us you might learn not to go beyond the things which are written.  And that not one of you be puffed up against the other.
\v 7 For who makes you to be different? And what  do you have that you did not receive? But if you did receive it, why do you glory as if you had not received it?
