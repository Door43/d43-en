\v 6 My fellow believers, I have \add told you\add* all these things as illustrations of myself and Apollos. I have done this for your sake, in order that you may learn \add to live according to\add* the saying, "Do not act contrary to what is \f + \ft Or:what they have \f* written \add in the Scriptures\add*." If you follow that rule, you will not be proud of one \add spiritual leader\add* and despise another.
\v 7 No one has made any of you superior to others!\f + \ft Or: Why do any of you think that you are superior to others? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add All the abilities\add* that you have, you received\add from God\add*.\f + \ft Or: did you not receive them \add from God\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* So if you received them all \add from God\add*, you should not boast \add thinking\add*,  "I got these abilities \add from myself\add*, \add not from God\add*!"\f + \ft Or: why do you boast \add thinking\add*,  "I got these abilities \add from myself\add*, \add not from God\add*?" \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 6 Now, brothers and sisters, the principle we follow is "do not go beyond what is written." I apply this principle to myself and to Apollos. For your sakes we teach only in this way. This keeps you focused on the word you are learning and not on the people who are teaching it to you, whether it is me or Apollos.
\v 7 Who makes a distinction between any of you. Did you not all receive everything you have? None of you is better than any other. None of you should boast like you are different from all the rest. We are all just the same.

\v 6 Now, brothers and sisters, I applied these principles to myself and Apollos for your sakes. So that in us you might learn the meaning of the saying, 
\q  "Do not go beyond what is written."
\m So that none of you be puffed up in favor of one against the other.
\v 7 For who sees anything different in you? What  do you have that you did not receive? If you received it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?
