<usfm>
\v 14 I am writing this to you, not to make you feel ashamed, but instead to warn you as \add though you were\add* my dear children.
\v 15 I say that because as \add an apostle of\add* Christ Jesus I \add was the first one who\add* proclaimed the good message to you. As a result, I was the one who enabled you to receive eternal life. So even if there were thousands of Christians who instruct you \f + \ft metaphor \f*, I am the only one who became \add like\add* a father to you.
\v 16 So I urge you to \add live for Christ\add* the way I do.

\v 14 I am not trying to shame you, but to correct you as a loving parent would correct a child.
\v 15  If you had ten thousand teachers telling you about Christ, you would still only have only one spiritual father. I became your father in Christ when you believed the gospel I preached to you.
\v 16 So I urge you to follow my example.

\v 14 I do not write these things to shame you, but to correct you as my beloved children.
\v 15 For if you have ten thousand tutors in Christ, you do not have many fathers. Because I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel.
\v 16 So I urge you to be imitators of me.
