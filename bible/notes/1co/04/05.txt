\v 5 So stop judging any of us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* before the time \add when God judges everyone\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*! Do not judge us before the Lord comes.

At that time God will praise each person as\add each one of them deserves\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 So then, you should not judge anything before it is time. The Lord will do that when he returns. He is the one who can bring to light everything that is hidden even in total darkness, and he can make a right judgment because he knows what each person truly thinks. When he comes, everyone will receive whatever honor they deserve from the Lord.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Therefore do not pronounce judgment about anything before the time, before the Lord comes. He will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the purposes of the heart. Then each one will receive his praise from God.
