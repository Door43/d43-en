====== 1 Corinthians 03:6-7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 I was \add the first one who preached God's message to you. I was like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* someone who plants seeds. \add Later\add*, Apollos \add taught you more of God's message. That was like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* someone who waters plants \add after they start to grow\add*. But it is God who \add enables people to grow spiritually, just like he is the one who\add* causes \add plants\add* to grow.
\v 7 So \add the person who first preaches God's message to people is not important, and the person who later teaches people more of God's message is not important, just like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* it is not the person who plants \add the seeds\add* or the person who waters \add the plants\add* who is important. Instead, it is God, who causes plants to grow\add and who causes people to grow spiritually, who is important\add*.

\v 6 Even though I was the first to plant the seed of God's word in you, it was Apollos who made sure you grew in faith. But Apollos and I both knew that it was God alone who gives spiritual growth.
\v 7 Let me say it again: The one who plants the seeds and one who waters them, do not matter in the least. God is the one who gives the growth.

\v 6 I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth.
\v 7 So then, neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but God gives the growth.
