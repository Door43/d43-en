====== 1 Corinthians 03:6-7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 I was \add the first one who preached God's message to you. I was like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* someone who plants seeds. \add Later\add*, Apollos \add taught you more of God's message. That was like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* someone who waters plants \add after they start to grow\add*. But it is God who \add enables people to grow spiritually, just like he is the one who\add* causes \add plants\add* to grow.
\v 7 So \add the person who first preaches God's message to people is not important, and the person who later teaches people more of God's message is not important, just like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* it is not the person who plants \add the seeds\add* or the person who waters \add the plants\add* who is important. Instead, it is God, who causes plants to grow\add and who causes people to grow spiritually, who is important\add*.

\v 6 Even though I was the first to plant the seed of God's word in you, it was Apollos who made sure you grew in faith. But it was God alone who can give spiritual growth to you.
\v 7 Let me say it again: The ones who plant the seeds and water them, we do not matter in the least. God is the one who gives the growth. You are like a garden that he has planted.

===== ULB: =====

\v 6 I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth.
\v 7 So then, neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything. But it is God who gives the growth.

  * **growth** - As plants grow and develop, so also do faith and knowledge in God also grow and become deeper and stronger. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
