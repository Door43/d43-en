====== 1 Corinthians 03:1-2 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 My fellow believers, \add when I was with you previously\add*, I was not able to teach you as \add I would teach people who are controlled by the Holy\add* Spirit \f + \ft Or:\add whom the Holy\add* Spirit\add controls\add* \f*. Instead, \add I had to teach you as I would teach\add* people whom their self-directed nature controls. \add I taught very simple concepts to you who had recently believed\add* in Christ, \add as a parent would speak very simple words\add* to a baby.
\v 2 I did not \add teach\add* you \add things that were difficult for you to understand, just like a woman does not\add* give \add her baby\add* solid food \add that the baby cannot chew and digest\add*. \add And just like a woman\add* \add gives her baby milk\f + \ft Or: breast-feeds her baby\add* \f*\add , I taught you simple spiritual concepts\add*, because at that time you were not able to understand difficult things. And you are still not able to understand difficult concepts,

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 My brothers and sisters, when I was with you, you were not ready to hear the difficult truths about God. I could speak to you only as if you were little children who are joined to Christ.
\v 2 I taught you things that were easy to understand, as a mother feeds milk to her babies. You were not ready for meat. And even now, you are not ready.

\p
\v 1 And brothers and sisters, I could not speak to you as spiritual people, but instead as to fleshly people, as to babes in Christ.
\v 2 I fed you milk and not meat, for you were not ready for meat. And even now you are not ready.
