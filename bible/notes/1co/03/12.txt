\v 12 Furthermore, people can build a house on its foundation \add with materials that are valuable and do not burn easily, such as\add* gold, silver, and expensive jewels. Or they could build a house with \add materials that are not valuable and that burn easily, such as\add* wood, hay, and straw.
\v 13 Later it will become clear\f + \ft Or: evident \f* what kind of material they used to build the house. \add Similarly, when people teach others God's truth\add*, it will later become clear \add what kind of things they taught\add*. \add God\add* will make that clear\f + \ft Or: evident \f* at the time \add when he judges us\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 The foundations that we build on can should be evaluated by what they are made of. Consider these materials for the foundation we are building: gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw--
\v 13 God will evaluate our work and put on display what each of us has done for him. The fire of testing will reveal the value and lasting quality of every work we have done. That fire will also prove how hard we worked for him.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 Now if anyone builds on the foundation of gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw--
\v 13 God will display each one's work. His fire will reveal what material each work is made of, and the fire will prove what sort of work each one has done.
