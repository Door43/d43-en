====== 1 Corinthians 03:8-9 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 The person \add who first preaches God's message to people and the one who later teaches them more of God's message\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* both are \add trying to reach the\add* same \add goal\add*\f + \ft Or: have the same \add purpose\add* \f*. And \add God\add* will reward each of them according to how they served him.
\v 9 Remember that Apollos and I are both working together for God. \add You do not belong to us\add*. Just like a field \add belongs to its owner, not to those who work in it\add*, you belong to God, \add not to us who work for him\add*.


\p Also, a house belongs to its owner. \add It does not belong to the man who built it. Similarly, God is the one to whom you belong\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 The one who plants and the one who waters are working in the same job, and each one individually will receive a wage as a reward. The reward is the amount he is paid measured by how hard each one worked.
\v 9 We are working together with God and we both belong to God. But as for you, God is growing you in his field. It is as if he were constructing a building out of you.


\p
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Now he who plants and he who waters are one, and each will receive his own wages according to his own labor.
\v 9 For we are God's fellow workers. You are God's garden, God's building.
