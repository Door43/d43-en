\v 8 The person \add who first preaches God's message to people and the one who later teaches them more of God's message\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* both are \add trying to reach the\add* same \add goal\add*\f + \ft Or: have the same \add purpose\add* \f*. And \add God\add* will reward each of them according to how they served him.
\v 9 Remember that Apollos and I are both working together for God. \add You do not belong to us\add*. Just like a field \add belongs to its owner, not to those who work in it\add*, you belong to God, \add not to us who work for him\add*.


\p Also, a house belongs to its owner. \add It does not belong to the man who built it. Similarly, God is the one to whom you belong\add*.

\v 8 The one who plants and the one who waters are working in the same job, and each one individually will receive a wage as a reward. The reward is the amount he is paid measured by how hard each one worked.
\v 9 We are working together with God and we both belong to God. But as for you, God is growing you in his field. It is as if he were building you up to become his dwelling.
