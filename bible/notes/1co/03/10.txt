====== 1 Corinthians 03:10-11 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 \add Just like\add* a skilled person puts a foundation in the ground \add before he builds a house\add*, as a result of God kindly helping me \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add I was the first one who declared the message about Christ to you. And, just like\add* others build a house on its foundation, there were \add others who later taught you more about Christ\add*. But \add just like each person who builds a house\add* must be careful about what materials he uses to build it \f + \ft metaphor \f*, each person \add who teaches God's truth must be careful about what he teaches\add*.
\v 11 Just like people can put in \add only\add* one foundation \add for a house\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add there is only one message that we can give to people. That message is about\add* Jesus Christ.

\v 10 God generously gave me the skills so I can do this task for him. I worked among you like an expert builder with great care. But after me, someone else will build on what I began. Everyone builds on what others did before. But each one must be careful how they build.
\v 11 For no other foundation can be laid other than the one that has already been set in place. That foundation is Jesus Christ.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 10 According to the grace of God that was given to me as a skilled master builder, I laid a foundation and another is building on it. But let each man be careful how he builds on it.
\v 11 For no one can lay a foundation other than the one that has been laid, that is, Jesus Christ.
