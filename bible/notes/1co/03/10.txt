===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 \add Just like\add* a skilled person puts a foundation in the ground \add before he builds a house\add*, as a result of God kindly helping me \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add I was the first one who declared the message about Christ to you. And, just like\add* others build a house on its foundation, there were \add others who later taught you more about Christ\add*. But \add just like each person who builds a house\add* must be careful about what materials he uses to build it \f + \ft metaphor \f*, each person \add who teaches God's truth must be careful about what he teaches\add*.
\v 11 Just like people can put in \add only\add* one foundation \add for a house\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add there is only one message that we can give to people. That message is about\add* Jesus Christ.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 God gave me his grace to be the foundation upon which I build, like a master builder with great skill. But someone else builds upon that foundation. And every other builder who comes, must be careful how they build, one upon the other.
\v 11 But no other foundation can be laid than the one that has already been put down. That foundation is Jesus Christ.

\p
\v 10 According to the grace of God that  was given to me, as a skilled master builder, I laid a foundation and another builds upon it. But let each man be careful how he builds on it.
\v 11 For no one can lay a foundation other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
