<usfm>
\v 18 Some among you think that you are wise because unbelievers thought you were wise previously. Stop deceiving yourselves. \add If you really want to be wise, by accepting what God considers to be wise\add* you should \add be willing to let unbelievers consider that you are\add* foolish \f + \ft irony \f*.
\v 19 You should do that because things that unbelievers \add consider to be\add* \f + \ft irony \f* wise, God considers to be foolish. \add We can learn from\add* the Scriptures\add what God says about\add* that,
\q Those who think that they are \f + \ft irony \f* wise, he messes up their plans by the mistakes they make!
\p
\v 20 And \add we can learn from\add* these words of Scripture,
\q The Lord considers as useless the thoughts of \add humans who think that they are\add* \f + \ft irony \f* wise.

\v 18 Be on guard that you do not deceive yourself. If any of you thinks he has great wisdom, as the world sees it, he should be careful. He would be far better off if those who are important in this world considered him to be a "fool," because he walks away from what the world craves. And by walking away from the world, he would begin to learn what true wisdom is.
\v 19 What the world considers to be great wisdom, is really foolishness to God. For scripture says, 
\q "God catches the wise in their foolish schemes."
\v 20 And again scripture teaches, 
\q "The Lord overhears all the negotiations of the wise, and he knows that in the end, they lose everything."

\v 18 Let no man deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks he is wise in this age, let him become a "fool," that he may become wise.
\v 19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For scripture says, 
\q "He catches the wise in their craftiness."
\m
\v 20 And again, 
\q "The Lord knows that the reasonings of the wise are futile."
