====== 1 Corinthians 03:18-20 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 Some among you think that you are wise because unbelievers thought you were wise previously. Stop deceiving yourselves. \add If you really want to be wise, by accepting what God considers to be wise\add* you should \add be willing to let unbelievers consider that you are\add* foolish \f + \ft irony \f*.
\v 19 You should do that because things that unbelievers \add consider to be\add* \f + \ft irony \f* wise, God considers to be foolish. \add We can learn from\add* the Scriptures\add what God says about\add* that,
\q Those who think that they are \f + \ft irony \f* wise, he messes up their plans by the mistakes they make!
\p
\v 20 And \add we can learn from\add* these words of Scripture,
\q The Lord considers as useless the thoughts of \add humans who think that they are\add* \f + \ft irony \f* wise.

\v 18 Be on guard that you do not deceive yourself. If any of you thinks he has great wisdom that unbelievers will admire, he should be careful. He would be far better off if he leaves alone all the things that unbelievers want, even if they consider him to be a fool for doing so. When he leaves those things alone, he will begin to learn what is true wisdom.
\v 19 What the world considers to be great wisdom, is really foolishness to God. For Scripture says, 
\q "God catches the wise in their own foolish plans."
\m
\v 20 And again Scripture teaches, 
\q "The Lord overhears all the planning of the wise, and he knows that in the end, they will lose everything."

<usfm>
\p
\v 18 Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks he is wise in this age, let him become a "fool" that he may become wise.
\v 19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written: 
\q "He catches the wise in their craftiness."
\m
\v 20 And again, 
\q "The Lord knows that the reasoning of the wise is futile."
\m
