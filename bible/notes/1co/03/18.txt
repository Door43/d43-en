\v 18 Let no man deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks he is wise in this age, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.
\v 19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For scripture says, 
\q "He catches the wise in their craftiness."
\m
\v 20 And again, 
\q "The Lord knows that the reasonings of the wise are futile."
