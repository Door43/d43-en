====== 1 Corinthians 03:14-15 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 When a fire \add starts burning a house\add*, it becomes clear whether the builders used \add materials in their\add* work \add that will burn, or materials that will not burn\add*. Similarly \f + \ft metaphor \f*, when God judges us, it will be clear whether we taught others things that were long-lasting and valuable or not. If \add the materials that are used to\add* build a house \add are materials that\add* do not burn, the builder will receive a reward \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add Similarly, if we have taught others things that are valuable and long-lasting, God will give us a reward\add*.
\v 15 If \add the things that we have taught\add* are not valuable and long-lasting \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add we will not get a reward\add*. We will be saved \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* will save us \f* \add from hell\add*, but \add that is all that we will get. We will be like a man who\add* escapes from a fire \add without saving any of his possessions\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 If a person's work survives the fire that tests what he built, he will receive a reward for his work.
\v 15 But if the fire burns up all his work, he will lose all his reward, but God can still save him. Even though the flames completely devoured everything he did.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 If anything a person builds remains, he will receive a reward.
\v 15 But if anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, as though escaping through fire.
