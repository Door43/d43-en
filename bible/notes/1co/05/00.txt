====== 1 Corinthians 05 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the line of 5:13, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.  

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

This chapter deals with sexual immorality of one church member.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]]: “sleep with” meaning have sex with.

[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]: “in the name of the Lord” meaning with Christ’s power. 

[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]: The day of the Lord means when Christ returns to earth.
 
[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]: He uses an extensive comparison using many metaphors. Yeast represents evil. The loaf represents the whole congregation. The unleavened bread represents a pure life. The Passover represents the Christian life. So the whole passage means: Don’t you know that a little evil will affect the whole congregation. So clean yourselves from evil so you will all be good. Christ has been sacrificed for us; so let us be sincere and truthful and not wicked and behaving badly.




=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

to “hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh”, means to allow Satan to destroy his body.
