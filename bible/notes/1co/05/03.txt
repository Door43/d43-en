\v 4  \add What I have decided is that\add* when you have gathered together with the authority \f + \ft metonymy \f* of our Lord Jesus, and my spirit is with you, and the power of our Lord Jesus  \add is with you\add*,
\v 5 you should put that man into Satan's hands. Then Satan can injure\f + \ft Or: punish \f* his body, in order that  \add he will turn away from his sinful behavior\add* and his spirit will be saved on the day when the Lord  \add returns\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*.

\v 3 I am not with you physically, but I am very concerned for you all, and I am with you in my spirit. And I have already judged the one who did this, just as if I were with you.
\v 4  When you gather together for worship under the authority of the Lord Jesus, I am worshiping with you—and I have already judged this person.
\v 5 You should turn this man over to Satan, so that his physical body might be destroyed. We have the hope that God will still save him when the Lord returns.

\v 3 For, although I am absent in body but still present in spirit, I have already judged the one who did this, just as though I were there. 
\v 4 When you gather together in the name of our Lord Jesus, and my spirit is there as well in the power of our Lord Jesus—I have already judged this person,
\v 5 to hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord.
