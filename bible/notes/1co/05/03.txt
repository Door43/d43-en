\v 3 I am not with you physically, but I am very concerned for you all, and I am with you in my spirit. And I have already judged the one who did this, just as if I were with you.
\v 4 When you gather together for worship under the authority of the Lord Jesus—and I am worshiping with you in spirit—
\v 5 you should turn this man over to Satan out into the world, so that his physical body might be destroyed, so that God may save his spirit on the day of the Lord's return.

<usfm>
\v 3 For even though I am absent in body, I am present in spirit. I have already passed judgment on the one who did this, just as though I were there.
\v 4 When you are assembled in the name of our Lord Jesus and I am with you in spirit, and the power of our Lord Jesus is present,
\v 5 hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord.
