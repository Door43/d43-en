\v 3 I am not with you physically, but I am very concerned for you all, and I am with you in my spirit. And I have already judged the one who did this, just as if I were with you.
\v 4  When you gather together for worship under the authority of the Lord Jesus, I am worshiping with you—and I have already judged this person.
\v 5 You should turn this man over to Satan, so that his physical body might be destroyed. We have the hope that God will still save him when the Lord returns.
