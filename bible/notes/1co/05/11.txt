\v 11 But now  \add I am stating clearly that\add* when I wrote, I  \add meant that\add* you should not associate with those who say that they are fellow believers, if they are sexually immoral or if they desire and forcefully seize things that belong to others, or worship idols, or slander others, or become drunk. You should not associate with people like that, and you should not even eat with them!
\v 12 It is certainly not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* my business to judge people who are not believers and who do not belong to  \add Christian congregations\add*. But it certainly is \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* your business to judge those who are in  \add your congregation\add*.
\v 13 God is the one who will judge those who are not believers\add . Do as the Scriptures command:\add*  "Expel the wicked person from your midst!"

\v 11 But now I am writing this instruction to you: that you are not to associate with a Christian brother who is living in sexual immorality. We must include other sins, such as greed, or idolatry, or one who is abusive in the way he talks to others, or a drunkard, or a swindler. You must not even eat with people who claim to be Christians and who live in these sins.
\v 12 For what responsibility do I have for judging those who are outside the church of Christ? Your duty is for the purity of the church and you must judge the lives of those who are in it, to maintain its purity and beauty.
\v 13 God is the one who will judge those who are outside the church. The scriptures command us,   
\q "You must remove the evil person from among you!"

\v 11 But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother in Christ who is sexually immoral, or greedy, or an idolater, or a verbally abusive, or a drunkard, or a swindler. Do not even eat with such a person.
\v 12 For what do I have to do with judging those that are outside the church? Are you not to judge those who are inside the church?
\v 13 But God judges those who are outside the church. 
\q "Remove the wicked evil from among you."
