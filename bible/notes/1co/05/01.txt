===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1  People have told us that there is someone in your church who is living in sexual immorality, a kind of immorality that even the unbelievers do not allow. A man has a lover who is his father's wife.
\v 2 You have been so arrogant! Rather you should have wept over this sin, for this harms the whole church. You must put this man out of your church.

\p
\v 1 We heard a report that there is sexual immorality among you, a kind of immorality that  is not even permitted among the Gentiles. The report is that one of you is sleeping with his father’s wife.
\v 2 And you are so arrogant! Should you not mourn instead? The one who did this must be removed from among you.
