\v 6 It is not good that, \add while you are letting that immoral man continue to be in your congregation\add*, you are boasting  \add about being spiritually mature\add*. You know that a small amount of yeast affects all the bread dough \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add into which it is put\add* \f + \ft Or:\add a woman puts it\add* \f*.\f + \ft Or: Do you not know that a small amount of yeast affects all the bread dough ( metaphor ) \add into which it is put\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add Similarly, one person who continues to sin will have a bad effect on all the congregation\add*.
\v 7 So, \add just like we Jews\add* expel the old yeast  \add from our houses during the Passover celebration\add* in order that we may have a fresh batch of dough without yeast in it \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add you must expel such evil people from your congregation\add*. Do  \add that so that you can truly be holy people\add*, as  \add I know that\add* you really are. Remember that Christ was sacrificed \f + \ft Or:sacrificed himself \f* \add so that God could spare us from being punished for our sins, just like the Jews sacrificed lambs during\add* the  \add first\add* Passover celebration  \add so that God would spare their firstborn sons from being killed\add*.
\v 8 So let us celebrate  \add the fact that God has freed us from punishing us for our sins\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add just like the Jews\add* in  \add later years\add* celebrated Passover  \add to celebrate God freeing them from being slaves in Egypt. They made sure that there was\add* no old yeast in the dough. \add They ate bread that\add* had no yeast in it. \add Similarly\add*, \add we should make sure that there are no people in our congregations\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add who act\add* maliciously  \add toward others\add* or  \add act\add* wickedly. Instead, \add make sure\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add that those in our congregations are ones who act\add* sincerely and  \add speak\add* truthfully.

\v 6 It is not good that you are praising yourselves. Surely you know that evil is like yeast: a little yeast makes the whole loaf rise.
\v 7 Sin is like that yeast. You must clean out the old yeast and throw it away so that it cannot affect the whole batch of dough. You are like  an unleavened batch of dough. As in the Passover Festival, the yeast must be kept away from the bread. For Christ is our Passover lamb: he became the sacrifice for us.
\v 8 So let us celebrate the Passover Festival, and let us follow all the rules of purification. We must throw out the old yeast, which stands for disobedience and wickedness, and we must celebrate the festival by obeying God and speaking truth to each other. If we do that, we will be like the bread that has no yeast.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little yeast leavens the whole loaf?
\v 7 Cleanse yourselves of the old yeast so that you may be new dough—as you are now like unleavened bread. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. 
\v 8 So let us therefore celebrate the festival, not with the old yeast, the yeast of bad behavior and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Do you not know that a little yeast leavens the whole loaf?**  - Just as a little yeast spreads throughout a whole loaf of bread, so can a little sin impact the entire fellowship of believers. (See [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **has been sacrificed**  - "The Lord God sacrificed Christ Jesus" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.** - As the passover Lamb covered the sins of Israel  by faith each year so did Christ's death cover the sins of all who  trust in Christ by faith for eternity.  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
