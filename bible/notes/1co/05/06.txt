\v 6 It is not good that, \add while you are letting that immoral man continue to be in your congregation\add*, you are boasting  \add about being spiritually mature\add*. You know that a small amount of yeast affects all the bread dough \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add into which it is put\add* \f + \ft Or:\add a woman puts it\add* \f*.\f + \ft Or: Do you not know that a small amount of yeast affects all the bread dough ( metaphor ) \add into which it is put\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add Similarly, one person who continues to sin will have a bad effect on all the congregation\add*.
\v 7 So, \add just like we Jews\add* expel the old yeast  \add from our houses during the Passover celebration\add* in order that we may have a fresh batch of dough without yeast in it \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add you must expel such evil people from your congregation\add*. Do  \add that so that you can truly be holy people\add*, as  \add I know that\add* you really are. Remember that Christ was sacrificed \f + \ft Or:sacrificed himself \f* \add so that God could spare us from being punished for our sins, just like the Jews sacrificed lambs during\add* the  \add first\add* Passover celebration  \add so that God would spare their firstborn sons from being killed\add*.
\v 8 So let us celebrate  \add the fact that God has freed us from punishing us for our sins\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add just like the Jews\add* in  \add later years\add* celebrated Passover  \add to celebrate God freeing them from being slaves in Egypt. They made sure that there was\add* no old yeast in the dough. \add They ate bread that\add* had no yeast in it. \add Similarly\add*, \add we should make sure that there are no people in our congregations\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add who act\add* maliciously  \add toward others\add* or  \add act\add* wickedly. Instead, \add make sure\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add that those in our congregations are ones who act\add* sincerely and  \add speak\add* truthfully.

\v 6 Your boasting and pride are not good. Do you not know that evil is like yeast, a little yeast changes the whole loaf. A little evil can change an entire life and it can affect the church.
\v 7 You must clean out the old yeast and throw it away so that it cannot affect the batch of dough. It is important that you do not let the leven of sin begin to do its work in you. You are unlevened, and everyone must be very careful to keep the leven away from you. As in the Passover, the leven is taken away. For Christ, our Passover lamb, was sacrificed, so we have been set apart for him, and made  by his blood.
\v 8 So let us celebrate the Passover feast, and let us follow all the rules of purification. We must put out the old yeast, the leven of disobedience and wickedness, and we celebrate the feast with the unlevened bread of sincere obedience and truthful living.

\v 6 Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little yeast levens the whole loaf?
\v 7 Clean out the old yeast that you may be a new batch of dough--seeing that you are unlevened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed 
\v 8 So let us therefore celebrate the feast, not using  the old yeast, the yeast of bad behavior and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
