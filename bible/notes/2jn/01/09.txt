\v 9 Those who change what Christ taught and do not continue \add to believe\add* what he taught do not have\add a relationship with\add* God. \add But\add* those who continue to believe \add what Christ\add* taught have \add a close relationship with\add* both \add God, our\add* Father, and with his Son\f + \ft Or: the one who is also God \f*.
\v 10 So when anyone comes to you who teaches something different from \add what Christ\add* taught, do not welcome him into your homes! Do not \add encourage him by\add* wishing him well\f + \ft Or: greeting him as a fellow believer \f* \add in any way!\add*
\v 11 \add I say that\add* because if you treat people like that as you would treat a fellow believer, \add God will punish you\add* along with them for the evil that they do.

\v 9 Those who change what Christ taught and do not continue to believe what he taught are not joined with God. But those who continue to believe what Christ taught are joined with both God, our Father, and with his Son.
\v 10 So when anyone comes to you who teaches something different from what Christ taught, do not welcome him into your homes! Do not encourage him by greeting him or wishing him well in any way!
\v 11 I say that because if you treat people like that as you would treat a fellow believer, you are helping them do their evil deeds.

<usfm>
\v 9 Whoever goes on ahead and does not remain in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. He who remains in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.
\v 10 If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house and do not greet him.
\v 11 For he who greets him participates in his evil deeds.
