\v 4 I am very happy because I have learned that some of you are living according to the truth that God has taught us. this is just what our Father commanded us to do.


\p
\v 5 And now, dear congregation, I beg you to obey what he has commanded us to do. This  is why I am writing to you. What he commanded--that we should love each other--is nothing new; instead, it was when we first believed in Christ that we learned that we should love each other.
\v 6 This is what it means to love God and each other--we should obey what God commands us to do. What he commands us to do is love him and each other.

\p
\v 4 I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, just as we have received this commandment from the Father.
\v 5 And now I plead with you, lady, not as though I wrote to you a new commandment, but that which we have had from the beginning, that we should love one another.
\v 6 And this is love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.
