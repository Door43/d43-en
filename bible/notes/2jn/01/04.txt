\v 4 I am very happy because I have learned that some of you are living according to the truth that God has taught us. this is just what our Father commanded us to do.
\p
\v 5 And now, dear congregation, I beg you to obey what he has commanded us to do. This is why I am writing to you. What he commanded—that we should love each other—is nothing new; instead, it was when we first believed in Christ that we learned that we should love each other.
\v 6 This is what it means to love God and each other—we should obey what God commands us to do. What he commands us to do is love him and each other.

\p
\v 4 I rejoice very much that I have found some of your children walking in truth, just as we have received this commandment from the Father.
\v 5 Now I plead with you, lady—not as though I were writing to you a new commandment, but one that we have had from the beginning—that we should love one another.
\v 6 And this is love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, just as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.
