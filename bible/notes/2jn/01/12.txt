  * **face to face** - This can be translated "actually with you" 
  * **joy may be made full** - This can be translated "joy may be complete"
  * **The children of your chosen sister** - Here John compares this other church to a sister. And the believers that are a part of that church are compared to children. This emphasizes that all believers are a spiritual family. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
