===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - John's letter closes with  his desire to visit them and gives greetings from another church.
  * **General Information:** - The words "you" in verse 12 are singular. The word "your" in verse 13 is plural. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **I did not wish to write them with paper and ink** - John does not wish to write these other things but would like to come say the words to them. He is not saying that he would write them with something other than paper and ink. 
  * **The children of your chosen sister** - Here John speaks of this other church as if it were a sister to the readers' church and the believers that are a part of that church as if they were that church's children. This emphasizes that all believers are a spiritual family. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
