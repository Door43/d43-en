===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Tradition identifies the apostle John as the writer of this letter. Though possibly addressed to an individual woman, because he writes that they should "love one another," this is probably to a church.
  * **General Information:** - All instances of "you" and "your" in this letter are plural unless noted otherwise. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **General Information:** - In this letter, John includes himself and his readers by using the word "us" and "our" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])

  * **From the elder to the chosen lady and her children** - This is how letters were started. The name of the author can be made explicit. AT: "I, John the elder, am writing this letter to the chosen lady and her children" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the elder** - This refers to John, the apostle and disciple of Jesus. He refers to himself as "elder" either because of his old age or because he is a leader in the church.

  * **whom I love in truth** - "you people whom I truly love" 
  * **who have known the truth** - who have known the truth about God and Jesus
  * **Father ... Son** - These are important titles that describe the relationship between God and Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
