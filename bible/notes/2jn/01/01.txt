===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The elder**  - This refers to John, the apostle and disciple of Jesus. He refers to himself as "elder" either because of his old age or because he is a leader in the church. The name of the author can be made explicit: "I, John the elder, am writing." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **because of the truth that remains in us and will be with us forever** - This could be translated “because we continue to  believe the truth and will forever”
  * **The elder to the elect lady and her children** - This is how letters are started in Greek. This could be translated “I, the elder John am writing this letter to you believers.”
  * **all those** - This is a pronoun referring to fellow believers.
  * **whom I love in truth** - This could be translated  “whom I truly love"
  * **because of the truth that remains in us** - The full meaning can be made explicit: "because the truth of Jesus' message lives in us since we have believed it, and it will live in us forever."
  * **in truth and love** -This could be translated "because they are true and they love us." Alternate translation: "because they truly love us." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hendiadys]])
