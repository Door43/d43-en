=== Outline of the Book of 2 John ===

  - Greeting (1:1-3)

=== What is the Book of 2 John about? ===

John addressed this letter to someone he called "the chosen lady" and to "her children" (1:1). This could be a reference to a specific friend and her children, or it may refer to a church, a group of believers, in a specific place or everywhere. John's purpose in writing this letter was to encourage the believers and to warn them of false teachers who were taking advantage of their kindness. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

 
=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "2 John" or "Second John." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as "The Second Letter from John," or "The Second Letter John wrote." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])

=== Who wrote the Book of 2 John? ===

The letter of 2 John was probably written by the Apostle John near the end of his life. John does not identify himself as the author; instead, he calls himself "the elder." The content of 2 John closely resembles the content found in John's Gospel.

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== What is hospitality? ===

Hospitality was an important concept in the ancient Near East. It was important to be friendly towards a foreigner or outsider and provide help to them if they needed it. John distinguishes between offering hospitality towards a well-meaning guest and giving help to a false teacher who opposes the Christian faith. 

=== Who were the people John spoke against? ===

It is possible that the people John spoke against were those who would eventually become known as "Gnostics." These people believed that Jesus was completely God but that he was not really a human with a physical body on earth. The reason for this belief was based in their view that the physical world was evil. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:evil]])
