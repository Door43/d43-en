====== biblical measures of time ======

===== Definition: =====

Measures of time in the New Testament were based on watchman shifts, called "watches".

  * For the purpose of appointing watchmen to guard a city, the 12-hour period at night was divided into equal time periods called "watches".
  * The Jews divided the 12-hour night period into three watches of four hours each, while the Romans divided it into four watches of three hours each.
  * The Jews counted the beginning of the day at sunset (around 6:00 in the evening), so the "sixth hour" would have been around midnight.
  * According to the Romans' way of reckoning time, the day began at sunrise (around 6:00 in the morning).
