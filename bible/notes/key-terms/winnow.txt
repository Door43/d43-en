====== winnow, sift ======

===== Definition: =====

To winnow means to separate grain from the unwanted chaff by throwing it into the air and allowing the wind to blow the chaff away. The word "sift" refers to shaking the winnowed grain in a sieve to remove any dirt or small rocks.

  * Winnowing forks are used to throw the grain into the air.
  * In the Bible, the image of winnowing grain is used figuratively to describe how God separates righteous people from unrighteous people, or how he removes evil thoughts and behavior from his people.
