====== bless, blessed, blessing ======

===== Definition: =====

To "bless" someone or something is to state a desire for positive and beneficial things to happen to them.

  * To cause beneficial things to happen to someone or something.
  * A father would often pronounce a formal blessing on his children.
  * When God blesses something he causes it to be fruitful and to have a positive effect on others.
  * This can also be translated as, "to provide abundantly for" or "to be very kind and favorable toward". A phrase like, "God has brought great blessing to" might be translated as, "God has given many good things to" or "God has provided abundantly for" or "God has caused many good things to happen to".
  * A statement like "he is blessed" could also be translated as "he will greatly benefit" or "he will experience good things" or "God will cause him to flourish".
  * The gospels also say that Jesus "blessed" the bread and fishes before giving it out to the crowd. This is often interpreted to mean that he thanked God for the food, but it may also be referring to him enabling it to multiply to feed thousands of people.

The opposite of "bless" is "curse."
