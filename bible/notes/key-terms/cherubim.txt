====== cherubim ======

===== Definition: =====

Cherubim are heavenly creatures that God created; the singular is cherub. The Bible describes them as having wings and they are often thought of as a special type of angel. <font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>After Adam and Eve sinned, God placed cherubim with flaming swords at the east side of the Garden of Eden so that people could no longer get to the tree of life.</font>

  * God commanded the Israelites to carve two cherubim facing each other over the cover of the Ark of the Covenant, with their wings touching.
  * He also told them to weave pictures of the cherubim into the curtains of the tabernacle.
  * The cherubim were guardians of sacred or holy things.
  * Translation suggestions: "creatures that have wings" or "holy guardians" or "guardians with wings."
  * This term could also be written as it sounds like or looks like in another language, such as English.
