====== purify, purification ======


===== Definition: =====


To purify something is to make it pure and free from anything that contaminates or pollutes it. In the Bible, "purification" is mainly cleansing from things that make an object or a person ritually unclean and unfit to be in God's presence.


    * The Old Testament has many laws about how a person could be purified from unclean things such as illness, contact with a dead body, contact with body fluids, or childbirth.
    * The Old Testament also has laws about a person could be purified from sin.
    * These laws often involved a waiting period, ceremonial washing, or the sacrifice of an animal.
    * The New Testament teaches that people who trust in Jesus are purified from their sin by Jesus' sacrifice.
