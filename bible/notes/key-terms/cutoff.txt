====== Cut Off ======

In this context, "cut off" is defined as "isolated from" or "banished." The Israelite male who was not circumcised was severed from all relationships with his people.

  * To be "cut off" can also refer to being killed as an act of divine judgment.
  * Refusal of an adult male who moves in among God's people to be circumcised means he has chosen to reject God's covenant with Israel.
