====== unclean ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Bible, the term "unclean" is used figuratively to refer to things that God declared to be unfit for his people to touch or eat.

  * God gave the Israelites many instructions about not touching "unclean" things. If they did touch such things, they themselves would be declared unclean for a certain period of time.
  * Obeying God's commands about avoiding unclean things kept the Israelites holy, that is, separate and set apart for God's service.
  * A Jewish priest who touched something that God had declared to be unclean, would be considered ceremonially unclean and not fit to perform his religious duties.
  * In the Old Testament God gave the Israelites many instructions about which animals were "clean" and which ones were "unclean." The unclean animals could not be used for eating or for sacrifice.
  * Be careful that the translation of "unclean" animals does not mean the animal was dirty. Rather, it should be understood that this was a way of labeling the type of animals that God had said were not fit to be eaten or sacrificed.
  * An "unclean spirit" refers to an "evil spirit," that is, a "demon."
