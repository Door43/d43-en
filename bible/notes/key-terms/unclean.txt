====== unclean ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "unclean" means "dirty" or "stained." In the Bible, it is also used figuratively to mean, "sinful" or "imperfect" or "evil."

  * God gave the Israelites many instructions about not touching "unclean" things. Often this had to do with things that had germs or disease.
  * A Jewish priest who touched something that God had declared to be unclean, would himself be considered ceremonially unclean and not fit to perform his religious duties.
  * In the Old Testament are many instructions that God gave the Israelites about which animals were "clean" and which ones were "unclean." The unclean animals could not be used for eating or for sacrifice.
  * Be careful that the translation of "unclean" animals does not mean the animal was dirty. Rather, it should be understood that this was a way of labeling the type of animals that God had said were not fit to be eaten or sacrificed.
  * An "unclean spirit" refers to an "evil spirit" or a "demon."
