====== hour ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "hour" is used in several different ways in the Bible. Often it means "time" or "moment."

  * A phrase like "in that very hour" means "at that moment" or "at that time."
  * Sometimes "hour" refers to a regular, set time to do something such as, "the hour of prayer."
  * When the "hour had come" for Jesus to suffer and be put to death, it means that this was the "appointed time" that God had decided long ago that this would happen.
  * The Jews divided the daylight into 12 hours, beginning with sunrise and ending at sunset. Then from sunset to sunrise, 12 more hours would be counted, at which time the counting of hours would start over.
  * The Romans  began the day at midnight and counted 12 hours until noon, at which time they would start over and count 12 more hours until the next midnight.
  * Based on this, the "third hour" in the Jewish system is the same as about 9:00 in the morning in the Roman system. The "sixth hour" refers to noon and the "ninth hour" refers to 3:00 in the afternoon.
  * If it specifically says "of the night" then this would mean the time would be counted from the time of sunset (around 6:00 pm). So for example, the "third hour of the night" would be about 9:00 in the evening.
  * Often night hours were referred to in terms of a larger unit of time called a "watch." See "biblical measures of time" page for more information about this.
