====== Asia ======

===== Facts: =====

In Bible times, "Asia" was the name of a province of the Roman Empire. It was located in the westernmost part of what is modern-day Turkey.

  * Paul traveled to Asia and shared the gospel in several cities there. Among these were the cities of Ephesus and Colossae. 
  * To avoid confusion with modern day Asia, it may be necessary to translate this as, "the ancient Roman province called Asia."
  * All of the churches referenced in Revelation were in the Roman province of Asia.
