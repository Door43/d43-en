====== Biblical measures ======

===== Definition: =====

The following terms are the most common Biblical units of measure used to explain how much liquid (such as wine) or solid objects (such as grain) a certain receptacle contains.

  * bath - 22.0 liters
  * hin - 3.7 liters
  * homer - 230.0 liters
  * kab - 1.3 liters
  * kor - 220.0 liters
  * log - 0.3 liters
  * seah - 7.7 liters

There are different ways units of measure can be translated:

  - Spell the word in a way that is similar to the way the Bible term is spelled, or the way it sounds. Then give the equivalent value using a unit of measure that is known to the receptor culture. This explanation can be given in the text or in a note.
  - Directly use the equivalent amount in terms of the unit of measure that is known to the receptor culture, without using the Bible name.
