====== tabernacle ======


===== Definition: =====


The tabernacle was a special tent that the Israelites constructed as a place to worship God as they traveled from Egypt to the Promised Land. They continued to use it until King Solomon had the temple built. 

  * “Tabernacle” can be translated as: tent, tent of meeting, dwelling, or sanctuary.
  * The tabernacle had wood frames and curtains made of fabric, goat hair and animal skins.
  * When the Israelites had to move, the priests would take apart the tabernacle and carry its parts to their next campsite. Then they would set it up again.
  * They always set up the tabernacle in the center of the camp.
  * The tabernacle was in a courtyard surrounded by curtains. The courtyard had a wash basin and an altar for burning offerings. The tabernacle itself had two rooms. The front room was the holy place. It had a table with bread on it, a gold lamp stand, and an altar for burning incense. The back room, or inner room, was the most holy place and it had the ark of the covenant.
