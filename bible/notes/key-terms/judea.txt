====== Judea ======


===== Facts: =====

The term "Judea" comes from the name Judah which was one of the twelve tribes of Israel. It is used in both a narrow sense and a broad sense.

    * Sometimes "Judea" is used in a narrow sense to refer only to the province located in the southern part of ancient Israel just west of the Dead Sea. Some translations call this province "Judah."
    * Other times "Judea" has a broader sense and refers to all the provinces of ancient Israel, including Galilee, Samaria, Perea, Idumea and Judea (Judah).

If translators want to make the distinction clear, the broader sense of Judea (ex. Luke 1:5) could be translated as "Judea Country" and the narrow sense (ex. Luke 1:39) could be translated as "Judea Province" or "Judah Province" since this is the part of the land of ancient Israel where the tribe of Judah had originally lived.
