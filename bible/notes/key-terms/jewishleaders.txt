====== Jewish leaders, religious leaders ======


===== Facts: =====

The Jewish leaders were religious leaders, such as priests and experts in God's laws.

  * Many of the religious leaders did not believe that Jesus was the Messiah and Son of God. They were jealous of Jesus and did not want other people to believe in him either.
  * Some of the religious leaders did believe in Jesus--especially after he rose from the dead.
  * Many of the religious leaders believed that they were more righteous than other people, and they were too proud to admit their sins. They lied about Jesus to the Roman rulers and demanded that he be killed.
  * Jesus condemned the Jewish leaders for being hypocrites. They claimed to know God, but did not obey him.
