====== Biblical money ======

===== Description: =====

The following terms are some of the most well-known units of money that are used in the Bible. In the Old Testament, the **sheke****l** referred to a type of weight (made of gold, silver, bronze, brass or iron) that was used for money and trade. In the New Testament, a shekel was a type of silver coin.

   * shekel (weight of various materials or silver coin = 4 days' wages)
  * talent (gold or silver weight = 6,000 days' wages)
  * denarius (Roman silver coin = one day's wages)
  * drachma (Greek silver coin = one day's wages)
  * mite/lepton (copper coin = 1/64 day's wages)

How to translate Biblical units of money:

  - <font 13.63636302948px line-height: 17.8181819915772px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>Keep the Bible term, spelling it in a way that is similar to the way it sounds or is spelled in the Bible.</font>    [See: Transliterate].
  - An important reason for keeping the Bible terms is to show that the Bible is true and that people actually used these types of money during that time period.
  - <font 13.63636302948px line-height: 17.8181819915772px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>If it doesn't work to use the Bible term, then give the same value in terms of what can be earned by a day's work in Bible times or how much weight in silver or gold it represents.</font>
  - For units of money, it is important to NOT use modern money values since these will change from year to year and will cause any Bible translation that uses them to become <font 13.63636302948px line-height: 17.8181819915772px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>outdated</font>    .
