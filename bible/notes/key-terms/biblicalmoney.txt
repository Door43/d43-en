====== Biblical money ======

===== Description: =====

The following terms are some of the most well-known units of money that are used in the Bible.

  * talent (gold weight - 6,000 days' wages)
  * denarius (silver coin - one day's wages)
  * mite (copper coin - 1/64 day's wages)
  * shekel (silver weight - 4 days' wages) – used as basis for measuring other money weights

How to translate Biblical units of money:

  - Spell the word in a way that is similar to the way the Bible term sounds or is spelled.[See: transliterate]. Then give the equivalent value in terms of what can be earned by a day's work in Bible times or how much weight in silver or gold it represents. This explanation can either be in the text or in a note.
  - An important reason for using words that closely resemble the Biblical terms for money units is to show that the Bible is an historical document and that real people used these coins during that time period.
  - For units of money, it is important to NOT use modern money values since these will change from year to year and will cause any Bible translation that uses them to become <font 13.63636302948px line-height: 17.8181819915772px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>outdated</font>    .
