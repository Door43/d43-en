===== Definition: =====

To fast is to stop eating food, or certain foods and drinks, for a period of time, such as for a day or more.

  * Fasting can help people to focus on God and pray without being distracted by food.
  * Jesus condemned the Jewish religious leaders for fasting for the wrong reasons. They fasted so that others would think they were very religious people.
  * Sometimes people fast in order to show that they are very sad or grieved about something.
