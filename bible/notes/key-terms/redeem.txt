To redeem something is to buy back something that was previously owned or that was held captive. Redemption is the act of redeeming.

  * God required that the Israelites give their first-born males (human and animal) as a sacrifice to him. But they could redeem the firstborn in order to keep it alive by paying the priest a set price for it.
  * People could redeem a person who was in slavery by paying the price so that the slave could go free. The word "ransom" is also used to communicate this.
  * If someone's property was sold, a family member could redeem that property so that it would stay in the family.
  * Because of sin, all people are condemned to eternal punishment. But by dying for people's sin, Jesus paid the full payment and redeemed all those who trust in him for salvation. People who have been redeemed are no longer condemned to die.
