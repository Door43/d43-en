====== Greece, Grecian, Greek ======

===== Facts: =====

At the time of the writing of the New Testament, Greece was a province in the Roman Empire. People who are from Greece are known as "Greeks."

  * Greek was the language spoken in Greece and throughout the Roman Empire, which is why the original New Testament texts were written in Greek.
  * The term "Greek" is also used in the Bible sometimes to refer to someone who is not a Jew. This is because at that time, most non-Jewish people in the Roman Empire spoke Greek, even though they might be of a different nationality. An example of this was the Syro-Phoenician woman in Mark 7.
  * When used in this way, as reference to someone who is not a Jew, other ways to translate "Greek" would be, "Gentile" or "non-Jew."
  * A "Grecian" Jew was a Jew who spoke Greek and who had grown up in the Greek culture. Some English versions use the term "Hellenistic" instead, which is a transliteration of the Greek word.  [TA: transliteration] This is in contrast to "Hebraic" Jews, those who spoke only Hebrew.
  * Many churches were established in Greece during the first century; among these were churches that the apostle Paul began in the cities of Corinth, Thessalonica, and Phillipi.
