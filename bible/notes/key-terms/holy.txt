To be holy is to be separated from all sin and evil. <font 14.3999996185303px line-height: 15.6800003051758px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>The state of being holy is "holiness".</font>    Only God is absolutely holy, but he makes things and people holy for his glory.

  * A holy person or thing belongs to God and is set apart to serve him.
  * Since God is holy, people cannot approach him unless he allows them to, because they are mere human beings, sinful and imperfect.
  * In the Old Testament, God set apart the priests for special service to him. They had to be ceremonially cleansed of sin in order to approach God.
  * God also set apart as holy certain places and things that belonged to him or in which he revealed himself, such as "holy ground" (Exodus 3:5) or his temple.
  * To "make holy" is often translated as "sanctify" in English.
  * Ways to translate "holy" might include, "set apart for God" or "belonging to God" or "completely pure" or "perfectly sinless".
