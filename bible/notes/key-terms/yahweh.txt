====== Yahweh, I AM ======

===== Facts: =====

Yahweh is the Hebrew name that God revealed to Moses when he spoke to him from a burning bush. It means "I am". God told Moses to tell the people that his name is "I am who I am".

  * Literally Yahweh means "he is" or "he who is" and is the same verb as the title "I am" that God first told to Moses. Both forms come from the verb "to be" or "to exist".
  * This name reveals that God is eternal and self-existent–he did need anyone to create him or give him life. It also means that he is always present.
  * Many Bible versions in major languages such as English, French and Spanish have used "LORD" to represent "Yahweh," as in the phrase, "I am the LORD your God" or the "LORD God" and in many other contexts. Translators may want to translate these phrases as, "I am Yahweh your God" and "Yahweh God".
