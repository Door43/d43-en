====== scroll ======


===== Definition: =====


A scroll is a piece of papyrus or leather that is used for writing on. After writing on a scroll or  reading it, people can roll it up to give to someone else or to store.


    * If someone wanted a messenger  to deliver a scroll to someone else, he could seal it with wax. This would prevent the messenger or anyone else from opening the scroll and writing anything in it. The person who received the scroll would see the unbroken seal  and know that no one had opened it.
    * Scrolls were used for legal documents and scripture.
