====== Jesus, Jesus Christ, Christ Jesus ======

===== Facts: =====

Jesus is the Son of God. The name "Jesus" means, "Yahweh will save." Therefore, the name "Jesus" emphasizes that God's Son became a man in order to save people from their sins. "Christ" is a title that means "Messiah." It is often combined with "Jesus" as a single name.

  * In a miraculous way, the Holy Spirit caused the eternal Son of God to take on human form. Because Jesus was born of a human mother, he is a human being. But Jesus already existed as God when he was miraculously conceived in Mary's body. Therefore, he is both fully God and fully human.
