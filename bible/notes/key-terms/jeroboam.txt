====== Jeroboam ======


===== Facts: =====


Jeroboam was the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel. He ruled over the ten tribes of Israel that rebelled and separated from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin in the south.

    * Jeroboam was a very wicked king. He set up idols and encouraged the people of the kingdom of Israel to worship them, instead of worshiping Yahweh at the Temple in Jerusalem.
    * Future kings of the kingdom of Israel followed Jeroboam's evil example.
