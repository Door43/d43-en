====== create, creation ======

===== Definition: =====

As used in the Bible, the terms "create" and "creation" refer to what God did when he caused the universe to come into existence, including the earth and everything on it.

  * God created the world out of nothing. Some languages may have to say this directly to make sure that this meaning is clear.
  * Sometimes, "creation" refers specifically to what took place during the six days that God created the world, as in the phrase, "..from the time of the creation of the world" (Mark 13:35; Luke 11:50).
  * The word "creation" is also used in the Bible to refer to everything that was actually created, as in "…the creation itself will be set free from its bondage…" (Romans 8:21).
