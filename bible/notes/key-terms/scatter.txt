====== scatter, disperse ======

===== Definition: =====

To scatter objects or people means to cause them to go in many different directions.

  * The Christians were "scattered" or "dispersed" when they had to move to different regions to escape persecution.
  * Sheep scatter when there is danger; seeds can be planted by scattering them over the soil.
  * Sometimes both these words are used in the same verse with slightly different meanings. If possible, both terms should be kept in the translation as in, "I will scatter them among the nations, I will disperse them throughout the peoples." [TA: parallelism]
