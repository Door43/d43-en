====== priest ======

===== Definition: =====

A priest is someone who is chosen to relate to God on behalf of his people. God chose Aaron and his descendants to be his priests for the people of Israel.

  * The Israelite priests had the responsibility of offering the people's sacrifices to God, along with other duties in the temple.
  * Priests offered regular prayers to God on behalf of his people and performed other religious rites.
  * The priests also pronounced formal blessings on people and taught them God's laws.
  * In Jesus' time, there were different levels of priests, including the chief priests and the high priest.
  * The Bible teaches that Jesus is our Great High Priest who intercedes for us in God's presence. He offered himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin so that the sacrifices made by human priests are no longer needed.
  * God also calls every believer in Jesus a "priest".
  * Besides God's priests, there were also other priests in Bible times who presented offerings to false gods such as Baal.
  * "Priest" could be translated as "intermediary" or "mediator" or "person God appoints to represent him".
