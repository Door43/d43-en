====== Promised Land ======

===== Facts: =====

This was the land that God had promised to give to Abraham and his descendants.

  * After Abraham's descendants had lived in Canaan for many years, there was a famine and they had to move to the country of Egypt. Over 400 years later, God brought them back to Canaan.
  * Canaan was also called the "Promised Land" by Abraham's descendants.
  * Because of Israel's disobedience, God took the people out of Canaan for seventy years during the Exile. Then, he brought them back to the Promised land again.
