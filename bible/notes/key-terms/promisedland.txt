====== Promised Land ======

===== Facts: =====


This was the land that God had promised to give to Abraham and his descendants.


    * After Abraham's descendants had lived in Canaan for many years, there was a famine and they had to move to the country of Egypt.
    * God promised that he would bring Abraham's descendants back to Canaan.
    * Because of this, Abraham's descendants called  Canaan the "Promised Land."
    * Four hundred years later, God brought Abraham's descendants back to the Promised Land.
    * Many years later God took the people of Israel out of Canaan because of their disobedience. Then after they had been in exile for seventy years, God brought them back to the Promised land.
