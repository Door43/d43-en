====== Gihon ======

===== Facts: =====

Gihon is the name of one of the four rivers that flowed out from the region of Eden when God first created the world.

  * The Gihon River was said to surround the country of "Cush" which was probably near the region that is present day Ethiopia.
  * Later references to the Gihon River in the Bible may be the same river that flowed from Eden, or it may be a different one since the great flood of Noah's time greatly changed the earth's surface.
