===== Definition: =====


Dreams are things that people see, hear, and experience in their minds while they are sleeping.


    * Most of the time, the things that people experience in dreams are not really happening, although while the person is dreaming, it seems that they are.
    * Sometimes God causes people to dream about something so they can learn from it. Sometimes God may speak directly to people in their dreams.
