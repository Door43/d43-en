====== world, worldly ======

===== Definition: =====

In its most general sense, the term "world" refers to the heavens and the earth, as well as everything in them. Many times it refers <font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>only to the part of the universe that is inhabited, the earth. The term "worldly" describes the values and behaviors of people living in this world.</font>

  * In many contexts, "world" actually means, "people in the world." Sometimes it is implied that this refers to the evil people on earth or the people who do not obey God.
  * The phrase "all the world" often means "many people" and refers to the people living in a certain region. For example, "all the world came to Egypt to buy food" means that many people from the surrounding countries came. And "all the world went to their hometown" means that everyone living in regions ruled by the Roman empire went.
  * The apostles also used "world" to refer to the selfish behaviors and corrupt values of the people living in this world. This can include self-righteous religious practices which are based on human efforts. People and things characterized by these values are said to be "worldly."
