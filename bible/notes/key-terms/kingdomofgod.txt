    * The prophets said that God would establish his kingdom by sending the Messiah to rule with righteousness and to conquer his enemies.
    * Jesus is the Son of God, and the Messiah who will rule over the kingdom of God.
    * The spiritual kingdom of God has always existed in heaven because God has always reigned there.
    * The physical kingdom of God will be established on earth when Jesus, the Messiah, returns from heaven to rule as the Messiah. 
    * John the Baptist and Jesus both announced that the kingdom of God was near when Jesus was living on earth. However, Jesus came that first time in order to save sinners, rather than to establish his earthly kingdom.
