====== firstborn ======


===== Definition: =====


The firstborn refers to the initial offspring, whether of people or animals. In humans, the term refers exclusively to the first male child born to a man and woman.


    * In biblical times, the firstborn son was given a place of prominence and twice as much of his family inheritance as the other sons.
    * This concept can also be used figuratively. For example, the nation of Israel is called God's firstborn son because God gave it special privileges over other nations. And the Son of God is called God's firstborn because of his importance and authority over everyone else.
    * This could also be translated as, "the son who was born first" or, "the eldest son" or, "the number one son."
