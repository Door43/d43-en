====== Cain ======

===== Facts: =====

Cain and his younger brother Abel were the first sons of Adam and Eve mentioned in the Bible.

  * Cain was a farmer who produced food crops while Abel was a sheep herder.
  * Cain killed his brother Abel in a fit of jealousy, because God had accepted Abel's sacrifice, but had not accepted Cain's sacrifice.
  * As punishment, God sent him away from Eden and told him that the land would no longer yield crops for him.
