====== sons of God ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Old Testament, the term "sons of God" is usually used in reference to angelic beings. In the New Testament, it refers to all believers in Jesus and is often translated as "children of God."

  * In Genesis 6, some people interpret "sons of God" to be fallen angels, that is, evil spirits or demons. Others think it may refer to powerful political rulers or to the descendants of Seth.
  * Since there are several possible interpretations of this term, it is important to translate it fairly literally, if possible.
