====== Herod the Great ======


===== Facts: =====

There are several rulers named Herod in the Bible. Herod the Great was a non-Jew who was the king of Judea at the time Jesus was born.


    * He was famous for the work he ordered to be done on the Jewish temple in Jerusalem.
    * He was cruel and had many people killed. When he heard that another king of the Jews had been born in Bethlehem, he had all the baby boys there killed.
    * His sons, Herod Antipas and Herod Philip, and his grandson Herod Agrippa later became rulers in Judea. His great-grandson Herod Agrippa II (called King Agrippa) also ruled over the entire area of Judea.
