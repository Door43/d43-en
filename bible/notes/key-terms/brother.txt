====== brother ======

===== Definition: =====

A brother is a male who shares at least one biological parent with another person. There are also some figurative meanings of this word:

  * In the Old Testament the term "brothers" is often used figuratively as a general reference to relatives, such as members of the same tribe, clan, or people group. Possible translations could also include, "relatives" or "clan members."
  * In the New Testament, the apostles often used "brothers" to refer to fellow Christians, including both men and women, since all believers in Christ are members of one spiritual family, with God as their heavenly Father.
  * The apostles also used the term "sister" when referring specifically to a fellow Christian who was a woman, or to emphasize that both men and women are being included. For example, when James says, "a brother or sister who is in need of food or clothing," he is emphasizing that he is talking about all believers.
  * If your language has a general term like "brothers" that can be used to refer to all believers, including both men and women, then this term should be used. However, if a term would make it sound like women are not included, then it would be better to find a different term such as "fellow believers" or "Christian brothers and sisters."
