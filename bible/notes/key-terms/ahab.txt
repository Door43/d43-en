====== Ahab ======


===== Facts: =====

Ahab was a very evil king who ruled over the northern kingdom of Israel.

  * King Ahab was wicked and encouraged the people of the kingdom of Israel to worship false gods.
  * The prophet Elijah confronted Ahab and told him that there would be a severe drought for three and a half years as a punishment for the sins that Ahab caused Israel to commit.
  * Ahab had 450 prophets to the false god named Baal. Elijah challenged those prophets and proved that Yahweh is the only true God.
