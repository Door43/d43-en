====== test ======


===== Definition: =====


A test refers to difficult circumstances God allows in a person's life. To "put something to a test" can also be used to mean, "to challenge something or someone for proof."

    * God sometimes uses tests to expose peoples sin. 
    * God also sometimes uses tests to demonstrate the people trust him.
    * God often uses Satan as the agent of testing in the Bible. 
    * Unlike God, Satan does not simply test people, but instead he temps them to sin. 
    * People do not have the right to "put God to a test" because he is always faithful and holy.
