====== guilt, guilty ======


===== Definition: =====


Guilt is the fact of having sinned or committed a crime.


    * To be guilty means, "to have done something morally wrong," that is, "to have disobeyed God."
    * People who are guilty deserve to be punished.
    * Some languages might translate "guilt" as, "the weight of one's sins" or, "the counting of one's sins."


The opposite of "guilty" is "innocent."
