====== deacon ======

===== Definition: =====

A deacon is a person who ministers to fellow believers in the area of practical needs, such as managing money and taking care of the needy.

  * The word "deacon" is taken directly from a Greek word meaning "servant" or "minister".
  * From the time of the early Christians, being a deacon has been a well-defined role and ministry in the Church body.
  * For example, in the New Testament, deacons would make sure that whatever money or food that the believers shared would be distributed fairly to the widows among them.
  * The term "deacon" could also be translated as, "church minister" or "church worker" or "church servant", or some other phrase that shows that the person has been formally appointed to do specific tasks that benefit the local Christian community.
