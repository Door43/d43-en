====== windows of heaven ======

===== Definition: =====

The expression, "windows of heaven" is part of an idiom that refers to something coming from the sky or from heaven.

  * Just as a window of a building usually can be opened, the Bible talks about the "windows of heaven" being "opened." This can refer to:
      * rain coming from the sky.
      * God greatly blessing his people.
  * Many translations translate "windows" as "floodgates."
  * This could be translated with a different idiom or more literally, such as,  "great torrents of rain came down" or "God sent great blessings."
