====== threshing floor ======

===== Definition: =====

A threshing floor is a place for separating food grain from the unwanted chaff and straw.

  * Threshing floors in Bible times were made of a large flat rock or packed down dirt, giving a hard, level surface to collect the threshed grain.
  * Plants to be threshed were first beaten (or trampled by oxen) to separate the straw from the grain and the chaff. Then the grain and chaff were tossed into the air, allowing the wind to blow the chaff away while the grain fell back to the threshing floor.
