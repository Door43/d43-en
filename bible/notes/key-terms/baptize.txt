====== baptize, baptism ======

===== Definition: =====

In the New Testament, the terms "baptize" and "baptism" usually refer to putting water on a believer in Jesus to show he has been cleansed from his sins and that he is now united with Christ.

  * Baptism is a way for believers to show that they have repented of their sins and have turned away from their former, ungodly way of life in order to follow Jesus.
  * Another meaning of baptism is that it shows that a person is completely united with Christ in his death, burial and resurrection.
  * Christians have different opinions about how a person should be baptized. Some pour or sprinkle the water on the person being baptized, while others put the person completely under the water. It is probably best to translate this term in a general way that could include different ways of applying the water.
  * Jesus also used the term "baptism" to refer to the experience of going through great suffering.
  * John (the baptizer) told people that Jesus was going to baptize people with the Holy Spirit and with fire. This may refer in part to the time years later when the Holy Spirit was poured out on the apostles, appearing as little flames of fire over their heads.
