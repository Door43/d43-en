  * The Bible teaches that God's love is centered in giving up one's own desires or needs in order to help someone else.
  * Jesus loved us by sacrificing everything, including his life, in order to rescue us from sin and death. He also taught his followers to love others sacrificially.
  * Some ways that different languages talk about loving someone include: "He put him in his heart" or, "His thoughts were towards him" or, "He feels good-heart toward him."
  * Sometimes "love" is used in another sense of being committed to an ideal such as truth or justice.
  * In English it is often used to mean "like very much" which states a strong preference for a type of food, activity or thing, as in "She loves to cook" or "He loves rice". But this way of using "love" is very different than the kind of love the Bible talks about.
  * Some languages have to express "love" as an action, so for example "Love is patient, love is kind…" would be translated as "When a person loves someone, he is patient with him and kind to him…".
  * Other ways to translate "to love" could be, "to act in a kind way toward" or "to do good things for" or "to do more good for another person than for oneself".
