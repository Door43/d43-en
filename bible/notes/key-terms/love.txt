  * In the New Testament there is one word that is always used for the kind of love that God has. This kind of love is unselfish, sacrificial and always thinks of what will be best for the person who is loved.
  * When people love others with this kind of love, it involves actions that are selfless and that cause the other person to thrive. It is also used to refer to parents loving their children.
  * The Bible teaches that love that comes from God means giving up one's own desires or needs in order to help someone else.
  * Jesus loved us by sacrificing everything, including his life, in order to rescue us from sin and death. He also taught his followers to love others sacrificially.

  * Some languages have to express "love" as an action, so for example "Love is patient, love is kind…" would be translated as "When a person loves someone, he is patient with him and kind to him…".
  * Other ways to translate "to love" could be, "to act in a kind way toward" or "to do good things for" or "to do more good for another person than for oneself".
