\v 3 They were singing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb:
\q "Great and marvelous are your works, 
\q2 Lord God, who rules over all. 
\q Just and true are your ways, 
\q2 King of the nations.
\q
\v 4 Who will not fear you, Lord, 
\q2 and glorify your name?
\q For you alone are holy.
\q2 All nations will come 
\q2 and worship before you
\q because your righteous acts have been made known."
