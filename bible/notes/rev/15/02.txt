\v 2 I saw what looked like an ocean that looked as though it was made of glass and mixed with fire. I also saw the people who had overcome the beast by not worshiping it or its image, and by not allowing its servant to mark them with the number that represents the beast's name. They were standing by the ocean that looked as though it was made of glass. They had harps for praising God.

\v 2 I saw what appeared to be a sea of glass mixed with fire, and standing beside the sea were those who had been victorious over the beast and his image, and over the number representing his name. They were holding harps given to them by God.
