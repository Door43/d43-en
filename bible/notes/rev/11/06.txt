\v 6 These witnesses have authority to close up the sky so no rain will fall during the time when they prophesy. They have power to turn the waters to blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague whenever they wish.
\v 7 When they will have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up from the bottomless pit will make war against them. He will conquer them and kill them.
