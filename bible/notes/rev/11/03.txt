===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - God continues speaking to John.

  * **for 1,260 days** - "for one thousand two hundred and sixty days" or "for twelve hundred and sixty days" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **clothed in sackcloth** - Why they will wear sackcloth can be made explicit. AT: "wearing rough mourning clothes" or "they will wear scratchy clothes to show that they are very sad" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **These witnesses are** - John explains who these witness are.
  * **These witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that have stood before the Lord of the earth** - The two olive trees and the two lampstands symbolize these people, but they are not literally the people. AT: "The two olive trees and the two lampstands that have stood before the Lord of the earth represent these witnesses" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_symlanguage]])
  * **the two olive trees and the two lampstands** - John expects his readers to know about them because many years earlier another prophet had written about them. AT: "the two olive trees and the two lampstands that scripture tells about" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **fire comes out of their mouth and devours their enemies** - Because this is about future events, it can also be stated in the future tense. AT: "fire will come out of their mouth and devour their enemies"
  * **fire ... devours their enemies** - Fire burning and killing people is spoken of as if it were an animal that could eat them up. AT: "fire ... will destroy their enemies" or "fire ... will completely burn up their enemies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
