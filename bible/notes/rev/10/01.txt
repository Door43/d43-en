===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - John begins to describe a vision of a mighty angel holding a scroll. In John's vision he is viewing what is happening from earth. This takes place between the blowing of the sixth and seventh trumpets.

  * **He was robed in a cloud** - John speaks of the angel as if he were wearing a cloud as his clothing. This expression may be understood as metaphor. However, because very unusual things were often seen in visions, it might be understood as a literally true statement in its context. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **His face was like the sun** - "his face was bright like the sun" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **his feet were like pillars of fire** - The word "feet" refers to the legs. AT: "his legs were like pillars of fire" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **he put his right foot on the sea and his left on the land** - "he stood with his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land."
