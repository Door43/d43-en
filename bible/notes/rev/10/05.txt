<usfm>
\v 5 Then the angel whom I had seen standing on the ocean and the land raised his right hand toward heaven,
\v 6 and he asked the one who lives forever, the one who created heaven and everything that is in it, \add who created\add* the earth and everything that is in it, and  \add who created\add* the ocean and everything that is in it, to affirm that what he said was true. \add He said that he\add* would surely no longer delay  \add what he had planned\add*.
\v 7 He said that when the time  \add came\add* for the seventh angel to blow his trumpet, \add he\add* would complete God's secret plan, just like he announced  \add long ago\add* to his servants, the prophets.

\v 5 Then the angel whom I had seen standing on the ocean and the land raised his right hand toward heaven,
\v 6 and he asked the one who lives forever, the one who created heaven and everything that is in it, who created the earth and everything that is in it, and who created the ocean and everything that is in it, to say that what he was going to say was true. The angel said that he would surely no longer delay what he had planned.
\v 7 He said that when the time came for the seventh angel to blow his trumpet, God's secret plan would be finished, just as he announced long ago to his servants, the prophets.

<usfm>
\v 5 The angel that I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his right hand to heaven,
\v 6 and swore by him who lives for ever and ever, who created the heavens and the things that are in them, the earth and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things that are in it, that there will no longer be any delay.
\v 7 Instead, in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound his trumpet, then the mystery of God will be achieved, as he announced to his servants the prophets.
