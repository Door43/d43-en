\v 8 Then the fourth angel poured out on the sun the wine that was in his bowl. He enabled the sun to scorch people with fire.
\v 9 So the people were severely burned, and they said evil things about God because he had the power to make them suffer in these ways. But they still refused to turn away from their evil behavior and refused to praise him.
