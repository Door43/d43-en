\v 12 The sixth angel poured out his bowl into the great river, the Euphrates, and its water was dried up in order to prepare the way for the kings that come from the east.
\v 13 I saw three unclean spirits that looked like frogs coming out of the mouths of the dragon, of the beast, and of the false prophet.
\v 14 For they are spirits of demons performing miraculous signs. They were going out to the kings of the whole world in order to gather them together for the battle on the great day of God, who rules over all.
