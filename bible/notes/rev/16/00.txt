====== Revelation 16 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 16:5-7, which are extended quotations.

This chapter forms the conclusion of a major section of the book of Revelation, ending the period of wrath or great [[:en:obe:kt:judge|judgment]] by God. 


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "The most holy place" ==

This statement has led some scholars to believe the Jewish temple reflected a scene in [[:en:obe:kt:heaven|heaven]].

== Seven bowl judgments ==
This chapter reveals judgments called the seven bowl judgments. The judgments are pictured as being poured out, emphasizing their quickness and totality. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]).

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

The tone of this chapter is meant to shock the reader. This should not be minimized in translation. 

== Armageddon ==

This is a word in Hebrew. Paul does not "translate" this word into Greek but chooses to "transliterate" it by transfer it into Greek using Greek letters instead of Hebrew letters. The translators of the ULB and UDB have not translated this word either. The translator should try to form the sounds of this without translating its meaning.
