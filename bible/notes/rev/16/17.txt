\v 17 The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air. Then a loud voice came out of the most holy place and from the throne, saying, "It is done!"
\v 18 There were flashes of lightning, rumbles, crashes of thunder, and a terrible earthquake—an earthquake greater than any that has ever happened since human beings have been on the earth, so great was this earthquake.
\v 19 The great city was split into three parts, and the nations' cities collapsed. Then God called to mind Babylon the great, and he gave that city the cup filled with the wine made from his furious wrath.

God completely destroys Babylon.

  * **poured out his bowl** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:rev:16:02|16:2]].
  * **Then a loud voice came out of the most holy place and from the throne** - This means someone sitting on the throne or someone standing near the throne spoke loudly. It is unclear who is speaking.
  * **The great city was split **- AT: "The earthquake split the great city"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Then God called to mind** - "Then God remembered" or "Then God thought of" or "Then God started to pay attention to." The reader should not think that God remembered something he had forgotten.
  * **he gave that city the cup filled with the wine made from his furious wrath** - God severely punished the people and made them suffer badly. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he gave that city the cup** - "he forced that city to drink from the cup"
