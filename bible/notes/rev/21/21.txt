===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **pearls** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:rev:17:03|17:4]].
  * **Lord God...and the Lamb are its temple** - The temple represented God's presence. This means the new Jerusalem does not need a temple since God and the Lamb will live there. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
