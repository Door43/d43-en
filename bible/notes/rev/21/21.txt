===== translationNotes: =====

  * **pearls** - beautiful and valuable white beads. They are formed inside the shell of a certain kind of small animal that lives in the ocean. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:17:03|17:4]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **each of the gates was made from a single pearl** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "someone had made each of the gates from a single pearl" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **pure gold, like transparent glass** - The gold was so clear that it is spoken of as if it was glass. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:21:18|21:18]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Lord God ... and the Lamb are its temple** - The temple represented God's presence. This means the new Jerusalem does not need a temple because God and the Lamb will live there. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
