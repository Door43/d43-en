It is unclear why this chapter gives such attention to the details of the new Jerusalem.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

Death is a type of separation. The first death is a physical death, the separation of the soul from the body. The second death is the eternal separation from God. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:death|Death]], [[:en:obe:kt:soul|soul]] and [[:en:obe:kt:eternity|eternal]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Book of Life ==
The is a metaphor for eternal life. Those possessing eternal life are said to have their names written in this Book of Life. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== New heaven and new earth ==
It is unclear whether this is an entirely new heaven and earth or if it is remade out of the present heaven and earth. The same is also true of the new Jerusalem. It is possible this will affect translation in some languages.
