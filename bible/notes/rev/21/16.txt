<usfm>
\v 16 The city was laid out in a square; its length was the same as its width. He measured the city with the measuring rod, 12,000 stadia in length (its length, width, and height were the same).
\v 17 He also measured its wall, 144 cubits thick by human measurement (which is also the angel's measure).
