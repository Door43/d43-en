\v 3 Then I heard someone near the throne of God speak in a loud voice. It said, "Listen to this! Now God will live with people. He will live right in the midst of them! They will be his people. God himself will be with them, and he will be their God.
\v 4 He will cause them to be sad no longer. He will stop them from weeping ever again. None of them will ever again die or mourn or cry or suffer pain because the things that used to make them sad will have all passed away."

\v 3 I heard a great voice from the throne saying, "Look! The dwelling of God is with human beings, and he will live with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and he will be their God.
\v 4 He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and there will be no more death, or grieving, or crying, or pain. The former things have passed away.
