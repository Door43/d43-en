<usfm>
\v 26 The people of the world will also bring their wealth into the city.
\v 27 Nothing that is morally impure, no one who does deeds that God considers detestable, and no one who tells lies will ever enter that city. Only those people whose names are written in the book that belongs to the lamb, the book that has the names of people who have eternal life, will be there.

<usfm>
\v 26 They will bring the splendor and the honor of the nations into it,
