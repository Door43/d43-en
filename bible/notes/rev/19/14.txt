\v 14 The armies of heaven were following him. They were riding on white horses. They were wearing clothes made of clean white linen.
\v 15 A sharp sword extends from his mouth; with it he will strike the rebellious people-groups. He himself will rule them powerfully, as though he had an iron rod. He will crush his enemies just like a person crushes grapes in a winepress. He will do this for God Almighty, who is furiously angry with them because of their sins.
\v 16 On his cloak close to his thigh a name had been written, which is "King who rules over all other kings and Lord who rules over all other lords."
