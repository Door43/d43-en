\v 14 The armies of heaven were following him. They were riding on white horses. They were wearing clothes made of clean white linen.
\v 15 A sharp sword extends from his mouth; with it he will strike the rebellious people groups. He himself will rule them powerfully as though he had an iron rod. He will crush his enemies as a person crushes grapes in a winepress. He will do this for God Almighty, who is furiously angry with them because of their sins.
\v 16 On his cloak close to his thigh a name had been written: "King who rules over all other kings and Lord who rules over all other lords."

\v 14 The armies of heaven were following him on white horses, dressed in fine linen, white and clean.
\v 15 Out of his mouth goes a sharp sword with which he strikes down the nations, and he will rule them with an iron rod. He tramples in the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God, who rules over all.
\v 16 He has written on his robe and on his thigh a name, KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.
