\v 7 We should rejoice, we should be extremely glad, and we should honor him,
\q1 because it is now time for Jesus, the one who is like a lamb, to be united
\q1 permanently with his people, which will be like a man \f + \ft metaphor \f* marrying his bride, and
\q1 because those who belong to him have prepared themselves to be united with him.
\q1
\v 8 God has permitted them to be completely pure, like a bride who \f + \ft metaphor \f* dresses in fine linen that is bright and clean.
