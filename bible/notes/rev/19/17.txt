===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **standing in the sun**  - "standing in the light of the sun".
    * **Come eat the flesh of kings**  - With all of the people listed in this verse, they are dead bodies.  The image is of dead bodies strewn throughout a battlefield.
    * **both free and slave, the unimportant and the powerful**  - "free and slave" and "unimportant and the powerful" are both Merism, which is stating two extremes to refer to those extremes and everything in between.  The fact that there are two pairs indicates parallelism to emphasize the sureness and totality of what will happen (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]], [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
