\v 17 I saw an angel standing in the sun. He called out in a loud voice to all the birds flying overhead, "Come, gather together for the great feast of God.
\v 18 Come eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of commanders, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all men, both free and slave, the unimportant and the powerful."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I saw an angel standing in the sun** - Here "the sun" is a metonym for the light of the sun. AT: "Then I saw an angel standing in the light of the sun" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **both free and slave, the unimportant and the powerful** - The angel uses these two sets of opposite-meaning words together to mean all people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
