=== What is the Book of Revelation about? ===

John’s goal in writing the book of Revelation is to encourage the readers to remain faithful to Jesus Christ and to give them hope because the time of Jesus’ returning is near (1:3, 22:7).  He wrote to all Christians generally and seven specific churches in chapters 2-3.  John labels his own writing as prophecy (1:3) and uses many images throughout the book to describe the things he saw.  The book is similar to some sections of the Old Testament, specifically Zechariah 6:1-8.  The seven trumpets and seven bowls are also very similar to the plagues which God sent to punish Egypt (Exodus 7-9).  Revelation talks about the end of time, that Jesus will be victorious, and all who put their trust in him will live forever with him.  Let this book warn you and give you hope that Jesus is returning soon. 

=== Who wrote the Book of Revelation? ===
