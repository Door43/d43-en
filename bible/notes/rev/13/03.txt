\v 3 One of the heads of the beast looked as if someone had wounded it so that it died. But its wound had healed. 
 As a result, all the people of the earth marveled at the beast and followed it.
\v 4 They also worshiped the dragon because he had given the beast authority to rule over them. They also worshiped the beast and said, "No one is as powerful as the beast! Who could ever fight against it?"
