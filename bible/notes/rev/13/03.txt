\v 3 One of the beast's heads appeared to have a lethal wound that would have caused his death. But that wound had been healed, and the whole earth marveled and followed the beast.
\v 4 They also worshiped the dragon, for he had given his authority to the beast. They worshiped the beast, too, and kept saying, "Who is like the beast? and "Who can fight against him?"
