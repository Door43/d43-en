\v 12 While the first beast watched, it used all the \add same\add* authority \add to rule people that the first beast had\add*. It forced the people who live on the earth \f + \ft metonymy, doublet \f* to worship the first beast, that is, the one who was healed of the wound that had caused it to almost die.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 Then I saw another beast come up from the earth. It had two small horns on its head as a sheep has. But it spoke harshly as a dragon does.
\v 12 It rules people with power in order to do what the first beast wants. It forces the people who live on the earth to worship the first beast, that is, the beast that almost died but whose wound was healed.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 11 Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth. He had two horns like a lamb and he spoke like a dragon.
\v 12 He exercised all the authority of the first beast in his presence, and made the earth and those who live on it worship the first beastâ€”the one whose lethal wound had been healed.
