\v 13 The second beast also did awesome miracles, even causing fire from the sky to fall to earth while people watched.
\v 14 He did these miracles on behalf of the first beast. By doing that, he deceived the people on the earth so that they thought they should worship the first beast. But this happened only because God allowed it to happen. The second beast told the people living on earth to make an idol to represent the first beast, the one that someone had almost killed.

<usfm>
\v 13 He performed mighty miracles, even making fire come down on the earth from heaven in front of people,
\v 14 and by the signs he was permitted to do, he  deceived those who lived on the earth, telling them to make an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword, but still he lived.
