\v 15 The merchants who sold these things and who had become rich will stand far away because they will be afraid that they will suffer just as the city has. They will weep and mourn,
\v 16 and they will say, 'Terrible things have happened to that great city! That city was like a woman, dressed in clothes made of fine linen cloth and expensive cloth dyed purple and crimson, and adorned with gold, precious stones, and pearls.
\v 17 But suddenly and swiftly God has destroyed all these expensive things.' Every ship captain, all people who travel by ship, all sailors, and all others who earn their living by traveling on the ocean will stand far away from the city.

\v 15 The merchants of these goods who became rich by her will stand away from her at a distance because of the fear of her torment, weeping and loud mourning.
\v 16 They will say, 
\q "Woe, woe to the great city
\q2 that was dressed in fine linen, 
\q3 in purple, and in scarlet, 
\q2 and was adorned with gold, 
\q3 precious jewels, and pearls!"
\q
\v 17 In a single hour all that wealth has been wasted.
\m
Every ship's captain, every seafaring man, sailors, and all whose living is made from the sea, stood off at a distance.
