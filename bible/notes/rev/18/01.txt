\v 1 After this I saw another angel, one who had great authority, coming down from heaven. The earth became bright because he was shining so intensely.
\v 2 He shouted with a very loud voice, "God is about to completely destroy the very evil city of Babylon. As a result, all kinds of evil spirits will live there, and all kinds of foul and detestable birds will live there. Babylon is like a prostitute
\v 3 with whom all the people-groups have committed acts of sexual immorality. God is very angry with them. Yes, and the kings of the earth have done the same things with her. And the world's merchants became rich because she wanted to commit so much sexual immorality."

\v 1 After these things I saw another angel coming down out of the sky, having great authority.  The earth was illumined with his glory.
\v 2 He cried out with a powerful voice, saying, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great. She has become a dwelling place of demons, a prison of every unclean spirit, and a prison of every unclean and hated bird.
\v 3 For all the nations have drunk the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality. The kings of the earth committed sexual immorality with her. The merchants of the earth became rich by the power of her excessive lust."
