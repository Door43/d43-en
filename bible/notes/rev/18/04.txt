\q
\v 4 Then I heard another voice from heaven say, 
\q2 "Come out from her, my people, 
\q3 so that you may not share in her sins, 
\q2 and so that you not receive any of her plagues.
\q
\v 5 Her sins have piled up as high as heaven, 
\q2 and God has remembered her evil actions.
\q
\v 6 Pay her back as she has paid others back, 
\q2 and repay her double for what she has done; 
\q2 in the cup she mixed, mix double the amount for her.
