\v 8 So in one day terrible calamities\f + \ft Or: troubles \f* will come upon them. \add The people in those cities\add* will die, others will mourn for them, people will be hungry  \add because there will be no food\add*, and  \add their cities\add* will be burned up.

\v 7 To the same extent that Babylon, like a woman, has honored herself and done the things she wanted to do, to that extent torment her and cause her to grieve. Do that because in her mind she thought, 'I rule as a queen! I am not a widow, and I will never mourn as widows do!'
\v 8 So in one day, terrible calamities will come upon her. The people in that city will die, others will mourn for them, people will be hungry because there will be no food, and the city will burn up. The Lord God is able to punish her because he is mighty."

\q 
\v 7 As she glorified herself and lived in luxury, 
\q2 give her just as much torture and grief. 
\q For she says in her heart, 
\q2 'I am seated like a queen; 
\q I am not a widow, 
\q2 and I will never see mourning.'
\q
\v 8 Therefore in one day her plagues will overtake her: 
\q2 death, mourning, and famine. 
\q She will be consumed by fire, 
\q2 for the Lord God is mighty, and he is her judge."
