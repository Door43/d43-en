\v 7 To the same extent that Babylon, like a woman, has honored herself and done the things she wanted to do, to that extent torment her and cause her to grieve. Do that because in her minds she thought, 'I rule as a queen! I am not a widow, and I will never mourn as widows do!'
\v 8 So in one day terrible calamities will come upon her. The people in that city will die, others will mourn for them, people will be hungry because there will be no food, and the city will burn up. The Lord God is able to punish those her because he is mighty."

<usfm>
\v 7 However much she glorified herself and grew out of control, give her just as much torment and mourning. For she says in her heart, 'I sit as a queen, and am not a widow, and shall in no way see mourning.'
\v 8 Because of this in one day her plagues will come: death, mourning, and hunger. She will be burned completely with fire, because the Lord God  who judges her is mighty."
