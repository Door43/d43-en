\v 7 To the same extent that they have honored themselves and done the things that they wanted to do, to that extent torment them and cause them to grieve. \add Do that because\add* in their minds they think, 'We rule as queens! We are not widows, and we will never mourn  \add as widows do!\add*'
\v 8 So in one day terrible calamities\f + \ft Or: troubles \f* will come upon them. \add The people in those cities\add* will die, others will mourn for them, people will be hungry  \add because there will be no food\add*, and  \add their cities\add* will be burned up. The Lord God is able to punish those cities  \add like that\add*, because he is mighty."

\v 7 To the same extent that Babylon, like a woman, has honored herself and done the things she wanted to do, to that extent torment her and cause her to grieve. Do that because in her mind she thought, 'I rule as a queen! I am not a widow, and I will never mourn as widows do!'
\v 8 So in one day, terrible calamities will come upon her. The people in that city will die, others will mourn for them, people will be hungry because there will be no food, and the city will burn up. The Lord God is able to punish her because he is mighty."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q 
\v 7 As she glorified herself and lived in luxury, 
\q2 give her just as much torture and grief. 
\q For she says in her heart, 
\q2 'I am seated as a queen; 
\q I am not a widow, 
\q2 and I will never see mourning.'
\q
\v 8 Therefore in one day her plagues will come: 
\q2 death, mourning, and famine. 
\q She will be consumed by fire, 
\q2 for the Lord God is mighty, and he is her judge."
