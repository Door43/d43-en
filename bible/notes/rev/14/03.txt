\v 3 The 144,000 people were singing a new song while they stood in front of the throne, in front of the four living creatures, and in front of the elders. Only the 144,000 people, the ones whom the lamb had redeemed from among the people on the earth, could learn that song. No one else could learn that song.
\v 4 Those 144,000 are the people who did not corrupt themselves with women; they were chaste. They are the ones who follow the lamb wherever he goes. These are the ones whom the lamb had redeemed for God from among the people of earth; they are the ones whom the lamb had first offered to God and to himself.
\v 5 These people never lied when they spoke, and they never acted immorally.

\v 3 They sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except for the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth.
\v 4 These are the ones that have not defiled themselves with women, for they have kept themselves sexually pure. It is these who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were redeemed out of humanity as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.
\v 5 No lie was found in their mouth, for they are blameless.
