===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Fallen, fallen** - This word is repeated for emphasis.
  * **Fallen...brought much wrath on her** - Here Babylon represents a city like the ancient city of Babylon that was large, wealthy and sinful. "The great city of Babylon is completely destroyed! God has punished the city of Babylon because she has persuaded people of all the nations to forsake God, just like a prostitute persuades men to drink strong wine and as then commit sexual immorality."
