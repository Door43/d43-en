====== Revelation 14 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "Victorious over the beast" ==
This is victory in the [[:en:obe:kt:spirit|spiritual]] battles occurring during this time. While most spiritual battles cannot be seen, the book of Revelation pictures a time of great spiritual battles openly occurring. 

== Mark of the beast ==
John has spent some time discussing the mark given by the beast. Many scholars believe this chapter teaches those who receive this mark will face [[:en:obe:kt:eternity|eternal]] punishment in hell. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Harvest ==
This is a common image used in Scripture. The harvest illustrates a time when good things come to fruition. It is commonly used to refer to people coming to [[:en:obe:kt:faith|faith]] in Jesus, but this is not how John uses it here. It is used to describe the culmination of God's plans.
