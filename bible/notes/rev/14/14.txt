\v 14 Then I was surprised to see a white cloud, and on the cloud \add someone\add* was sitting who looked like the one who came from heaven. He \add was wearing\add* a golden crown on his head. In his hand \add he held\add* a sharp sickle.
\v 15 Another angel came out of the temple \add in heaven\add*. In a loud voice, \add speaking figuratively about gathering people for God to judge them\add*, he said to the one who was sitting on the cloud, "The time has come to reap \add the grain on the earth\add*, so with your sickle \add reap\add* the \add grain\add*, because the grain on the earth is ripe."
\v 16 The one who was sitting on the cloud forcefully gathered together \add all the people\add* on earth, \add as\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add a farmer\add* reaps grain with his sickle.

\v 14 Then I saw another surprising thing. It was a white cloud, and on the cloud someone was sitting who looked like the Son of Man. He was wearing a golden crown on his head. In his hand he held a sharp sickle.
\v 15 Still another angel came out of the temple in heaven. In a loud voice, he said to the one who was sitting on the cloud, "The time has come to reap the grain on the earth, so with your sickle reap the grain because the grain is ripe."
\v 16 Then the one who was sitting on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and he harvested the earth.

\v 14 I looked, and there was a white cloud. Seated on the cloud was one like a Son of Man. He had a golden crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand.
\v 15 Then another angel came out of the temple and called with a loud voice to the one sitting on the cloud: "Take your sickle and start to reap. For the time to reap has come, since the harvest of the earth is ripe."
\v 16 Then the one who was sitting on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested.
