\v 13 The people whose bodies were buried in the sea became alive again in order to stand before God's throne. Everyone who had been buried on the land became alive again also, in order to stand before the throne. God judged each one of them according to what each one had done.
\v 14 All the unbelievers—those who had been in the place where they waited after they died—were thrown into the burning lake. The burning lake is the place in which people die the second time.
\v 15 God also threw the people whose names were not in the book, the one where God has written the names of the people who have eternal life, into the lake of fire.

\v 13 The sea gave up the dead who were in it. Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them, and they were judged according to what they had done.
\v 14 Death and hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death—the lake of fire.
\v 15 If anyone's name was not found written in the Book of Life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.
