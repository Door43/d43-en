<usfm>
\v 5 The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection.
\v 6 Blessed and holy is anyone who takes part in the first resurrection! The second death has no power over such as these. They will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him for a thousand years.
