\v 1 Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven. He had the key to the deep, dark pit, and he was carrying a large chain in his hand.
\v 2 He seized the dragon. That dragon is the ancient serpent, the devil, that is, Satan. The angel bound him with the chain. That chain could not be loosed for one thousand years.
\v 3 The angel threw him into the deep, dark pit. He shut the door of the pit, locked it, and sealed it to prevent anyone from opening it. He did that in order that Satan might no longer deceive the people-groups until those one thousand years are ended. After that time, Satan must go free for a short time in order that he can do what God has planned.

\v 1 Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven. He had the key to the bottomless pit, and he had a great chain in his hand.
\v 2 He took hold of the dragon, the old serpent, which is the devil, or Satan, and bound him for a thousand years.
\v 3 He threw him into the bottomless pit, he shut it and sealed it over him. This was so that he would not deceive the nations anymore until the thousand years were over. After that, he must be set free for a short amount of time.
