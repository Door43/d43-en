\v 4 I saw thrones on which people were sitting. God gave them authority to judge. I also saw the souls of other people whose heads had been cut off because they had spoken the truth about Jesus and declared God's message. They were people who had refused to worship the beast or its image, and who did not allow the beast's servants to put the beast's mark on them, either on their foreheads or on their hands. They became alive again, and they ruled with Christ during those one thousand years.

\v 4 I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and power to judge was given to them. I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God, and who had not worship the beast, nor his image, and had  not receive the mark on their foreheads or on their hands. They lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
