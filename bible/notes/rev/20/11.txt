\v 11 Then I saw a huge white throne on which God was sitting. He was so fearsome that the earth and the sky disappeared from his presence completely; they were no more.
\v 12 I saw that the people who had died but now lived again were standing in front of the throne. They were both important and unimportant people! The books in which God records what people do were opened. Another book was also opened, which is the book of life in which God has written the names of people who have eternal life. God judged the people who had died and now lived again according to what they had done, just as he had recorded it in the books.

\v 11 Then I saw a great white throne and the one who is seated on it. The earth and the heaven fled away from his presence, but there was no place for them to go.
\v 12 I saw the dead—the mighty and the unimportant—standing before the throne, and the books were opened. Then another book was opened—the Book of Life. The dead were judged by what was recorded in the books, the result of what they had done.

===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **The earth and the heaven fled away from his presence, but there was no place for them to go** - John describes heaven and earth as a person who is trying to escape God's judgment. This means the presence of God completely destroyed the old heaven and earth. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **the mighty and the unimportant** - John combines these words to mean all of the dead people. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **the books were opened** - AT: "and the books were open" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
