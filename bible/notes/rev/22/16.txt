===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **to testify to you** - Here "you" is plural. Possible meanings are 1) it refers to the people in seven churches, or 2) it refers to a group of prophets who will take this message to the seven churches. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
    * **root and descendant of David** - The Old Testament prophets said the Messiah would be a descendant of David. The words "root" and "descendant" mean basically the same thing. They emphasize that Jesus belongs to the family of David. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]]).
    * **the bright Morning Star** - This refers to the bright star that appears early in the morning and indicates that daylight is coming soon. This also represents Jesus as the Messiah. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
