===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **wash their robes...eat from the tree of life** - people who are spiritually clean are able to enjoy the fruits of eternal life - living with God forever. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **Outside** - This means they are outside the city and not allowed to enter.
    * **are the dogs** - In that culture the dog was an unclean and despised animal. It represents people who are wicked.
