\v 1 After these things I looked, and I saw that a door had opened in heaven. The first voice, speaking to me like a trumpet, said, "Come up here, and I will show you what must happen after these things."
\v 2 At once I was in the Spirit, and I saw there was a throne placed in heaven, with someone sitting on it.
\v 3 The one who was sitting on it looked like jasper and carnelian. There was a rainbow around the throne. The rainbow looked like an emerald.
