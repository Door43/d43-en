\v 9-10 The living creatures praise, honor, and thank the one who sits on the throne, the one who lives forever. Whenever they do that, the twenty-four elders lie down on the ground before the one who sits on the throne. They worship him, the one who lives forever and ever.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **the one living forever and ever** - The phrase "forever and ever" means that he will live "for all eternity." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
    * **our Lord and our God**  - the speakers, but not the hearer (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
    * **they existed and were created** - The words "existed" and "created" share similar meanings and emphasize that God has created everything. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
