\v 7 Look! Christ is coming in the clouds. Everyone will see him, including those who killed him by nailing him to a cross. Every tribe, every kind of person on earth, will be in sorrow and grief when they see him coming. That is the truth!
\v 8 The Lord God declares, "I am the one who began all things, the Alpha, and I am the one who will cause all things to end, the Omega. I am the one who exists, who has always existed, and who will always exist. I am the One who rules over everything and everyone."
