\v 14 His head and hair were as white as wool—as white as snow, and his eyes were like a flame of fire.
\v 15 His feet were like burnished bronze, like bronze that had been refined in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of many rushing waters.
\v 16 He had in his right hand seven stars, and coming out of his mouth was a sharp two-edged sword. His face was shining like the sun at its strongest shining.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **His head and hair were as white as wool—as white as snow**  - The repetition of "as white as" emphasizes how very white white his head and hair were. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **the sound of many rushing waters** - This is like the sound a large, fast flowing, white water river makes.
