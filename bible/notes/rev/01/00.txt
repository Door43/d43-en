====== Revelation 01 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter explains how the book is a recording of the vision John received on the island of Patmos. This book is a recording of the visual image John saw. 

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent all the lines of 1:7, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Seven churches ==
This letter was specifically addressed to seven actual churches located in the modern country of Turkey.

== White ==
White is a color that often symbolizes holiness or righteousness in scripture. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:holy]] and [[:en:obe:kt:righteous]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== "Him who is, and who was, and who is to come" ==
The phrase explains that God has always existed, exists now and will always exist. Not all languages have a way to easily translate the past, present and future aspects of a verb. It is possible this is a play on the name of God, Yahweh, which means "I am." 

== His blood ==
This is a reference to Jesus's death. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "He is coming with the clouds" ==
Many scholars believe Jesus will come back in two stages. Jesus will first return will be subtle, like a "thief in the night." Then, Jesus will come in an undeniable way where everyone will see him. It is this latter coming that the book of Revelation is about. 

== Jesus ==
The image of the man in heaven is probably Jesus. Overall, the image is a description of Jesus in all of his glory. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:glory]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]).

== "The angels of the seven churches" ==
The Greek word translated as "angels" can also be translated as "messengers." It is possible this is a reference to the messengers or leaders of these seven churches.
