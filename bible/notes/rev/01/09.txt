\v 9 I, John, your fellow believer, am suffering as you are because Jesus rules over us. We share together the call to suffer for our faith. We are part of his reign and rule over all things, and we are patiently enduring every trial and test the comes. I was imprisoned and sent to the island of Patmos because I kept telling people about God's message and the truth about Jesus.
\v 10 On one of the days we worship the Lord with other believers, God's Spirit took control of me. Then I heard behind me someone speaking. He voice was like a trumpet that was being played.
\v 11 He said to me, "Write on a scroll what you see, and send it to seven groups of believers. Send it to the believers in the cities of Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea."

\v 9 I, John—your brother and the one who shares with you in the suffering and kingdom and patient endurance that are in Jesus—was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony about Jesus.
\v 10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day. I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet.
\v 11 It said, "Write in a book what you see, and send it to the seven churches—to Ephesus, to Smyrna, to Pergamum, to Thyatira, to Sardis, to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea."
