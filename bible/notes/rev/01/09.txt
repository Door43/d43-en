\v 9 I, John, your fellow believer, am suffering as you are because Jesus rules over us. We are steadfastly enduring suffering because of our relationship with him. Persons with power sent me to the island of Patmos because I kept telling people about God's message and the truth about Jesus.
\v 10 God's Spirit took control of me on one of the days that we believers meet to worship the Lord. At that time, I heard behind me someone speaking to me. He spoke as loudly and as clearly as a trumpet sounds.
\v 11 He was saying to me, "Write on a scroll what you see, and send it to seven groups of believers. Send it to the believers in the cities of Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea."

\v 9 I John--your brother in Jesus and one who shares with you in the suffering and kingdom and endurance--came to be on the island called Patmos, because of the word of God and the witness of Jesus.
\v 10 I came to be in the Spirit on the Lord’s day. I heard behind me a great voice, like the voice of a trumpet.
\v 11 It said, "What you see, write in a book and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamum, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea."
