\v 1 This book has the things that Jesus Christ showed to me, John. God showed these things to him in order that he might pass them on to his servants. These are the things that will happen soon. Jesus communicated these things by sending his angel to me, his servant John.
\v 2 I truthfully reported everything that I saw and heard when God showed me these things--all these things about Jesus Christ.
\v 3 God will do good to anyone who reads these words to the group of believers, He will do good to those who listen carefully to them and obey them, for the opportunity to respond to them is short.
