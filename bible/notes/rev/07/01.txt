\v 1 After this I saw four angels standing on the earth. One was standing at the north, one at the east, one at the south, and one at the west. They were keeping back the winds from blowing and destroying things on the earth, or the ocean, or even any tree.
\v 2 Then I saw another angel come up from the east. He was carrying God's seal. With this seal God, who is all-powerful, marks his own people to protect them. This angel called out with a loud voice to the four angels whom God had told to harm the earth and the ocean.
\v 3 He said to them, "Do not harm the earth or the ocean or the trees until we have marked the servants of our God on their foreheads."

\v 1 After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, tightly holding back the four winds of the earth, that no wind should blow on the earth, on the sea, or against any tree.
\v 2 I saw another angel ascend from the east, having the seal of the living God. He cried out with a loud voice to the four angels who were commanded to harm the earth and the sea,
\v 3 saying, "Do not harm the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads."
