===== translationNotes: =====

  * **All the angels ... living creatures** - "All the angels stood around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures"
  * **the four living creatures** - These are the four creatures mentioned in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:04:06|4:6-8]].
  * **Praise, glory ... be to our God** - "Our God is worthy of all praise, glory, wisdom, thanks, honor, power and strength"
  * **Praise, glory ... thanksgiving, honor ... be to our God** - The verb "give" can be used to show how praise, glory, and honor,  are to be "to" God. AT: "We must give praise, glory, thanks, and honor to our God"
  * **wisdom, ... power, and strength ... be to our God** - The verb "have" can be used to show how power and strength are "to" our God. AT: "May God have all wisdom, power, and strength" or "Our God has all wisdom, power, and strength."
  * **forever and ever** - These two words mean basically the same thing and emphasize that the praise will never end.
