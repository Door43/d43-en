===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the four living creatures** - These are the four creatures mentioned in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:04:06|4:6-8]].
  * **they fell on their faces** - They lay down facing the ground. See how you translated a similar expression in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:04:09|4:10]].
  * **Praise, glory ... be to our God** - "Our God is worthy of all praise, glory, wisdom, thanks, honor, power and strength"
  * **Praise, glory ... thanksgiving, honor ... be to our God** - The verb "give" can be used to show how praise, glory, and honor, are to be "to" God. AT: "We must give praise, glory, thanks, and honor to our God"
  * **forever and ever** - These two words mean basically the same thing and emphasize that the praise will never end.
