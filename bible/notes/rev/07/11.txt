===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **All the angels...living creatures** - "All the angels stood around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures"
  * **the four living creatures** - These are the four creatures mentioned in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:04:06|4:6-8]].
  * **Praise, glory...be to our God** - "Our God is worthy of all praise, glory, wisdom, thanks, honor, power and strength"
  * **forever and ever** - These two words mean basically the same thing and emphasize that every living thing will worship God for all eternity. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
