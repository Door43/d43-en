\v 13 Then one of the elders asked me, "These people who are wearing white robes, do you know who they are and from where they come?"
\v 14 I answered him, "Sir, I do not know. Surely you know who they are!" He said to me, "These are the people whom others have caused to suffer greatly. The lamb died for them, and God has forgiven them for their sins. It is as if they have washed their robes in his blood and made them clean.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb ** - The color "white" represents purity, and "blood" is compared to water, which usually makes things clean. Purity is achieved by being "washed" or covered by Christ's blood. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
