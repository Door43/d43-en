====== Revelation 07 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Many scholars believe the first half of this chapter is about a great revival among the Hebrew people, where 144,000 will come to [[:en:obe:kt:believe|believe]] in Jesus. The tribe of Dan is noticeably absent from this list. The second half of this chapter would then be able a great revival among the Gentiles where countless Gentiles will come to believe in Jesus.

The ULB has chosen to set apart 7:5-8 and 7:15-17 through the use of indentation. These passages are extended [[:en:obe:kt:prophet|prophecies]].

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Worship ==
The people in this chapter respond to the [[:en:obe:kt:reveal|revelation]] of these events with [[:en:obe:kt:repent|repentance]] and [[:en:obe:kt:worship|worship]]. This is the proper response to the information contained in this book. 

== The Great Tribulation ==
This is a period when the people of the earth will be greatly punished by God. There is some disagreement about this period but many scholars believe it is a reference to the last half of the seven years of tribulation prophesied in Revelation 4-19, and in the rest of Scripture. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== The Lamb ==
This is a reference to Jesus. In this chapter, it also functions as a title for Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]).
