<usfm>
\v 16 The ten horns that you saw represent rulers. They and the beast will hate the prostitute. So they will take away everything that is in the city as if they were leaving it naked. They will destroy it as if devouring flesh, and they will burn it completely.
\v 17 They will do that because God has caused them to decide to do what he wants them to do. As a result, they will let the beast have their power to rule until what God has said is fulfilled.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 The ten horns that you saw—they and the beast will hate the prostitute. They will make her desolate and naked, they will devour her flesh, and they will burn her completely with fire.
\v 17 For God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by agreeing to give their power to rule to the beast until God's words are fulfilled.

  * **hate** - Translate this as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:02:06|2:6]].
  * **make her desolate and naked** - "steal everything that she has and leave her with nothing"
  * **they will devour her flesh, and they will burn her completely with fire** - These are two ways of saying they will completely destroy her. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **until God's words are fulfilled** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "until God fulfills what he said will happen" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
