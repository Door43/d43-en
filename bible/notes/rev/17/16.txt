<usfm>
\v 16 The ten horns that you saw represent rulers. They and the beast will hate the prostitute. So they will take away everything that is in the city as if they were leaving it naked. They will destroy it as if devouring flesh, and they will burn it completely.
\v 17 They will do that because God has caused them to decide to do what he wants them to do. As a result, they will let the beast have their power to rule until what God has said is fulfilled.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 The ten horns that you saw—they and the beast will hate the prostitute. They will make her desolate and naked, they will devour her flesh, and they will burn her completely with fire.
\v 17 For God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by agreeing to give their power to rule to the beast until God's words are fulfilled.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **make her desolate and naked** - "steal everything that she has and leave her with nothing"
  * **they will devour her flesh** - Destroying her completely is spoken of as eating all her flesh. "They will destroy her completely" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by agreeing to give ... until God's words are fulfilled** - They would agree to give their power to the beast, but it would not be that they want to obey God. AT: "For God has put it into their hearts to agree to give ... until God's words are fulfilled, and by doing this, they would carry out God's purpose"
  * **God has put it into their hearts** - The heart represents desires. Making them want to do something is spoken of as putting it in their hearts to do it. AT: "God has made them want" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **power to rule** - "authority" or "kingly authority"
  * **until God's words are fulfilled** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "until God fulfills what he said will happen" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
