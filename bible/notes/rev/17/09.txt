\v 9 People need to think wisely to understand this: The seven heads of the beast on which the woman sits symbolize the seven hills of the city that the woman represents. They also symbolize seven rulers.
\v 10 Five of those rulers have died. One is still alive. The seventh ruler has not yet come. When he comes, he must remain for only a short time.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 This calls for a mind that has wisdom. The seven heads are seven hills on which the woman is seated. 
\v 10 They are also seven kings. Five kings have fallen, one exists, and the other has not yet come; when he comes, he can remain only for a little while.
