\v 8 The beast that you saw lived previously. Eventually God will destroy him, but now he is dead. He is about to come up from the underworld. When that beast appears again, the people on the earth will be amazed. They are people whose names have not been written in the book of life before God created the world.

<usfm>
\v 8 The beast you saw existed, does not exist now, but is about to come up from the deep, bottomless pit. Then he will go on to destruction. Those who live on the earth, those whose names have not been written in the book of life since the foundation of the world—they will be astounded when they see the beast that existed, does not exist now, but is about to come.
