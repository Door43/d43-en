===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 The ten horns that you saw \add represent\add* ten rulers who have not yet begun to rule. They will receive authority in order to rule \add people\add* together with the beast \add for only a short time, as if it were\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* for one hour.
\v 13 Those \add rulers\add* will all agree to do the same thing. \add As a result\add* they will give to the beast their right \add to rule people\add* and their authority \add to rule people\add* \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\v 14 The rulers and the beast will fight against \add Jesus\add*, the \add one who is like a\add* lamb. He will defeat them, because he is Lord \add who rules over all other\add* lords and the King \add who rules over all other\add* kings. Those \add people\add* who are with him \add and helping him\add* are the ones whom \add God\add* has chosen, and who keep \add serving him\add* faithfully."

\v 12 The ten horns that you saw represent ten rulers who have not yet begun to rule. They will receive authority in order to rule people together with the beast, but they will rule for only a short time, as if it were for only one hour.
\v 13 Those rulers will all agree to do the same thing. As a result they will give to the beast their right and authority to rule people.
\v 14 The rulers and the beast will fight against the lamb. He will defeat them because he is the Lord who rules over all other lords and the King who rules over all other kings. The people who are with him are the ones whom God has chosen and called to himself, and who keep serving him faithfully."

<usfm>
\v 12 The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they will receive authority as kings for one hour together with the beast.
\v 13 These are of one mind, and they give over their power and authority to the beast.
\v 14 They will make war against the Lamb. But the Lamb will conquer them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings—and with him are the called ones, the chosen ones, the faithful ones."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The angel continues speaking to John. Here he explains the meaning of the ten horns of the beast.


  * **for one hour** - If your language does not divide the day into 24 hours, you may need to use a more general expression. AT: "for a very short time" or "for a very small part of a day" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **These are of one mind** - "These all think the same thing" or "These all agree to do the same thing"
  * **the Lamb** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:05:08|5:8]]. 
  * **the called ones, the chosen, the faithful** - This refers to one group of people. "Called" and "chosen" can be expressed in active form. AT: "the called, chosen, and faithful ones" or "the ones whom God has called and chosen and who are faithful to him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
