<usfm> \v 1 One of the seven angels, who had one of the seven bowls, came to me and said, "Come with me and I will show you how God will punish the prostitute, the woman who represents the city in which there are many canals of water. \v 2 The kings of the earth have acted immorally and idolatrously with her. The people on the earth acted immorally in the same way. It was as if they had gotten drunk on wine that she gave them."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the condemnation of the great prositute**  - "Condemnation" is the noun form of the verb "condemn". AT: "how God will condemn the great prostitute." (See: Abstract Nouns)
  * **seated on many waters**  - AT: "many different sources of water" or "many different bodies of water". It's recommended to leave the word as general as possible, rather than saying "river" or "sea".
  * **wine of her sexual immorality**  - This metaphor says her immorality degrades the people of the earth, just as wine degrades a person when they get drunk (See: Metaphor)
