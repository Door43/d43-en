\v 1 One of the seven angels, who had one of the seven bowls, came to me and said, "Come with me and I will show you how God will punish the prostitute, the woman who represents the city in which there are many canals of water.
\v 2 The kings of the earth have acted immorally and idolatrously with her. The people on the earth acted immorally in the same way. It was as if they had gotten drunk on wine that she gave them."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - John begins to describe the part of his vision about the great prostitute.

  * **the condemnation of the great prostitute who is seated on many waters** - The noun "condemnation" can be expressed with the verb "condemn." AT: "how God will condemn the great prostitute who is seated on many waters" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **the great prostitute** - "the prostitute that everyone knows about." She represents a certain sinful city. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_symlanguage]])
  * **on many waters** - If you need to, you can use a more specific word for the kind of water. AT: "on many rivers"
  * **on whose wine of her sexual immorality the earth's inhabitants became drunk** - This phrase can be expressed as a separate sentence. The wine represents sexual immorality. AT: "The people of the earth became drunk by drinking her wine, which represents being sexually immoral" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_distinguish]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_symlanguage]])
  * **her sexual immorality** - This may well have a double meaning: literal sexual immorality and also the worship of false gods. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
