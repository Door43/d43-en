====== Revelation 05 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart the songs in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:05:09|5:9-10]], [[:en:bible:notes:rev:05:11|5:12]] and [[:en:bible:notes:rev:05:13|5:13]]. This is typically done through the use of indentation.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Sealed scroll ==
A sealed scroll contains a written message hidden and waiting to be read. The scroll can only be read by the person with the authority to open it.

== 24 elders ==
This is probably a reference to church leaders, but the identity of the twenty-four elders is uncertain.

== Christian prayers ==
The prayers of Christian are connected with incense. Christian prayers have a good smell to God. He is pleased when Christians pray.

== Seven spirits of God ==

The exact meaning of this phrase is unclear. It is possibly a reference to the Holy Spirit with the number 7 symbolizing "completeness." It may also be a reference to the seven spirits surrounding the throne of God. It should be unnecessary to specifically define it in translation.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphor ==
The "Lion of the tribe of Judah" and the "Root of David" are references to Jesus. They are [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|metaphors]] and they function as titles for Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]).
