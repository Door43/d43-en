He had seven horns, and he had seven eyes that symbolize the Spirit of God who has all kinds of power \f + \ft Or: who is also symbolized as seven spirits \f*. \add He\add* sends \add God's\add* Spirit out into all the earth.

\v 6 Then I saw a lamb standing there in the midst of the four living creatures and the elders around the throne. Although he was alive, he had marks that showed that someone had killed him. He had seven horns, and he had seven eyes that are the seven Spirits of God that God sends out over all the earth.
\v 7 The lamb came and took the scroll from the right hand of the one sitting on the throne.
