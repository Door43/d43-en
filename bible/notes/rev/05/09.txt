===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For you were slaughtered** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "For they slaughtered you" or "For people killed you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **slaughtered** - If your language has a word for killing an animal for a sacrifice, consider using it here.
  * **with your blood** - Since blood represents a person's life, losing the blood represents dying. This probably means "by your death" or "by dying." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **you purchased persons for God** - "you bought people so that they could belong to God" or "you paid the price so that people could belong to God"
  * **from every tribe, language, people, and nation** - This means people from everywhere are included.
