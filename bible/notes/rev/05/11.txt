<usfm>
\v 11 As I \add continued to\add* look, I heard the voices of many angels around the throne and around the living \add creatures\add* and the elders. There were millions of them, a \add crowd so large that no one could count them\add*.
\v 12 They were singing in a loud voice:
\q1 "The one who is like a lamb, who was killed \f + \ft Or:whom his enemies killed \f*
\q1 and who became alive again, is worthy that all created beings acknowledge
\q1 that he is infinitely powerful, infinitely rich,
\q1 infinitely wise, and infinitely strong!
\q1 He is worthy of being honored and praised by all created beings!"

\v 11 Then I looked and heard the sound of many angels around the throne—the number of them was 200,000,000—and the living creatures and the elders.
\v 12 They said in a loud voice,
\pi "Worthy is the Lamb who has been slaughtered to receive power, wealth, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and praise."
