===== translationNotes: =====

  * **in heaven and on the earth and under the earth** - his means everywhere: the place where God and the angels live, the place where people and animals live, and the place where those who have died are. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:05:03|5:3]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **To the one who sits on the throne and to the Lamb, be praise, honor, glory** - The verb "give" can be used to show how praise, honor, and glory are "to" the one on the throne and the Lamb. AT: "We must give praise, honor, and glory to him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb"
  * **the power to rule, forever and ever** - The verb "have" can be used to show how power can be "to" the one on the throne and the Lamb. AT: "may they have the power to rule forever and ever"
