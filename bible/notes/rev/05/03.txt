\v 3 But no created being in heaven nor any created being on the earth nor any created being under the earth was able to open the scroll and see what was written on it.
\v 4 I cried loudly because there was no one worthy to do that.
\v 5 But one of the elders said to me, "Do not cry any longer! Look, the one who is called the Lion from the tribe of Judah, the Messiah who is the descendant of King David, has overcome Satan! As a result, he is worthy to break the seven seals on the scroll and open it!"
