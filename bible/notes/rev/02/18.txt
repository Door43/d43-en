===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Thyatira** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:rev:01:09|1:11]].
  * **These are the words of the Son of God** - Jesus, the resurrected Son of God, is still speaking to believers, even many years after he has ascended into heaven. Jesus is eternally "the Son of God." In translating this phrase, "Son of God," the translator must be aware of the power of this title. "Son of God" is wording chosen by God himself to describe God the Son, the Savior of the world. "Son of God" must be translated as closely to its original wording and meaning as is possible, in all languages.
