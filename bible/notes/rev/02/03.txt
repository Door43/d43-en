\v 3  \add I know\add* also that you continue  \add to serve me\add* steadfastly. \add Even when people\add* \add caused you to suffer\f + \ft Or: persecuted you\add* \f*, you continued to serve  \add me\add* because  \add you believe\add* in me, and you have not become too tired  \add to keep on serving me\add*.
\v 4 Nevertheless, I have  \add this complaint\add* against you: You no longer love  \add each other and me\add* as you did when you first \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add trusted in me\add*.
\v 5  \add So, I tell you to\add* remember how you used to love  \add me and each other, and\add* to  \add realize\add* that you no longer love as you did. \add I tell\add* you to turn away from your sin  \add of not loving me and each other\add*, and start loving  \add each other and me again\add* as you did at first. If you do not turn away from your sinful behavior, I will come  \add to judge\add* you and cause your group to cease to be a Christian congregation \f + \ft metaphor \f*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 I know also that you endure patiently when you suffered because of you believe in me and continue to serve me.  steadfastly. Even when people caused you to suffer because you followed me. You have continued to serve and hold to my words even when it was difficult. You did not give up or stop, even though it has been difficult for you.
\v 4 Nevertheless, you have done something wrong: You no longer love each other and me as you did when you first came to trust. You do not have the same love for me now that you had at first.
\v 5 So, I tell you to remember how you used to love me. Love me again like you did at the first. Or if you do not, I will come to you and remove the light of the worshiping community, the group of believers, and I will take that away from you.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 I know you have patient endurance, and you have gone through much because of my name, and you have not grown weary.
\v 4 But this is what I have against you—you have left behind your first love.
\v 5 Remember therefore from where you have fallen. Repent and do the things you did at first. Unless you repent, I will come to you and will remove your lampstand from its place.
