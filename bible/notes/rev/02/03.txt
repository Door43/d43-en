<usfm>
\v 3 I know also that you continue to serve me steadfastly. Even when people caused you to suffer because you followed me, you continued to worship me. You have not grown tired.
\v 4 Nevertheless, you have done something wrong: You no longer love each other and me as you did when you first trusted in me.
\v 5 So, I tell you to remember how you used to love me and each other, and to I tell you to start loving each other and me again as you did at first. If you do not do this, I will come to judge you and remove your lampstand from this place.

<usfm>
\v 3 I know that you have perseverence, and that you have endured because of my name, and that you have not grown weary.
\v 4 But what I have against you is that you have left your first love.
\v 5 Remember therefore from where you have fallen, and repent and do again your first deeds, or else I will come to you and will remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.
