===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 Do not be afraid of any of the things that you are about to suffer. The truth is that the devil is about to  \add put\add* some of you in prison, to tempt you  \add to deny that you believe in me\add*. For a short period of time you will suffer  \add because of what people will do to you\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. Continue to trust in me, \add even if\add* they kill you  \add because you trust in me\add*. As a result, I will  \add reward you with\add* eternal life\add , just like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add people reward a victorious athlete by putting\add* a wreath  \add on his head\add*.
\v 11 Everyone who wants to understand \f + \ft metonymy \f* must listen carefully to the message that  \add God's\add* Spirit speaks to the congregations. \add After\add* those who conquer  \add Satan die\add*, they will live with God. They will never suffer again, even though many others will suffer as though they died a second time.'"

\v 10 Do not be afraid of any of the things that you are about to suffer. The truth is that the devil is about to put some of you in prison, to put you in a difficult place where you are being tested to see what kind of faith you have. For a short period of time you will suffer. Continue to trust in me, even if they kill you because you trust in me. and I will put a wreath on your head that will be a sign that you have eternal life and that you have overcome.
\v 11 Listen carefully to the message that God's Spirit speaks to the groups of believers assembled together. All who conquer will never die a second time.'"

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Look! The devil is about to throw some of you into prison so that you may be tested, and you will suffer for ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life.
\v 11 If you have an ear, listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who conquers will not be hurt by the second death.'
