<usfm>
\v 24 But I have something good to say about the rest of you believers in the city of Thyatira. It is good that you do not accept these wrong things. It is good that you reject what those teachers call their 'secret practices' that Satan taught them. I will not burden you with any other commands.
\v 25 Just keep believing firmly in me and obey me until I come.

<usfm>
\v 24 But to the rest of you in Thyatira, to all who do not hold this teaching, and do not know what some call the deep things of Satan—to you I say, 'I do not put on you any other burden.'
\v 25 In any case, you must hold on tightly until I come.
