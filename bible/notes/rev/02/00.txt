====== Revelation 02 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Chapters 2 and 3 together form a single unit. This is section usually referred to as the "seven letters to the seven churches." The translator may wish to set these letters apart from each other to clearly distinguish them. 

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 2:27, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Poverty and wealth ==
This chapter has a play on the two possible meanings of being poor and rich. The Ephesians were poor financially because they did not have a lot of money. They were not poor [[:en:obe:kt:spirit|spiritually]] because of the great "riches" they had in Christ. 

== "The devil is about to" ==
The book of Revelation is about the things that Satan is going to do on earth. Despite this, it is ultimately about what God will do in the end to defeat Satan.

== Balaam, Balak and Jezebel ==
These teachings of Balaam are difficult to fully understand if the books of Kings have not yet been translated. This is probably a reference to leading the people of Israel into immorality and to worship of [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod|false gods]].

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphor ==
Some scholars take chapter 2 and 3 as a [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|metaphor]]. They understand these churches to refer to types of churches or historical periods of the church. It is best to translate this as instructions to ancient churches in each of these cities.

== "If you have an ear, listen to what the Spirit says to the churches." ==
This is a phrase which acts as a call to [[:en:obe:kt:repent|repentance]] for those in the church.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "The angels of the seven churches" ==

The Greek word translated as "angels" can also be translated as "messengers." It is possible this is a reference to the messengers or leaders of these seven churches.

== "These are the words of the one" ==
This phrase, used to introduce these letter is probably a reference to Jesus. Each letter the describes an aspect of Jesus which is significant for the rest of the letter.
