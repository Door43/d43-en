  * **Repent, therefore** - "So repent" 
  * **If you do not, I** - "If you do not repent, I" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **make war against them** - "fight against them"
  * **with the sword of my mouth** - This refers to the sword in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:01:14|1:16]]. Although symbols in apocalyptic language are normally not to be translated, translators may choose whether or not to explain this symbol as a symbol of God's word, as the UDB does. This symbol indicates that Christ will defeat his enemies by giving a simple command. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_symlanguage]])
  * **If you have an ear, listen** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:02:06|2:7]].
  * **To the one who conquers** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:02:06|2:7]]
