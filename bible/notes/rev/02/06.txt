\v 6 But you do one thing very well: Those Nicolaitans, the people who say you can worship idols and act immorally--you hate what they do, just as I hate it.
\v 7 Everyone who wants to understand my message must listen carefully to the message that God's Spirit speaks to the groups of believers. To everyone who overcomes Satan, I will give the right to eat fruit from the tree that gives eternal life, the tree that is in God's garden.'"

\v 6 But this you have, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
\v 7 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who conquers, him will I allow to eat from the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God."
