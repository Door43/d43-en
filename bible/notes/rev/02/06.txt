\v 6 But you have the following good quality: Those Nicolaitans  \add teach you believers that you can worship idols and that you may act immorally\add*. However, you hate such teaching, just like I also hate it.
\v 7 Everyone who wants to understand my message \f + \ft metonymy \f* must listen carefully to the message that  \add God's\add* Spirit speaks to the congregations. To everyone who overcomes  \add Satan\add*, I will give the right to eat  \add fruit\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* from the tree  \add that gives\add* eternal life, the tree that is in God's garden.'"

\v 6 But you do one thing very well: Those Nicolaitans, the people who say you can worship idols and act immorally—you hate what they do, just as I hate it.
\v 7 Everyone who wants to understand my message must listen carefully to the message that God's Spirit is saying to the groups of believers assembled together. The promise is that victory is promised to you who follow me. And those who are victorious will be permitted to eat fruit from the tree that gives eternal life, the tree that is in God's garden.'"

\v 6 But you have this—you hate what the Nicolaitans have done, which I also hate.
\v 7 If you have an ear, listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers I will permit to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.'
