\v 1 The fifth angel sounded his trumpet. I saw a star from heaven that had fallen to the earth. The key of the pit of the abyss was given to him.
\v 2 He opened the pit of the abyss. A column of smoke went up out of the pit, like smoke from a great furnace. The sun and the air were darkened by the smoke from the pit.
