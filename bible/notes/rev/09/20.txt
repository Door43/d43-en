===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 But the rest of the people, those who were not killed by these plagues of fire and smoke and burning sulfur, did not turn from the sinful things they were doing. They did not stop worshipping demons or their idols--idols that they themselves had made of gold, of silver, of bronze, of stone, and of wood. The people did not stop worshipping them, even though they were idols that could not see, hear, or walk.
\v 21 They did not stop murdering people, or practicing sorcery, or acting in sexually immoral ways, or stealing things.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 The rest of the people, those who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, so that they would no longer worship demons or the idols of gold, silver, brass,  stone, and wood, idols that can neither see, hear, nor walk.
\v 21 They did not repent of their murders, sorceries, acts of fornication, nor of their thefts.
