<usfm>
\v 20 The rest of the \add rebellious\add* people, those who were not killed by these plagues of \add fire and smoke and burning sulfur\add*, did not turn from their sinful behavior. \add They did not stop worshipping\add* the idols that they had made with their own hands. They did not stop worshipping demons and idols \add that were made\add* of gold, of silver, of bronze, of stone, and of wood, \add even though they are idols\add* that can neither see nor hear nor walk.
\v 21 They did not stop murdering people, or practicing sorcery, or acting in sexually immoral ways, or stealing \add things\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 But the rest of the people, those who were not killed by the plagues of fire and smoke and burning sulfur, did not turn from the sinful things they were doing. They did not stop worshiping demons or the idols that they themselves had made of gold, of silver, of bronze, of stone, and of wood. The people did not stop worshiping them, even though they were idols that could not see, hear, or walk.
\v 21 They did not stop murdering people, or practicing sorcery, or acting in sexually immoral ways, or stealing things.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 The rest of mankind, those who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the deeds they had done, nor did they stop worshiping demons and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood—things that cannot see, hear, or walk.
\v 21 Neither did they repent of their murders, their sorcery, their sexual immorality or their acts of theft.
