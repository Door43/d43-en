\v 16 The number of the soldiers on horseback was 200,000,000. I heard their number.
\v 17 This is how I saw the horses in my vision and those who rode on them: Their breastplates were fiery red, dark blue and sulfurous yellow. The heads of the horses resembled the heads of lions, and out of their mouths came fire, smoke, and sulfur.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Suddenly, 200,000,000 soldiers on horseback appear in John's vision. John is no longer speaking about the four angels mentioned in the previous verse.

  * **200,000,00** - Some ways to express this are: "two hundred million" or "two hundred thousand thousand" or "twenty thousand times ten thousand." If your language does not have a specific number for this, you could also see how you translated a similar large number in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:05:11|5:11]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **fiery red** - "it was red like fire" or "it was bright red." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:06:03|6:3]].
  * **sulfurous yellow** - "yellow like sulfur" or "bright yellow like sulfur" 
  * **out of their mouths came fire, smoke, and sulfur** - "fire, smoke, and sulfur came out of their mouths"
