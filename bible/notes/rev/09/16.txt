\v 16 The number of the soldiers on horseback was 200,000,000. I heard their number.
\v 17 This is how I saw the horses in my vision and those who rode on them:  Their breastplates were fiery red, dark blue and sulfurous yellow. The heads of the horses resembled the heads of lions, and out of their mouths came fire, smoke, and sulfur.
