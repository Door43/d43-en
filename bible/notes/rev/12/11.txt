====== Revelation 12:11-12 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 Our fellow believers overcame him because they never stopped trusting 
\q1 \f + \ft Or: never stopped telling people about \f* Jesus, 
\q1 and because they trusted in what the one who is like a lamb accomplished 
\q1 when his blood flowed when he died.
\q1 Even though those believers wanted to live, 
\q1 they were willing to let people kill them for speaking truly about him.
\q1
\v 12 So, all you angels living \f + \ft metonymy \f* in heaven, rejoice!
\q1 But terrible things will happen to you ungodly people who \f + \ft metonymy \f* live on the earth and 
\q1 on the ocean, because the devil has come down to you!
\q1 He is very angry because he knows that he has only a short time 
\q1 during which he can harm people.

<usfm>
\v 11 Our fellow believers overcame him because the Lamb had shed his blood and died for them
\q1 and because they spoke the truth about him to other people.
\q1 They did not seek to remain alive,
\q1 but were willing to let people kill them for speaking the truth about him.
\q1
\v 12 So everyone in heaven should rejoice.
\q1 But terrible things will happen to you people who live on the earth and on the ocean because the devil has come down to you.
\q1 He is very angry because he knows that he has only a short time before God judges and punishes him."

\q
\v 11 They conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony,
\q for they did not love their lives even to death.
\q
\v 12 Therefore, rejoice, you heavens,
\q2 and all who reside in them.
\q But woe to the earth and to the sea
\q2 because the devil has gone down to you.
\q He is filled with terrible anger,
\q2 because he knows he only has a little time.
