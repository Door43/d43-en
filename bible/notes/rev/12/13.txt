\v 13 When the dragon realized he had been thrown down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child.
\v 14 But the woman was given the two wings of a great eagle, so that she might fly to the place prepared for her in the wilderness, the place where she would be taken care of, for a time, times, and half a timeâ€”out of the reach of the serpent.
