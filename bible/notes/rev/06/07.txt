\v 7 Then the lamb opened the fourths seal, and I heard the fourth living creature say, "Come!"
\v 8 This time I saw a pale horse appear. Someone was riding it; his name was, "The one who causes people to die." Someone else was following him; this person's name was, "The place where dead people go." God gave these two persons power to kill one fourth of all people on earth. They could kill them with weapons or with famine, with sickness or with wild animals.

\v 7 When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, "Come."
\v 8 I saw, and look, a pale horse: and he who sat upon it, his name was Death; and Hades followed with him. Authority was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword, and with famine, and with death, and by the wild beasts of the earth.
