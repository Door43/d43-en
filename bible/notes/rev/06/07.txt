===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 Then the Lamb opened the fourth seal, and I heard the fourth living creature say, "Come!"
\v 8 This time I saw a pale horse appear. Someone was riding it; his name was, "The one who causes people to die." Someone else was following him; this person's name was, "The place where dead people go." God gave these two persons power to kill one fourth of all people on earth. They could kill them with weapons, or with famine, or with sickness, or with wild animals.
