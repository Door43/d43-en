\v 5 Then the lamb opened the third seal, and I heard the third living creature say, "Come!" This time, I saw a black horse appear. There was someone riding it, and he had a pair of balance scales in his hand.
\v 6 Then I heard a voice that sounded like it was coming from among the four living creatures. It said to the person on the horse, â€œMake it happen that one liter of wheat will cost so much that a man must work a whole day to earn enough money to buy it. Also make it happen that three liters of barley will sell for the same price. But do not reduce the supply of olive oil or wine."
