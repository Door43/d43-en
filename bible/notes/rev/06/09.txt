\v 9 Then the lamb opened the fifth seal, and I saw under the altar in heaven the souls of God's servants whom others had killed because they had believed God's message, and because they had told others the message about Jesus.
\v 10 They said loudly to God, "Sovereign Lord, you are holy and true. How long will it be before you judge and punish the people on earth who murdered us?"
\v 11 Then God gave to each of them a long white robe, and he told them to rest and be patient a little longer. They should be patient until the wicked people had killed all the believers who served the Lord with them. These believers were those whom God wanted to die in just the same way that these others had died.

\v 9 When he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those that had been slain because of the word of God, and for the testimony which they held.
\v 10 They cried out with a great voice, saying, "How long, O Lord, the holy and true, do you not judge and avenge our blood on them who dwell on the earth?"
\v 11 A white robe was given to them, to each one. It was said to them, that they should enjoy rest yet for a little time, until their fellow-servants also and their brothers should be completed, who were about be killed even as they were.
