====== Revelation 06 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

The image of the wrath of God in this chapter is intended to produce [[:en:obe:kt:fear|fear]] in those who hear these words.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Seven Seals ==
There is disagreement over how these seals are attached to the scroll. It would be logical if they were all side-by-side but the scroll would only have revealed its contents after the last seal is broken. This is not how this chapter describes the scroll because each seal reveals a [[:en:obe:kt:judge|judgment]]. It is also commonly believed that the absent seventh seal uncovers the seven trumpet judgments.

== Inflation ==
The prices for things people need will suddenly be very expensive. People will not be able to afford the things they need to live. This is usually called "inflation."


=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== The Lamb ==
This is a reference to Jesus. In this chapter, it also functions as a title for Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]).

== Metaphors ==
This chapter contains many different [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|metaphors]] and symbols. The translators should avoid translating their meaning. If possible, allow any symbolic meaning to be determined later by the reader. 

== Similes ==
The author uses many different [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|similes]]. This is because he is attempting to describe the image he sees in the vision. Therefore, he compares the images in this vision to everyday things.
