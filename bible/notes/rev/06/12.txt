<usfm> \v 12 Then I saw the lamb open the sixth seal, and the earth shook violently. The sun became as black as cloth made of black wool. The whole moon became red like blood. \v 13 Stars fell to the earth in great numbers, just as immature figs fall when a fig tree shakes in a strong wind. \v 14 The sky split open and rolled up on either side just as an old scroll rolls up when it is split in two. Every mountain and island was shaken out of its place. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \p \v 12 When the Lamb opened the sixth seal. I watched and there was a great earthquake. The sun became as black as sackcloth, and the full moon became like blood. \v 13 The stars in the heavens fell to the earth, just like a fig tree drops her winter fruit when shaken by a stormy wind. \v 14 The sky vanished like a scroll that was being rolled up. Every mountain and island was moved out of its place. </usfm>
