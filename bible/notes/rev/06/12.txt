\v 13 The stars fell to the earth  \add in great numbers\add*, just \f + \ft simile \f* like immature figs fall when a fig tree is shaken by a strong wind \f + \ft Or:when a strong wind shakes a fig tree \f*.
\v 14 The sky split open and  \add rolled up on either side\add* just \f + \ft simile \f* like an  \add old\add* scroll rolls up  \add when it is split in two\add*. Every mountain and island moved out of its place.

\v 12 Then I saw the lamb open the sixth seal, and the earth shook violently. The sun became as black as cloth made of black wool. The whole moon became red like blood.
\v 13 Stars fell to the earth in great numbers, just as immature figs fall when a fig tree shakes in a strong wind.
\v 14 The sky split open and rolled up on either side just as an old scroll rolls up when it is split in two. Every mountain and island was shaken out of its place.

<usfm>
\p
\v 12 When the Lamb opened the sixth seal, I watched and there was a great earthquake. The sun became as black as sackcloth, and the full moon became like blood.
\v 13 The stars in the heavens fell to the earth, just as a fig tree drops its unripe fruit when shaken by a stormy wind.
\v 14 The sky vanished like a scroll that was being rolled up. Every mountain and island was moved out of its place.

===== translationNotes: =====


  *  **the sixth seal** -  "the next seal" or "seal number six" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **as black as sackcloth** - Sometimes sackcloth was made of black hair. People would wear sackcloth when they were mourning, so the image of the sun being like sackcloth might lead to thoughts of death and mourning. AT: "as black as mourning clothes" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **like blood** - How it was like blood can be stated clearly. AT: "red like blood" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]]) Since the shedding of blood represents death, the moon being like blood would lead people to think of death. 
  * **just as a fig tree drops its unripe fruit when shaken by a stormy wind** - "just as unripened fruit easily falls in great quantities from a fig tree when a strong wind shakes it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
