\v 12 Then I saw the lamb open the sixth seal, and the earth shook violently. The sun became as black as cloth made of black wool. The whole moon became red like blood.
\v 13 Stars fell to the earth in great numbers, just like immature figs fall when a fig tree shakes in a strong wind.
\v 14 The sky split open and rolled up on either side just like an old scroll rolls up when it is split in two. Every mountain and island moved out of its place.

\v 12 I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake; the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the whole moon became as blood.
\v 13 The stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig tree drops her unripe figs when shaken by a great
wind.
\v 14 The heavens was removed as a scroll when it is rolled up; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.
