====== Revelation 03 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Chapters 2 and 3 form a single unit. This section is usually referred to as the "seven letters to the seven churches." The translator may wish to set these letters apart from each other to clearly distinguish them from each other.

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 3:7, which is a reference to the Old Testament.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Seven spirits of God ==
The exact meaning of this phrase is unclear. It is possibly a reference to the Holy Spirit with the number 7 symbolizing "completeness." It may also be a reference to the seven spirits surrounding the throne of God. It should be unnecessary to specifically define it in translation.

== Seven stars == 
These are probably a reference to the leaders of the churches. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:rev:01:19|1:20]]).

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphor ==
Some scholars take chapter 2 and 3 as a [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|metaphor]]. They understand these churches to refer to types of churches or historical periods of the church. It is best to translate this as instructions to ancient churches in each of these cities.

The phrase "Look, I stand at the door and knock" is another extended metaphor describing Jesus' readiness and willingness to accept anyone who [[:en:obe:kt:repent|repents]] and [[:en:obe:kt:believe|believes]] in him. 

== "If you have an ear, listen to what the Spirit says to the churches." ==
This is a phrase which acts as a call to [[:en:obe:kt:repent|repentance]] for those in the church.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "The angels of the seven churches" ==

The Greek word translated as "angels" can also be translated as "messengers." This is possibly a reference to the messengers or leaders of these seven churches.
