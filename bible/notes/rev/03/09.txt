<usfm>
\v 9 \add I am aware that\add* some of your people meet together with those who \add follow\f + \ft Or: worship \f*\add* Satan. They claim to be Jews, but I know that they are not true Jews. They are lying. I will cause them to come to you and to bow down \add humbly\add* at your feet and to acknowledge that I love you.
\p
\v 10 Because you have paid attention to the message to endure patiently \add when you suffered\add*, I will keep you \add safe from those who will try to harm you spiritually\add* during the period\f + \ft Or: time \f* that is about to come. At that time \add God will cause rebellious people\add* on the earth to suffer, in order that I can determine \add whether they will turn away from their sins or not\add*.
\v 11 I am coming soon. \add So\add* continue to hold fast to\f + \ft Or: to believe firmly \f* the \add message\add* that you have received, in order that no one may cause you to lose the reward \add that God has reserved for\add* you.

\v 9 Be careful! I am aware that some of your people meet together with those who follow Satan. They claim to be Jews, but I know that they are not true Jews. They are lying. I will cause them to come to you and to bow down humbly at your feet and to acknowledge that I love you.
\p
\v 10 Because you have obeyed me when I commanded you to endure suffering patiently, I will keep you safe from those who will try to make you disobey me. They will soon do this to everyone in the entire world.
\v 11 I am coming soon. So continue to do what I have told you, in order that no one may cause you to lose your reward that God has reserved for you.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 Look! Those who belong to the synagogue of Satan, those who say they are Jews but are not; they are lying instead. I will make them come and bow down before your feet, and they will come to know that I loved you.
\v 10 Since you have kept my command to endure patiently, I will also keep you from the hour of testing that is coming on the whole world, to test those who live on the earth.
\v 11 I am coming soon. Hold tight to what you have so no one can take away your crown.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **synagogue of Satan ... Jews but are not** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:02:08|2:9]].
  * **bow down** - This is a sign of submission, not worship. AT: "bow down in submission" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **before your feet** - "before you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **they will come to know** - "they will learn" or "they will admit"
  * **will also keep you from the hour of testing** - "will also keep you safe in the hour of testing"
  * **hour of testing** - "time of testing." This probably  means "the time when people try to make you disobey me."
  * **Hold tight** - "Continue to believe" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **crown** - See how you translated "crown" in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:02:10|2:10]]. This is a reward.
