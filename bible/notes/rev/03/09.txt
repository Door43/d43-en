\v 9 \add I am aware that\add* some of your people meet together with those who \add follow\f + \ft Or: worship \f*\add* Satan. They claim to be Jews, but I know that they are not true Jews. They are lying. I will cause them to come to you and to bow down \add humbly\add* at your feet and to acknowledge that I love you.
\p
\v 10 Because you have paid attention to the message to endure patiently \add when you suffered\add*, I will keep you \add safe from those who will try to harm you spiritually\add* during the period\f + \ft Or: time \f* that is about to come. At that time \add God will cause rebellious people\add* on the earth to suffer, in order that I can determine \add whether they will turn away from their sins or not\add*.
\v 11 I am coming soon. \add So\add* continue to hold fast to\f + \ft Or: to believe firmly \f* the \add message\add* that you have received, in order that no one may cause you to lose the reward \add that God has reserved for\add* you.

\v 9 Be careful! I am aware that some of your people meet together with those who follow Satan. They claim to be Jews, but I know that they are not true Jews. They are lying. I will cause them to come to you and to bow down humbly at your feet and to acknowledge that I love you.
\p
\v 10 Because you have obeyed me when I commanded you to endure suffering patiently, I will keep you safe from those who will try to make you disobey me. They will soon do this to everyone in the entire world.
\v 11 I am coming soon. So continue to do what I have told you, in order that no one may cause you to lose your reward that God has reserved for you.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 Look! Those who belong to the synagogue of Satan who say they are Jews but are not, but they are liarsâ€”I will make them come and bow down before your feet, and they will come to know that I loved you.
\v 10 Since you have kept my command to endure patiently, I will also keep you from the hour of testing that is coming on the whole world, to test those who live on the earth.
\v 11 I am coming soon. Hold to what you have so no one can take away your crown.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **synagogue of Satan** - People who gather to obey or honor Satan are spoken of as if they were in a synagogue, a place of worship and teaching for the Jews. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:02:08|2:9]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **bow down** - This is a sign of submission, not worship. AT: "bow down in submission" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **before your feet** - Here the word "feet" represent the person before whom these people bow down. AT: "before you" or "to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **they will come to know** - "they will learn" or "they will admit"
  * **will also keep you from the hour of testing** - "will also prevent the hour of testing from happening to you" or "will protect you so you do not enter the hour of testing"
  * **hour of testing** - "time of testing." This probably means "the time when people try to make you disobey me."
  * **is coming** - Existing in the future is spoken of as coming. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I am coming soon** - It is understood that he is coming in order to judge. AT: "I am coming to judge soon" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Hold tight to what you have** - Continuing to believe firmly in Christ is spoken of as if it were holding something tightly. AT: "Continue to believe firmly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **crown** - A crown was a wreath, originally of olive branches or laurel leaves, that was put on the head of a victorious athlete. Here "crown" stands for a reward. See how you translated "crown" in [[:en:bible:notes:rev:02:10|2:10]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
