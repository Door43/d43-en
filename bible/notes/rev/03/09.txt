<usfm>
\v 9 See, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan, those who say they are Jews, but are not--instead, they lie. See, I will make them come and bow down before your feet. I will make them know that I have loved you.
\v 10 Because you have kept my instructions to endure, I also will keep you from the hour of testing, 
which is about to come upon the whole inhabited world, to test those who live upon the earth.
\v 11 I am coming soon: hold tightly to what you have, so that no one takes away your crown.
