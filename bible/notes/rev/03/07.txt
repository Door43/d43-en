\v 7 "Write this message to the angel of the group of believers assembled in the city of Philadelphia: 'I am saying these things to you. I am the One who is holy, the True One. Just as King David had authority to allow people to enter the ancient city of Jerusalem, so I have the authority to allow people to enter my kingdom. I am the one who opens doors so that no one can close them and the one who closes doors so that no one can open them.
\v 8 I know everything you have done. Be aware that I have opened a door for you that no one can close. I know that although you have little power, you have obeyed what I say, and you have not denied that you believe in me.

\v 7 "To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write:
\q The words of the one who is holy and true—
\q2 he holds the key of David, 
\q2 he opens and no one shuts, 
\q3 he shuts and no one can open.
\p
\v 8 I know what you have done. See, I have put before you an open door that no one can shut. I know you have little strength, yet you have obeyed my word and have not denied my name.
