\v 14 "Write this message to the angel of the group of believers assembled in the city of Laodicea: 'I am saying these things to you. I am the one who guarantees all of God's promises. I am the one who testifies about God reliably and accurately. I am the ruler over all of God's creation.
\v 15 I know everything that you have done: You do not deny that you trust in me, but you do not love me much. You are like water that is neither cold nor hot. I wish that you were either cold or hot!
\v 16 Because you are neither hot or cold, I am about to reject you, as if I were spitting lukewarm water out of my mouth.

\v 14 "To the angel of the church in Laodicea write:
\p 'These are the words of the Amen, the reliable and true witness, the ruler over God's creation.
\v 15 "I know what you have done, and that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish that you were either cold or hot!
\v 16 So, because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to vomit you out of my mouth.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This is the beginning of the Son of Man's message to the angel of the church in Laodicea.

  * **the words of the Amen** - Here "the Amen" is a name for Jesus Christ. He guarantees God's promises by saying amen to them.  AT: "the words of the one who is called the Amen" or "the words of the one who says "Amen" to God's promises"
  * **the ruler over the creation of God** - "the one who rules over everything that God created." Another possible meaning is "the source of God's creation" meaning "the one through whom God created the everything" or "the creator of God's universe."
  * **you are neither cold nor hot** - "Cold" and hot" represent two extremes of spiritual interest or love for God. To be "cold" is to be completely against God, and to be "hot" is to be zealous to serve him. AT: "you are like water that is neither cold nor hot" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **lukewarm** - "slightly warm." This describes someone who has only a small amount of spiritual interest or conviction. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I am about to vomit you out of my mouth** - Rejecting them is spoken of as vomiting them out of the mouth. AT: "I will reject you as I would spit out lukewarm water." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
