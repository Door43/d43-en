\v 14 "Write this message to the angel of the group of believers assembled in the city of Laodicea: 'I am saying these things to you. I am the one who guarantees all of God's promises. I am the one who testifies about God reliably and accurately. I am the one by whom God created all things.
\v 15 I know everything that you have done: You do not deny that you trust in me, but you do not love me much. You are like water that is neither cold nor hot. I wish that you were either cold or hot!
\v 16 Because you are neither hot or cold, I am about to reject you, as if I were spitting lukewarm water out of my mouth.

\v 14 "To the angel of the church in Laodicea write:
\p 'The words of the Amen, the reliable and true witness, the ruler over the creation of God.
\v 15 I know what you have done, and that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish that you were either cold or hot!
\v 16 So, because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to vomit you out of my mouth.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The words of the Amen **- AT: "These are the words of the one who is called the Amen"
  * **cold nor hot** - This represents two extremes of spiritual interest. To be "cold" is to be completely against God, and to be "hot" is to be zealous to serve him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **lukewarm** - "slightly warm." This describes someone who has only a small amount of spiritual interest or conviction. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
