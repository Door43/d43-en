\v 3 So then, keep remembering God's message, what you accepted when you heard it. Obey it continually and turn away from your sinful behavior. If you do not do this, I will come to you when you are not expecting me, as a thief comes. You will never know at what time I will come to judge you.
\v 4 Nevertheless, there in the city of Sardis you have a few believers who have not been doing what is wrong. It is as though they have not dirtied their garments. As a result, because they are worthy to live with me, they will live with me and will be pure in every way, like people who are dressed in pure white clothing.

\v 3 Therefore remember how you have received and heard. Keep, and repent. If you do not wake up, I will come as a thief, and you will not know what hour I will come upon you.
\v 4 But you have a few people in Sardis that did not dirty their clothes: they will walk with me in white; for they are worthy.
