\v 17 You are saying, 'I am rich and have acquired a lot of wealth. I lack nothing!' But you do not realize that you are lacking in so many ways. You are like people who are very wretched and pitiful, poor, blind, and naked.
\v 18 I advise you to obtain from me all that you need, as though you were buying from me pure gold, in order that that you may be truly rich. Let me make you righteous, as though you were buying  from me white garments in order that you might wear clothes instead of being naked and ashamed. Let me help you to understand the truth, as though you were buying from me eye salve in order to put on sick eyes.

<usfm>
\v 17 Because you say, "I am rich, and have become rich, and have need of nothing," and you do not know that you are the wretched one and miserable and poor and blind and naked,
\v 18 I advise you to buy gold from me that has been refined by fire, so that you may become rich; and white garments, that you may clothe yourself, and that the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed; and eye salve to anoint your eyes, that you may see.
