====== Matthew 23 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Hypocrites ==

The hypocrisy of the Pharisees is the major theme in this chapter. Jesus speaks at length about this hypocrisy. The Pharisees made rules that no one could actually obey, and then they persuade the ordinary people that they were guilty because they could not obey the rules. In addition, the Pharisees' own rules give them excuses for not obeying God's original commands in the Law of Moses. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Name calling ==

In most cultures, it is wrong to insult people. Many of the words in this chapter directed at the Pharisees can be taken as insults. They are called "hypocrites," "blind guides," "fools," and "serpents." Jesus uses these words to describe and condemn their behavior.

== Paradox ==

This is a statement that seems absurd or appears to contradict itself. For example, "he who is greatest among you will be your servant" ([[:en:bible:notes:mat:23:11|23:11-12]])
