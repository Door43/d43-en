====== Matthew 23 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Hypocrites ==

The hypocrisy of the Pharisees is the major theme in this chapter. Jesus remarks that the religious rules developed by the Pharisees are impossible for anyone to keep, but that they Pharisees then persuade the people that they are guilty for not keeping them. In addition, their rules give them excuses for not obeying God with sincere hearts. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Name calling ==

In most cultures, it is wrong to insult people. Many of the words in this chapter directed at the Pharisees can be taken as insults. They are called "hypocrites," "blind guides," "fools," and "serpents." Jesus uses these words to describe and condemn their behavior.

== Paradox ==

This is a statement that seems absurd or appears to contradict itself. For example, "he who is greatest among you will be your servant" ([[:en:bible:notes:mat:23:11|23:11-12]])
