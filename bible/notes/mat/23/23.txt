\v 23 "You men who teach the \add Jewish\add* laws and you Pharisees, your punishment will be terrible! You are hypocrites because, \add even though\add* you give \add to God\add* a tenth of \add the herbs you produce, such as\add* mint, dill, and cummin, you do not \add obey God's\add* laws that are more important. \add For example, you do not act\add* justly toward others, you do not act mercifully toward people, and you are not trustworthy. It is good to \add give a tenth of your herbs\add* to God, but you should also \add obey\add* these other \add more important laws\add*.
\v 24 You \add leaders are like\add* blind people \add who are trying to lead others. According to your laws you say that touching gnats and camels makes you unacceptable to God. What you are doing is like\add* straining a gnat \add out of a jar of water so that you do not swallow it and thereby become unacceptable to God\add*, and \add at the same time\add* swallowing a camel \add with the water\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*!"

\v 23 "You teachers of the law and you Pharisees, how terribly God will punish you! You are hypocrites because, even though you give to God a tenth of the herbs you produce, such as mint, dill, and cummin, you do not obey God's laws that are more important. For example, you do not act justly toward others, you do not act mercifully toward people, and you act dishonestly. It is good to give a tenth of your herbs to God, but you should also obey these other more important laws.
\v 24 You leaders are like blind people who are trying to lead others. You are careful not to offend God by swallowing even the smallest insect when you drink water, but you act as badly as if you were swallowing a camel!

\v 23 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you tithe mint, dill, and cumin, but you have left undone the weightier matters of the law—justice, mercy, and faith. But these you ought to have done, and not to have left the other undone.
\v 24 You blind guides, you who strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to speak against the religious leaders because of their hypocrisy.

  * **Woe to you** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:23:13|23:13]].
  * **mint, dill, and cumin** - leaves and seeds used to make food taste good (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **You blind guides** - These people are not physically blind. Jesus is comparing spiritual blindness to physical blindness. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you who strain out a gnat but swallow a camel** - Being careful to follow the less important laws and ignoring the more important laws is as foolish as being careful not to swallow the smallest unclean animal but eating the meat of the largest unclean animal either purposely or unknowingly. AT: "you are as foolish as a person who strains out a gnat that falls into his drink but swallows a camel." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **strain out a gnat** - drink through cloth that will keep the gnat from going into the mouth
  * **gnat** - a small flying insect
