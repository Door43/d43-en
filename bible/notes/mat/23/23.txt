It is good to \add give a tenth of your herbs\add* to God, but you should also \add obey\add* these other \add more important laws\add*. \v 24 You \add leaders are like\add* blind people \add who are trying to lead others. According to your laws you say that touching gnats and camels makes you unacceptable to God. What you are doing is like\add* straining a gnat \add out of a jar of water so that you do not swallow it and thereby become unacceptable to God\add*, and \add at the same time\add* swallowing a camel \add with the water\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*!"

<usfm> \v 23 "You teachers of the law and you Pharisees, how terribly God will punish you! You are hypocrites because, even though you give to God a tenth of the herbs you produce, such as mint, dill, and cummin, you do not obey God's laws that are more important. For example, you do not act justly toward others, you do not act mercifully toward people, and you act dishonestly. It is good to give a tenth of your herbs to God, but you should also obey these other more important laws. \v 24 You leaders are like blind people who are trying to lead others. You are careful not to offend God by swallowing even the smallest insect when you drink water, but you act as badly as if you were swallowing a camel!

<usfm> \p \v 23 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you tithe mint, dill, and cumin, but you have left undone the weightier matters of the law–justice, mercy, and faith. But these you ought to have done, and not to have left the other undone. \v 24 You blind guides, you who strain out a gnat but swallow a camel! </usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Woe to you**  - This is a way of saying, "How terrible it will be for you." It lets the hearers know that God is angry with them. See how you translated this in __23:13__.
  * **mint, dill, and cumin **- These are different spices.
  * **You blind guides**  - These people are not physically blind. Jesus is comparing spiritual blindness to physical blindness. (See: Metaphor)
  * **you who strain out a gnat but swallow a camel**  - Jesus uses these examples from nature to show them their actions about obeying God's law. He was showing them they were unwilling to swallow a small insect (or insignificant rules of God) but were ignoring the very big animals (or rules of God) (See: Metaphor)
  * **gnat**  - a very small flying insect
  * **camel**  - a very large animal in desert regions
