You killed them by throwing stones at them \f + \ft doublet \f*!

\v 37 "O people of Jerusalem, you who killed the prophets who lived long ago, and you who killed others whom God sent to you with stones. Many, many times I wanted to gather you together to protect you, like a hen gathers her young chicks under her wings. But you did not want me to do that.
\v 38 So listen to this: Your city will become an uninhabited place.
\v 39 Keep this in mind: You will see me again only when I return, when you say about me, 'God is truly pleased with this man who comes with God's authority.'"

\v 37 Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you! How often did I long to gather your children together, just as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, but you did not agree!
\v 38 See, your house is left to you abandoned.
\v 39 For I say to you, You will not see me from now on, until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'"
