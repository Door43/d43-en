\v 18 Also \add you say\add*, 'In the case of those who promise to \add do\add* something and then ask \add the altar to affirm what they have promised\add*, it means nothing \add if they do not do what they have promised\add*. But if they ask the gift \add that\add* they have put on the altar \add to support what they have promised\add*, they must do \add what they promised\add*.'
\v 19 \add You are like people who are\add* blind \f + \ft metaphor \f*. The gift \add that is offered\add* on the altar is important, but the altar is even more important \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* because it is the altar on which the offering is offered that sets it apart for a special use for God.

\v 18 Also you say, 'If someone asks the altar to confirm that he will do something as if the altar were a person, then if he does not do what he promised, it means nothing. But if he asks the gift that he has placed on the altar to confirm that he will do something, then he must do it.'
\v 19 You are like people who are blind. The gift that you put on the altar is important, but the altar is even more important because it is the altar that makes the gift only for God to use.

\v 18 And, 'Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is on it, he is bound to his oath.'
\v 19 You blind people, for which is greater, the gift, or the altar that consecrates the gift?
