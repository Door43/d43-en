\v 29 "You men who teach the \add Jewish\add* laws and you Pharisees are hypocrites! Your punishment will be terrible! You rebuild the tombs of the \add prophets whom others killed long ago\add*. You decorate the monuments \add that honor\add* righteous \add people\add*.
\v 30 You say, 'If we had \add lived\add* when our ancestors \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add lived\add*, we would not have helped \f + \ft metaphor \f* those who killed \f + \ft metonymy \f* the prophets.'
\v 31 Thus \add you recognize that you should honor the prophets, but you disregard the word of God that other men whom God has sent teach you. In that way\add* you testify against yourselves that you are descendants and disciples \f + \ft metaphor \f* of those who killed the prophets.

\v 30 You say, 'If we had lived when our ancestors lived, we would not have helped those who killed the prophets.'
\v 31 In this way you admit that you are the descendants of those murderers; so, you are like them!

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to rebuke religious leaders.

  * **Woe to you**  - See how you translated this in __23:13__  and other verses.
  * **You say **- Jesus is using this phrase to let them know he is aware of their thoughts, beliefs, and things they had said.
  * **would not have been participants with them in shedding the blood **- This can be translated as "would not have helped our ancestors who killed."
  * **you testify to yourselves**  - "in this way you admit." (UDB)
  * **sons of those who killed**  - "you are descendants of those who killed" Not literal sons.
