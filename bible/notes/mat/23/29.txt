\v 30 You say, 'If we had \add lived\add* when our ancestors \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add lived\add*, we would not have helped \f + \ft metaphor \f* those who killed \f + \ft metonymy \f* the prophets.'
\v 31 Thus \add you recognize that you should honor the prophets, but you disregard the word of God that other men whom God has sent teach you. In that way\add* you testify against yourselves that you are descendants and disciples \f + \ft metaphor \f* of those who killed the prophets.
