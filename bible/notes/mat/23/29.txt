\v 29 "You men who teach the \add Jewish\add* laws and you Pharisees are hypocrites! Your punishment will be terrible! You rebuild the tombs of the \add prophets whom others killed long ago\add*. You decorate the monuments \add that honor\add* righteous \add people\add*.
\v 30 You say, 'If we had \add lived\add* when our ancestors \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add lived\add*, we would not have helped \f + \ft metaphor \f* those who killed \f + \ft metonymy \f* the prophets.'
\v 31 Thus \add you recognize that you should honor the prophets, but you disregard the word of God that other men whom God has sent teach you. In that way\add* you testify against yourselves that you are descendants and disciples \f + \ft metaphor \f* of those who killed the prophets.

\v 29 "You men who teach the Jewish laws and you Pharisees are hypocrites! How terribly God will punish you! You rebuild the tombs of the prophets whom others killed long ago. You decorate the monuments that honor righteous people.
\v 30 You say, 'If we had lived when our ancestors lived, we would not have helped those who killed the prophets.'
\v 31 In this way you admit that you are the descendants of those murderers; so, you are like them!
