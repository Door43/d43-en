\v 16 "You \add Jewish leaders\add*, your punishment will be terrible! You are \add like people who are\add* blind \f + \ft metaphor \f* who are trying to lead others. You say, '\add In the case of\add* those who promise to \add do\add* something and then ask the Temple \add to affirm what they have promised\add*, it means nothing \add if they do not do what\add* they have promised. But if they ask the gold that is in the Temple \add to affirm what they have promised\add*, they must do what they promised.'
\v 17 You are fools, and you are \add like people who are\add* blind \f + \ft metaphor \f*! The gold \add that is in the Temple\add* is important, but \add the Temple\add* is even more important \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*, because it is the Temple that the gold is in that sets the gold apart for a special use for God.

\v 16 "You Jewish leaders, how terribly God will punish you! You are like blind people who try to lead others. You say, 'If someone asks the temple to confirm that he will do something as if the temple were a person, then if he does not do what he promised, it means nothing. But if he asks the gold in the temple to confirm that he will do something, then he must do it.'
\v 17 You are fools, and you are like people who are blind! The gold that is in the temple is important, but the temple is even more important, because it is the temple that makes the gold to be only for God.

\v 16 Woe to you, you blind guides, you who say, 'Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing. But whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound to his oath.'
\v 17 You blind fools! Which is greater, the gold or the temple that has makes the gold holy?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **blind guides ... blind fools** - The Jewish leaders were spiritually blind. Although they thought of themselves as teachers, they were unable to understand God's truth. See how you translated "blind guides" in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:15:12|15:14]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **by the temple, it is nothing** - "by the temple does not have to keep his oath"
  * **is bound to his oath** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "must do what he promised to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Which is greater, the gold or the temple that has dedicated the gold to God?** - Jesus uses this question to rebuke the Pharisees. AT: "The temple that has dedicated the gold to God is more important than the gold!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the temple that has dedicated the gold to God** - "the temple that makes the gold belong to God alone"
