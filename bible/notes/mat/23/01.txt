\v 1 Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples;
\v 2 he said, "The scribes and the Pharisees sit in  Mosesâ€™ seat.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus begins to warn his followers not to be like the religious leaders.

  * **sit in Moses' seat** - "have authority as Moses had" or "have authority to say what the Law of Moses means" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **whatever** - "anything" or "everything"
