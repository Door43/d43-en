\v 13-14 \add Then Jesus said to the religious leaders\add*, "You men who teach the \add Jewish\add* laws and you Pharisees are hypocrites! There will be terrible punishment for \add you, because by teaching what is false\add*, you \add prevent people\add* [MTY\f + \ft Or: HYP \f*] \add who are thinking about letting\add* God rule their lives \add from doing that\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add What you are doing is like\add* closing a gate \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add so that people who\add* are wanting to enter \add a city cannot go in\add*. As for \bd you,\bd* \add you do not let\add* God \add rule your lives. Neither do you allow\add* other people \add to let God rule their lives. What you do is like\add* not going into a \add house\add* yourselves, and not allowing others to enter it \add either\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*.\f + \fk very \fk* severely."\f*"


\p
\v 15 "You are hypocrites, you men who teach the \add Jewish\add* laws and you Pharisees! Your punishment will be terrible, because you exert yourselves very much to get \add even\add* one person to believe what you teach. For instance, you travel across seas and lands \add to distant places\add* in order to do that. And \add as a result\add*, when one person \add believes what you teach\add*, you make that person much more deserving to go to hell than you yourselves \add deserve to\add*."

\v 13-14 "You teachers of the law and you Pharisees, you are hypocrites! How terribly God will punish you, because you refuse to come under the rule of heaven and also keep others out. You yourselves do not want to go in, and you keep others from entering, too." 
\p
\v 15 "You are hypocrites, you teachers of the law and you Pharisees! How terribly God will punish you! You work hard to get even one person to believe what you teach. You even travel across seas and lands to distant places in order to do that. And as a result, when one person believes what you teach, you make that person deserve to go to hell much more than you yourselves do."

\v 13 But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You shut the kingdom of heaven against people. For you do not enter it yourselves, and neither do you allow those about to enter to do so. 
\v 14 \f + \ft The best ancient copies omit verse 14 (some copies add the verse after verse 12). \fqa Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows' houses, while you make a show of long prayers. You will therefore receive greater condemnation. \f*
\v 15 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you go over sea and land to make one convert. And when he has become one, you make him twice a son of hell as you yourselves are.

  * **neither do you allow those about to enter to do so** - "neither do you allow those who want to accept God as their king to do so"
  * **you go over sea and land** - This is an idiom that means they go to distant places. AT: "you travel great distances" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **to make one convert** - "to make one person accept your religion"
  * **son of hell** - Here "son of" is an idiom that means "one belonging to." AT: "person who belongs in hell" or "person who should go to hell" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **devour widows' houses** - In the footnote, "devour" is an idiom that means to take by force. AT: "steal everything from women who have no men to protect them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
