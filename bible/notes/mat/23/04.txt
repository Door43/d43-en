\v 4 They require you to obey many rules that are difficult to obey. But they themselves do not help anyone obey those rules. It is as if they were tying up very heavy loads and putting them on your shoulders for you to carry. But they will not even move one finger to help you carry them.
\v 5 Whatever they do, they do those things so that other people will see them and admire them. For example, they make extra wide the tiny boxes containing portions of Scripture that they wear on their arms. They enlarge the tassels on their robes, to make others think that they honor God.

\v 4 Yes, they bind heavy burdens that are difficult to carry, and then they put them on people's shoulders.  But they themselves will not move
a finger to carry them.
\v 5 All their deeds, they do them to be seen by people; for they make their phylacteries wide, and they enlarge the borders
of their garments.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to warn his followers not to be like the religious leaders.

  * **they bind heavy burdens that are difficult to carry **- This phrase compares heavy burdens to many rules imposed by the Pharisees. "They place on you many rules which collected together are difficult to follow." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **they themselves will not move a finger** - "They will not give the least amount of help" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **for they make their phylacteries wide, and enlarge the borders of their garments ** - The religious leaders often made their phylacteries larger so they would appear to have even greater devotion to Yahweh.Likewise, they made the tassels on the hem of their cloths longer, to also draw attention to their devotion to Yahweh. 
  * **phylacteries** - These were small leather boxes containing portions of Scripture that they wore on their arms or foreheads to remind them to keep the law.
