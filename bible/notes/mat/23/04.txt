\v 4 They require you to obey many rules that are difficult to obey. But they themselves do not help anyone obey those rules. It is as if they were tying up very heavy loads and putting them on your shoulders for you to carry. But they will not even move one finger to help you carry them.
\v 5 Whatever they do, they do those things so that other people will see them and admire them. For example, they make extra wide the tiny boxes containing portions of Scripture that they wear on their arms. They enlarge the tassels on their robes to make others think that they honor God.

\v 4 Yes, they bind heavy burdens that are difficult to carry, and then they put them on people's shoulders.  But they themselves will not move a finger to carry them.
\v 5 All their deeds, they do them to be seen by people; for they make their phylacteries wide, and they enlarge the borders of their garments.
