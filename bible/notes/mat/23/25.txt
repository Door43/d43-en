\v 25 "You men who teach people the \add Jewish\add* laws and you Pharisees, your punishment will be terrible! You are hypocrites! You are greedy and selfish, but you \add make yourselves appear holy. You are like\add* cups and plates that have been cleaned on the outside, but on the inside \add they are very filthy\add*.
\v 26 You blind Pharisees! First you must \add stop being greedy and selfish\add*. \add Then you will be able to do what\add* is \add righteous. That will be like\add* cleaning the inside of a cup first. Then when you clean \f + \ft metaphor \f* the outside \add of the cup\add*, \add the cup will truly be clean\add*."

\v 25 "You hypocrites, you teachers of the law and you Pharisees, how terribly God will punish you! You make yourselves appear like good people to others. You are like cups and plates that women have washed on the outside, but on these things are dirty on their inside with more food and drink than you will ever need, food and drink that you have taken from others.
\v 26 You blind Pharisees! First you must stop stealing from others. Then you will be able to do what is righteous. Then you will be like a cup that is clean both outside and in."

  * **Woe to you** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:23:13|23:13]].
  * **For you clean the outside of the cup and of the plate, but inside they are full of extortion and excess** - This is a metaphor that means the scribes and Pharisees appear pure on the outside to others, but on the inside they are wicked. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **inside they are full of extortion and excess** - "they take by force what belongs to others so they can have much more than they need"
  * **You blind Pharisee** - The Pharisees were spiritually blind. Although they thought of themselves as teachers, they were unable to understand God's truth. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **clean first the inside of the cup and of the plate, so that the outside may become clean also** - This is a metaphor that means that if they would become pure in their inner being, then the result is that they would be pure on the outside as well. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
