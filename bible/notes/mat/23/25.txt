\v 25 "You hypocrites, you teachers of the law and you Pharisees, how terribly God will punish you! You make yourselves appear like good people to others. You are like cups and plates that women have washed on the outside, but on the inside they are very dirty with food and drink that you have stolen from others.
\v 26 You blind Pharisees! First you must stop stealing from others. Then you will be able to do what is righteous. Then you will be like a cup that is clean both outside and in."
