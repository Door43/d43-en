\v 11 Note this: of all the people who have ever lived, God does not consider any of them to be greater than John the Baptizer. At the same time, God considers that all the people over whom he will agree to rule are greater than John, even if they are the least people whom he rules.
\v 12 From the time that John the Baptizer preached until now, some people have tried to force God to rule as they want him to rule, and they have tried to force him to rule so they can profit from it.

\v 11 I say to you truly, among those born of women no one is greater than John the Baptist. Yet the least important person in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he is.
\v 12 From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and men of violence take it by force.
