\v 11 Note this: Of all the people who have ever lived, \add God does not consider\add* that any of them are greater than John the Baptizer.

\v 12 From the time that John the Baptizer\add preached\add* until now, \add other people\add* have violently attacked the people who have \add allowed\add* God [MTY\f + \ft Or: EUP \f*] to rule their lives and they have suffered \f + \ft Or: people have very eagerly been asking God to take control of their lives, OR, Israelite people \add who have thought that I would become their king\add* have been extremely eager to be included in my kingdom \f* \f + \ft Or: have been violently attacked and made to suffer \f*.

\v 11 Note this: Of all the people who have ever lived, God does not consider any of them to be greater than John the Baptizer. At the same time, God considers those that are not important over whom he will agree to rule from heaven are greater than John.
\v 12 From the time that John the Baptizer preached until now, some people have been trying to make God rule from heaven in their own way, and they have been using force for this purpose.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 I say to you truly, among those born of women no one is greater than John the Baptist. Yet the least important person in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he is.
\v 12 From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and men of violence take it by force.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to talk to the crowds about John the Baptist.

  * **I say to you truly** - "I tell you the truth." This phrase adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.
  * **among those born of women** - This is a way of referring to all humans. AT: "out of all people who have ever lived" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **no one is greater than John the Baptist** - This can be stated in positive form. AT: "John the Baptist is the greatest" or "John the Baptist is the most important"
  * **the least important person in the kingdom of heaven** - Here "kingdom of heaven" refers to God's rule as king. The phrase "kingdom of heaven" is used only in Matthew. If possible, try to keep "heaven" in your translation. AT: "the least important person under the rule of our God in heaven" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **is greater than he is** - "is more important than John is"
  * **From the days of John the Baptist** - "From the time John began preaching his message" (See: [[:en:obe:other:biblicaltimeday]])
  * **the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and men of violence take it by force** - There are various possible interpretations of this verse. The ULB and UDB assume that it means that some people want to use God's kingdom for their own selfish purposes, and that they are willing to use force against other people to accomplish this. Other versions assume a positive interpretation, that the call to enter the kingdom of God has become so urgent, that people must act in an extreme manner in order to answer that call and to resist the temptation to sin further. A third interpretation is that violent people are harming God's people and trying to stop God from ruling.
