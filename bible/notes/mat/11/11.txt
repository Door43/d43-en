\v 11 Note this: of all the people who have ever lived, God does not consider any of them to be greater than John the Baptizer. At the same time, God considers that all those people who have accepted God to rule over them are greater than John, even if they are the least people whom he rules.
\v 12 From the time that John the Baptizer preached until now, some people have tried to force God to rule as they want him to rule, and they have tried to force him to rule so they can profit from it.
