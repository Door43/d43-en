===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 11 Note this: of all the people who have ever lived, God does not consider any of them to be greater than John the Baptizer. At the same time, God considers that all the people over whom he will agree to rule are greater than John, even if they are the least people whom he rules. \v 12 From the time that John the Baptizer preached until now, some people have tried to force God to rule as they want him to rule, and they have tried to force him to rule so they can profit from it. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 11 I say to you, among those born of women no one is greater than John the Baptist. Yet the least important person in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he is. \v 12 From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and men of violence take it by force. </usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to talk to the crowds about John the Baptist.

  * **I say to you **- This can be translated "Truly, I tell you" or "I tell you the truth." Jesus was speaking to the crowd, so “you” is plural. Jesus said this to emphasize the truth of the surprising thing he was about to say next.
  * **among those born of women **- “among those to whom a woman has given birth.” This is a figure of speech referring to all people. It could also be translated as “of all the people who have ever lived” (UDB).
  * **no one is greater than John the Baptist **- This can be translated positively as “John the Baptist is the greatest.”
  * **in the kingdom of heaven**  - This refers to a person who will be part of the kingdom that God will establish. This could be translated as “who has entered into the kingdom of heaven.”
  * **is greater that he is**  - “has higher spiritual status than John”
  * **he is **- "He" refers to John the Baptist.
  * **the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and men of violence take it by force**  - Possible meanings are (1) a negative sense as in the UDB, or (2) in a different negative sense of the people of God being persecuted, or (3) in a positive sense of "the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and forceful men take hold of it."
  * **suffers violence **- "has experienced violence" or "has been attacked with violence"
  * **men of violence **- "the violent" or "violent men"
  * **take it by force**  - "It" refers to the kingdom of heaven.
