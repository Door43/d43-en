\v 11 Note this: of all the people who have ever lived, God does not consider any of them to be greater than John the Baptizer. At the same time, God considers that all the people over whom he will agree to rule are greater than John, even if they are the least people whom he rules.
\v 12 From the time that John the Baptizer preached until now, some people have tried to force God to rule as they want him to rule, and they have tried to force him to rule so they can profit from it.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to talk to the crowds about John the Baptist.

  * **I say to you ** - "Truly, I tell you" or "I tell you the truth." Jesus was speaking to the crowd, so the pronoun “you” is plural. Jesus said this to emphasize the truth of the surprising thing he was about to say next.
  * **among those born of women ** - “among those to whom a woman has given birth.” This is a figure of speech referring to all people who have ever lived (see UDB).
  * **no one is greater than John the Baptist** - This can be translated positively as “John the Baptist is the greatest.”
  * **in the kingdom of heaven** - This refers to a person who will be part of the kingdom that God will establish. Alternative translation: “who has entered into the kingdom of heaven.”
  * **is greater that he is** - “has higher spiritual status than John” or "is more important than John is"
  * **From the days of John the Baptist until now** - "From the time John began preaching his message"
  * **the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and men of violence take it by force** - Possible meanings are (1) a negative sense (see UDB) or (2) in a different negative sense ("people persecute the subjects of the kingdom of heaven, and violent men are trying to take control of it") or (3) in a positive sense of "the kingdom of heaven has been powerfully advancing, and powerful men want to be part of it."
  * **take it by force** - The pronoun "it" refers to the kingdom of heaven.
