\v 7 When John's disciples had gone away, Jesus began to talk to the crowd of people about John. He said to them, "When you went out into the wilderness to see John, what was it you expected to see? You did not go there just to look at the tall grass blowing in the wind, did you?
\v 8 So what kind of person did you expect to see? Surely not a man who was wearing expensive clothes. No! You know very well that people who wear clothes like that reside in kings' palaces and not in the wilderness.

\v 7 As these men went on their way, Jesus began to say to the crowds about John, "What did you go out  in the desert to see—a reed being shaken by the wind?
\v 8 But what did you go out to see—a man dressed in soft clothing? Really, those who wear soft clothing live in kings' houses.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus begins to talk to the crowds about John the Baptist.

  * **what did you go out to see ** - Jesus used this phrase in three rhetorical questions to cause the people to think about what kind of person John the Baptist was. It could be translated as “Did you go out to see …? Of course not!” or “Surely you did not go out to see …!” (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **a reed being shaken by the wind** - This can 1) mean the literal plants by the Jordan river (see UDB) or 2) be a metaphor for a kind of person: “a man who was like a reed shaken by the wind.” (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]]) This simile has two possible interpretations: such a man could 1) be easily moved by the wind, a metaphor for  easily changing his mind, or 2) make noise when the wind blows, a metaphor for talking a lot but not saying anything important. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **reed ** - "tall, grassy plant"
  * **dressed in soft clothing ** - “wearing expensive clothing.” Rich people wore this kind of clothing.
  * **Really** - This word, often translated “behold,” adds emphasis to what follows. Alternative translation: “Indeed.”
