\v 7 When John's disciples had gone away, Jesus began to talk to the crowd of people about John. He said to them, "When you went out into the wilderness to see John, what was it you expected to see? You did not go there just to look at the tall grass blowing in the wind, did you?
\v 8 So what kind of person did you expect to see? Surely not a man who was wearing expensive clothes. No! You know very well that people who wear clothes like that reside in kings' palaces and not in the wilderness.

\v 8 But what did you go out to see--a man dressed in soft clothing? Really, they who wear soft clothing live in kings' houses.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus begins to talk to the crowds about John the Baptist.

  * **What did you go out to see ** - Jesus used this phrase in three rhetorical questions to cause the people to think about what kind of person John the Baptist was. It could be translated as “Did you go out to see …? Of course not!” or “Surely you did not go out to see …!” (See: [[en:ta:translate:RhetoricalQuestion]])
  * **a reed shaken by the wind** - This metaphor could also be translated as a simile: “a man who was like a reed shaken by the wind.” It has two possible interpretations. 1) Reeds are easily moved by the wind, so it could refer to a person who is easily motivated to change his mind. 2) Reeds make noise when the wind rattles them, so it could refer to a person who talks a lot but his speech does not result in anything important (See: [[en:ta:translate:Metaphor]]).
  * **reed ** - "tall, grassy plant"
  * **dressed in soft ****clothing ** - “wearing expensive clothing.” Rich people wore this kind of clothing.
  * **Really** - This word, often translated “behold,” adds emphasis to what follows. Alternative translation: “Indeed.”
