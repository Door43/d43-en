\v 18 I say this because you are dissatisfied with both John and me! When John came and preached to you, he did not eat good food and did not drink wine, like most people do. But you rejected him and said, 'A demon is controlling him!'
\v 19 I, the Son of Man, was not like John. I eat the same food and drink wine as other people do. But you also reject me and say, 'Look! This man eats too much food and drinks too much wine, and he is friends with tax collectors and other sinners!' But anyone who is truly wise will show it by doing good deeds."

\v 18 For John came not eating bread or drinking wine, and they say, 'He has a demon.'
\v 19 The Son of Man came eating and drinking and they say, 'Look, he is a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners! But wisdom is justified by her deeds.'"

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus concludes talking to the crowds about John the Baptist.

  * **not eating bread **  - "not eating food." This can be translated "frequently fasting" or "not eating good food" (UDB). It does not mean that John never ate food.
  * **they say, 'He has a demon'**  - Jesus was quoting what the people were saying about John. It can be translated as an indirect quote: "they say that he has a demon" or "they accuse him of having a demon." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations|Speech Quotations]])
  * **they**  - The pronoun "they" refers to the people of that present generation.
  * **The Son of Man**  - Since Jesus expected the people there to understand that he was the Son of Man, it could also be translated as "I, the Son of Man."
  * **they say, 'Look, he is a gluttonous man**  - Jesus was quoting what the people were saying about him as the Son of Man. This can be translated as an indirect quote: "they say that he is a gluttonous man" or "they accuse him of eating too much." If you translated "The Son of Man" as "I, the Son of man", the indirect quote could be translated as "they say that I am a gluttonous man."
  * **he is a gluttonous man**  - "he is a greedy eater" or "he continually eats too much food"
  * **a drunkard**  - "a drunk" or "he continually drinks too much alcohol"
  * **But wisdom is justified by her deeds **  - This is probably a proverb that Jesus was applying to this situation, because the people who rejected both him and John were not being wise. It can be translated as an active sentence as in the UDB (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **wisdom is justified **  - This expression, where Jesus describes wisdom as if it were a woman, is not used here in the sense that wisdom is put right before God but in the sense that wisdom is proved right (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification|Personification]])
  * **her deeds**  - The pronoun "her" refers to wisdom which Jesus has described as if it were a woman.
