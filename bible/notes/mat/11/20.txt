\v 20 \add The people, who lived in\add* the towns \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add in the area where Jesus was, saw him\add* perform many miracles. But they did not turn away from their sinful behavior. So Jesus began to reproach them \add by saying to them\add*,
\v 21 "You \add people who live in\add* Chorazin \add city\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* and you \add people who live in\add* Bethsaida \add city\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* will suffer terribly in hell! \add I\add* did great miracles in your \add cities, but you did not turn from your sinful behavior\add*. If the miracles that I performed in your \add cities\add* had been done in \add the ancient cities of\add* Tyre and Sidon, the \add wicked people who lived there\add* long ago would have sat in ashes, wearing coarse cloth \add to show that they were sorry for their sins\add*.
\v 22 So note this: \add God will punish the wicked people who lived in the cities of\add* Tyre and Sidon \f + \ft metonymy \f*, but he will punish you even more severely on the final day when he judges \add all people\add*.

\v 20 The people, who lived in the towns in the area where Jesus was, saw him perform many miracles. But they did not turn away from their sinful behavior. So Jesus began to rebuke them by saying to them,
\v 21 "You people who live in the city of Chorazin and you in the city of Bethsaida, how terribly you will suffer! I did great miracles in your cities, but you did not stop sinning. If I had done these things in the cities of Tyre and Sidon of long ago, those wicked people would certainly have stopped sinning; they would have put on rough clothing and sat in the cold ashes of their fires, so sorry they would have been.
\v 22 Let me tell you this: God will punish the wicked people who lived in the cities of Tyre and Sidon, but he will punish you even more severely on the final day when he judges all people.

\v 20 Then Jesus began to rebuke the cities in which most of his mighty deeds were done, because they had not repented. 
\v 21 "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the mighty deeds had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
\v 22 But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment than for you.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jesus begins to rebuke the people of the cities where he previously did miracles.

  * **rebuke the cities** - Here "the cities" refers to the people who live there. AT: "rebuke the people of the cities" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **cities** - "towns"
  * **in which most of his mighty deeds were done** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "in which he did most of his mighty deeds" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **mighty deeds** - "mighty works" or "works of power" or "miracles"
  * **Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida!** - Jesus speaks as if the people of the cities of Chorazin and Bethsaida were there listening to him, but they were not. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
  * **Woe to you** - "How terrible it will be for you!" Here "you" is singular and refers to the city. If it is more natural to refer to the people instead of a city, you could translate with a plural "you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **Chorazin ... Bethsaida ... Tyre ... Sidon** - The names of these cities are used as metonyms for the people living in these cities. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **If the mighty deeds ... in sackcloth and ashes** - Jesus is describing a hypothetical situation that could have happened in the past, but it did not. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **If the mighty deeds had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you** - This can be translated with active forms. AT: "If I had done the mighty deeds among the people of Tyre and Sidon that I have done among you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **which were done in you ... than for you** - Here the "you" is plural and refers to Chorazin and Bethsaida. If it is more natural for your language, you could use a dual "you" to refer to the two cities, or a plural "you" to refer to the people of the cities. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **they would have repented long** - The pronoun "they" refers to the people of Tyre and Sidon.
  * **repented** - "shown they were sorry for their sins"
  * **it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment than for you** - Here "Tyre and Sidon" refers to the people who live there. AT: "God will show more mercy to the people of Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than to you" or "God will punish you more severely at the day of judgment than the people of Tyre and Sidon" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **than for you** - The implied information can be made explicit. AT "than for you, because you did not repent and believe in me, even though you saw me do miracles" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
