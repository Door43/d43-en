\v 25 At that time Jesus answered and said, "I praise you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you concealed these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to those who are untaught, like little children.
\v 26 Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight.
\v 27 All things have been entrusted to me from my Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son desires to reveal him.
