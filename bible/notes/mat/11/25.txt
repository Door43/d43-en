<usfm> \v 25 At that time Jesus prayed, "Father, you rule over everything in heaven and on the earth. I thank you that you have prevented people who think that they are wise and well-educated from knowing these things. Instead, you have revealed them to people who accept your truth just as little childen believe what an adult tells them. \v 26 Yes, Father, you have done that because it seemed good to you to do so." \p \v 27 Then Jesus said to the people, "God, my Father, has revealed to me all the things that I need to know in order to do my work. Only my Father knows who I really am. Furthermore, only I and those people to whom I wish to reveal him really know him. </usfm>

<usfm> \p \v 25 At that time Jesus answered and said, "I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have concealed these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to infants; \v 26 yes, Father, for thus it was well pleasing in your sight. \v 27 All things have been delivered to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father; neither does anyone know the Father except the Son and to whomever the Son wishes to reveal him. </usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus now turns to speak to God the Father in verses 25 and 26. In verse 27, Jesus is not speaking to God the Father.

  * **O Father **- This refers to God the Father, not an earthly father.
  * **concealed **- This word is the opposite of "revealed."
  * **revealed them**  - The pronoun "them" refers back to "these things" earlier in this verse.
  * **infants **- Here, "infants" is a metaphor for people who are not wise or well-educated. (See: Metaphor)
  * **All things have been delivered to me by my Father**  - This passive phrase can be translated if necessary in an active voice as in UDB (See: Active or Passive)
  * **to whomever the Son wishes to reveal him**  - The pronoun "him" refers to God the Father.
