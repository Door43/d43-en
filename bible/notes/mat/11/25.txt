\v 25 At that time Jesus prayed, "Father, you rule over everything in heaven and on the earth. I thank you that you have prevented people who think that they are wise and well educated from knowing these things. Instead, you have revealed them to people who accept your truth just as little childen believe what an adult tells them.
\v 26 Yes, Father, you have done that because it seemed good to you to do so."
\p
\v 27 Then Jesus said to the people, "God, my Father, has revealed to me all the things that I need to know in order to do my work. Only my Father knows who I really am. Furthermore, only I and those people to whom I wish to reveal him really know him.

\v 25 At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you concealed these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to those who are untaught, like little children.
\v 26 Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight.
\v 27 All things have been entrusted to me from my Father. And no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son desires to reveal him.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In verses 25 and 26, Jesus prays to his heavenly Father while still in the presence of the crowd. In verse 27, he begins to address the people again.

  * **Father** - This is an important title for God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **Lord of heaven and earth** - "Lord who rules over heaven and earth." The phrase "heaven and earth" is a merism that refers to all people and things in the universe. AT: "Lord who rules over the whole universe" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **you concealed these things ... and revealed them** - It is not clear what is meant by "these things." If your language needs to specify what is meant, an alternative translation might be best. AT: "you concealed these truths ... and revealed them"
  * **you concealed these things from** - "you hid these things from" or "you have not made these things known to." This verb is the opposite of "revealed."
  * **from the wise and understanding** - These nominal adjectives can be translated as adjectives. AT: "from people who are wise and understanding" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]])
  * **the wise and understanding** - Jesus is using irony. He does not think these people are really wise. AT: "people who think they are wise and understanding" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **revealed them** - "made them known." The pronoun "them" refers to "these things" earlier in this verse.
  * **to those who are untaught** - "to those who are ignorant"
  * **like little children** - Jesus compares an ignorant person to a little child. Jesus is emphasizing that many of those who believe him are not well educated or think of themselves as wise. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **for so it was well-pleasing in your sight** - The phrase "in your sight" is a metonym that stands for how a person considers something. AT: "for you considered it good to do this" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **All things have been entrusted to me from my Father** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "My Father has entrusted all things to me" or "My Father has given everything over to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **All things** - Possible meanings are 1) God the Father has revealed everything about himself and his kingdom to Jesus or 2) God has given all authority to Jesus.
  * **my Father** - This is an important title for God that describes the relationship between God and Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **no one knows the Son except the Father** - "only the Father knows the Son" 
  * **no one knows** - Both times Jesus uses this phrase, the word "knows" means more than just knowing the person. It means knowing the person intimately because they have a special relationship.
  * **the Son** - Jesus was referring to himself in the third person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **Son** - This is an important title for Jesus, the Son of God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **no one knows the Father except the Son** - "only the Son knows the Father"
