\v 25 At that time Jesus prayed, "Father, you rule over everything in heaven and on the earth. I thank you that you have prevented people who think that they are wise and well educated from knowing these things. Instead, you have revealed them to people who accept your truth just as little childen believe what an adult tells them.
\v 26 Yes, Father, you have done that because it seemed good to you to do so."
\p
\v 27 Then Jesus said to the people, "God, my Father, has revealed to me all the things that I need to know in order to do my work. Only my Father knows who I really am. Furthermore, only I and those people to whom I wish to reveal him really know him.

\v 25 At that time Jesus answered and said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you concealed these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to those who are untaught, like little children.
\v 26 Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight.
\v 27 All things have been entrusted to me from my Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son desires to reveal him.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus prays to his heavenly Father while still in the presence of the crowd of people.

  * **Jesus answered and said** - This can mean 1) the disciples Jesus had sent out in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:10:05|10:5]] had returned (see [[:en:bible:notes:mat:12:01|12:1]]) and Jesus was responding to something someone had said, or 2) Jesus was concluding his condemnation of the unrepentant cities: "Furthermore, Jesus said."
  * **O Father **- This refers to God the Father, not an earthly father. Jesus is directly speaking to his Father, God the Father, so translate using the words "Father" and "Son" in your language. These are the words used here in the original Greek text. Jesus' very close relationship as God the Son to his Father, God the Father, is very important to the accurate meaning of the text.
  * **Lord of heaven and earth**  - This can be translated as a metonym, "Master over everyone and everything in heaven and earth," or as a merism, "Master of the universe." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **you concealed these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to those who are untaught, like little children** - It is not clear what is meant by "these things." If your language needs to specify what is meant, an alternative translation might be best: "You have revealed to ignorant people truths that you have not allowed wise and educated people to learn."
  * **you concealed these things from **- "you hid these things from" or "you have not made these things known to." This verb is the opposite of "revealed."
  * **the wise and understanding**  - "people who are wise and understanding." Alternative translation: "people who think they are wise and understanding." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **revealed them**  - "made them known." The pronoun "them" refers to "these things" earlier in this verse.
  * **to those who are untaught, like little children**  - This whole phrase translates one word that combines the meanings of "young children" and "untaught" or "ignorant." Alternative translation: "ignorant little children"
  * **like little children **- a simile for people who are not wise or well-educated, or people who know that they are not wise and well-educated (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **for so it was well-pleasing in your sight**  - "for you saw that it was good to do that"
  * **All things have been entrusted to me from my Father**  - This can be translated with an active verb: "My Father has entrusted all things to me" or "My Father has handed everything over to me."(See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) God the Father's close, eternal relationship to God the Son, Jesus, is illustrated in their Father-Son relationship, and the use of the words "Father" and "Son" are necessary to describe their relationship.
  * **no one knows the Son except the Father**  - "Only the Father knows the Son." The Father and the Son are really the only persons who truly know one another (along with the Spirit of God). This Father-Son terminology is very important to translate the reality of their relationship.
  * **knows the Son** - knows the Son from personal experience
  * **the Son** - Jesus was referring to himself in the third person. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **no one knows the Father except the Son**  - "Only the Son knows the Father."
  * **knows the Father**  - knows from personal experience
  * **and anyone to whom the Son desires to reveal him**  - Alternative translation: "people know who the Father is only if the Son wants to reveal the Father to them"
