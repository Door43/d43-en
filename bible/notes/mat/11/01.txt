\v 1 It came about that when Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he departed from there to teach and preach in their cities.
\v 2 Now when John heard in the prison about the deeds of the Christ, he sent a message by his disciples
\v 3 and said to him, "Are you the Coming One, or is there another person we should be looking for?"

===== Translation Notes: =====

This section begins the story of how Jesus responded to disciples of John the Baptist.

  * **It came about that** - This phrase is used to show that this is the beginning of an account. If your language has a way of showing the start of an account, you may use that. It could be translated "Then" or "After that"
  * **instructing** - This word can also be translated as "teaching" or "commanding."
  * **his twelve disciples ** - This refers to the twelve chosen apostles of Jesus.
  * **Now** - "At that time." This can also be omitted (see UDB).
  * **when John heard in the prison about** - Alternative translations: "When John, who was in prison, heard about" or “When someone told John, who was in prison, about”
  * **he sent a message by his disciples** - John the Baptist sent his own disciples with a message to Jesus.
  * **and said to him ** - The pronoun "him" refers to Jesus.
  * **Are you the Coming One** - Whether translated "Coming One" or "the one whom we are expecting to come," this is a euphemism for the Messiah ("Christ," UDB).
  * **we should be looking for** - “we should be expecting.” The pronoun "we" refers to all Jews, not only John's disciples.
