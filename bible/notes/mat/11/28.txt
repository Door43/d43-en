  * **who labor and are heavy burdened** - This is a doublet meaning "who work hard and carry a heavy load." It is a metaphor for the burden as described in the UDB. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:doublet|Doublet]]), (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **I will give you rest** - The implied information is "from your labors and burdens." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit]])
