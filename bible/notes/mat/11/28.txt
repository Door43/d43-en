===== Translation Notes: =====

  * Jesus is talking to people in the crowd who are described by Him in these verses. These verses continue Jesus' quotation.
  * **labor **- refers to working hard, not labor pains of childbirth
  * **who labor and are heavy burdened**  - This is a doublet meaning "who work hard and carry a heavy load."  It is a metaphor for the burden as described in the UDB. (See: Doublet, Metaphor)
  * **I will give you rest**  - The pronoun "I", as well as the pronouns "my" and "me" in verses 29 and 30, refers to Jesus.
  * **Take my yoke on you -**  The plural pronoun "you" throughout this verse refers back to "all you who labor and are heavy burdened" in verse 28.
  * **meek and lowly in heart **- explanation
  * **my burden is light**  - The word "light" here means light as the opposite of heavy, not the opposite of dark.
