\v 9 So really, what kind of person did you expect to see? A prophet? Oh, yes! But let me tell you this: John is not just any ordinary prophet.
\v 10 He is the one to whom God was referring when someone wrote in the scriptures and said,
\q 'Notice this! I am sending my messenger to go ahead of you to prepare the people for your coming.'

\v 9 But what did you go out to see—a prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.
\v 10 This is he of whom it was written,
\q 'See, I am sending my messenger before your face,
\q who will prepare your way before you.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to talk to the crowds about John the Baptist.
  * **General Information:** - In verse 10, Jesus quotes the prophet Malachi to show that the life and ministry of John the Baptist fulfilled prophecy.

  * **But what did you go out to see—a prophet?** - Jesus uses a question to make the people think about what kind of man John the Baptist is. AT: "But surely you went out to the desert to see a prophet!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **and much more than a prophet** - This can be translated as a complete sentence. AT: "he is not an ordinary prophet" or "he is more important than a normal prophet." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **This is he of whom it was written** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "This is what the prophet Malachi wrote long ago about John the Baptist." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **I am sending my messenger** - The pronouns "I" and "my" refer to God. Malachi is quoting what God said. 
  * **before your face** - Here "your" is singular, because God was speaking to the Messiah in the quotation. Also, "face" refers to the whole person. AT: "in front of you" or "to go ahead of you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **prepare your way before you** - This is a metaphor that means the messenger will prepare the people to receive the Messiah's message. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
