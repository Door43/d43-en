===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 23 I also have something to say to you people who live in the city of Capernaum. Do you think that others will praise you so much that you will go right up to heaven? That will not happen! On the contrary, you will go down to where God punishes people after they die! If I had done these same miracles in Sodom of long ago, those wicked people would certainly have stopped sinning, and their city would have been here even today. But you have not stopped sinning. \v 24 Let me tell you this: God will punish the wicked people who lived in Sodom, but he will punish you even more severely on the final day when he judges all people."

<usfm> \v 23 And you, Capernaum, do you wish to be exalted to heaven? You will go down to hades; for if in Sodom there had been done the great deeds that were done in you, it would still have remained until today. \v 24 But I say to you that it shall be easier for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you." </usfm>
