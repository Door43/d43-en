\v 23 I \add also have something to say to\add* you \add people who live in\add* Capernaum \add city\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. Do not \add think that\add* you will be honored \f + \ft Or:that\add God\add* will honor you \f* in heaven!\f + \ft Or: Do you think that you will be honored \f + \ft Or:that\add God\add* will honor you \f* in heaven? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add That will not happen! On the contrary\add*, \add after you die, you will be sent\add* \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* will send you \f* down into the place where \add sinful people\add* will be punished \f + \ft Or:he will punish sinful people \f* \add forever\add*! \add God destroyed the ancient city of\add* Sodom \add because the people who lived in that city were extremely wicked\add*. If I had performed in \add Sodom the miracles that I performed in your city, the people there would have turned away from their wicked behavior and\add* their \add city\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* would still exist now \f + \ft metonymy \f*. But you, \add although I did miracles in your city, did not turn from your wicked behavior\add*.
\v 24 So note this: \add God\add* will punish \add the people who lived in\add* Sodom \add city\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*, but he will punish you \add even\add* more severely on the final day when \add he\add* judges \add all people\add*."

\v 23 I also have something to say to you people who live in the city of Capernaum. Do you think that others will praise you so much that you will go right up to heaven? That will not happen! On the contrary, you will go down to where God punishes people after they die! 
If I had done these same miracles in Sodom of long ago, those wicked people would certainly have stopped sinning, and their city would have been here even today. But you have not stopped sinning.
\v 24 Let me tell you this: God will punish the wicked people who lived in Sodom, but he will punish you even more severely on the final day when he judges all people."

\v 23 You, Capernaum, do you think you will be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades. For if in Sodom there had been done the mighty deeds that were done in you, it would still have remained until today.
\v 24 But I say to you that it shall be easier for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to rebuke the people of the cities where he previously did miracles.

  * **You, Capernaum** - Jesus now speaks to the people in the city of Capernaum as if they were listening to him, but they were not. The pronoun "you" is singular and refers to Capernaum throughout these two verses. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
  * **You** - All occurrences of "you" are singular. If it is more natural to refer to the people of the city, you could translate with a plural "you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **Capernaum ... Sodom** - The names of these cities refer to the people living in Capernaum and in Sodom. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **do you think you will be exalted to heaven?** - "do you think you will be raised up to heaven?" Jesus uses a rhetorical question to rebuke the people of Capernaum for their pride. It can be stated in active form: AT: "you cannot raise yourself up to heaven" or "the praise of other people will not raise you up to heaven" or "God will not bring you up to heaven like you think he will" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **you will be brought down to hades** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will send you down to hades" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **For if in Sodom ... it would still have remained until today** - Jesus is describing a hypothetical situation that could have happened in the past, but it did not. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **if in Sodom there had been done the mighty deeds that were done in** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "if I had done the mighty deeds among the people of Sodom that I have done among you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **mighty deeds** - "mighty works" or "works of power" or "miracles"
  * **it would still have remained** - The pronoun "it" refers to the city of Sodom.
  * **I say to you** - This phrase adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.
  * **it shall be easier for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you** - Here "land of Sodom" refer to the people who lived there. AT: "God will show more mercy to the people of Sodom in the day of judgment than to you" or "God will punish you more severely in the day of judgment than the people of Sodom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **than for you** - The implicit information can be made explicit. AT: "than for you, because you did not repent and believe in me, even though you saw me do miracles" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
