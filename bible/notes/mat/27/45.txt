===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Here Matthew starts to tell a new part of the story.
  * **from the sixth hour...until the ninth hour** - "from about noon...for three hours" or "from about twelve o'clock midday...until about three o'clock in the afternoon"
  * **darkness came over the whole land** - The word "darkness" is an abstract noun. AT: "it became dark over the whole land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Jesus cried** - "Jesus called out" or "Jesus shouted"
  * **Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani** - These words are what Jesus cried out in his own language. Translators usually leave these words as is. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_transliterate]])
