\v 6 Later the high priests found the coins. They picked them up and said, "This is money that we paid for a man to die, and our law does not allow us to put money like this into the Temple treasury."
\v 7 So they decided to use that money to buy a field that was called the Potter's Field. They made that field a place where they buried strangers who died in Jerusalem.
\v 8 That is why that place is still called "The field of blood."
