\v 6 Later the high priests found the coins. They picked them up and said, "This is money that we paid for a man to die, and our law does not allow us to put money like this into the temple treasury."
\v 7 So they decided to use that money to buy a field that was called the Potter's Field. They made that field a place where they buried strangers who died in Jerusalem.
\v 8 That is why that place is still called "The field of blood."

\v 7 They discussed the matter together and with the money bought the Potter's Field to bury strangers in.
\v 8 For this reason that field has been called, "The field of blood" to this day.
