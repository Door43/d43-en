\v 62 The next day, which was the day after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together with Pilate.
\v 63 They said, "Sir, we remember that when that deceiver was alive, he said, 'After three days will I rise again.'
\v 64 Therefore command that the tomb be made secure until the third day, otherwise his disciples may come and steal him and say to the people, 'He has risen from the dead ones,' and the last deception will be worse than the first."
