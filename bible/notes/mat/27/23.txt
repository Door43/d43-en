\v 23 And he said, Why, what evil has he done? But they cried out exceedingly, saying, Let him be crucified.
\v 24 So when Pilate saw that he prevailed nothing, but rather that a tumult was arising, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man; see you to it.
