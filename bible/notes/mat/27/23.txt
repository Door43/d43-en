\v 23 And he said, "Why, what crime has he done?" But they cried out even louder, "Crucify him."
\v 24 So when Pilate saw that he could not do anything, but instead a riot was starting, he took water, washed his hands in front of the crowd, and said, "I am innocent of the blood of this innocent man; see to it yourselves."
