\v 17 So when the crowd gathered, Pilate asked them, "Which prisoner would you like me to release for you: Barabbas, or Jesus, whom they call the Christ?"
\v 18 He asked that question because he realized that the chief priests had brought Jesus to him only because they were jealous of Jesus. And Pilate thought that the crowd would prefer that he release Jesus.

\v 17 So when they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, "Who do  you want me to release for you? Barabbas, or
Jesus who is called Christ?"
\v 18 Because he knew that they had handed him over because of envy.
\v 19 While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him and said, "Have nothing to do with that
innocent man; for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him."
