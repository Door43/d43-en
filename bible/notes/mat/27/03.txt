===== Translation Notes: =====

The author has stopped telling the story of the arrest of Jesus so he can tell the story of how Judas killed himself (27:3-[[:en:bible:notes:mat:27:09|10]]). 

  * **Then when Judas**  - If your language has a way of showing that the story is breaking off and a new story is starting, you may want to use that here.
  * **the thirty pieces of silver** - the money that the chief priests had given Judas to betray Jesus ([[:en:bible:notes:mat:26:14|26:15]])
  * **innocent blood**  - "a person who does not deserve to die" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
