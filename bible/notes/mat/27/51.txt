\v 51 At that moment the \add heavy thick\add* curtain \add that closed off the most holy place\add* in the Temple split into two pieces from top to bottom. \add That signified that ordinary people could now go into the presence of God\add*.

===== Translation Notes: =====

This begins the account of the events that happened when Jesus died.

  * **Behold**  - The writer is telling the reader to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.
  * **The tombs were opened, and the bodies of many saints who had fallen asleep were raised** - "God opened the tombs and raised the bodies of many saints that had died" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **fallen asleep**  - "died" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism|Euphemism]])
  * **The tombs were opened … appeared to many**  - The order of events is unclear. Possible orders: After the earthquake when Jesus died and the tombs were opened 1) the saints were raised, Jesus was resurrected, and the saints entered the city and were seen by many people, or 2) Jesus was resurrected, and the saints were raised, entered the city, and were seen by many people.
