===== Translation Notes: =====

This begins the account of the miraculous events that happened when Jesus died.

  * **Behold** - The word “behold” here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows. (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:standard-notes:behold]])
  * **The tombs were opened, and the bodies of many saints that had fallen asleep were raised**  "God opened the tombs and raised the bodies of many saints that had died" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **fallen asleep**  - As used here, "fallen asleep" is a euphemism for "died." (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:euphemism]])
  * **The tombs were opened...appeared to many**  - The resurrection of many saints is an event possibly mentioned out of sequence here–probably because the earthquake and rending of rocks at Jesus' death also opened their tombs. Commentators speculate that these awakened saints either remained in the open tombs until after Jesus raised himself in three days or they came out when Jesus died but didn't (according to v. 53) enter the city until his resurrection. We never hear what became of them after that. Verse 54 actually happens immediately after verse 51, if the order of events in the passion story is crucial for rendering in a target culture.
