\v 41 In the same way the chief priests were mocking him, along with the scribes and elders, and said,
\v 42 "He saved others, but he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down off the cross, and then we will

===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of the crucifixion and death of Jesus.

  * **He saved others, but he cannot save himself** - Possible meanings: 1) The Jewish leaders do not believe that Jesus saved others (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]] and UDB) or that he can save himself, or 2) they believe he did save others but are laughing at him because now he cannot save himself.
  * **He is the King of Israel** - The leaders do not believe Jesus is the King of Israel. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
