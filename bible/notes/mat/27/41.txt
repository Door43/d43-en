  * **He saved others, but he cannot save himself** - Possible meanings are 1) the Jewish leaders do not believe that Jesus saved others or that he can save himself, or 2) they believe he did save others but are laughing at him because now he cannot save himself.   (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **He is the King of Israel** - The leaders do not believe Jesus is the King of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
