\v 30 God makes the wild plants very beautiful, but they grow in the field for only a short time. One day they grow, and the next day people will throw them into an oven to bake bread. But you are more important to God than wild plants are, and you live much longer. So trust in God, you who have so little faith!
\v 31 So do not worry and say, 'Will we have anything to eat?' or 'Will we have anything to drink?' or 'Will we have clothes to wear?'

\v 30 If God so clothes the grass in the fields, which exists today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, you of little faith?
\v 31 Therefore do not be anxious and say, 'What will we eat?' or, 'What will we drink?' or, 'What will we clothe ourselves in?'

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01|5:1]].

  * Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. The instances of “you” and “your” are plural.
  * **grass** - If your language has a word that includes "grass" and the word you used for "lilies" in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:06:27|6:28]], you can use it here. 
  * **thrown into the oven**  - The Jews of Jesus' day used grass in their fires to cook their food (see UDB). Alternative translation: "thrown into the fire" or "burned up."
  * **O you of little faith**  - Jesus is scolding the people because they have little faith in God.Alternative translation: "You who have such little faith" or as a new sentence, "Why do you have such little faith?"
