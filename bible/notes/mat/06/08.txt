Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01|5:1]].

  * Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. He speaks to them as a group in the plural as far as "pray like this." All occurrences of "your" after "Heavenly Father" are singular.
  * **sanctify your name**  - "we want everyone to know you are holy"
  * **Let your kingdom come **- "We want to see you rule over everyone and everything completely"
