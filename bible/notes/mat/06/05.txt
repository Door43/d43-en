\v 5 "Also when you pray, do not do what the hypocrites do. They like to stand in the Jewish meeting places and on the corners of the main streets to pray, in order that other people will see them \add and think highly of them\add*. Keep this in mind: \add People praise them, but\add* that is the\add only\add* reward they will get.
\v 6 But as for you, when you pray, go into your private room and close the door in order to pray to \add God\add*, your Father, whom no one can see. He observes you where no one else observes you, and he will reward you.
\v 7 When you pray, do not repeat words many times as the people who do not know God do \add when they pray. They repeat meaningless words\add* because they think that if they use many words, their gods will listen to them and give them \add what they ask for\add*.

\v 5 And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners, so that they may be seen by people. Truly I say to you, they have received their reward.
\v 6 But you, when you pray, enter your inner chamber, shut the door, and pray to your Father who is in
private; then your Father who sees in private will recompense you.
\v 7 And when you pray, do not make useless repetitions, as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard because of their much
speaking.
