======  Matthew 06 General Notes ======


=== Formatting in this chapter ===

The translator may wish to set the prayer in verses 9-11 apart by using indentation. Since this chapter shifts quickly from one topic to another, it is possible to use a line of space between topic to distinguish between the more easily.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Sermon on the Mount ==

Matthew chapters 5-7 together form one sermon or teaching by Jesus. The chapter divisions can cause confusion here.

== Lord's Prayer ==

This is not a prayer that is to recited over and over again, although this pray can be used exactly as it is present here. Instead, it provides a model for how Christians are to pray.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphors ==

There are many [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|metaphors]] in this chapter. This is possibly because these teachings were intended to be applicable to many different situations. It was also common at that time to use analogies and metaphors in one's teaching.
