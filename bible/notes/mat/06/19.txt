\v 19 Do not selfishly accumulate large quantities of money and material goods for yourselves on this earth, because the earth is where everything perishes. For example, on earth termites ruin things, things rust, and thieves steal things.
\v 20 Instead, do deeds that will please God. If you do good deeds, it will be like storing treasures in heaven. Nothing perishes in heaven. In heaven no termites ruin things, nothing rusts, and thieves do not steal things.
\v 21 Remember that whatever is most important to you, that is what you will be thinking about.

\v 19 Do not store up for yourselves treasures on the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break in and
steal.
\v 20 Instead, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
\v 21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
