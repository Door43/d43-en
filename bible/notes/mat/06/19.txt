\v 19 Do not selfishly accumulate large quantities of money and material goods for yourselves on this earth, because the earth is where everything perishes where moths ruin clothing, rust destroys metals, and thieves steal what belongs to other people.
\v 20 Instead, do deeds that will please God so that you store up treasures in heaven. Nothing perishes in heaven. In heaven no moths can ruin clothing, there is no rust, and there are no thieves who could steal.
\v 21 Remember that whatever is most important to you, that is what you will be thinking about.

\v 19 Do not store up for yourselves treasures on the earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
\v 20 Instead, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
\v 21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
