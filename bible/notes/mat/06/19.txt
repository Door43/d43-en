\v 19 Do not selfishly accumulate large quantities of money and material goods for yourselves on this earth, because the earth is where everything perishes. For example, on earth termites ruin things, things rust, and thieves steal things.
\v 20 Instead, do deeds that will please God. If you do good deeds, it will be like storing treasures in heaven. Nothing perishes in heaven. In heaven no termites ruin things, nothing rusts, and thieves do not steal things.
\v 21 Remember that whatever is most important to you, that is what you will be thinking about.
