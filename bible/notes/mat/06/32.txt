\v 32 Those who do not know God are always worrying about things like that. But God, your Father who is in heaven, knows that you need all those things, \add so you should not worry about them\add*.
\v 33 Instead, the most important thing you should be concerned about is to let \add God\add* completely direct your life, and to strive \add to live\add* righteously. \add If you do that\add*, all the things that you \add need\add* will be given to you \f + \ft Or:God will give you all the things \add that you need\add* \f*.
\v 34 So \add each day\add* do not be worried about what will happen to you the next day, because \add when\add* that day \f + \ft personification \f* comes, \add you\add* will be concerned about \add what happens during\add* that day. You will have enough to be concerned about each day. \add So do not worry ahead of time\add*."

\v 32 Those who do not know God are always worrying about things like that. But God, your Father who is in heaven, knows that you need all those things, so you should not worry about them.
\v 33 Instead, make it the most important thing in your life to accept God when he rules over you, and to try to live righteously. If you do that, he will give you all the things that you need.
\v 34 So do not be worried about what will happen to you the next day, because when that day comes, you will have enough to be concerned about. So do not worry ahead of time."

<usfm>
\v 32 For all these things the Gentiles seek; for your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.
\v 33 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness; then all these things will be provided for you.
\v 34 Therefore, do not be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient to the day is its own evil.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01|5:1]].

  * Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. The instances of “you” and “your” are plural.
  * **For ... for** - These each introduce a sentence that explains [[:en:bible:notes:mat:06:30|6:31]]. That is, the Gentiles seek these things, so "do not be anxious"; "your heavenly Father knows that you need them," so "do not be anxious."
  * **Therefore**  - Alternative translation: "Because of all of this."
  * **tomorrow will be anxious for itself**  - This personification actually refers to the person who lives "the next day"  (see UDB). (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **Sufficient to the day is its own evil**  - this can be translated as "the day will have enough bad things in it."
