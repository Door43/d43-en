===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01|5:1]].

  * Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. All “you” and “your” are plural.
  * **do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing**  - This is a metaphor for total secrecy. Just as hands usually work together and can be said to "know" what each other is doing at all times, you should not let even those closest to you know when you are giving to the poor. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **your alms may be given in private**  - "you will give to the poor without other people knowing"
