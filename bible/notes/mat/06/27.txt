\v 27 None of you can, just by worrying, add years to your life. You cannot add even one minute to your life! So you should not worry about things you need.
\p
\v 28 You should also not worry about whether you will have enough clothes to wear. Think about the way flowers grow in the fields. They do not work to earn money, and they do not make their own clothes.
\v 29 But I tell you that even though King Solomon, who lived long ago, wore very beautiful clothes, his clothes were not as beautiful as one of those flowers.

\v 27 And which one of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his lifespan?
\v 28 And why are you anxious about clothing? Think about the lilies in the fields, how they grow; they do not work, and they do not spin cloth.
\v 29 Yet I say to you, even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01|5:1]].

  * Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. All instances of “you” and “your” are plural.
  * **And which one of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his lifespan?**  - This rhetorical question means that no one can live longer by worrying. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **one cubit** - A "cubit" was a little less than half a meter. In this instance, it is used as a metaphor for adding time to a lifespan. (See: [[en:obe:other:biblicaldistance]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **And why are you anxious about clothing?**  - This rhetorical question means "you should not be worried about what you will wear."
  * **Think about**  - "Consider"
  * **lilies**  - a kind of wild flower
