<usfm>
\v 1 "When you do your good deeds, make certain that you do not do them when other people are watching so that they may see you \add and think highly of you\add*. If \add you do good deeds merely in order that other people may think highly of you, God\add*, your Father who is in heaven, will not give you any reward.
\v 2 So, whenever you give something to the poor, do not \add announce it as people announce something that they want other people to know about\add* by playing a \add fanfare\add* on a trumpet \f + \ft metaphor \f*. That is what the hypocrites do in the synagogues\f + \ft Or: in the Jewish meeting places \f* and on the main roads in order that people might \add see what they do and\add* praise them. Keep this in mind: \add People praise those hypocrites\add*, \add but\add* that is the \add only\add* reward they will receive!

\v 1 "Make certain when you do good deeds do not do them to let other people watch so they will think highly of you. God, your Father who is in heaven, will not give you any reward.
\v 2 So whenever you give something to the poor, do not make other people notice it as if playing a trumpet. That is what the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the main roads in order that people might praise them. That is the only reward the hypocrites will receive!

\p
\v 1 Take heed that you do not do your acts of righteousness before people to be seen by them, or else you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.
\v 2 So when you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before yourself as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may have the praise of people. Truly I say to you, they have received their reward.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to teach his disciples in his Sermon on the Mount, which began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01|5:3]]. In this section, Jesus addresses the "acts of righteousness" of alms, prayer, and fasting.
  * **General Information:** - Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. All "you" and "your" are plural.

  * **before people to be seen by them** - It is implied that those who see the person will honor him. This can be stated in active form. AT: "in front of people just so that they can see you and give you honor for what you have done." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Father** - This is an important title for God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **do not sound a trumpet before yourself** - This metaphor means to do something that purposefully gets people's attention. AT: "do not draw attention to yourself like someone who plays a loud trumpet in a crowd." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Truly I say to you** - "I tell you the truth." This phrase adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.
