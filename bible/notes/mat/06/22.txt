\v 22 "Your eyes are \add like\add* a lamp \f + \ft metaphor \f* for your body, because they enable you to see things. So if your eyes are healthy, you are able to see everything well \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add Similarly, if you are generous with your money and other possessions, you will be able to know much of what God wants you to know\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 23 But if your eyes are bad, you are not able to see things well. And if that continues, the time will come when you will not be able to see at all. You will be in complete darkness \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add Similarly, if you continue to be greedy, you will be in spiritual darkness. If all that your eyes can see and your mind can think about involves your greedily desiring material possessions, all that you do will be evil\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*."

\v 24 "No one is able to serve two \add different\add* bosses \add at the same time\add*. If \add he tried to do that\add*, he would hate one of them and love the other one, or he would be loyal to one of them and despise the other one \f + \ft doublet \f*. \add Similarly\add*, you cannot \add devote your life to\add* worshipping God and \add worshipping\add* money and material goods \add at the same time\add*."

\v 22 "Your eyes are like a lamp for your body, because they enable you to see things. So if you see things as God sees them, it will be as if your whole body were full of light.
\v 23 But if your eyes are bad, you are not able to see things well. You will be in complete darkness. How greedy you will be! 



\p
\v 24 "No one is able to serve two different masters at the same time. If he tried to do that, he would hate one of them and love the other one, or he would be loyal to one of them and despise the other one. Similarly, you cannot worship God and  money at the same time."

<usfm>
\v 22 The eye is the lamp of the body. Therefore, if your eye is good, the whole body is filled with light.
\v 23 But if your eye is bad, your whole body is full of darkness. Therefore, if the light that is in you is actually darkness, how great is that darkness!
\v 24 No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to teach his disciples.

Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. The instances of "you" and "your" are all singular, but you may need to translate them as plurals.

  * **The eye is the lamp of the body**  - "like a lamp, the eye allows you to see things clearly" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **if your eye is good, the whole body is filled with light**  - If your eyes are healthy, if you can see, then your whole body is able to function properly. That is, you can walk, work, etc. This is a metaphor for seeing things as God sees them, specifically in the area of generosity and greed. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **eye**  - You may have to translate this as plural.
  * **filled with light**  - This is a metaphor for having understanding. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **if your eye is bad**  - This does not refer to magic. AT: "you do not see things as God sees them." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the light that is in you is actually darkness**  - This is a metaphor for thinking one sees things as God sees them when one does not. AT: "what you think is light is actually darkness." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **how great is that darkness**  - To be in darkness is bad. To be in darkness and think one is in light is even worse. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other**  - These two phrases refer to the same issue—being unable to love and be devoted to both God and money at the same time. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **You cannot serve God and wealth**  - "You cannot worship God and money at the same time"
