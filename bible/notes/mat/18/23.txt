\v 23 In order to illustrate why you should do this, I will tell you a parable. In it God is like a king and his officials. That king told some of his servants that he wanted his officials to pay what they owed him.
\v 24 So those officials came to the king to settle their accounts with him. One of the officials who were brought owed the king several million dollars.
\v 25 But because he did not have enough money to pay what he owed, the king demanded that he, his wife, his children and all he possessed be sold to someone else and that the king be repaid with the money that was paid for them.

\v 23 Therefore the kingdom of heaven is similar to a certain king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
\v 24 As he began the settling, one servant was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.
\v 25 But since he had not the means to repay, his master commanded him to be sold, together with his wife and children and everything that he had, and payment to be made.
