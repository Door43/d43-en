It is good\add that you not sin and\add* go where you will live \add with God eternally, even though while you are still here on earth\add* you have only one eye.

\v 9 Yes, and if what you see you makes you want to sin, stop looking at those things! Even if you have to gouge out one of your eyes and throw it away to avoid sinning, do it!  Suppose you had only one eye and still lived forever with God; that would be much better than if you had both eyes and God threw you into the eternal fire in hell."

\v 9 And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you. It is better for you to enter into life with
one eye, rather than to be thrown into the eternal fire possessing both eyes.
