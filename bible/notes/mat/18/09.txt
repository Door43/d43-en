<usfm>
\v 9 If what you see you \add makes you want\add* to sin, \add stop looking at those things! Even if you have to\add* gouge out one of your eyes and throw it away \add to avoid sinning, do it\add* \f + \ft hyperbole \f*! It is good\add that you not sin and\add* go where you will live \add with God eternally, even though while you are still here on earth\add* you have only one eye. But it is not good that you continue to have your two eyes \add and do the sinful things you want to, and as a result\add*, you are thrown \f + \ft Or:God throws you \f* into hell where there is eternal fire burning."

<usfm>
\v 9 Yes, and if what you see makes you want to sin, stop looking at those things! Even if you have to gouge out one of your eyes and throw it away to keep from sinning! Suppose you had only one eye and still lived forever with God, how much better is that than if you had both eyes and God threw you into the eternal fire in hell."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye than to be thrown into the eternal fire having both eyes.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you** - The command to destroy the eye, perhaps the most important part of the body, is probably an exaggeration for his hearers doing anything necessary to remove from their lives anything they consider important causes them to sin. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **causes you to stumble** - Here "stumble" is a metaphor for sin. AT: "causes you to sin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **your ... you** - All occurrences of these words are singular. Jesus is speaking to all people in general. It may be more natural for your language to translate with a plural "you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **into life** - "into eternal life"
  * **than to be thrown into the eternal fire having both eyes** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "than to have both eyes when God throws you into the eternal fire" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
