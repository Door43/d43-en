===== translationNotes: =====

  * **seven times** - "7 times" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **seventy times seven** - Possible meanings are 1) "70 times 7" or 2) "77 times." If using a number would be confusing, you can translate it as "more times than you can count" or "you must always forgive him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
