\v 15 "If a fellow believer sins against you, go to him when you can be alone with him, and reprove him for sinning against you. If that person listens to you and feels sorry that he has sinned against you, you and he will be good brothers once more.
\v 16 If, however, that person does not listen to you, go get one or two other fellow believers. Have them go with you so that, as the Law says, 'there must be two or three witnesses to confirm every accusation.'

\v 15 If your brother sins against you, go, show him his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you will have gained your brother.
\v 16 But if he does not listen to you, take with you one or two more brothers, so that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word might be verified.
