\v 15 "If a fellow believer sins against you, go to him when you can be alone with him, and reprove him for sinning against you. If that person listens to you and feels sorry that he has sinned against you, you and he will be good brothers once more.
\v 16 If, however, that person does not listen to you and is not sorry that he has sinned against you, go get one or two other fellow believers who will listen to what you both have to say. Have them go with you so that what is written in the Scriptures might happen: ‘When one person accuses another in some matter, it should be confirmed by at least two or three people before that person can be declared guilty.'

\v 15 If your brother sins against you, go, show him his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you will have gained your brother.
\v 16 But if he does not listen to you, take with you one or two more brothers, so that at the mouth of two witnesses or three every word might be verified.
