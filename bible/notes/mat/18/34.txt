  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus concludes his parable about forgiveness and reconciliation.

  * **His master** - "The king"
  * **handed him over** - "gave him over." Most likely the king himself did not take the first servant to the torturers. AT: "he ordered his servants to give him over" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

  * **that was owed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "that the first servant owed the king" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **my heavenly Father** - This is an important title for God that describes the relationship between God and Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **to you...your** - All occurrences of these words are plural. Jesus is speaking to his disciples, but this parable teaches a general truth that applies to all believers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **his brother** - "your brother"
  * **from your heart** - This is an idiom. AT: "sincerely" or "completely" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
