\v 12 What do you\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add* think \add you would do in the following situation\add*? If you had one hundred sheep and one of them got lost, you would surely leave the ninety-nine sheep \add that are\add* on the hill and go and search for the lost one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*, would you not?
\v 13 If you found it, I affirm to you\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add* that you would rejoice very much. You would be happy that ninety-nine sheep did not stray away, but you would rejoice even more \add because you had found\add* the sheep that had strayed away.
\v 14 In the same way \add that the shepherd does not want one of\add* his \add sheep to stray away\add*, so \add God\add*, your Father in heaven, does not want \add even\add* one of these children to go to hell."

\v 12 What do you think you would do in the following situation? If you had one hundred sheep and one of them got lost, you would surely leave the ninety-nine sheep that were on the hillside and go and search for the lost one, would you not?
\v 13 If you found it, I affirm to you that you would rejoice very much. You would be happy that ninety-nine sheep did not stray away, but you would rejoice even more because you had found the sheep that had strayed away.
\v 14 In the same way that the shepherd does not want one of his sheep to stray away, so God, your Father in heaven, does not want even one of these children to go to hell."

\v 12 What do you think? If any person has one hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the hillside and go off seeking the one that went astray?
\v 13 And if he finds it, truly I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray. 
\v 14 In the same way, it is not the will of your Father in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.
