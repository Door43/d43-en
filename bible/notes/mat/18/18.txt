\v 18 Truly I say to you, whatever things you bind on earth will be bound in heaven; and whatever things you
shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
\v 19 Moreover I say to you, that if two of you agree on earth about anything that they ask for, it will be done
for them by my Father who is in heaven.
\v 20 For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in their midst.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I say to you**  - Jesus is speaking to his disciples.
  * **whatever things you bind… whatever things you loose…. **- Matthew uses repetition to emphasize his point. (See: Doublet)
  * **will be bound in heaven**  - "God will bind those things in heaven" (See: Active/Passive)
  * **bind/bound**  - this is probably a metaphorical term meaning to withhold forgiveness or acceptance in the kingdom. See also 16:19.
  * **shall be loosed in heaven **- "God will loose in heaven" (See: Active/Passive)
  * **loose/loosed**  - describes release or forgiveness or accepting one in the kingdom. (See: Metaphor)
