\v 17 If the one who has sinned against you does not listen to them, tell the matter to the entire congregation so that they can correct him. And if the person does not listen to the congregation, exclude him from among you, just as you would exclude pagans and tax collectors as hopeless sinners.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **if he refuses to listen to them** - "if your fellow believer refuses to listen to the witnesses who came with you"
  * **to the church** - "to the whole community of believers"
  * **let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector** - "treat him as you would treat a Gentile or tax collector." This implies that they should remove him from the community of believers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
