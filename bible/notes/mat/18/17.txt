\v 17 If the one who has sinned against you does not listen to them and does not feel sorry, tell the matter to the entire congregation so that they can correct him. And if the person does not listen to the congregation and is not sorry that he has sinned against you, exclude him from being a member of your congregation, just like you would exclude pagans, tax collectors, and others who do not believe in God and sin greatly.
