====== Matthew 18:4-6 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 The people who become as humble as this child \add or any child\add* is, will be the most important people among those over whom God rules.
\v 5 Also, when those who, \add because they love\add* me, welcome \add a\add* child like this one, \add God considers\add* that they are welcoming me."


\p
\v 6 "If you cause someone who believes in me to sin, \add even if it is someone who is socially unimportant like\add* this little child, \add God will severely punish you\add*. If a heavy stone were fastened around your neck and you were thrown into the deep waters of the sea, \add people would consider that you had been severely punished. But God will punish\add* you more severely \add than that if you cause someone to sin\add*!

\v 4 The people who become as humble as this child will be the most important people among those over whom God will rule from heaven.
\v 5 Also, whenever people welcome a child like this one because they love me, God considers that they are welcoming me."
\p
\v 6 "If a person causes someone who believes in me to sin, even if it is someone who people think is as unimportant as this little child, God will severely punish that person. He will punish that person worse than if someone had thrown him into the sea's deep waters with a heavy stone tied to his neck!

\v 4 Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
\v 5 And whoever receives one such little child in my name receives me.
\v 6 But whoever causes one of these little ones who believes in me to sin, it would be better for him that a great millstone should be hung about his neck, and that he should be sunk into the depths of the sea.
