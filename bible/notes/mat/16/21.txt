\v 21 From that time Jesus began to teach the disciples that it was necessary for him to go to the city of Jerusalem. There the ruling elders, the chief priests, and the men who taught the Jewish laws would cause him to suffer and die. Then on the third day after that, he would come alive again.
\v 22 But Peter took Jesus aside and began to scold him for saying these things. He said, "Lord, may God never permit that to happen to you! That must certainly not happen!"
\v 23 Then Jesus turned to look at Peter, and he said to him, "Get out of my sight, because Satan is speaking through you. You are trying to get me to sin. You are not thinking what God thinks, but only what people think!"

\v 21 From that time Jesus started to tell his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, suffer many things at the hand of  the elders and chief priests and scribes, that he must be killed, and on the third day be raised up.
\v 22  Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, "May this be far from you, Lord; may this never happen to you."
\v 23 But Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, for you do not care for the things of God, but for the things of people."
