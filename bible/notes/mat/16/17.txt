\v 17 Then Jesus said to him, "Simon, son of Jonah, God is pleased with you. What you just said—no human has revealed this to you. Instead, it was my Father who lives in heaven who has revealed this to you.
\v 18 I will also tell you this: You are Peter, which means 'rock.' You will be the support for the group of those who believe in me, like a large rock supports a great building. And even death will not be strong enough to destroy it."

\v 17 Jesus answered and said to him, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar Jonah, for flesh and blood have not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.
\v 18 I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; the gates of Hades will not prevail against it.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus responds to Peter's acknowledgment that Jesus is the Son of God.

  * **Simon Bar Jonah** - "Simon, son of Jonah"
  * **flesh and blood have not revealed this to you** - "no human being has revealed this to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) Jesus powerfully states that Peter's description of him as, "the Christ, the Son of the living God," came to Peter from God himself, not from any human.
  * **the gates of Hades will not prevail against it** - Possible meanings: 1) "the powers of death will not overcome it" (see UDB) or 2) it will break down the power of death the way an army breaks into a city. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) The title of Jesus as the "Son of God" is the very power that breaks the power of Satan. Take care to translate "the Son of the living God" in your language as closely as possible to Peter's words and as Jesus affirmed it.
