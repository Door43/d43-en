\v 9 Do not think I am worried about having food. Have you really forgotten how I fed the five thousand with five loaves, or how many baskets of leftover food you gathered up?
\v 10 Or what about the four thousand people who ate when I multiplied the seven small loaves? And how many baskets of scraps did you gather up then?

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus warns his disciples after his encounter with the religious leaders.

  * **Do you not yet perceive nor remember the five loaves for the five thousand and how many baskets you gathered up? Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up?** - Jesus is scolding them. AT: "You should have understood and remembered the 5 loaves for the 5000 and how many baskets you gathered up! You should also have remembered the 7 loaves for the 4,000 and how many baskets you took up!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
