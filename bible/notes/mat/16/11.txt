  * **How is it that you do not understand that I was not speaking to you about bread?** - Jesus uses this question to rebuke the disciples. AT: "You should have understood that I was not really speaking about bread" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees** - Here "yeast" represents evil ideas and wrong teaching. Translate as "yeast" and do not explain the meaning in your translation. In 16:12 the disciples will understand the meaning. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
