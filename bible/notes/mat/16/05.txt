\v 5 They all sailed to the other side of the Sea of Galilee. Then the disciples realized that they had forgotten to take anything to eat with them.
\v 6 At that point, Jesus said to them, "Be careful not to accept the yeast that the Pharisees and Sadducees want to give you."
\v 7 They tried to make sense out of what Jesus had told them, and they said to each other, "He must have said that because we forgot to bring anything to eat!"
\v 8 But Jesus knew what they were saying and answered them, "I am disappointed that you think it was because you forgot bring bread that I talked about the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees. You believe only a little what I am able to do for you.

\v 5 When the disciples reached the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.
\v 6 Jesus said to them, "Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
\v 7 The disciples reasoned among themselves and said, "It is because we took no bread."
\v 8 Jesus was aware of this and said, "You of little faith, why do you reason among yourselves and say that it is because you have taken no bread?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Here the scene shifts to a later time. Jesus uses an opportunity to warn his disciples about the Pharisees and Sadducees.

  * **the other side** - You can make clear the understood information. AT: "the other side of the lake" or "the other side of the Sea of Galilee" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees** - Here "yeast" is a metaphor that refers to evil ideas and wrong teaching. Translate as "yeast" here and do not explain its meaning in your translation. This meaning will be made clear in 16:12. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **reasoned among themselves** - "discussed with each other"
  * **You of little faith** - "You who have such little faith." Jesus is scolding the people because they have little faith in God. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:06:30|6:30]].
  * **why do you reason ... taken no bread?** - Jesus uses a question to rebuke his disciples for not understanding what he just said. AT: "I am disappointed that you think it was because you forgot to bring bread that I talked about the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
