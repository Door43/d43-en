\v 5 They all sailed to the other side of the Sea of Galilee. Then the disciples realized that they had forgotten to take anything to eat with them.
\v 6 At that point, Jesus said to them, "Be careful not to accept the yeast that the Pharisees and Sadducees want to give you."
\v 7 They tried to make sense out of what Jesus had told them, and they said to each other, "He must have said that because we forgot to bring anything to eat!"
\v 8 But Jesus knew what they were saying and answered them, "I am disappointed that you think it was because you forgot bring bread that I talked about the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees. You believe only a little what I am able to do for you.

\v 5 The disciples came to the other side, but forgot to take bread.
\v 6 Jesus said to them, "Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
\v 7 The disciples reasoned among themselves and said, "It is because we took no bread."
\v 8 Jesus was aware of this and said, "You of little faith, why do you reason among yourselves and say that it is because you have taken no bread?
