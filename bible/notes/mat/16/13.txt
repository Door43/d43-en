===== Translation Notes: =====

Peter acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God.

  * **But who say you that I am?** - "But it is you I am asking: who do you say that I am?"
  * **"You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."** - Peter affirms about Jesus: He is the Christ (the Messiah), and Jesus is the Son of the living God, which is a vivid picture of why the word "Son" must be maintained in the translation. The God who actually lives is the Father of Jesus the Christ.
