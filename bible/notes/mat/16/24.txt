\v 24 Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone of you wants to trust me and go where I am going, you must put away your own desires and purposes, and you must take up your own cross, and go where I lead you.
\v 25 Whoever tries to save his own life, will find that instead of saving his life, he loses it. But whoever loses his life for me, he will find his life.
\v 26 People might get everything they want in this world, but if they do not become my disciples, they gain nothing and they even lose their owns lives. What could anyone give in exchange for their own life?

\v 24 Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.
\v 25 For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.
\v 26 For what does it profit a person if he gains the whole world but forfeits his life? What can a person give in exchange for his life?
