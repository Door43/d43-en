\v 25 \add You must do that\add*, because those who try to save their lives \add by denying that they belong to me when people want to kill them for believing in me\add* will not live \add eternally\add*, but those who are killed \add because of being my disciples\add* will live \add with God eternally\add*.

\v 24 Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone of you wants to trust me and go where I am going, you must put away your own desires and purposes, and you must take up your own cross, and go where I lead you.
\v 25 Whoever tries to save his own  life, will find that instead of saving his life, he loses it. But whoever loses his life for me, he will find his life.
\v 26 People might get everything they want in this world, but if they do not become my disciples, they gain nothing and they even lose their owns lives. What could anyone give to God in exchange for their own  life?

\v 24 Then said Jesus to his disciples, "If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.
\v 25 For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.
\v 26 For what does it profit a person if he gains the whole world but forfeits his life? What can a person give in exchange for his life?

  * **follow me** - "come with me as a disciple"
  * **deny himself** - "not give in to his own desires" or "forsake his own desires."
  * **take up his cross, and follow me** - "lift up his cross, carry it, and walk behind me," being willing to suffer and die the way Christ did (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For whoever wants** - "For anyone who wants"
  * **if he gains the whole world** - "if he gains everything in the world"
  * **but forfeits his life** - "he himself is lost or destroyed"
