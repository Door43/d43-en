\v 24 Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If any one of you wants to be my disciple, you must not do only what you yourself want to do. You must be willing to let people hurt you and disgrace you. That is like what they do to criminals whom they force to carry a cross to the place where the criminals will be executed. That is what anyone who wants to be my disciple must do.
\v 25 You must do that, because those who try to save their lives by denying that they belong to me when people want to kill them for believing in me will not live eternally, but those who are killed because they are my disciples will live with God eternally.
\v 26 People might get everything they want in this world, but if they do not become my disciples, they will really be gaining nothing because they will not get eternal life. There is nothing that God will accept in exchange for a person's life.

\v 24 Then said Jesus to his disciples, "If any one wants to follow me, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and 
follow me.
\v 25 For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.
\v 26 For what does it profit a person if he gains the whole world but forfeits his life? What can a person give in 
exchange for his life?
