\v 24 Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If any one of you wants to be my disciple, you must do things you would not prefer to do. It is like someone who has to carry his cross to the place he will die. This is what it means to be my disciple.
\v 25 Whoever tries to save his life when others attack my followersâ€”he will lose it. But whoever is willing to die for me will live forever.
\v 26 People might get everything they want in this world, but if they do not become my disciples, they will really be gaining nothing because they will not get eternal life. There is nothing that God will accept in exchange for a person's life.

\v 24 Then said Jesus to his disciples, "If any one wants to follow me, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.
\v 25 For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.
\v 26 For what does it profit a person if he gains the whole world but forfeits his life? What can a person give in exchange for his life?

  * **deny himself** - "not give in to his own desires" or "forsake his own desires."
  * **take up his cross, and follow me** - "lift up his cross, carry it, and walk behind me," being willing to suffer and die the way Christ did (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For whoever wants** - "For anyone who wants"
  * **if he gains the whole world** - "if he gains everything in the world"
  * **but forfeits his life** - "he himself is lost or destroyed"
