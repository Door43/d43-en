===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to tell his disciples the cost of following him.

  * **the glory of his Father with his angels** - Jesus, called "the Son of Man" and "the Son of God," will share the glory of God the Father, accompanied by angels. The Father and Son are one, and the words "Father" and "Son" must be maintained in your translation to accurately translate the original meanings of these words.
  * **will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom** - "will see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom before they die"
  * **will not taste death** - "will not experience death" or" will not die"
  * **the Son of Man coming in his kingdom** - Jesus was referring to himself in the third person. AT:"until they see me coming in my kingdom."  (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
