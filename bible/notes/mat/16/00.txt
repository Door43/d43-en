====== Matthew 16 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Bread ==

Bread is a special image in 16:5-12. Jesus used his disciples' discussion about bread to warn them against the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees. He spoke of these teachings as if they were yeast, the ingredient that causes bread to rise before it is baked.

At the same time, the mention of bread in this chapter is meant to remind the readers that Jesus fed the five thousand with bread (see: [[:en:bible:notes:mat:14:13|14:13-21]]) and also the four thousand (see: [[:en:bible:notes:mat:15:29|15:29-39]]). The implication is that Jesus gives good "bread" (teaching), but that the Pharisees and Sadducees do not.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

[[:en:bible:notes:mat:16:21|16:21]] forms a break in the narrative. At this point, Matthew makes a comment about Jesus' actions that will extend into the future. It is important that the translator clearly signal that this comment is about the future, embedded in the narrative.

== The use of paradox ==

This is a statement that seems absurd, that appears to contradict itself. A paradox occurs in this chapter: "Whoever wants to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it" ([[:en:bible:notes:mat:16:24|16:24-28]]).
