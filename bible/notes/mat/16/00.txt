======  Matthew 16 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Bread ==
Bread is a special image in this chapter. Jesus used the forgetting of the bread to instruct the disciples. Bread reminds the readers of Jesus' feeding of the 5000 and the provision of God giving manna in the desert. Leaven, used in making bread, is always used as a negative image. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

Verse 21 forms a break in the narrative. Matthew narrates or gives a comment about this story from the future. It is possible to put this type of information into parentheses, but in most languages context is enough to enable the reader to understand. 

== Paradox ==

This is a statement that  seems absurd or appears to contradict itself. For example, "whoever wants to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it" ([[:en:bible:notes:mat:16:24|16:24-28]])
