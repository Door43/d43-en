===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jesus quotes a verse from Leviticus as the second greatest commandment.

  * **a second commandment is like it** - Possible meanings are 1) "there is another commandment that is next in importance" or 2) "there is a second commandment that is just as important." Either way, Jesus means these two commandments are more important than all other commandments.
  * **second commandment** - (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **like it** - This means like the commandment in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:22:37|22:37]].
  * **your neighbor** - Here "neighbor" means more than just those who live nearby. Jesus means a person must love all people.
  * **On these two commandments depend the whole law and the prophets** - Here "whole law and the prophets" refer to all of scripture. AT: "Everything that Moses and the prophets wrote in the scriptures is based on these two commandments" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
