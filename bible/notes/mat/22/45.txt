===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - This is the end of the account of the religious leaders trying to trap Jesus with several difficult questions.
  * **General Information:** - This is the end of the part of the story that began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:19:01|19:1]], that tells of Jesus ministering in Judea.


  * **If David then calls the Christ 'Lord', how is he David's son?** - Jesus uses a question to make the religious leaders think deeply about what he is saying. AT: "David calls him Lord, so the Christ has to be more than just a descendant of David." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **If David then calls the Christ** - David referred to Jesus as "Lord" because Jesus was not only a descendant of David, but he was also superior to him.
  * **to answer him a word** - Here "word" refers to what people say. AT: "to answer him anything" or "to answer him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **any more questions** - It is implied that no one asked him the kind of questions that were intended to make him say something wrong so the religious leaders could arrest him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
