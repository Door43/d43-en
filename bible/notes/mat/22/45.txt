===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to question the religious leaders about the Messiah.

  * **If David then calls the Christ 'Lord', how is he David's son?** - AT: "David calls him Lord, so the Christ has to be more than just a descendant of David" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])  
  * **If David then calls the Christ** - David referred to Jesus as "Lord" because Jesus was not only a descendant of David, he was also "the Son of God." Translate "Son of God" as clearly and accurately in your language as possible.
