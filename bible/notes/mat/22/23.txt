===== Translation Notes: =====

The religious leaders continue to try to trap Jesus about his views on divorce.

  * **Teacher, Moses said, 'If a man dies,….'**  - They were asking him about what Moses wrote in the scriptures. If your language does not allow quotes within quotes, this could be stated as an indirect quote: "Moses said that if a man dies…." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations

  * **his brother...his wife...his brother**- the dead man's
