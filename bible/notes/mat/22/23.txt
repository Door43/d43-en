===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The Sadducees try to trap Jesus by asking him a difficult question about marriage and the resurrection of the dead.

  * **"Teacher, Moses said, 'If a man dies** - The religious leaders were asking Jesus about what Moses had written in the scriptures. If your language does not allow quotes within quotes, this could be stated as an indirect quote: "Teacher, Moses said that if a man dies." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotesinquotes]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **his brother...his wife...his brother** - Here "his" refers to the dead man.
