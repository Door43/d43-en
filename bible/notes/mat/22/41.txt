===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus asks the Pharisees a difficult question in order to stop their attempts to trap him.

  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Here Matthew starts to tell a new part of the story when Jesus asks the religious leaders a question.
  * **son...son of David** - In both of these "son" means "descendant."
