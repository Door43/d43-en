\v 26 The same thing \add happened to\add* the third \add brother\add*, and also to the other four \add brothers, who one by one married this same woman\add*.
\v 27 Last of all, the widow also died.
\v 28 So, at the time when people are raised from the dead, which of the seven \add brothers do you think\add* will be her husband? Keep in mind that they had all been married to her."

\v 25 There were seven brothers. The first married and then died. Having left no children, he left his wife to his brother.
\v 26 Then the second brother did the same thing, then the third, all the way to the seventh brother.
\v 27 After them all, the woman died.
\v 28 Now in the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven brothers? For they all had married her."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The Sadducees continue asking Jesus a question.

  * **first ... second ... third ... seventh** - (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **After them all** - "After every brother had died"
  * **Now** - Here the Sadducees shift from the story about the seven brothers to their actual question.
  * **in the resurrection** - "when dead people come back to life"
