\v 25 Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first married and deceased, and having no seed left his wife to his
brother;
\v 26 in like manner the second also, and the third, to the seventh.
\v 27 And after them all, the woman died.
\v 28 In the resurrection therefore whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.
