\v 25 There were seven brothers. The first married and then died, having left no children. He left his wife to his brother. 
\v 26 In the same manner the second brother acts also, then the third, all the way to the seventh brother.
\v 27 After them all, the woman died.
\v 28 Now in the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven brothers? For they all had her."
