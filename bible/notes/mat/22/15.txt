\v 16 They sent to him some of their disciples, who thought that the Israelites should pay only the tax that the Jewish authorities required them to pay. They also sent some members of the party that supported King Herod. The members of that party thought that the Israelites should pay only the tax that the Roman government required them to pay. Those who were sent came and said to Jesus, "Teacher, we know that you are truthful and that you teach the truth about what God wants us to do. We also know that you do not change what you teach because of what someone says about you, even if it is an important person who does not like what you  teach.
\v 17 So tell us what you think about this matter: Is it right that we pay taxes to the Roman government, or not?"

\v 15 Then the Pharisees went and planned how they might entrap Jesus in his own talk. 
\v 16 Then they sent to him their disciples, together with the Herodians. They said to Jesus, "Teacher, we know that you are truthful, and that you teach God's way in truth, and that you care for no one's opinion, and you do not show partiality between people.
\v 17 So tell us, what do you think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"

===== Translation Notes: =====

This begins an account of the religous leaders trying to trap Jesus.

  * **how they might entrap Jesus in his own talk** - "how they could cause him to say something that they could use against him"
  * **Herodians** - officials and followers of the Jewish king Herod, who was friendly to the Roman empire (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **you do not show partiality between people** - "you do not show special honor to some people" or "you do not pay attention to more important people"
