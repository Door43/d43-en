\v 16 They sent to him some of their disciples, \add who thought that the Israelites should pay only the tax that the Jewish authorities required them to pay\add*. They also sent some members of the party that supported Herod. \add The members of that party thought that the Israelites should pay only the tax that the Roman government required them to pay\add*. \add Those who were sent came and\add* said to Jesus, "Teacher, we know that you are truthful and that you teach the truth about what God wants\add us to do\add*.

\v 15 After Jesus said that, the Pharisees met together in order to plan how they could cause him to say something that would enable them to accuse him.
\v 16 They sent to him some of their disciples along with those of the Herodian party. Those said to Jesus, "Teacher, we know that you are truthful and that you teach the truth about what God wants us to do. We also know that you do not change what you teach because of what someone says about you, no matter what kind of person they are.
\v 17 So tell us what you think about this matter: Is it right that we pay taxes to the Roman government, or not?"

\v 15 Then the Pharisees went and planned how they might entrap Jesus in his own talk.
\v 16 Then they sent to him their disciples, together with the Herodians. They said to Jesus, "Teacher, we know that you are truthful, and that you teach God's way in truth. You care for no one's opinion, and you do not show partiality between people.
\v 17 So tell us, what do you think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - This begins an account of the religious leaders trying to trap Jesus with several difficult questions. Here the Pharisees ask him about paying taxes to Caesar.

  * **their disciples ... Herodians** - The disciples of the Pharisees supported paying taxes only to Jewish authorities. The Herodians supported paying taxes to the Roman authorities.

  * **Herodians** - These were officials and followers of the Jewish king Herod. He was friends with Roman authorities. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **you do not show partiality between people** - "you do not show special honor to some people" or "you do not consider some people more important than other people"
  * **to pay taxes to Caesar** - People did not pay taxes directly to Caesar but to one of his tax collectors. AT: "to pay the taxes that Caesar requires" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
