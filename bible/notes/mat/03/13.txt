\v 13 During that time, Jesus went from the district of Galilee to the Jordan River, where John was. He did this so John could baptize him.
\v 14 When Jesus asked John to baptize him, John refused; he said, "I need you to baptize me! But you are not a sinner, so why do you come to me?"
\v 15 But Jesus said to him, "Baptize me now, because in this way we two will do everything that God requires." Then John agreed to baptize him.

\v 13 Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John.
\v 14 But John would have stopped him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?"
\v 15 Jesus responded and said to him, "Permit it now, for it is right for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then John permitted him.

===== Translation Notes: =====

This begins the account of how Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist.

  * **I need to be baptized by you **- "I" refers to John the Baptist and "you" refers to Jesus Christ.
  * **do you come to me?**  - This is a rhetorical question. Alternative translation: "Since you are not a sinner, you should not come to me and have me baptize you." Note that "you" refers to Jesus Christ and "me" refers to John the Baptist. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
