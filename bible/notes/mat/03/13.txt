\v 13 During that time, Jesus went from the district of Galilee to the Jordan River, where John was. He did so John could baptize him.
\v 14 When Jesus asked John to baptize him, John refused; he said, "I need you to baptize me! But you are not a sinner, so why do you come to me?"
\v 15 But Jesus said to him, "Baptize me now, because in this way we two will do everything that God requires." Then John agreed to baptize him.

\v 13 Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John.
\v 14 But John would have stopped him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?"
\v 15 Jesus responded and said to him, "Permit it now, for it is right for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then John permitted him.
