\v 1 While Jesus was still in the town of Nazareth, John, whom the people called the Baptizer, went to a desolate place in the province of Judea.
He was preaching to the people who came there.
\v 2  He kept saying, "You must stop sinning, because God will soon show that he is king, and he will reject you if you do not stop sinning."
\v 3 When John began preaching, then came true what Isaiah the prophet had said long ago. He said, 
\pi "In the wilderness people hear someone shouting to anyone who comes,
\pi Get ready to receive the Lord when he comes!
\pi Get everything ready for him!"
