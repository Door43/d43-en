\v 4 John wore rough clothing made from camel's hair. As the prophet Elijah had done so long ago, he wore a leather belt around his waist. His food was only grasshoppers and honey that he found in the wilderness.
\v 5 People who lived in the city of Jerusalem, many people who lived in other places in the district of Judea, and many others who lived near the Jordan River came to John to hear him preach.
\v 6 After they heard him, they openly confessed their sins, and then he baptized them in the Jordan River.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Now ... wild honey** - The word "Now" is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Here Matthew tells background information about John the Baptist. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **wore clothing of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist** - This clothing symbolizes that John is a prophet like the prophets from long ago, especially the prophet Elijah. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Then Jerusalem, all Judea, and all the region** - The words "Jerusalem," "Judea," and "the region" are metonyms for the people from those areas. The word "all" is an exaggeration to emphasize that very many people went out. AT: Then very may people from Jerusalem, Judea, and that region" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **They were baptized by him** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "John baptized them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **They** - This refers to the people coming from Jerusalem, Judea, and the region around the Jordan River.
