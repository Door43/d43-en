===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of how Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist.

  * **After he was baptized** - This could be translated by saying: "After John baptized Jesus."
  * **the heavens were opened to him** - Alternative translation: "he saw the sky open" or "he saw the heavens open." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **coming down like a dove** - This can 1) be a plain statement that the Spirit was in the form of a dove (see UDB) or 2) be a simile that compares the Spirit coming down upon Jesus gently, the way a dove would. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Behold** - This marks the beginning of another event in the larger story. It may involve different people than the previous events. Your language may have a way of doing this.
  * **This is my beloved Son** - God the Father expresses his love for God the Son using Father-Son terms important to their relationship. Translate these words in your language as literally as possible.
