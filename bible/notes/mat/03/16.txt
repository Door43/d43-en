===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of how Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist.

  * **After he was baptized **- This could be translated by saying: "After John baptized Jesus."
  * **the heavens were opened to him** - This could be translated as "he saw the sky open" or "he saw the heavens open." (See: [[en:ta:translate:active]])
  * **coming down like a dove **- This can 1) be a plain statement that the Spirit was in the form of a dove (see UDB) or 2) be a simile that compares the Spirit coming down upon Jesus gently, the way a dove would. (See: [[en:ta:translate:simile]])
  * **Behold**  - This marks the beginning of another event in the larger story. It may involve different people than the previous events. Your language may have a way of doing this.
