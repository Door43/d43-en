===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of how Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist.

  * **After he was baptized **- This could be translated by saying: "After John baptized Jesus."
  * **the heavens were opened to him** - This could be translated as "he saw the sky open" or "he saw the heavens open." (See: [[:en:ta:vocabulary:active|]])
  * **descending as a dove **- This can 1) be a plain statement that the Spirit was in the form of a dove (see UDB) or 2) be a simile that compares the Spirit coming down upon Jesus gently, the way a dove would. (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:simile|]])
