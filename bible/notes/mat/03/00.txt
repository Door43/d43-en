=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

John the Baptist often used metaphors and a harsh tone when speaking to the Jewish religious leaders. This would have been common for a prophet to speak in this way. It conveys judgment. 

**Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter**\\

== Is Near ==

This phrase can have great theological significance. Scholars often debate whether the "kingdom of heaven" was present at this time or still coming. English translations frequently use the phrase "at hand" but this can create difficulty in translating its meaning properly. Other translations use the phase "is drawing near" and "has come near." In Greek, the word is defined as "to move closer."
