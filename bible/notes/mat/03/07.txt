\v 8 Do what is appropriate [IDI] for people who have truly turned away from their sinful behavior \add before you come to me in order to be baptized\add* \f + \ft Or:\add that I baptize you\add* \f*.
\v 9 \add God promised to give Abraham many descendants. In order to fulfill that promise\add*, God\add does not need you! I\add* tell you that he can change these stones to make them descendants of Abraham. So do not start to say to yourselves, 'Since we are descendants of \add our ancestor\add* Abraham, \add God will not punish us even though we have sinned\add*.'

\v 7 But John saw that many Pharisees and Sadducees were coming for him to baptize them. He said to them, "You
people are the children of poisonous snakes! No one warned you that one day God will punish everyone who sins, did they? Do not think that you can escape from him!
\v 8 If you truly stop sinning, then do right things to show it.
\v 9 I know that God promised to be with Abraham's descendants.  But do not say to yourselves, 'Since we are descendants of our ancestor Abraham, God will not punish us even though we have sinned.' No! I tell you that he can change these stones here into descendants of Abraham!

\v 7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to him for baptism, he said to them, "You offspring of poisonous snakes, who warned you to flee from the wrath that is coming?
\v 8 Bear fruit worthy of repentance.
\v 9 And do not think of saying among yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father.' For I say to you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham even out of these stones.

===== Translation Notes: =====

John the Baptist continues to preach.

  * **You offspring of poisonous snakes**  - This is a metaphor. Poisonous snakes are dangerous and represent evil. Alternative translation: "You evil poisonous snakes!" or "You are evil like poisonous snakes." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **who warned you to flee from the wrath that is coming**  - With this rhetorical question John was rebuking the Pharisees and Sadducees because they were asking him to baptize them so that God would not punish them, but they did not want to stop sinning. AT: "You can't flee from God's wrath like this" or "Do not think that you can flee from God's wrath just by being baptized" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **from the wrath that is coming**  - "from the punishment that is coming" or "from God's wrath that he is about to act on" or "because God is about to punish you." The word "wrath" is being used to refer to God's punishment because his wrath precedes it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
  * **We have Abraham for our father**  - "Abraham is our ancestor" or "We are descendants of Abraham"
  * **God is able to raise up children for Abraham even out of these stones**  - "God could make physical descendants out of even these stones and give them to Abraham"
