===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of Jesus' sending out his twelve apostles to do his work.

  * **These twelve Jesus sent out** - "Jesus sent out these twelve men" or "It was these twelve men whom Jesus sent out"
  * **sent out** - Jesus sent them out for a particular purpose. "Sent out" is the verbal form of the noun "apostles" that is used in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:10:01|10:2]].
  * **he instructed them **- "he told them what they needed to do." This could be translated "he commanded them."
  * **lost sheep of the house of Israel** - This is a metaphor comparing the entire nation of Israel to sheep who have strayed away from their shepherd (UDB). (See: [[en:ta:translate:Metaphor]])
  * **house of Israel** - This metonym refers to the nation of Israel. It may be translated as “people of Israel” or "descendants of Israel." (See: [[en:ta:translate:Metonymy]])
  * **And as you go ** - The pronoun "you" refers to the twelve apostles.
  * **the kingdom of heaven has drawn near** - You should translate this the same way you translated the same words in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:03:01|3:2]].
