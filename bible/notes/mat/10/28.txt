\v 28 Do not be afraid of people who \add are able to\add* kill your body \f + \ft synecdoche \f* but are not able to destroy your soul. Instead, fear \add God because\add* he is able to destroy both a \add person's\add* body and a \add person's\add* soul in hell.
\v 29 \add Think about the\add* sparrows. \add They have so little value\add* that \add you\add* can buy two of them for \add only\add* one small coin \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. But when \add any\add* sparrow falls to the ground \add and dies\add* \f + \ft litotes \f*, \add God\add*, your \add heavenly\add* Father, knows it, \add because he knows everything\add*.
\v 30 \add He knows everything about you, too\add*. He even knows how many hairs you have on your head!
\v 31 \add God\add* values you much more than he values sparrows \f + \ft litotes \f*. So, do not be afraid \add of people who threaten to kill you\add*!

\v 28 Do not be afraid of people who are able to kill your body but are not able to destroy your soul. Instead, fear God, because he is able to destroy both your body and your soul in hell.
\v 29 Think about the sparrows. They have so little value that you can buy two of them for only one small coin. But when any sparrow falls to the ground and dies, God, your heavenly Father, knows it, because he knows everything.
\v 30 He knows everything about you, too. He even knows how many hairs you have on your head!
\v 31 God values you much more than he values sparrows. So, do not be afraid of people who threaten to kill you!

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul. Instead, fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
\v 29 Are not two sparrows sold for a small coin? Yet not one of them falls to the ground without your Father's knowledge.
\v 30 But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
\v 31 Do not fear. You are more valuable than many sparrows.

  * **General Information:** - Here Jesus also begins to give reasons why his disciples should not be afraid of the persecution  they might experience.

  * **Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul** - This is not distinguishing between people who cannot kill the soul and people who can kill the soul. No person can kill the soul. AT: "Do not be afraid of people. They can kill the body, but they cannot kill the soul" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_distinguish]])
  * **kill the body** - This means to cause physical death. If these words are awkward, they can be translated as "kill you" or "kill other people."
  * **body** - the part of a person that can be touched, as opposed to the soul or spirit
  * **kill the soul** - This means to harm people after they have physically died.
  * **soul** - the part of a person that cannot be touched and that lives on after the physical body dies
  * **fear him who is able** - You can add "because" to clarify why people should fear God. AT: "fear God because he is able" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_connectingwords]])
  * **Are not two sparrows sold for a small coin?** - Jesus states this proverb as a question to teach his disciples. AT: "Think about the sparrows.

  * **not one of them falls to the ground without your Father's knowledge** - This can be stated in a positive form. AT: "your Father knows when even one sparrow dies and falls to the ground" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
