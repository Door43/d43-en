\v 28 Do not be afraid of people who \add are able to\add* kill your body \f + \ft synecdoche \f* but are not able to destroy your soul. Instead, fear \add God because\add* he is able to destroy both a \add person's\add* body and a \add person's\add* soul in hell.
\v 29 \add Think about the\add* sparrows. \add They have so little value\add* that \add you\add* can buy two of them for \add only\add* one small coin \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. But when \add any\add* sparrow falls to the ground \add and dies\add* \f + \ft litotes \f*, \add God\add*, your \add heavenly\add* Father, knows it, \add because he knows everything\add*.
\v 30 \add He knows everything about you, too\add*. He even knows how many hairs you have on your head!
\v 31 \add God\add* values you much more than he values sparrows \f + \ft litotes \f*. So, do not be afraid \add of people who threaten to kill you\add*!

\v 28 Do not be afraid of people who are able to kill your body but are not able to destroy your soul. Instead, fear God, because he is able to destroy both your body and your soul in hell.
\v 29 Think about the sparrows. They have so little value that you can buy two of them for only one small coin. But when any sparrow falls to the ground and dies, God, your heavenly Father, knows it, because he knows everything.
\v 30 He knows everything about you, too. He even knows how many hairs you have on your head!
\v 31 God values you much more than he values sparrows. So, do not be afraid of people who threaten to kill you!

<usfm>
\v 28 Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul. Instead, fear him who is able to
destroy both soul and body in hell.
\v 29 Are not two sparrows sold for a small coin? Yet not one of them falls to the ground without your Father's knowledge.
\v 30 But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
\v 31 Do not fear. You are more valuable than many sparrows.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to tell his apostles about the persecution they will endure as they work for him; this began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:10:16|10:16]].

  * **Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul** - "Do not be afraid of people. They can kill the body, but they cannot kill the soul."

  * **sparrows ** - Sparrows are very small, seed-eating birds.

  * **not one of them falls to the ground without your Father's knowledge** - This litotes can be translated "even one of them falls to the ground only if your Father knows about it" or "only if your Father knows about it does even one of them fall to the ground" (See: [[en:ta:translate:litotes|]])
  * **not one of them ** - "not one sparrow"
  * **falls to the ground** - "dies"
