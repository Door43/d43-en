===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to tell his apostles about the persecution they will endure as they work for him; this began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:10:16|10:16]].

  * **He who loves...is not worthy** - Alternate translations: "Those who love...are not worthy" or "If you love...you are not worthy."
  * **He who ** - This can also be translated "Whoever" or "The one who" or "Anyone who" or "People who" (see UDB).
  * **loves ** - The word for "love" here refers to "brotherly love" or "love from a friend." It can also be translated "cares for" or "is devoted to" or "is fond of."
  * **is not worthy of me ** - This can also be translated "does not deserve to belong to me" or "is not worthy to be my disciple" or "is not worthy to belong to me."(see UDB).
  * **He who does not pick up...is not** - Alternate translations: "Those who do not pick up...are not" or "If you do not pick up...you are not" or "Unless you pick up...you are not."
  * **pick up...cross and follow** - This is a metaphor for being willing to die. You should use the regular words for picking up an object and walking with it behind another person. (See: Metaphor)
  * **pick up** - "take up" or "pick up and carry"
  * **He who finds...will lose...he who loses...will find** - These words should be translated with as few words as possible. Alternate translations: "Those who find...will lose...those who lose...will find" or "If you find...you will lose...if you lose...you will find."
  * **finds** - This is a metonym for "keeps" or "saves." Alternate translations: "tries to keep" or "tries to save." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **will lose it** - This does not mean the person will die. It is a metaphor for "will not have true life." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **who loses his life** - This does not mean to die. It means the person considers obeying Jesus is more important than his own life. AT: "who denies himself." 
  * **for my sake** - "because he trusts me" (see UDB) or "on my account" or "because of me." This is the same idea as "for my sake" in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:10:16|10:18]].
  * **will find it** - This metaphor means "will find true life." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
