Jesus continues to tell his apostles about the persecution they will endure as they work for him; this began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:10:16|10:16]].

  * **everyone who confesses me before men** - “whoever tells others that he is my disciple” or “anyone who acknowledges before others that he is loyal to me”
  * **confess ** - "acknowledge" (see UDB)
  * **before men** - "before people" or "before other people"
  * **my Father who is in heaven ** - Jesus is speaking of God the Father.
  * **he who denies me before men **- “he who disowns me before people” or "he who rejects me before people" or “whoever refuses to acknowledge to others that he is my disciple” or “if anyone refuses to say that he is loyal to me.”
