  * **first** - in order, not in rank
  * **the Zealot** - Possible meanings are 1) "the Zealot" or 2) "the zealous one." The first meaning indicates he was part of the group of people who wanted to free the Jewish people from Roman rule. Alternative translation: "the patriot" or "the nationalist" or "the freedom fighter." The second meaning indicates that he was zealous for God to be honored. Alternative translation: "passionate."
  * **Matthew the tax collector** - "Matthew, who had been a tax collector"
