  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to instruct his disciples about the persecution they will endure when they go out to preach.


  * **When they deliver you up** - "When people give you over to the councils." The "people" here are the same "people" as in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:10:16|10:17]].
  * **you...your** - These are plural and refer to the twelve apostles. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **do not be anxious** - "do not worry"
  * **how or what you will speak** - "how you are to speak or what you are to say." The two ideas may be combined: "what you are to say." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hendiadys]])
  * **for what to say will be given to you** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "for the Holy Spirit will tell you what to say." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **in that hour** - Here "hour" means "right then." AT: "right then" or "at that time." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **the Spirit of your Father** - If necessary, this can be translated as "the Spirit of God your heavenly Father" or a footnote can be added to make it clear that this refers to God the Holy Spirit and not to the spirit of an earthly father.
  * **Father** - This is an important title for God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
