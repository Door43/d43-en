\v 8 Heal sick people, cause dead people to become alive, heal people with leprosy and bring them back into society, and cause demons to leave those whom they control. Do not charge any money for helping people, because God did not charge you anything for helping you.
\v 9-10 Do not take any money with you, nor a bag for what belongs to you. Do not take an extra tunic, nor sandals in addition to what you are wearing, nor a walking stick.

===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of Jesus sending out his twelve apostles to do his work that began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:10:01|10:1]].

  * **you...your** - the twelve apostles
  * **Acquire no gold, silver, nor brass** - "Do not acquire gold, silver, or brass"
  * **Acquire** - "Get," Receive," or "Take"
  * **gold, silver, nor brass** - These are metals out of which coins were made. This list is a metonym for money, so if the metals are unknown in your area, translate the list as "money" (see UDB).
  * **purses **- This means "belts" or "money-belts," but it can refer to whatever might be used to carry money. A belt is a long strip of cloth or leather worn around the waist. It was often wide enough that it could be folded and used to carry money.
  * **traveling bag **- This could either be any bag used to carry things on a journey, or a bag used by someone to collect food or money.
  * **two tunics** - Use the same word you used for "tunic" in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:40|5:40]].
  * **laborer**  - "worker"
  * **food** - "what he needs"
