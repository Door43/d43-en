===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of Jesus sending out his twelve apostles to do his work that began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:10:01|10:1]].

  * **you, your** - the twelve apostles
  * **Acquire no gold, silver, nor brass** - "Do not acquire gold, silver, or brass"
  * **Acquire** - "Get," Receive," or "Take"
  * **gold, silver, nor brass** - These are metals out of which coins were made. This list is a metonym for money, so if the metals are unknown in your area, translate the list as "money" (see UDB).
  * **purses **- This means "belts" or "money-belts," but it can refer to whatever might be used to carry money. A belt is a long strip of cloth or leather worn around the waist. It was often wide enough that it could be folded and used to carry money.
  * **traveling bag **- This could either be any bag used to carry things on a journey, or a bag used by someone to collect food or money.
  * **two coats **- This can be translated "two tunics" or "two shirts" or "extra clothes." The "coats" here were long shirts worn under the outer garment. You can use the same word you used for "coat" in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:40|5:40]].
  * **laborer**  - "worker"
  * **food** - "what he needs"
