===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of Jesus sending out his twelve apostles to do his work.

  * **Heal the sick **- "heal sick people" (UDB)
  * **raise the dead **- "raise up people who have died" or "cause dead people to become alive" (UDB)
  * **Freely you have received, freely give**  - The apostles received these gifts from God. They were to give them as gifts to other people. (See also UDB)
  * **you, your **- The pronouns "you" and "your" refer to the twelve apostles.
  * **Acquire **- "Get," Receive," or "Take"
  * **gold, silver, nor brass **- These are metals out of which coins were made.
  * **brass**  - "brass coins" or "copper coins." Brass is a common metal made from copper and tin.
  * **purses **- This has the meaning of "belts" or "money-belts" but can refer to whatever might be used to carry money. A belt is a long strip of cloth or leather worn around the waist. It was often wide enough that it could be folded and used to carry money.
  * **traveling bag **- This could either be any bag used to carry things on a journey, or a bag used by someone to collect food or money.
  * **two coats **- This can be translated "two tunics" or "two shirts" or "extra clothes." The word here refers to a long shirt worn under the outer garment.
