\v 16 "Take note: When I send you out, you will be as defenseless as sheep, among people who are as dangerous as wolves. So be careful like snakes are careful and be harmless to them like pigeons are harmless.
\v 17 Also, be on guard against such people, because they will arrest you and take you to the members of the governing councils to put you on trial. They will whip you in their synagogues.
\v 18 And because you belong to me, they will take you before governors and kings in order that they may put you on trial and punish you. But you will testify to those rulers and to other non-Jews about me.

\v 16 See, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be as wise as serpents and harmless as doves.
\v 17 Watch out for people! They will deliver you up to councils, and they will whip you in their synagogues.
\v 18 Then you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.

  * **be as wise as serpents and harmless as doves** - Jesus is telling the disciples they must be cautious and harmless among the people.
