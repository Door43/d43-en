\v 24 A disciple should not \add expect to be\add* greater than his teacher, and servants \add are not\add* superior to their master.
\v 25 You do not \add expect that\add* people will \add treat\add* a disciple better than \add they treat\add* his teacher, or that\add they will treat\add* a servant \add better than they treat\add* his master. \add Similarly, because I am your teacher and master, you can expect that people will mistreat you, because they have mistreated me\add*. The most you can expect is that people \add will treat you like they treat me. I am like\add* the ruler of a household \f + \ft metaphor \f*. But people \add have insulted me by\add* calling \add me\add* Beelzebub, \add the ruler of the demons\add*. So they \add will\add* certainly \add insult you more, you who are only like\add* members of my household \f + \ft metaphor \f*!"

\v 24 A disciple should not expect to be greater than his teacher, and servants are not superior to their master.
\v 25 You do not expect that people will treat a student better than they treat his teacher, or that they will treat a servant better than they treat his master. Similarly, because I am your teacher and master, you can expect that people will mistreat you, because they have mistreated me. I am like the ruler of a household, whom they call Satan. If they act that badly toward me, how do you think they will act toward you?"

\v 24 A disciple is not greater than his teacher, nor a servant above his master.
\v 25 It is enough for the disciple that he should be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much worse would be the names they call the members of his household!

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to instruct his disciples about the persecution they will endure when they go out to preach.

  * **A disciple is not greater than his teacher, nor a servant above his master** - Jesus is using a proverb to teach his disciples a general truth. Jesus is emphasizing that the disciples should not expect people to treat them any better than the people treat Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_proverbs]])
  * **A disciple is not greater than his teacher** - "A disciple is always less important than his teacher" or "A teacher is always more important than his disciple"
  * **nor a servant above his master** - "and a servant is always less important than his master" or "and a master is always more important than his servant"
  * **It is enough for the disciple that he should be like his teacher** - "The disciple should be satisfied to become like his teacher"
  * **be like his teacher** - If necessary, you can make explicit how the disciple becomes like the teacher. AT: "know as much as his teacher knows" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the servant like his master** - If necessary, you can make explicit how the servant becomes like the master. AT: "the servant should be satisfied to become only as important as his master" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **If they have called the master ... how much worse ... they call ... the members of his household** - Again Jesus is emphasizing that since people have mistreated him, his disciples should expect people to treat them the same or worse.
  * **how much worse would be the names they call the members of his household** - "the names that they call the members of his household will certainly be much worse" or "they will certainly call the members of his household much worse names"
  * **If they have called** - "Since people have called"
  * **the master of the house** - Jesus is using this as a metaphor for himself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Beelzebul** - This name can either be 1) transcribed directly as "Beelzebul" or 2) translated with its original, intended meaning of "Satan."
  * **his household** - This is a metaphor for Jesus' disciples. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
