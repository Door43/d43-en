\v 21 They will take you to the authorities to die because you believe in me. For example, people will do that to their brothers, and fathers will do that to their children. Children will rebel against their parents and cause them to be killed.
\v 22 Many people will hate you because you trust in me. But anyone who faithfully trusts in me until they die, those people God will save.
\v 23 When people in one city cause you to suffer, escape to another city. Note this: I, the Son of Man, will certainly return to earth before you have finished going from one town to another town throughout Israel and telling people about me.

\v 21 Brother will deliver up brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rise up against their parents and cause them to be put to death.
\v 22 You will be hated by everyone because of my name. But whoever endures to the end, that person will be saved.
\v 23 When they persecute you in this city, flee to the next, for truly I say to you, you will not have gone through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man has come.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to instruct his disciples about the persecution they will endure when they go out to preach.

  * **Brother will deliver up brother to death, and a father his child** - The phrase "a father his child" can be translated as a complete sentence. AT: "Brothers will deliver up their brothers to death, and fathers will deliver up their children to death" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **deliver up** - "betray" or "give up." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:10:16|10:17]].
  * **to death** - The abstract noun "death" can be translated in a concrete, more detailed way. AT: "to the courts so that the authorities can execute them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **rise up against** - "rebel against" or "turn against"
  * **cause them to be put to death** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "have them put to death" or "have the authorities execute them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **You will be hated by everyone** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "Everyone will hate you" or "All people will hate you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **You** - This is plural and refers to the twelve disciples. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **because of my name** - Here "name" refers to the entire person. AT: "because of me" or "because you trust in me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **whoever endures** - "whoever stays faithful"
  * **to the end** - It is not clear whether the "end" means when a person dies, when the persecution ends, or the end of the age when God shows himself to be king. The main point is that they endure as long as necessary.
  * **that person will be saved** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will deliver that person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **in this city** - Here "this" does not refer to a specific city. AT: "in one city"
  * **flee to the next** - "flee to the next city"
  * **truly I say to you** - "I tell you the truth." This phrase adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.
  * **Son of Man** - Jesus is speaking about himself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **has come** - "arrives"
