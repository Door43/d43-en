\v 21 They will take you to the authorities to die because you believe in me. For example, people will do that to their brothers, and fathers will do that to their children. Children will rebel against their parents and cause them to be killed.
\v 22 Many people will hate you because you trust in me. But anyone who faithfully trusts in me untill they die, those people God will save.
\v 23 When people in one city cause you to suffer, escape to another city. Note this: I, the Son of Man, will certainly return to earth before you have finished going from one town to another town throughout Israel and telling people about me.

Jesus continues to tell his apostles about the persecution they will endure as they work for him; this began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:10:16|10:16]].

  * **Brother will deliver up brother to death, and a father his child** - The singular here refers to the class of people. It can also be translated as "Brothers will deliver up their brothers to death, and fathers will deliver up their children to death."
  * **deliver up** - You should translate this the same way you translated "deliver...up" in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:10:16|10:17]].
  * **rise up against ** - "rebel against" (UDB) or "turn against"
  * **and cause them to be put to death ** - "and have them put to death" or "and have the authorities put them to death"
  * **You will be hated by everyone** - This can be translated as "Everyone will hate you" or "All people will hate you" (See: [[en:ta:translate:Active]])

  * **that person will be saved** - This can be translated as "God will deliver that person." (See: [[en:ta:translate:Active]])
