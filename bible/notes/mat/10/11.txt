\v 11-12 In any town or village that you enter, find a person who wants you to stay in his home. As you go into that house, call upon God to do good to the people who live there. Stay in that home until you leave that town or village.
\v 13 If the people who live in that house receive you well, God will indeed do good to them. But if they do not receive you well, then your prayer will not help them, and God will not do them good.

===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of Jesus sending out his twelve apostles to do his work that began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:10:01|10:1]].

  * **you...your ** - These pronouns refer to the twelve apostles.
  * **Whatever city or village you enter **- "Whenever you enter a city or village" or "Every city or village you go into"
  * **city...village** - "large village...small village" or "large town...small town." These are the same words as in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:09:35|9:35]].
  * **stay there until you leave** - "stay in that person's house until you leave the town or village"
  * **As you enter into the house, greet it** - "As you enter into the house, greet the people who live in it." A common greeting in those days was "Peace be to this house!" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the house is worthy** - "the people who live in that house receive you well" (UDB)  or "the people who live in that house treat you well" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **let your peace come upon it** - "let peace come upon it" or "the people who live in that house will live in peace" (See UDB)
  * **your peace ** - the peace the apostles are to ask God to bring upon the people in the house
  * **if it is not worthy** - "if they do not receive you well" (UDB) or "if they do not treat you well"
  * **let your peace come back to you**  - This could have one of two meanings 1) If the household was not worthy, then God would hold back peace or blessings from that household, as expressed in the UDB, or 2) if the household was not worthy, then the apostles were supposed to do something, such as asking God not to honor their greeting of peace. If your language has a similar meaning of taking back a greeting or its effects, that should be used here.
