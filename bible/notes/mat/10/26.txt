\v 26 "Do not be afraid of those people. Everything that is unknown to people, God wants you now to reveal it. He does not want you to hide what is true about him, neither to keep it secret.
\v 27 So, instead of being afraid, what I say to you secretly as people do at night, tell it publicly as people do during the daytime. What I say to you privately as people do when they whisper to you, proclaim it publicly.

\v 26 Therefore do not fear them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed, and nothing hidden that will not be  known.
\v 27 What I tell you in the darkness, say in the daylight, and what you hear softly in your ear, proclaim upon the housetops.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to tell his apostles about the persecution they will endure as they work for him; this began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:10:16|10:16]].

  * **do not fear them** - The pronoun "them" refers to the people who mistreat followers of Jesus.
  * **there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed, and nothing hidden that will not be known** - This parallelism can also be translated as "God will reveal the things that people hide." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]], [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **What I tell you in the darkness, say in the daylight, and what you hear softly in your ear, proclaim upon the housetops** - This parallelism can also be translated as "Tell people in the daylight what I tell you in the darkness, and proclaim upon the housetops what you hear softly in your ear." 
  * **What I tell you in the darkness** - "What I say to you secretly" (UDB) or "The things I am telling you privately" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **say in the daylight** - "say it openly" or "say it publicly" (see UDB) (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **what you hear softly in your ear** - "what I whisper to you."
  * **proclaim upon the housetops** - "say it with a loud voice for all to hear." Housetops where Jesus lived were flat, and people far away would be able to hear anyone speaking with a loud voice.
