\v 26 "Do not be afraid of those people. Everything that is unknown to people, God wants you now to reveal it. He does not want you to hide what is true about him, neither to keep it secret.
\v 27 So, instead of being afraid, what I say to you secretly as people do at night, tell it publicly as people do during the daytime. What I say to you privately as people do when they whisper to you, proclaim it publicly.
