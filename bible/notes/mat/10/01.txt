===== Translation Notes: =====

This begins an account of Jesus' sending out his twelve apostles to do his work.

  * **called his twelve disciples together **  - "summoned his twelve disciples"
  * **gave them authority** - Be sure that the text clearly communicates that this authority was (1) to drive out unclean spirits and (2) to heal disease and sickness.
  * **drive them out **  - "make the unclean spirits leave"
  * **all kinds of disease and all kinds of sickness **  - "every disease and every sickness." The words "disease" and "sickness" are closely related but should be translated as two different words if possible. "Disease" is what causes a person to be sick. "Sickness" is the physical weakness or affliction that results from having a disease.
