<usfm>
\v 11 God is pleased with you when other people insult you, when they do evil things to you and when other people say that you are evil because you believe in me.
\v 12 When that happens, rejoice and be glad, because God will give you a great reward in heaven. God will think very well of you.  It was just like that that your ancestors long ago persecuted the prophets, of whom God also thought highly.

\v 12 Rejoice and be very glad, for great is your reward in heaven. For in this way people persecuted the prophets that lived before you.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to teach his disciples. 

  * **against you falsely for my sake** - "when it is not true about you but because you follow me" or "without your doing anything to deserve it except believing in me"
  * **Rejoice and be very glad** - "Rejoice" and "be very glad" mean almost the same thing. Jesus wanted his hearers not merely to rejoice but to do even more than rejoice if possible. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
