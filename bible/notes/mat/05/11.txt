===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 11 God is pleased with you when other people insult you, when they do evil things to you and when other people say that you are evil because you believe in me. \v 12 When that happens, rejoice and be glad, because God will give you a great reward in heaven. God will think very well of you. It was just like that that your ancestors long ago persecuted the prophets, of whom God also thought highly.
