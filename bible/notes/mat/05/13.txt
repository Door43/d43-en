===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 What salt does for food, this is what you will do for the world. But if salt loses its power, no one can make it good again. People just throw it out and walk over it.
\v 14 What light does for people in the dark, this is what you will do for the world. All people will see you, just as they see a city built on a hillside.

\p
\v 13 You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt has lost its taste, how can it be made salty again? It is never again good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled under by people's feet.
\v 14 You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be concealed.
