\v 17 "I came to earth, not to annul the laws \add that God gave Moses\add* or \add what\add* the prophets \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add wrote\add*. Instead, I \add came\add* to cause to happen \add what the authors of those books predicted would happen\add*. So do not think any longer that I have come \add to earth\add* in order that I might annul \add what they wrote\add*.
\v 18 Keep this in mind: \add Every\add* point of those laws, \add including those points that seem\add* least important, and even the smallest details of the laws \f + \ft metonymy \f* will surely be in effect \f + \ft hyperbole, litotes \f* until the heavens and the earth disappear and until all \add that God told their authors to write\add* happens.

\v 17 "You should not suppose that I have come to you in order to do away with the laws that God gave Moses or what the prophets wrote. Instead, I came to cause to happen what those things said would happen.
\v 18 Keep this in mind: everything in those laws, including the things that seem least important, and the smallest details in those lawsâ€”everything will surely be true until the heavens and the earth disappear and until all that God told their authors to write happens.

\v 17 Do not think that I have come to destroy the law or the prophets; I have come not to destroy them, but to fulfill them.
\v 18 For truly I say to you that until heaven and earth pass away, not one jot or one tittle shall in any way pass away from the law, until all things shall have been accomplished.
