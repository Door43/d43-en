  * **the peacemakers**  - These are the people who help others to have peace with one another.
  * **sons of God**  - These are God's own children. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **those who have been persecuted**  - This could be translated as "those people whom others treat unfairly."
