===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to teach his disciples.

  * **the peacemakers**  - These are the people who help others to have peace with one another.
  * **sons of God**  - These are God's own children. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **those who have been persecuted**  - Alternative translation: "those people whom others treat unfairly."
  * **for righteousness' sake**  - "because they do what God wants them to do"
  * **theirs is the kingdom of heaven**  - "God allows them to live in the kingdom of heaven." They do not own the kingdom of heaven; rather, God gives them the right to live in his presence.
