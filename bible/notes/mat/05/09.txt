===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the peacemakers** - These are the people who help others to have peace with one another.
  * **for they will be called sons of God** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "for God will call them his children" or "they will be children of God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **sons of God** - It is best to translate "sons" with the same word your language would naturally use to refer to a human son or child.
  * **those who have been persecuted** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "those people whom others treat unfairly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **for righteousness' sake** - "because they do what God wants them to do"
  * **theirs is the kingdom of heaven** - Here "kingdom of heaven" refers to God's rule as king. This phrase is only in the book of Matthew. If possible, keep "heaven" in your translation. AT: "for God in heaven will be their king." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01|5:3]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
