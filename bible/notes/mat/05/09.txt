===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the peacemakers** - These are the people who help others to have peace with one another.
  * **for they will be called sons of God** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "for God will call them his children" or "they will be children of God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **sons of God** - It is best to translate "sons" with the same word your language would naturally use to refer to a human son or child.
  * **those who have been persecuted** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "those people whom others treat unfairly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **for righteousness' sake** - "because they do what God wants them to do"
  * **theirs is the kingdom of heaven** - Here "kingdom of heaven" refers to God's rule as king. This phrase is only in the book of Matthew. If possible, keep "heaven" in your translation. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01|5:3]]. AT: "for God in heaven will be their king" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
