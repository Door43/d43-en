And if someone harms one of your teeth, then they should harm one of that person's teeth.' \v 39 But now listen to what I say to you: far from taking revenge on someone who harms you, do not even try to stop him. Instead, if someone insults you by striking you on one cheek, turn your other cheek toward that person so he can strike it also. </usfm>
