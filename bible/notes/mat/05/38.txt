\v 39 But \add now listen to what\add* I say to you: Do not take revenge for evil \add deeds done\add* \f + \ft Or:\add that other people do\add* \f* \add to you\add*.

\v 38 "You have heard that God said to our ancestors, 'If someone harms one of your eyes, then they should harm one of that person's eyes. And if someone harms one of your teeth, then they should harm one of that person's teeth.'
\v 39 But now listen to what I say to you: far from taking revenge on someone who harms you, do not even try to stop him. Instead, if someone insults you by striking you on one cheek, turn your other cheek toward that person so he can strike it also.

also.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01|5:1]].

  *  Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals.
  * **You have heard that it was said** - Translate this the way you translated it in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:33|5:33]].
  * **You have heard** - The "you" is singular..
  * **eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth** - The people were allowed to do to others what was done to them, but only to the extent of the harm done.
  * **But I say to you** - Translate this the same way you translated it in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:31|5:32]].
  * **one who is evil** - "an evil person" or "someone who harms you" (UDB)
  * **whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn** - All of these are plural.
  * **strikes ... your right cheek** - To strike the side of a man's was an insult in Jesus' culture. As with the eye and the hand ([[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:29|5:29-30]]), the "right" cheek is metaphorically the more important of the two, and striking that cheek was the worst possible insult. (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor|]].)
  * **strikes** - The verb specifies that the strike is made with the back of an open hand.
  * **turn to him the other also**  - "let him hit your other cheek also."
