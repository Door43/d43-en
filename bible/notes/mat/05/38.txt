\v 38 "You have heard that our ancestors were told, 'If someone harms one of your eyes, then they should harm one of that person's eyes. And if someone harms one of your teeth, then they should harm one of that person's teeth.'
\v 39 But now listen to what I say to you: Far from taking revenge on someone who harms you, do not even try to stop him. Instead, if someone insults you by striking you on one cheek, turn your other cheek toward that person so he can strike it also.

\v 38 You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.'
\v 39 But I say to you, do not resist one who is evil. Instead, whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to teach about how he has come to fulfill the Old Testament law. Here he begins to speak about retaliating against an enemy.
  * **General Information:** - Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. The word "you" in "You have heard" and "I say to you" is plural. The phrase "whoever strikes you" is addressed to singular "you," but you may have to translate it as plural "you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **You have heard that it was said** - Jesus agrees with God and his word. But, he does not agree with the way the religious leaders had applied God's word. This can be stated in active form. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:33|5:33]]. AT: "Your religious leaders have told you that God said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth** - The law of Moses allowed a person to harm a person in the same way he had harmed him, but he could not harm him worse.
  * **But I say** - The "I" is emphatic. This indicates that what Jesus says is equally important to the original commands from God. Try to translate this phrase in a way that shows that emphasis. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:21|5:22]].
  * **one who is evil** - "an evil person" or "someone who harms you" 
  * **strikes ... your right cheek** - To strike the side of a man's face was an insult in Jesus' culture. As with the eye and the hand, the right cheek is the more important one, and striking that cheek was a terrible insult.
  * **strikes** - "slaps." This means hitting someone with the back of an open hand.
  * **turn to him the other also** - "let him hit your other cheek also"
