===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01|5:1]].

  * **Neither do people light a lamp**  - "People do not light a lamp."
  * **lamp**  - This is a small bowl with a wick and olive oil for fuel. The important thing is that it gave light.
  * **put it under a basket**  - "place the lamp under a basket." This is saying it is foolish to create light only to hide it so people do not see the light of the lamp.
