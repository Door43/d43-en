===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to teach his disciples. 

  * **Neither do people light a lamp** - "People do not light a lamp."
  * **lamp** - This is a small bowl with a wick and olive oil for fuel. The important thing is that it gave light.
  * **put it under a basket** - "place the lamp under a basket." This is saying it is foolish to create light only to hide it so people do not see the light of the lamp.
  * **your Father who is in heaven** - God the Father in heaven is a Person of God along with God the Son and God the Spirit. Translating with your best word for "Father" to maintain the original meaning of the Scriptures.
