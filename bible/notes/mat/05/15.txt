<usfm>
\v 15 Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but rather on the lampstand, and it shines for everyone in the house.
\v 16 Let your light shine before people in such a way that they see your good deeds and praise your Father who is in heaven.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Neither do people light a lamp** - "People do not light a lamp"
  * **put it under a basket** - "place the lamp under a basket." This is saying it is foolish to create light only to hide it so people do not see the light of the lamp.
  * **Let your light shine before people** - This means a disciple of Jesus should live in such a way that others can learn about God's truth. AT: "Let your lives be like a light that shines before people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **your Father who is in heaven** - It is best to translate "Father" with the same word your language would naturally use to refer to a human father.
