===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01|5:1]].

  *  Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. All "you" and "your" are singular, as are the commands "let," "go," "give," and "do not turn away," but you may have to translate them as plurals.
  * **coat ... cloak** - The "coat" was worn close to the body, like a heavy shirt or a sweater. The "cloak," the more valuable of the two, was worn over the "coat" for warmth and also used as a blanket for warmth at night.
  * **let that person ... have**  - "give to that person"
  * **whoever **- any person
  * **one mile **- one thousand paces, the distance a Roman soldier could legally force someone to carry something for him
  * **with him**  - this refers to the one who compels you to go.
  * **go with him two**  - "go the mile he forces you to go, then go another mile"
