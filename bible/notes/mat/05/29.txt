\v 29 If because of what you see \f + \ft metonymy \f* you \add are tempted to\add* sin, \add stop looking at those things! Even if you have to\add* gouge out one of your eyes and throw it away \f + \ft hyperbole \f* \add to avoid sinning, do it!\add* It is good \add that you not sin and\add* as a result \add go to heaven, even though while you are still here on earth\add* you lack one \add or both of\add* your eyes. But it is not good \add that you continue to have two eyes and sin and, as a result, God\add* sends your whole body to hell.
\v 30 If you are \add tempted to\add* use one of your hands to sin \f + \ft metonymy \f*, \add stop using your hand. Even if you have to\add* cut your hand off and throw it away\add to avoid sinning, do it\add* \f + \ft hyperbole \f*! It is good \add that you do not sin and as a result you go to heaven, even though while you are still here on earth\add* you lack one \add or both\add* of your \add hands\add*. But it is not good \add that you sin and, as a result, God\add* sends your whole body to hell."

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 29 If you want to sin because you have looked at certain things, then stop looking at them.  Even if you have to destroy both of your eyes, do it if that would make you able to avoid sinning. It would be better to be blind and stop sinning, than for God to throw you into hell while you can still see.
\v 30 And if you want to use one of your hands to sin, stop using your hand. Even if you have to cut your hand off and throw it away, do it if that would make you able to avoid sinning. It would be better to be blind and stop sinning, than for God to throw you into hell while you still have both your hands."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 29 And if your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you; for it is better for you that one
of your body parts should perish, than that your whole body should be thrown into hell.
\v 30 And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you; for it is better for you that one
of your body parts should perish, than that your whole body should go into hell.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01|5:1]].

  * Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. All instances of "you" and "your" are singular, but you may have to translate them as plurals.
  * **right eye … right hand**  - The most important eye or hand, as opposed to the left eye or hand. You may need to translate "right" as "best." or "only." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metonymy|Metonymy]])
  * **if your right eye causes you to stumble**  - "if what you see causes you to stumble" or "if you want to sin because of what you see." "Stumble" is a metaphor for "sin." Jesus is using irony here, as people usually use their eyes to keep from stumbling over things. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor|Metaphor]], [[:en:ta:translate:irony|Irony]])
  * **pluck it out**  - "forcefully remove it" or "destroy it" (see UDB). If the right eye is not specifically mentioned, you may need to translate this "pluck your eyes out." If eyes have been mentioned, you may need to translate this "pluck them out" (see UDB). (See: [[:en:ta:translate:hyperbole|Hyperbole]].)
  * **throw it away from you**  - "get rid of it"
  * **one of your body parts should perish**  - "you should lose one part of your body"
  * **if your right hand causes**  - This metonymy is used to connect the hand to the actions of the whole person. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metonymy|Metonymy]])
