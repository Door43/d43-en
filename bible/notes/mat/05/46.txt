===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 46 If you love only the people who love you, do not expect God to reward you at all! Even people who do terrible things, such as tax collectors, love those who love them. You must act better than they do! \v 47 Yes, and if you greet only your friends and ask God to bless them, you are not acting any better than other people. Even non-Jews, who do not obey God's law, do the same thing! \v 48 So you must be completely faithful to God your Father in heaven, just as he is completely faithful to you." </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 46 For if you love those who love you, what reward do you get? Do not even the tax collectors do the same thing? \v 47 And if you greet only your brothers, what do you do more than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same thing? \v 48 Therefore you must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect. </usfm>
