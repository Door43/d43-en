  * **He opened his mouth**  - "Jesus began to speak."
  * **taught them**  - The word "them" refers to his disciples.
  * **the poor in spirit **  - "those who know they need God"
  * **those who mourn**  - These people are sad because of 1) the sinfulness of the world or 2) their own sins or 3) the death of someone. Do not specify the reason for mourning unless your language requires it.
  * **they will be comforted**  - Alternate translation: "God will comfort them." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
