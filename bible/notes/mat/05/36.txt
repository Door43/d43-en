\v 36 Also, do not promise that you will do something and then say that they should cut off your head if you do not do it. You are not even able to change the color of one hair on your head.
\v 37 If you talk about doing something, just say 'Yes, I will do it,' or 'No, I will not do it.' If you say anything more than that, it is Satan, the Evil One, who has suggested that you talk this way."

\v 36 Neither swear by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.
\v 37 But let your speech be, 'Yes, yes,' or 'No, no.' Anything that is more than this is from the evil one.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01|5:1]].

  * Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. The instances of "you" in "will you swear" and "you cannot" are singular, but you may have to translate them as plurals. "Your" in "your speech" is plural.
  * In [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:33|5:34-35]] Jesus has told his hearers that God's throne, footstool, and earthly home are not theirs to swear by. Here he says that even their own heads are not theirs to swear by.
  * **swear** - Translate this with the same word you used in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:33|5:34]].
  * **let your speech be, 'Yes, yes,' or 'No, no.'** - "if you mean 'yes,' say 'yes,' and if you mean 'no,' say 'no.'"
