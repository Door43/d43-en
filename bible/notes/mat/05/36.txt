<usfm> \v 36 Also, do not promise that you will do something and then say that they should cut off your head if you do not do it. You are not even able to change the color of one hair on your head. \v 37 If you talk about doing something, just say 'Yes, I will do it,' or 'No, I will not do it.' If you say anything more than that, it is Satan, the Evil One, who has suggested that you talk this way."

<usfm> \v 36 Neither will you swear by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black. \v 37 But let your speech be, 'Yes, yes,' or 'No, no.' Anything that is more than this is from the evil one. </usfm>
