\v 21 "You have heard \add your religious teachers say\add* that it was said \f + \ft Or:that \add Moses\add* said \f* to your ancestors, 'Do not murder \add anyone.'

\v 22 But what I say to you is this: \add If you are\add* angry with someone, \add God\add* will judge you. If you say to someone, '\add You are worthless\add*,' the Jewish Council will judge you.

\v 21 "Others have told you what God said to our ancestors, 'You must not kill anyone,' and, 'If you kill anyone, the members of a governing council might sentence you to die.'
\v 22 But I tell you that if you are angry with anyone, God himself will judge you. If you say to someone, 'You are worthless,' the Jewish council will judge you. If you say to someone, 'You are a fool,' God will throw you into the fire in hell.

\v 21 You have heard that it was said to them in ancient times, 'You will not kill,' and, 'Whoever kills will be in danger of
the judgment.'
\v 22 But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be in danger of the judgment; and whoever 
says to his brother, 'Raca,' will be in danger of the Council; and whoever says, 'You fool,' will be in danger of the hell
of fire.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in 5:1.

  * Jesus was talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals.
  * **kill ... kills**  - This word refers to murder, not to all forms of killing.
  * **Raca ... fool**  - These are emotional words for people who cannot think correctly. "Raca" is close to "brainless," where "fool" adds the idea of disobedience to God.
