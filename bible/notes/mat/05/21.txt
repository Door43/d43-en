\v 21 "You have heard \add your religious teachers say\add* that it was said \f + \ft Or:that \add Moses\add* said \f* to your ancestors, 'Do not murder \add anyone.'

\v 22 But what I say to you is this: \add If you are\add* angry with someone, \add God\add* will judge you. If you say to someone, '\add You are worthless\add*,' the Jewish Council will judge you.

\v 21 "Others have told you what God said to our ancestors, 'You must not kill anyone,' and, 'If you kill anyone, the members of a governing council might sentence you.'
\v 22 But I tell you that if you are angry with anyone, God himself will judge you. If you say to someone, 'You are worthless,' a governing council will judge you. If you say to someone, 'You are a fool,' God will throw you into the fire in hell.

\p
\v 21 You have heard that it was said to them in ancient times, 'Do not kill,' and, 'Whoever kills will be in danger of the judgment.'
\v 22 But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be in danger of the judgment. And whoever
says to his brother, 'You worthless person!' will be in danger of the council. And whoever says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to teach about how he has come to fulfill the Old Testament law. Here he begins to speak about murder and anger.
  * **General Information:** - Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. The word "you" in "You have heard" and "I say to you" is plural. The command "You will not kill" is singular, but you may need to translate it as plural.

  * **it was said to them in ancient times** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God told our ancestors long ago" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Whoever kills will be in danger of the judgment** - Here "the judgment" implies that a judge will condemn the person to die. AT: "A judge will condemn anyone who kills another person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **kill ... kills** - This word refers to murder, not to all forms of killing.
  * **But I say** - The "I" is emphatic. This indicates that what Jesus says is equally important to the original commands from God. Try to translate this phrase in a way that shows that emphasis.
  * **brother** - This refers to a fellow believer, not to a literal brother or a neighbor.
  * **will be in danger of the judgment** - It seems here Jesus is not referring to a human judge but rather to God condemning the person who is angry with his brother. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **worthless person ... fool** - These are insults for people who cannot think correctly. "Worthless person" is close to "brainless," where "fool" adds the idea of disobedience to God.
  * **council** - This was likely a local council, not the main Sanhedrin in Jerusalem.
