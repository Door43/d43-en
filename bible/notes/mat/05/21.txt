\v 21 "Others have told you what God said to our ancestors, 'You must not kill anyone,' and, 'If you kill anyone, the judge might sentence you to die.'
\v 22 But I tell you that if you are angry with anyone, God himself will judge you. If you say to someone, 'You are worthless,' the Jewish council will judge you. If you say to someone, 'You are a fool,' God will throw you into the fire in hell.

\v 21 You have heard that it was said to them in ancient times, 'You will not kill,' and, 'Whoever kills will be in danger of
the judgment.'
\v 22 But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be in danger of the judgment; and whoever 
says to his brother, 'Raca,' will be in danger of the council; and whoever says, 'You fool,' will be in danger of the hell
of fire.
