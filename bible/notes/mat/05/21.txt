\v 21 "You have heard \add your religious teachers say\add* that it was said \f + \ft Or:that \add Moses\add* said \f* to your ancestors, 'Do not murder \add anyone.'

\v 22 But what I say to you is this: \add If you are\add* angry with someone, \add God\add* will judge you. If you say to someone, '\add You are worthless\add*,' the Jewish Council will judge you. If you say \add to someone\add*, '\add You are\add* a fool,' \add God will throw you\add* into the fires in hell.

\v 21 "Others have told you what God said to our ancestors, 'You must not kill anyone,' and, 'If you kill anyone, the members of a governing council might sentence you to die.'
\v 22 But I tell you that if you are angry with anyone, God himself will judge you. If you say to someone, 'You are worthless,' a governing council will judge you. If you say to someone, 'You are a fool,' God will throw you into the fire in hell.

\v 21 You have heard that it was said to them in ancient times, 'Do not kill,' and, 'Whoever kills will be in danger of
the judgment.'
\v 22 But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be in danger of the judgment; and whoever 
says to his brother, 'You worthless person!' will be in danger of the council; and whoever says, 'You fool,' will be in danger of the hell
of fire.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01|5:1]].

  * Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. "You have heard" and "I say to you" are spoken to the group using plurals. "You will not kill" is singular, but you may need to translate it as plural.
  * **But I say** - The "I" is emphatic. This indicates that what Jesus says is equally important to the original commands from God. Try to translate this phrase in a way that shows that emphasis.
  * **kill ... kills**  - This word refers to murder, not to all forms of killing.
  * **brother** - This refers to a fellow believer, not to a literal brother or a neighbor.
  * **worthless person ... fool**  - These are insults for people who cannot think correctly. "Worthless person" is close to "brainless," where "fool" adds the idea of disobedience to God.
  * **council** - This was likely a local council, not the main Sanhedrin in Jerusalem.
