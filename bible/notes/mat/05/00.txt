====== Matthew 05 General Notes ======

=== Structure and Formatting ===

Matthew 5-7, traditionally called The Sermon on the Mount, forms one lengthy teaching by Jesus. The chapter divisions cause needless confusion here. A title could help the reader understand that these chapters form one section or unit. The translator should be aware that there is some question about the teaching applies to Israel, the church or the future kingdom of God.

5:3-10, known as the Beatitudes or Blessings, has been set apart by using indentation, with each line beginning with the word "blessed." This indentation highlights the poetic form of this teaching.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "His disciples" ==

It is possible to refer to anyone who followed Jesus as a follower or disciple. Jesus selected twelve of his followers to become his inner circle, the twelve disciples. They would later become known as the apostles. It may have significance that this teaching was for the twelve apostles.
