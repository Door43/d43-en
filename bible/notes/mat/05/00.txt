======  Matthew 05 General Notes ======


**Formatting in this chapter**\\

Verses 3-10, known as the Beatitudes or Blessings, have been set apart by using indentation, with each line beginning with the word "blessed." This highlights the poetic form of this teaching.

**Special concepts in this chapter**\\

== Sermon on the Mount ==

Matthew chapters 5-7 together form one sermon or teaching by Jesus. The chapter divisions cause confusion here. A title could help the reader understand that these chapters form one section or unit. The translator should be aware that there is some controversy over whether the teaching applies to Israel, the church or a future kingdom of God.

**Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter**\\

== Disciples ==

It is possible to refer to anyone who followed Jesus' a "follower" or "disciple." There were twelve special disciples, also known as the "apostles," who are called "disciples in this passage ([[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01|5:1]]). They are distinct from this the disciples or followers of Jesus, whom Matthew refer to as the "crowds" in this chapter. It may have significance that this teaching is to the twelve apostles.
