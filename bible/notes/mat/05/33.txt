\v 34 But \add now listen to what\add* I say to you: Never promise to do anything and then ask a superior being to affirm\add that what you are saying will happen. For example, do\add* not \add promise that you will give something and then ask spiritual beings in\add* heaven \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add to affirm that you will do it\add*, because heaven is where God \add sits\add* on his throne \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add to rule over people\add*.
\v 35 \add Also, do\add* not \add promise that you will give something and then ask spiritual beings\add* on earth \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add to affirm that you will do it\add*, because the earth is where God rests his feet \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add Also, do\add* not \add promise that you will do something and ask religious authorities\add* in Jerusalem \add to affirm that you will do it\add*, because Jerusalem is the city where \add God\add*, the great King \add rules\add*.

\v 33 "You have also heard your religious teachers say that God said to our ancestors, ‘Make sure that you do what you have called upon the Lord to witness that you would do!’
\v 34 But now listen to what I say to you: Never promise to do anything and then ask someone greater than yourself to witness it. For example, do not promise that you will do something and then ask anyone in heaven to witness it, because heaven is where God sits on his throne as king.
\v 35 And do not promise that you will do something as surely as the earth exists; do not do this, because the earth is where God rests his feet. Moreover, do not promise that you will do something as surely as the city of Jerusalem exists, because Jerusalem is the city that especially belongs to God.

\v 33 Again, you have heard that it was said to those in ancient times, 'Do not swear a false oath, but carry out your oaths to the Lord.'
\v 34 But I say to you, swear not at all, neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God;
\v 35 nor by the earth, for it is the footstool for his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01|5:1]].

  * Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. The "you" in "you have heard" and "I say to you" are plural. The "you" in "you will not swear" and "you will carry" are singular.
  * **you have heard that it was said**  - "your religious leaders have said to you, 'God said to those in ancient times, "You will not swear."'" Jesus uses the passive here to make it plain that it is not God or God's word that he disagrees with. Rather, he is telling his hearers not to use what does not belong to them to try to make people believe their words.
  * **it was said**  - Translate this the way you did in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:31|5:31]].
  * **swear … oaths**  - This can mean 1) tell God and people that you will do what God requires you to do (see UDB) or 2) tell people that God knows that what you are saying about something you have seen is true.
  * **But I say to you **- Translate this the same way you translated it in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:31|5:32]].
  * **swear not … by heaven … the throne of God … by the earth … the footstool for his feet … by Jerusalem … the city of the great King**  - This metaphor from Isaiah [[:en:bible:notes:isa:66:01|66:1]] and Psalm [[:en:bible:notes:psa:148:001|48:2]] is of God as "the great King." Just as none of Jesus' hearers would think of treating an earthly king's beautiful throne, or even his lowly footstool or the city where he lives, as his own to make his own words strong, so they should not use heaven or earth or Jerusalem to back up their words. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor|Metaphor]].)
  * **swear not at all**  - If your language has a plural form for commands, use it here. "You will not swear a false oath" (verse 33) allows the hearer to swear but forbids false oaths. "Swear not at all" here forbids all oaths.
  * **swear not**  - Translate this the same way you translated it in verse 33.
