\v 34 But \add now listen to what\add* I say to you: Never promise to do anything and then ask a superior being to affirm\add that what you are saying will happen. For example, do\add* not \add promise that you will give something and then ask spiritual beings in\add* heaven \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add to affirm that you will do it\add*, because heaven is where God \add sits\add* on his throne \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add to rule over people\add*.
\v 35 \add Also, do\add* not \add promise that you will give something and then ask spiritual beings\add* on earth \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add to affirm that you will do it\add*, because the earth is where God rests his feet \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add Also, do\add* not \add promise that you will do something and ask religious authorities\add* in Jerusalem \add to affirm that you will do it\add*, because Jerusalem is the city where \add God\add*, the great King \add rules\add*.

\v 33 "You have also heard your religious teachers say that God said to our ancestors, ‘Make sure that you do what you have called upon the Lord to witness that you would do!’
\v 34 But now listen to what I say to you: Never promise to do anything and then ask someone greater than yourself to witness it. For example, do not promise that you will do something and then ask anyone in heaven to witness it, because heaven is where God sits on his throne as king.
\v 35 And do not promise that you will do something as surely as the earth exists; do not do this, because the earth is where God rests his feet. Moreover, do not promise that you will do something as surely as the city of Jerusalem exists, because Jerusalem is the city that especially belongs to God.

\v 33 Again, you have heard that it was said to those in ancient times, 'You will not swear a false oath, but you will carry out your oaths to the Lord.'
\v 34 But I say to you, swear not at all, neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God;
\v 35 nor by the earth, for it is the footstool for his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
