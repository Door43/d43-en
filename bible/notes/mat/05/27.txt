===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to teach his disciples.

Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. "You have heard" and "I say to you" are plural. "You will not" is singular, but you may have to translate it as plural.

  * **Do not commit adultery** - This means you should have sex with your wife or husband but not with anyone else.
  * **commit** - This word means acting out or doing something.
  * **But I say** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:21|5:22]].
  * **everyone who looks on a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart** - This metaphor indicates that a man who lusts after a woman is as guilty of adultery as a man who actually commits the act of adultery. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and  [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **looks on a woman to lust** - "desires in the mind to have another woman"
