===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to teach about how he has come to fulfill the Old Testament law. Here he begins to speak about adultery and lust.
  * **General Information:** - Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. The word "you" in "You have heard" and "I say to you" is plural. The command "Do not commit adultery" is addressed to singular "you," but you may have to translate it as plural "you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **that it was said** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "that God said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **commit** - This word means acting out or doing something.
  * **But I say** - The "I" is emphatic. This indicates that what Jesus says is equally important to the original commands from God. Try to translate this phrase in a way that shows that emphasis. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:21|5:22]].
  * **everyone who looks on a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart** - This metaphor indicates that a man who lusts after a woman is as guilty of adultery as a man who actually commits the act of adultery. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to lust after her** - "and lusts after her" or "and desires to sleep with her"
  * **in his heart** - Here "heart" refers to a person's thoughts. AT: "in his mind" or "in his thoughts" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
