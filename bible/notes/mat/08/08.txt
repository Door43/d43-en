\v 8 But the officer said \add to him\add*, "Lord\f + \ft Or: Sir \f*, \add do not bother to go. I am a non-Jew\add*, so I am not worthy for you, \add a Jew\add*, to come into my house \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add and associate with me\add*. Instead, \add just\add* say \add that\add* my servant\add is healed\add*, and he will be healed.
\v 9 I \add believe this\add* because, as for me, I am a man under the authority of others, and I also have soldiers under my authority. When I say to one of them 'Go!' he goes. When I say to another 'Come!' he comes. When I say to my slave, 'Do this!' he does it. \add And I believe that you speak with a similar kind of authority\add*."
\v 10 When Jesus heard this, he marveled. He said to the crowd that was walking with him, "Listen to this: I have never before found anyone who has as firm a faith \add in me as this non-Jewish man has\add*. Not even in Israel, \add where I would expect people to believe in me\add*, have I found anyone who has the kind of faith in me that he has!

\v 8 But the officer said to him, "Lord, do not bother to go. I am not worthy for you to come into my house and associate with me. Instead, just say that my servant is healed, and he will be healed.
\v 9 It is the same way with me. I am a soldier; I have to obey my commanders, and I also have soldiers that I command. When I say to one of them 'Go!' he goes. When I say to another 'Come!' he comes. When I say to my slave, 'Do this!' he does it. You also speak with a similar kind of authority."
\v 10 When Jesus heard this, he marveled. He said to the crowd that was walking with him, "Listen to this: I have never before found anyone who trusts in me as much this non-Jewish man. Not even in Israel, where I would expect people to believe in me, have I found anyone who trusts as much in me!

\v 8 The centurion answered and said, "Lord, I am not worthy that you should come under my roof; but only say the word and my servant will be healed.
\v 9 For I also am a man under authority; I have soldiers under me. I say to this one, 'Go!' and he goes; to
another, 'Come!' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."
\v 10 When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who were following him, "Truly I say to you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel."
