\v 8 But the officer said \add to him\add*, "Lord\f + \ft Or: Sir \f*, \add do not bother to go. I am a non-Jew\add*, so I am not worthy for you, \add a Jew\add*, to come into my house \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add and associate with me\add*. Instead, \add just\add* say \add that\add* my servant\add is healed\add*, and he will be healed.
\v 9 I \add believe this\add* because, as for me, I am a man under the authority of others, and I also have soldiers under my authority. When I say to one of them 'Go!' he goes. When I say to another 'Come!' he comes. When I say to my slave, 'Do this!' he does it. \add And I believe that you speak with a similar kind of authority\add*."
\v 10 When Jesus heard this, he marveled. He said to the crowd that was walking with him, "Listen to this: I have never before found anyone who has as firm a faith \add in me as this non-Jewish man has\add*. Not even in Israel, \add where I would expect people to believe in me\add*, have I found anyone who has the kind of faith in me that he has!

\v 8 But the officer said to him, "I am not worthy for you to come into my house. Instead, just say that my servant is healed, and he will be healed.
\v 9 It is the same way with me. I am a soldier; I have to obey my commanders, and I also have soldiers that I command. When I say to one of them 'Go!' he goes. When I say to another 'Come!' he comes. When I say to my slave, 'Do this!' he does it."
\v 10 When Jesus heard this, he marveled. He said to the crowd that was walking with him, "Listen to this: I have never before found anyone who trusts in me as much this non-Jewish man. Not even in Israel, where I would expect people to believe in me, have I found anyone who trusts so much in me!

\v 8 The centurion answered and said, "Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, only say the word and my servant will be healed.
\v 9 For I also am a man who is placed under authority, and I have soldiers under me. I say to this one, 'Go,' and he goes, and to another one, 'Come,' and he comes, and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."
\v 10 When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those who were following him, "Truly I say to you, I have not found anyone with such faith in Israel.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **under my roof** - This is an idiom that refers to inside the house. AT: "into my house" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **say the word** - Here "word" represents a command. AT: "give the command" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **will be healed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "will become well" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **who is placed under authority** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "who is under the authority of someone else" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **under authority ... under me** - To be "under" someone means to be less important and to obey the commands of someone more important. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]) 
  * **soldiers** - "skilled fighters"
  * **Truly I say to you** - "I tell you the truth." This phrase adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.
  * **I have not found anyone with such faith in Israel** - Jesus' hearers would have thought that the Jews in Israel, who claim to be children of God, would have greater faith than anyone. Jesus is saying they are wrong and that the centurion's faith was greater. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
