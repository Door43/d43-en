\v 8 But the officer said \add to him\add*, "Lord\f + \ft Or: Sir \f*, \add do not bother to go. I am a non-Jew\add*, so I am not worthy for you, \add a Jew\add*, to come into my house \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add and associate with me\add*. Instead, \add just\add* say \add that\add* my servant\add is healed\add*, and he will be healed.
\v 9 I \add believe this\add* because, as for me, I am a man under the authority of others, and I also have soldiers under my authority. When I say to one of them 'Go!' he goes. When I say to another 'Come!' he comes. When I say to my slave, 'Do this!' he does it. \add And I believe that you speak with a similar kind of authority\add*."
\v 10 When Jesus heard this, he marveled. He said to the crowd that was walking with him, "Listen to this: I have never before found anyone who has as firm a faith \add in me as this non-Jewish man has\add*. Not even in Israel, \add where I would expect people to believe in me\add*, have I found anyone who has the kind of faith in me that he has!

\v 8 But the officer said to him, "Lord, do not bother to go. I am not worthy for you to come into my house and associate with me. Instead, just say that my servant is healed, and he will be healed.
\v 9 It is the same way with me. I am a soldier; I have to obey my commanders, and I also have soldiers that I command. When I say to one of them 'Go!' he goes. When I say to another 'Come!' he comes. When I say to my slave, 'Do this!' he does it. You also speak with a similar kind of authority."
\v 10 When Jesus heard this, he marveled. He said to the crowd that was walking with him, "Listen to this: I have never before found anyone who trusts in me as much this non-Jewish man. Not even in Israel, where I would expect people to believe in me, have I found anyone who trusts as much in me!

\v 8 The centurion answered and said, "Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof; but only say the word and my servant will be healed.
\v 9 For I also am a man who is placed under authority and I have soldiers under me. I say to this one, 'Go,' and he goes, and to 
another one, 'Come,' and he comes, and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."
\v 10 When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those who were following him, "Truly I say to you, not even in Israel have I found anyone with so much faith."

===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of Jesus' healing several people.

  * **you should enter under my roof**  - This metonym means "you should enter my home." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:Metonymy]])
  * **say the word**  - "give the command"
  * **soldiers**  - "skilled fighters"
  * **not even in Israel have I found anyone with so much faith ** - Jesus' hearers would have thought that the Jews in Israel, who claim to be children of God, would have greater faith than anyone. Jesus is saying they are wrong and that the centurion's faith was greater.
