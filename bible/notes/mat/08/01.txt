===== Translation Notes: =====

This begins an account of Jesus miraculously healing several people.

  * **When Jesus had come down from the hill, large crowds followed him.**  - Alternative translation: “After Jesus came down from the hill, a large crowd followed him.” The crowd may have included both people who had been with him on the mountain and people who had not been with him.
  * **Behold**  - The word “behold” alerts us to a new person in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this.
  * **a leper**  - “a man who had leprosy” or “a man who had a skin disease” (UDB)
  * **if you are willing**  - Alternative translation: “if you want to” or “if you desire”. The leper knew that Jesus had the power to heal him, but he did not know if Jesus would want to touch him.
  * **you can make me clean**  - Alternative translations: “you can heal me” or “please heal me” (UDB).
  * **Immediately**  - “Right away”
  * **he was cleansed of his leprosy**  - The result of Jesus saying “Be clean” was that the man was healed. Alternative translation: “he was well” or “the leprosy left him” or “the leprosy ended.”
