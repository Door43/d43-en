===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This is the beginning of a new part of the story that contains several accounts of Jesus healing people. This theme continues through [[:en:bible:notes:mat:09:35|9:35]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_newevent]])

  * **When Jesus had come down from the hill, large crowds followed him** - "After Jesus came down from the hill, a large crowd followed him." The crowd may have included both people who had been with him on the mountain and people who had not been with him.
  * **Behold** - The word "behold" alerts us to a new person in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this.
  * **a leper** - "a man who had leprosy" or "a man who had a skin disease" 
  * **bowed before him** - This is a sign of humble respect before Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **if you are willing** - "if you want to" or "if you desire." The leper knew that Jesus had the power to heal him, but he did not know if Jesus would want to touch him.
  * **you can make me clean** - Here "clean" means to be healed and to be able to live in the community again. AT: "you can heal me" or "please heal me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Be clean** - By saying this, Jesus healed the man. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_imperative]])
  * **Immediately** - "Right away"
  * **he was cleansed of his leprosy** - The result of Jesus saying "Be clean" was that the man was healed. This can be stated in active form. AT: "he was well" or "the leprosy left him" or "the leprosy ended" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
