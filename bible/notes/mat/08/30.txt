\v 30 Now a herd of many pigs was there feeding, not too far away from them.
\v 31 The demons kept imploring Jesus and saying, "If you cast us out, send us away into that herd of pigs."
\v 32 Jesus said to them, "Go!" The demons came out and went into the pigs; and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep hill into the sea and perished in the water.

===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of Jesus' healing two men with demons.

  * **Now** - This shows that the author will tell the reader information he needs before the story can continue. The pigs had been there before Jesus arrived. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_events]])
  * **If you cast us out** - This can also mean "Since you are going to cast us out."
  * **us** - exclusive (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **them ** - the demons inside the man
  * **The demons came out and went into the pigs** - "The demons left the man and entered the animals."
  * **Behold**  - The word "behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.
  * **rushed down the steep hill** - "ran quickly down the steep slope"
  * **perished in the water** - "drowned"
