===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - This concludes the account of Jesus healing two demon-possessed men.

  * **tending the pigs** - "taking care of the pigs"
  * **what had happened to the men who had been possessed by demons** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "what Jesus did to help the men whom demons had controlled" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Behold** - This marks the beginning of another event in the larger story. It may involve different people than the previous events. Your language may have a way of showing this.
  * **all the city** - The word "city" is a metonym for the people of the city. The word "all" is probably an exaggeration to emphasize how very many people came out. Not necessarily every person came out. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **their region** - "their area"
