===== Translation Notes: =====

This concludes the account of Jesus healing two men with demons.

  * **The men who had been tending the pigs**  - "the men who took care of the pigs"
  * **what had happened to the men who were controlled by demons **- what Jesus had done to the demon-controlled men.
  * **Behold**  - This marks the beginning of another event in the larger story. It may involve different people than the previous events. Your language may have a way of doing this.
  * **all the city** - This would mean a many or most of the people, not necessarily every person. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **region **- "the city and the land near it"
