\v 28 When Jesus had come to the other side and to the country of the Gadarenes, two men who were controlled by demons  met him; they were coming out of the tombs and were very violent, so that no traveler could pass that way. 
\v 29 Behold, they cried out and said, "What do we have to do with you, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the set time?"

===== Translation Notes: =====

This begins an account of Jesus' healing two men with demons.

  * **to the other side**  - "to the other side of the Sea of Galilee"
  * **country of the Gadarenes **- The Gadarenes were named for the town of Gadara. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:translatenames|]])
  * **they…were very violent, so that no traveler could pass that way**  - The demons that held these two men were so dangerous that no one could go through that area.
  * **What do we have to do with you, Son of God?**  - This first rhetorical question is hostile (see UDB, [[en:ta:translate:RhetoricalQuestion]]).
  * **Son of God** - The demons use this title to show that Jesus is not welcome because of who he is.
  * **Have you come here to torment us before the set time?** - This second rhetorical question is also hostile and means "You should not disobey God by punishing us before the specific time God has set when he will punish us." (See: [[en:ta:translate:RhetoricalQuestion]])
