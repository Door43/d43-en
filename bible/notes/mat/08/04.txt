\v 4 Then Jesus said to him, "Go and show yourself to a nearby priest so that he can examine you and verify that you are no longer sick. Then, after he tells the local people, they will know that you no longer have leprosy, and you will be able to associate with them again. Make sure that now you do not report about my healing you to anyone other than the priest. Then go to the temple in Jerusalem and give the priest the offering that Moses commanded that people who have been healed from this sickness should offer as a sacrifice to God."
