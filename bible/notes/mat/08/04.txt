\v 4 Then Jesus said to him, "Go and show yourself to a nearby priest so that he can examine you and verify that you are no longer sick. Then, after he tells the local people, they will know that you no longer have leprosy, and you will be able to associate with them again. Make sure that now you do not report about my healing you to anyone other than the priest. Then go to the temple in Jerusalem and give the priest the offering that Moses commanded that people who have been healed from this sickness should offer as a sacrifice to God."

===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of Jesus' healing the man who had leprosy.

  * **him**  - the man who had had leprosy
  * **say nothing to any man**  - Though the man would have to talk to the priest when he gave the sacrifice (see UDB), Jesus wanted the man to say nothing to anyone else about what had happened. This can be translated as "do not say anything to anyone" or "do not tell anyone that I healed you." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:hyperbole|Hyperbole]])
  * **show yourself to the priest**  - Jewish law required that the person show his healed skin to the priest, who would allow him or her to be with other people.
  * **offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them**  - The law of Moses required that someone healed of leprosy give a thanksgiving offering to the priest. When the priest accepted the gift, people would know that the man had been healed.
  * **to them**  - This can possibly refer to 10 the priests or 2) all the people or 3) the critics of Jesus. If possible, use a pronoun that could refer to any of these groups. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:ambiguity]])
