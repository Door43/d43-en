===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Here the scene shifts to the account of Jesus calming a storm as he and his disciples cross the Sea of Galilee.

  * **entered a boat** - "got onto a boat"
  * **his disciples followed him** - Try to use the same words for "disciple" and "follow" that you used in ([[:en:bible:notes:mat:08:21|8:21-22]]).
  * **Behold** - This marks the beginning of another event in the larger story. Your language may have a way of showing this. AT: "Suddenly" or "Without warning"
  * **there arose a great storm on the sea** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "a powerful storm arose on the sea" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **so that the boat was covered with the waves** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "so that the waves covered the boat" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **woke him up, saying, "Save us** - Possible meanings are 1) they first woke Jesus and then they said, "Save us" or 2) as they were waking Jesus up, they were saying "Save us."
  * **us ... we** - If you need to translate these words as inclusive or exclusive, then inclusive is best. The disciples probably meant they wanted Jesus to save the disciples and himself from drowning. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
  * **we are about to die** - "we are going to die"
