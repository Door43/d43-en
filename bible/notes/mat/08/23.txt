===== Translation Notes: =====

This begins an account of Jesus calming a storm.

  * **entered a boat **- "Jesus got onto a boat"
  * **his disciples followed him**  - Try to use the same words for "disciple" and "follow" that you used in ([[:en:bible:notes:mat:08:21|8:21]]) and ([[:en:bible:notes:mat:08:21|8:22]]).
  * **Behold** - This marks the beginning of another event in the larger story. It may involve different people than the previous events. Your language may have a way of doing this.
  * **there arose a great storm on the sea**  - "a great storm arose on the sea."
  * **so that the boat was covered with the waves**  - "so that the waves covered the boat." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **woke him up, saying, "Save us"**  - They did not wake him up with the words "Save us." They first "woke him up" and then "said, 'Save us.'"
  * **we are about to die**  - "we are going to die"
