\v 27 The men were amazed, and they said to each other, "This man is certainly an extraordinary person! All things are under his control! Even the winds and the waves obey him!"

===== Translation Notes: =====

This concludes the account of Jesus calming a storm.

  * **them **  - the disciples
  * **you ... you** - plural
  * **Why are you afraid ...?**  - Jesus was rebuking the disciples with this rhetorical question. It means "You should not be afraid" (see UDB) or "There is nothing for you to be afraid of." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **you of little faith**  - "You" is plural. Translate this the same way you translated the same words in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:06:30|6:30]].
  * **What sort of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?** - This rhetorical question shows that the disciples were surprised. This can be translated as "Even the winds and the sea obey him! What sort of man is this?" or "This man is unlike any man we have ever seen! Even the wind and the waves obey him!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **even the winds and the sea obey him**  - For people or animals to obey or disobey is not surprising, but for wind and water to obey is very surprising. This personification describes the natural elements as able to hear and respond like people. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification|Personification]])
