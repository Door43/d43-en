\v 18 Now when Jesus saw the crowd around him, he gave instructions to leave for the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
\v 19 Then a scribe came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
\v 20 Jesus said to him, "Foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky 
have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus explains what he expects of his followers.

  * **he, him ** - These refer to Jesus in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:08:18|8:18]] and [[:en:bible:notes:mat:08:18|8:19]].
  * **he gave instructions**  - "he told them what to do"
  * **Then** - After Jesus "gave instructions" but before he could get into the boat (see UDB).
  * **wherever **  - "to any place"
  * **Foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests** - The animals in this merism represent a wide range of wild animals. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **Foxes**  - Foxes are animals like dogs that eat nesting birds and other small animals. If foxes are unknown in your area, use a general term for dog-like creatures or other furry animals. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **holes** - Foxes make holes in the ground to live in. Use the appropriate word for the place where the animal you use for "foxes" lives.
  * **nowhere to lay his head **  - "no place of his own to sleep" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom|Idiom]])
