\v 11 I tell you truly that many other non-Jewish people will believe in me also, and they will come from distant countries, including those far to the east and far to the west, and they will sit down to eat with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob when God will rule over everything completely.
\v 12 But the Jews who should have allowed God to rule over them--God will throw them into hell, where there is total darkness. There they will weep because of their suffering, and they will grind their teeth because they will have severe pain."
\v 13 Then Jesus said to the officer, "Go home. What you believed would happen, that I would heal your servant from a distance, will happen." Then the officer went home and found out that his servant had become well at the exact time that Jesus told him that he would heal him.

\v 11 I tell you, many will come from the east and the west, and will recline at table with Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.
\v 12 But the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness,  where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth."
\v 13 Jesus said to the centurion, "Depart! As you have believed,
so may it be done for you." And the servant was healed at that very hour.
