\v 11 I tell you truly that many other non-Jewish people will believe in me also, and they will come from distant countries, including those far to the east and far to the west, and they will sit down to feast with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob when God will rule from heaven over everything completely.
\v 12 But as for the Jews whom God intended to rule—he will throw them into hell, where there is total darkness. There they will weep because of their suffering, and they will grind their teeth because they will have severe pain."
\v 13 Then Jesus said to the officer, "Go home. What you believed will happen." Then the officer went home and found out that his servant had become well at the exact time that Jesus told him that he would heal him.

\v 11 I tell you, many will come from the east and the west, and they will recline at the table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.
\v 12 But the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth."
\v 13 Jesus said to the centurion, "Go! As you have believed, so may it be done for you." And the servant was healed at that very hour.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **you** - Here "you" is plural and refers to "those who were following him" in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:08:08|8:10]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **from the east and the west** - Using the opposites "east" and "west" is a way of saying "everywhere." AT: "from everywhere" or "from far away in every direction" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **recline at the table** - People in that culture would lie down beside the table while eating. This phrase indicates that all those at the table are family and close friends. The joy in the kingdom of God is frequently spoken of as if the people there were feasting. AT: "live as family and friends with" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **in the kingdom of heaven** - Here "kingdom of heaven" refers to God's rule as king. The phrase "kingdom of heaven" is used only in the book of Matthew. If possible, keep "heaven" in your translation. AT: "when our God in heaven shows that he is king" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the sons of the kingdom will be thrown** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will throw the sons of the kingdom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the sons of the kingdom** - The phrase "sons of" refers to those who belong to something, in this case the kingdom of God. There is also irony here because the "sons" will be thrown out while the strangers will be welcomed. AT: "those who should have allowed God to rule over them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **the outer darkness** - This expression refers to the eternal destiny of those who reject God. AT: "the dark place away from God" or "hell" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **weeping and grinding of teeth** - This represents extreme sadness and suffering.
  * **so may it be done for you** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "so I will do it for you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the servant was healed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Jesus healed the servant" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **at that very hour** - "at the exact time Jesus said he would heal the servant"
