===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 God also said to Isaiah,
\q These people have become unable to really listen to me;
\q They have become unable to really hear what I say.
\q It is as if they wanted to keep their eyes shut,
\q As if they did not really want to see anything,
\q As if they did not really want to hear anything.
\q They are like this so they will not think they must stop sinning;
\q They are like this so they will not think they need for me to save them.

\q
\v 15 For this people's heart has become dull,
\q And their ears are heavy of hearing,
\q And their eyes they have closed;
\q Lest they should perhaps perceive with their eyes,
\q Hear with their ears,
\q Understand with their heart,
\q And should turn again,
\q And I should heal them.'

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to tell a large crowd of people different parables that describe what the kingdom of God is like. He continues to repeat the words of Isaiah that began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:13:13|13:14]].

  * **this people's heart has become dull ** - "these people can no longer learn" (see UDB).
  * **their ears are heavy of hearing** - "they no longer desire to listen" (see UDB).
  * **their eyes they have closed** - "they have closed their eyes" or "they refuse to see"
  * **Lest they should perhaps perceive with their eyes, Hear with their ears, Understand with their heart, And should turn again ** - "So that they will not be able to see with their eyes, Hear with their ears, Understand with their heart, And as a result turn again."
  * **turn again** - "turn back" or "repent"
  * **And I should heal them** - "And have me heal them." Alternate translation: "And have me receive them again." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
