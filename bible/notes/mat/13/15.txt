\v 15 God also said to Isaiah,
\q These people have become unable to really listen to me;
\q They have become unable to really hear what I say.
\q It is as if they wanted to keep their eyes shut,
\q As if they did not really want to see anything,
\q As if they did not really want to hear anything.
\q They are like this so they will not think they must stop sinning;
\q They are like this so they will not think they need for me to save them.

\q
\v 15 'For this people’s heart has become dull,
\q And their ears are heavy of hearing,
\q And their eyes they have closed;
\q Lest they should perhaps perceive with their eyes,
\q Hear with their ears,
\q Understand with their heart,
\q And should turn again,
\q And I should heal them.'
