===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to tell a large crowd of people different parables that describe what the kingdom of God is like.

  * **fell among the thorn plants** - "fell where thorn plants would also grow"
  * **choked them** - "choked the new sprouts." Use the usual word for the way weeds prevent other plants from growing well.
  * **produced grain ** - "produced a crop" or "grew more seeds" or "gave fruit"
  * **He who has ears, let him listen**  - AT: "You who have ears to listen, listen."
  * **He who has ears**  - "Whoever can hear" or "Whoever hears me"
  * **let him listen**  - "let him listen well" or "let him pay attention to what I say"
