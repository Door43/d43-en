===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to tell a large crowd of people different parables that describe what the kingdom of God is like. These verses continue the parable of the weeds.

  * **the landowner**  - This is the same person who sowed good seed in his field.
  * **did you not sow good seed in your field?**  - "you sowed good seed in your field." The landowner probably had his servants plant the seeds (see UDB). (See: [[:en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Question]] and [en:ta:translate:metonymy|]]).
  * **He said to them**  - "The landowner said to the servants"
  * **Do you wish then for us**  - "Then, do you want us". The word "us" refers to the servants.
  * **gather them up**  - "pull the weeds up" to throw them away (See: [[en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit|]])
