Jesus went into a house with his disciples and continued to explain the parables about the kingdom of God.

  * **So will it be** - "It will be this way"
  * **end of the world** - "end of the age"
  * **come forth** - "come out" or "go out" or "come from heaven"
  * **throw them** - "throw the wicked"
  * **furnace of fire** - This can be translated “fiery furnace.” This is a metaphor for the fires of hell that uses the imagery of the Old Testament passage Daniel 3:6. (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]]) If the term “furnace” is not known, “oven” can be used.
  * **where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth**  - "where the wicked people will cry and grind their teeth"
