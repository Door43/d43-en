\v 10 The disciples approached Jesus later and asked him, "Why do you use parables when you speak to the crowd?"
\v 11 He answered, "God is revealing to you what he did not reveal before, about how he is going to show himself as king. But he has not revealed it to these other people.
\v 12 Those who think about what I say and understand it, God will enable them to understand more. But those who do not think carefully about what I say will forget even what they already know.

\v 10 The disciples came and said to Jesus, "Why do you talk to the crowd in parables?"
\v 11 Jesus answered and said to them, "You have been given the privilege of understanding mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it 
is not given.
\v 12 Because whoever has, to him will be given more, and he will have a great deal. But whoever has not, from him will be taken 
away even what he has.
