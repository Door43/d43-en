\v 34 All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables; and without parables he said nothing to them.
\v 35 This was in order that what had been said through the prophet might come true, when he said,
\q "I will open my mouth in parables;
\q I will say things that were hidden from the foundation of the world."

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to tell a large crowd of people different parables that describe what the kingdom of God is like.

  * **All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables; and without parables he said nothing to them** - The order "said...parables...parables...said" is meant to emphasize that he spoke to them in parables.
  * **All these things** - This refers to what Jesus taught beginning at [[:en:bible:notes:mat:13:01|13:1]].
  * **without parables he said nothing to them** - "he taught them nothing except by parables." Alternate translation: "everything he said to them he said in parables." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **what had been said through the prophet might come true, when he said **- This can be translated with an active verb: "he made come true what God told one of the prophets to write long ago" (UDB). (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **when he said** - "when the prophet said" 
  * **things that were hidden** - This can be translated with an active verb: "things that God has kept hidden".(See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **from the foundation of the world** - "since the beginning of the world" or "since God created the world."
