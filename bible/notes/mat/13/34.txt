\v 34 Jesus told the crowd parables to teach them all these things. When he spoke to them he habitually told stories like these.
\v 35 By doing that, he made come true what God told one of the prophets to write long ago.
\p I will speak in parables; I will tell parables to teach what I have kept secret since I created the world.

\v 34 All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables; and he said nothing to them without a parable. 
\v 35 This was in order that what had been said through the prophet might come true, when he said,
\q "I will open my mouth in parables.
\q I will say things that were hidden from the foundation of the world."
