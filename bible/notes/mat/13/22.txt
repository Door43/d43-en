\v 22 \add Some people are like the soil that had the roots of\add* thorny \add weeds\add* in it. They hear God's message, but they desire to be rich, \add so they\add* worry \add only\add* about \f + \ft metonymy, personification \f* material things. As a result, they \f + \ft personification \f* forget \add God's\add* message and they do not do [IDI] the things that God wants them to do.
\v 23 But \add some people are like the\add* good soil where \add some of the seeds\add* fell. \add Just like the plants that grew in this soil\add* produced a lot of grain, \add these people\add* hear my message and understand it. \add Some of them\add* do many things [IDI] \add that please God, some do\add* even more\add things that please God, and some do\add* very many \add things that please God\add*."

\v 22 Some people hear God's message,  but they desire to be rich, so they worry only about money and what they can buy with money. As a result, they forget God's message and they do not do the things that God wants them to do. These people are like the soil that had the roots of thorny weeds in it.
\v 23 But some people hear my message and understand it. Some of them do many things that please God, some do even more things that please God, and some do very many things that please God. They are like the good soil where some of the seeds fell."

\v 22 He who was sown among the thorn plants, this is he who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness 
of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.
\v 23 He who was sown on the good soil, this is he who hears the word and understands it; this is he who truly produces 
fruit and brings it forth, some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty."

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to tell a large crowd of people different parables that describe what the kingdom of God is like. Here he is explaining the parable he told in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:13:03|13:3]]-[[:en:bible:notes:mat:13:07|13:8]].

  * **He who was sown among the thorn plants...He who was sown on the good soil** - If a literal translation makes no sense, try to translate so the reader understands that Jesus is the sower, the message is the seed, and the hearer is the ground with thorn plants. Possible translation: "This is how it is with what was sown on the ground with thorn plants...This is how it is with what was sown on the good soil." (See: [[en:ta:translate:simile]] and [[en:ta:translate:ellipsis]])
  * **the word** - "the message"
  * **the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful** - This can be translated "as weeds prevent good plants from growing, the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches keep this person from becoming fruitful” (See: [[en:ta:translate:Metaphor]])
  * **cares of the world ** - “the things in this world that people worry about”
  * **becomes unfruitful ** - “becomes unproductive"
  * **this is he who truly produces fruit and brings it forth** - “these are the ones who are fruitful and productive” or “like healthy plants that produce good fruit, these people are productive.” (See: [[en:ta:translate:Metaphor]] and [[en:ta:translate:simile]])
