They caught all classes \add of fish, both useful and worthless fish\add*.
\v 48 When the net was full, the \add fishermen\add* pulled it up onto the shore. Then they sat there and put the useful \add fish\add* into buckets, and threw the worthless ones away.

\v 47  When God  shows himself as king, it is  like what certain fishermen did with the fish they caught in a lake with a large net. They caught all kinds of fish, both useful and worthless fish.
\v 48 When the net was full, the fishermen pulled it up onto the shore. Then they sat there and put the good fish into buckets, but they threw the worthless ones away.

\v 47 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea, and that gathered creatures of every kind.
\v 48 When it was filled, the fishermen drew it up on the beach. Then they sat down and gathered the good things into containers, but the worthless things 
they threw away.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus went into a house with his disciples and continued to explain the parables about the kingdom of God. In this parable, Jesus again uses a simile to teach his disciples what the kingdom of heaven is like. (See: Simile)

  * **the kingdom of heaven is like** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:13:24|13:24]]. The kingdom is not like the net, but the kingdom draws all kinds of people like a net catches all kinds of fish. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **like a net that was cast into the sea** - This can be translated with an active verb: "like a net that some fishermen cast into the sea."
  * **a net that was cast into the sea** - "a net that was thrown into the lake"
  * **gathered creatures of every kind** - "caught all kinds of fish"
  * **drew it up on the beach** - "pulled the net up onto the beach" or "pulled the net ashore"
  * **the good things** - "the good ones" 
  * **the worthless things **- "the bad fish" or "the inedible fish"
  * **threw away** - "did not keep"
