\v 36 Then Jesus left the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the
parable of the weeds of the field."
\v 37 Jesus answered and said, "He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.
\v 38 The field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil
one;
\v 39 and the enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the world, and the reapers are angels.
