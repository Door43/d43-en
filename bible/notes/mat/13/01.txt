===== Translation Notes: =====

In this chapter, Jesus sat in a boat near the beach and told a large crowd of people different parables that describe what the kingdom of God is like.

  * **On that day**  - These events happened on the same day as the previous chapter.
  * **out of the house**  - It is not mentioned at whose house Jesus was staying.
  * **got into a boat**  - This was probably an open wooden fishing boat with a sail.
