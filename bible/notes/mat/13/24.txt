\v 24 Jesus also told the crowd another parable, \add by which he tried to explain that although\add* God [MTY\f + \ft Or: EUP \f*] is a king, \add he will not immediately judge and punish all the wicked people\add*. Jesus said, "\add God\add* is like a landowner \add who sent his servants\add* to sow good \add wheat\add* seed in his field.
\v 25 While those servants were sleeping \add and not watching the field\add*, an enemy of the landowner came and scattered weed \add seeds\add* in the midst of the wheat. Then he left.

\v 24 Jesus also told the crowd another parable. He said, "When God begins to show himself as king, it will be like a landowner who sent his servants to sow good wheat seed in his field.
\v 25 While those servants were sleeping and not guarding the field, an enemy of the landowner came and scattered weed seeds in the midst of the wheat. Then he left.
\v 26 After the seeds sprouted and the green plants grew, the heads of grain began to form. But the weeds also grew.

\v 24 Jesus presented another parable to them; he said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his
field.
\v 25 But while people slept, his enemy came and also sowed weeds among the wheat, and then went away.
\v 26 When the blades sprouted and then produced their crop, then the weeds appeared also.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to tell a large crowd of people different parables that describe what the kingdom of God is like.

  * **Jesus presented another parable to them**  - Jesus told another parable to the crowd of people.
  * **The kingdom of heaven is like a man**  - The translation should not equate the kingdom of heaven to a man, but rather the kingdom of heaven is like the situation described in the parable (see UDB).
  * **good seed** - "good food seeds" or "good grain seeds." The audience probably thought that Jesus was talking about wheat. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **his enemy came **  - "his enemy came to the field."
  * **weeds**  - This can be translated "bad seed" or "weed seeds." These weeds look like food plants when they are young, but the grain is poison.
  * **When the blades sprouted**  - "when the wheat seeds sprouted" or "when the plants came up"
  * **brought forth their crop**  - "produced grain" or "produced the wheat crop"
  * **then the weeds appeared also **  - Alternate translation: "then people could see that there were weeds in the field also."
