===== TFT: =====

<usfm> \v 13 That is why I use parables when I speak to people, because although they see \add what I do\add*, they do not perceive \add what it means\add*, and although they hear \add what I say\add*, they do not really understand \add what it means\add*. \v 14 What these people do completely fulfills what \add God told\add* the prophet Isaiah \add to say long ago to the people who did not\add* try to understand what he said, \p You will hear \add what I say\add*, but you will not understand it. You will keep seeing \add what I do\add*, but you will not understand \add what it means\add* \f + \ft doublet \f*. \p </usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 13 That is why I use parables when I speak to people, because although they see what I do, they do not understand what it means, and although they hear what I say, they do not really learn what it means. \v 14 What these people do completely fulfills what God told the prophet Isaiah to say long ago, \q \p You will hear what I say, but you will not understand it. \q You will see what I do, but you will not learn what it means.

\p </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 13 So I talk to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, neither do they understand. \v 14 To them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, that which says, \q 'While hearing you will hear, but you will in no way understand; \q While seeing you will see, but you will in no way perceive. </usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to sit in a boat near the beach and tell a large crowd of people different parables that describe what the kingdom of God is like.

  * **I talk to them**  - "Them" here is referring to the people in the crowd throughout these two verses.
  * **because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear**  - Jesus uses this doublet to tell the disciples that the crowd refuses to understand. (See: Doublet)
  * **seeing they do not see **-This can be translated “though they see, they do not perceive.” If the verbs require an object, it could be translated as “though they see things, they do not understand them” or “though they see things happen, they do not understand what they mean.” (See: the section about Verbs and Objects on Verbs)
  * **hearing they do not hear, neither do they understand **- This can be translated “though they hear, they do not understand.” If the verbs require an object, it could be translated as “though they hear instruction, they do not understand the truth.”
  * **While hearing you will hear, but you will in no way understand; While seeing you will see, but you will in no way perceive **- This begins a quote from the prophet Isaiah about the unbelieving people of Isaiah's day. Jesus is using this quote to describe the crowd that was listening to Him. This is a doublet. (See Doublet.)
  * **While hearing you will hear, but you will in no way understand**  - This can be translated "You will hear, but you will not understand." If the verbs require an object, it could be translated as "You will hear things, but you will not understand them."
  * **While seeing you will see, but you will in no way perceive**  - This can be translated "You will see, but you will not perceive." If the verbs require an object, it could be translated as "You will see things, but you will not perceive them."
