\v 13 That is why I use parables when I speak to people, because although they see \add what I do\add*, they do not perceive \add what it means\add*, and although they hear \add what I say\add*, they do not really understand \add what it means\add*.
\v 14 What these people do completely fulfills what \add God told\add* the prophet Isaiah \add to say long ago to the people who did not\add* try to understand what he said, \p You will hear \add what I say\add*, but you will not understand it. You will keep seeing \add what I do\add*, but you will not understand \add what it means\add* \f + \ft doublet \f*. \p

\v 14 What these people do completely fulfills what God told the prophet Isaiah to say long ago,
\q 
\p You will hear what I say, but you will not understand it.

\v 13 So I talk to them in parables, because although they see, they do not really see, and although they hear, they do not really hear, neither do they understand.
\v 14 To them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, that which says, 
\q 'While hearing you will hear, but you will in no way understand;
\q While seeing you will see, but you will in no way perceive.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to tell a large crowd of people different parables that describe what the kingdom of God is like.

  * **I talk to them** - The pronoun"them" here is referring to the people in the crowd throughout these two verses.
  * **because although they see, they do not really see, and although they hear, they do not really hear** - Jesus uses this parallelism to tell the disciples that the crowd refuses to understand. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **although they see, they do not really see** - "though they see, they do not perceive." If the verbs require an object, this could be translated as "though they see things, they do not understand them" or "though they see things happen, they do not understand what they mean." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_verbs]])
  * **although they hear, they do not really hear, neither do they understand** - "though they hear, they do not understand." If the verbs require an object, it could be translated as "though they hear instruction, they do not understand the truth."
  * **While hearing you will hear, but you will in no way understand; While seeing you will see, but you will in no way perceive** - This begins a quote from the prophet Isaiah about the unbelieving people of Isaiah's day. Jesus is using this quote to describe the crowd that was listening to Him. This is another parallelism. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **While hearing you will hear, but you will in no way understand** - This can be translated "You will hear, but you will not understand." If the verbs require an object, it could be translated as "You will hear things, but you will not understand them."
  * **While seeing you will see, but you will in no way perceive** - "You will see, but you will not perceive." If the verbs require an object, it could be translated as "You will see things, but you will not perceive them."
