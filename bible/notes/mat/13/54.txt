\v 54 Then they went to the town of Nazareth, the hometown of Jesus. On the Sabbath he began to teach the people in the synagogue. The result was that the people there were astonished. But some said, "This man is just an ordinary person like us! So how is it that he knows so much and understands so much? And how is it that he is able to do such miracles?
\v 55 He is just the son of the carpenter, is he not? His mother is Mary, and his younger brothers are James, Joseph, Simon and Judas!
\v 56 And his sisters also live here in our town. So how is he able to do all these miracles?"

\v 54 Then Jesus entered his own region and taught the people in their synagogue, with the result that they were astonished and said, "Where does this man get his wisdom and these miracles from?
\v 55 Is not this man the carpenter's son? Is not his mother Mary? And his brothers, are they not James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
\v 56 And his sisters, are they not all among us? So where does this man get all these things from?"

===== Translation Notes: =====

This is the account of how the people of Jesus' home town rejected him when he taught in their synagogue.

  * **his own region** - "his hometown" (see UDB)
  * **in their synagogue** - The pronoun "their" is referring to the people of the region.
  * **they were astonished** - "they were amazed"
  * **and these miracles** - "and where does he get the power to do these miracles" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **the carpenter's son** - A carpenter is someone who makes things with wood or stone. If "carpenter" is not known, "builder" can be used.
