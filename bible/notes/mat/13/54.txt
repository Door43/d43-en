\v 54 Then they went to the town of Nazareth, the hometown of Jesus. On the Sabbath he began to teach the people in the synagogue. The result was that the people there were astonished. But some said, “This man is just an ordinary person like us! So how is it that he knows so much and understands so much? And how is it that he is able to do such miracles?
\v 55 He is just the son of the carpenter, isn't he? His mother is Mary, and his younger brothers are James, Joseph, Simon and Judas!
\v 56 And his sisters also live here in our town. So how is he able to do all these miracles?"

\v 55 Is not this man the carpenter’s son? Is not his mother Mary? And his brothers, are they not James, Joseph, Simon, and
Judas?
\v 56 And his sisters, are they not all among us? So where does this man get all these things from?"

===== Translation Notes: =====

This is the account of how the people of Jesus' home town rejected him when he taught in their synagogue.

  * **his own region **- This can be translated "his hometown" (see UDB).
  * **In their synagogue**  - The pronoun "their" is referring to the people of the region.
  * **astonished **- "amazed" or "astounded" or "overwhelmed"
  * **these miracles **- "this power" or "these miraculous powers" or "these mighty works" (see UDB).
  * **Is not this man the carpenter's son? Is not his mother Mary? And his brothers, are they not James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas? And his sisters, are they not all among us? **- These are all rhetorical questions about the identity of Jesus that would expect a "yes" answer. They can be rewritten if necessary as in the UDB. (See: Rhetorical Question**)**
  * **carpenter **- A carpenter is someone who makes or builds things with wood. The Greek word can also mean someone who works with stone. If "carpenter" is not known, "builder" can be used.
  * **all these things **- "All these things" refers to the wisdom and power that Jesus displayed as he taught the people.
