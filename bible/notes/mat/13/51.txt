\v 52 "Yes, we understand them." Then he said, "Because you understand all these parables, you will understand the following parable: You, along with all others, will teach people what you heard me say about how God wishes to rule over people.

\v 51 Have you understood all these things?" The disciples said to him, "Yes."
\v 52 Then Jesus said to them, "Therefore every scribe who has become a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like a man
who is the owner of a house, who withdraws old and new things from his treasure."

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus went into a house with his disciples and continued to explain the parables about the kingdom of God.

  * **"Have you understood all these things?" The disciples said to him, "Yes."** - If necessary, this can be written as an indirect quotation such as "Jesus asked them if they had understood all this, and they said they had." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **has become a disciple to** - "has learned about"
  * **treasure** - A treasure is a very valuable and precious thing or a collection of things. Here it may refer to the place where these things are stored, the "treasury" or "storeroom."
