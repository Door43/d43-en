\v 40 The weeds are gathered and burned. \f + \ft Or:The reapers gather the weeds. Then they burn them. \f* That represents \add the judging of people, which God will do\add* when the world will end. \add It will be like this\add*:
\v 41 I, the one who came from heaven, will send my angels and they will gather \add from everywhere the people\add* who cause others to quit believing in me \f + \ft metaphor \f* and all those who disobey \add God's\add* commands.
\v 42 They will throw those people into the fires of\add hell\add*. There they will weep and grind their teeth \add because of the great pain that they are suffering\add*.
\v 43 \add God's\add* brightness will shine \add on\add* the people who have lived as he wants them to. It will shine \add on them as brightly\add* as the sun \add shines\add*.

\v 40 The weeds are gathered and burned. That represents what will happen when God judges all people, when the world will end. It will be like this:
\v 41 I, the Son of Man, will send my angels, and they will gather from among all those whom I have begun to rule the people who cause others to stop believing in me and all those who sin in other ways as well.
\v 42 The angels will throw those people into the fires of hell. There those people will weep and grind their teeth because of the great pain that they are suffering.
\v 43 However, God's brightness will shine on the people who have lived as he wants them to. It will shine on them as brightly as the sun shines. It will shine on them because God, their Father, will rule over them. If you want to understand this, you should think carefully about what I have just said."

\v 40 Therefore, as the weeds are gathered up and burned with fire, so will it be at the end of the world.
\v 41 The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all the things that cause sin, and
those who commit iniquity,
\v 42 and they will throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.
\v 43 Then will the righteous people shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him listen.
