===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 40 The weeds are gathered and burned. That represents what will happen when God judges all people, when the world will end. It will be like this: \v 41 I, the Son of Man, will send my angels, and they will gather from among all those whom I have begun to rule the people who cause others to stop believing in me and all those who sin in other ways as well. \v 42 The angels will throw those people into the fires of hell. There those people will weep and grind their teeth because of the great pain that they are suffering. \v 43 However, God's brightness will shine on the people who have lived as he wants them to. It will shine on them as brightly as the sun shines. It will shine on them because God, their Father, will rule over them. If you want to understand this, you should think carefully about what I have just said."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 40 Therefore, as the weeds are gathered up and burned with fire, so will it be at the end of the world. \v 41 The Son of Man will send forth his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all the things that cause sin, and those who commit iniquity, \v 42 and they will throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth. \v 43 Then will the righteous people shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him listen. </usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus went into a house with his disciples and continued to explain the parables about the kingdom of God.

  * **Therefore, as the weeds are gathered up and burned with fire**  - This can be translated with active verbs: "Therefore, as people gather up weeds and burn them in the fire." (See: Active or Passive)
  * **end of the world**  - "end of the age"
  * **The Son of Man will send forth his angels **- Jesus is here speaking of himself. This can be translated "I, the Son of Man, will send forth my angels."
  * **those who commit iniquity**  - "those who do lawlessness" or "evil people"
  * **furnace of fire **- This can be translated "fiery furnace." This is a metaphor for the fires of hell that uses the imagery of the Old Testament passage Daniel 3:6. (See: Metaphor) If the term "furnace" is not known, "oven" can be used.
  * **shine forth like the sun**  - means they will shine very brightly or gloriously. (See: Simile)
  * **He who has ears, let him listen**- This metonymy is relating having ears and listening to gaining understanding or knowledge. (See: Metonymy) “He” and “him” are general pronouns addressed to the hearer (see UDB). It may be more natural in some languages to use the second person: “You who have ears to hear, listen.” (See: First, Second or Third Person)
  * **He who has ears to hear **- “Whoever can hear” or “Whoever hears me”
  * **let him listen **- “let him listen well” or “let him pay attention to what I say”
