\v 16 But as for you, God has made you able because you realize what I have done and
because you understand what I say.
\v 17 Note this: Many prophets and righteous people who lived long ago longed to see what you are seeing me do, but they did not see it. They longed to hear the things that you have been hearing me say, but they did not hear what you hear me say."

\v 16 But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.
\v 17 Truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things that you see, and did not see them. They desired to hear the things that you hear, and did not hear them.
