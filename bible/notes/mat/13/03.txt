\v 3 He taught them using many parables. He said, "Listen! A man went out to his field to sow seeds.
\v 4 As he was scattering the seeds over the soil, some of the seeds fell on the path. But some birds came and ate those seeds.
\v 5 Other seeds fell on ground where there was not much soil on top of the rock. Those seeds sprouted very soon, because the sun quickly warmed the shallow soil.
\v 6 But when the young plants came up, they became too hot in the sunlight, and they dried up because they did not have deep roots.

\v 3 Then Jesus said many things to them in parables. He said, "Behold, a sower went out to sow.
\v 4 As he sowed, some seeds fell beside the road, and the birds came and devoured them.
\v 5 Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil. Immediately they sprang up, because the soil had no depth.
\v 6 But when the sun had risen, they were scorched because they had no root, and they withered away.
