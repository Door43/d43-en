Then some birds came and ate those seeds. \v 5 Other \add seeds\add* fell on ground where there was not much soil \add on top of the\add* rock. Those seeds sprouted very soon, \add because the sun quickly warmed\add* the shallow soil. \v 6 But when \add the young plants came up\add*, they were scorched by the sun, and they withered because they did not have \add deep\add* roots. </usfm>

<usfm> \v 3 He taught them using many parables. He said, "Listen! A man went out to his field to sow seeds. \v 4 As he was scattering the seeds over the soil, some of the seeds fell on the path. But some birds came and ate those seeds. \v 5 Other seeds fell on ground where there was not much soil on top of the rock. Those seeds sprouted very soon, because the sun quickly warmed the shallow soil. \v 6 But when the young plants came up, they became too hot in the sunlight, and they dried up because they did not have deep roots. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 3 Then Jesus said many things to them in parables. He said, "See, a sower went forth to sow. \v 4 As he sowed, some seeds fell on the roadside, and birds came and devoured them. \v 5 Other seeds fell on rocky places, where they had little earth; they sprouted immediately, because they had no deep earth. \v 6 But when the sun had risen, they were scorched; because they had no root, they withered away. </usfm>
