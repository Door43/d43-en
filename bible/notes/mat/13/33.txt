===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus describes the kingdom of heaven by telling a parable about the effect that yeast has on flour. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]])

  * **The kingdom of heaven is like yeast** - The kingdom is not like the yeast, but the spread of the kingdom is like the spreading of the yeast. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **The kingdom of heaven is like** - Here "kingdom of heaven" refers to God's rule as king. The phrase "kingdom of heaven" is used only in Matthew. If possible, use "heaven" in your translation. AT: "When our God in heaven shows himself to be king, it will be like." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:13:24|13:24]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **three measures of flour** - Say "a large amount of flour" or use a term that your culture uses for measuring large amounts of flour. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bvolume]])
  * **until it rose** - "until the dough rose." The implied information is that the yeast and the three measures of flour were made into dough for baking. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
