\v 44 "When people understand that God wishes to rule over them, it is like a man who found a great treasure that another person had buried in a field. When this man dug it up, he buried it again so no one else would find it. Then he went and sold all his possessions to obtain money to buy that field. He then went and bought the field, and so he was able to acquire that treasure.
\p
\v 45 Also, when God rules over people, it is like what  a merchant did who was looking for good quality pearls to buy.
\v 46 When he found one very costly pearl that was for sale, he sold all his possessions to acquire enough money to buy that pearl. Then he went and bought it.

\v 44 The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field; a man found it and hid it. In his joy he goes, sells everything he possesses, and buys that field. 
\v 45 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a man who is a merchant looking for valuable pearls.
\v 46 When he found one pearl of very great value, he went and sold everything that he possessed and bought it.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus went into a house with his disciples and continued to explain the parables about the kingdom of God. In these two parables, Jesus uses two similes to teach his disciples what the kingdom of heaven is like. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
 
  * **The kingdom of heaven is like** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:13:24|13:24]]. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **a treasure hidden in a field** - A treasure is a very valuable and precious thing or collection of things. This can be translated with an active verb: "a treasure that someone had hidden in a field" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **hid it** - "covered it up"
  * **sells everything he possesses, and buys that field** - The implied information is that the person buys the field to take possession of the hidden treasure. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **a merchant** - A merchant is a trader or wholesale dealer, often obtaining merchandise from distant places.
  * **looking for valuable pearls** - The implied information is that the man was looking for valuable pearls that he could buy. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **valuable pearls** - This can be translated "fine pearls" or "beautiful pearls". A "pearl" is a smooth, hard, shiny, white or light-colored bead formed inside mollusks in the sea and highly prized as a gem or to make valuable jewelry.
