\v 20 \add Some people are like the\add* shallow soil on top of rock. When they hear God's message, they immediately accept it joyfully.
\v 21 \add But because it does not penetrate deeply into their hearts, they believe it for only\add* a \add short\add* time\add . They are like the plants that\add* did not have\add deep\add* roots. When they are treated badly and caused to suffer because they believe \add God's message\add*, they soon stop believing \add it\add*.

\v 20 Some people hear God's message and immediately accept it joyfully. They are like the rocky places where some seeds fell.
\v 21 But because it does not penetrate deeply into their hearts, they believe it for only a short time. They are like the plants that did not have deep roots. When others treat them badly and make them suffer because they believe in what I have told them, they sin by refusing to believe in it any longer.

\v 20 He who was sown on the rocky places, this is he who hears the word and receives it with joy immediately;
\v 21 yet he has no root in himself but endures for only a little while. When tribulation or persecution arises because of the
word, he stumbles immediately.
