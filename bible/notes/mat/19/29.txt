\v 29 God will reward those who, because they were my disciples, left behind a house or a plot of ground, their brothers, their sisters, their father, their mother, their children, or any other family  members. God will give them a hundred times as many benefits as they have given up. And they will live with God forever.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to teach about riches in the world and rewards in heaven.

  * **receive a hundredfold** - "receive a hundred times as many good things as they gave up"
  * **many who are first now will be last** - Many who are first in the world's eyes, such as those who are rich and those who rule others, will one day be last in the kingdom of God.
