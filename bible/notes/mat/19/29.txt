\v 29 God will reward those who, because they were my disciples, left behind a house or a plot of ground, their brothers, their sisters, their father, their mother, their children, or any other family members. God will give them a hundred times as many benefits as they have given up. And they will live with God forever.
\v 30 But many people who are important in this life now will be unimportant at that future time, and many people who are unimportant now will be important at that future time."

Those who are important now, God will consider them unimportant when he establishes his rule on earth. Those who seem unimportant now, God will consider them important when he establishes his rule.
