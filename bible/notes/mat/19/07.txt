\v 7 The Pharisees then said to him, "If that is true, why did Moses command that \add a man who wanted to divorce\add* his wife should give her a paper \add stating his reason for\add* divorcing her, and then send her away?"
\v 8 He said to them, "It was because\add your ancestors\add* stubbornly \add wanted their own ways\add* that Moses allowed them to divorce their wives, \add and you are no different from them\add*. But when God first \f + \ft metonymy \f* created a man and a woman, \add he did not intend for them to separate\add*.
\v 9 I am telling you emphatically that \add because God considers that a marriage lasts until either the husband or the wife dies, he considers that\add* any man who divorces his wife and marries another woman is committing adultery, unless\add his first wife\add* has committed adultery."

\v 8 He said to them, "For your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not that way.
\v 9 I say to you, Whoever divorces his wife, except for fornication, and marries another, commits adultery; and the man who marries a woman who is divorced commits adultery."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **They**  - The Pharisees who came to Jesus, testing him (see verse 3).
  * **us - **  The Jews, first given God's commandments and laws in the Old Testament.
  * **her - **  This refers to one's wife.
  * **a certificate of divorcement **- See UDB
  * **divorce her **- The husband would send her away with the certificate of divorcement.
  * **Moses command us to give a certificate of divorcement **- Moses gave them the process to divorce a wife, but the Pharisees incorrectly thought it meant they //must //  divorce their wives.
  * **Moses allowed you to divorce your wives**  - Jesus corrected the understanding of the Pharisees. Moses did not //command//  to divorce; he simply //allowed//  it in some situations. Make sure your translation shows the difference between the words "command" and "allowed".
  * **hardness of heart **- This refers to a man not desiring God's perfect will, but his own.
  * **from the beginning it was not that way - **  (see metonymy) This means that God did not intend for a man and wife to ever divorce.
  * **except for fornication**  - This can be translated as "unless he finds out that she has had sexual relations before they were married".
  * **marries another commits adultery - **  If she has been illegally divorced, God still sees her as a married woman who would be committing adultery if she has sexual intercourse with another man.
  * **man who marries a woman who is divorced - **  Since she is still considered by God to be married to her previous husband, anyone who marries an illegally divorced woman is also committing adultery.
