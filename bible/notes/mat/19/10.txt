\v 10 We disciples said to him, "If that is true, it is better for men never to marry!"
\v 11 Then he said to us, "Not every man is able to accept this teaching. Only the men whom \add God\add* enables \add to accept it are able to do so\add*.
\v 12 There are men who \add do not marry because they are not able to have sexual relations because they\add* have been sexually defective ever since they were born. There are other men \add who do not marry because they are unable to have sexual relations\add* because they have been castrated \f + \ft Or:other men have made them that way \f*. There are other \add men who decide not to marry\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* in order that they can serve God better \add and spend more time telling people about how\add* God [MTY, Or: EUP] wants to rule people's lives. You who are able to understand \add what I have said about marriage\add* should accept it \add and obey it\add*."

\v 10 The disciples said to him, "If that is true, it is better for men never to marry!"
\v 11 He answered, "Not every man is able to accept this teaching, but only the men whom God enables to accept it.
\v 12 There are men who do not marry because their private parts have been defective ever since they were born. There are other men who do not marry because they have been castrated. Then there are still other men who decide not to marry in order to serve God better as he rules over them. You who are able to understand what I have said about marriage should accept it and obey it."

\v 10 The disciples said to Jesus, "If that is the case of a man with his wife, it is not good to marry."
\v 11 But Jesus said to them, "Not everyone can accept this teaching, but only those who are allowed to accept it. 
\v 12 For there are eunuchs who were so born from their mother's womb. And there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men. And there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He who is able to receive this teaching, let him receive it."

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to teach about marriage and divorce.

  * **eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs** - Possible meanings are 1) "eunuchs who have removed their private parts" or 2) "men who choose to remain unmarried and sexually pure" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]).
  * **for the kingdom of heaven's sake** - "so they can serve God better"
  * **receive this teaching...receive it** - See how you translated "accept this teaching...accept it" in 19:11.
