\v 5 That explains why \add God said\add*, '\add When\add* a man \add and woman marry\add*, they should no longer live with their fathers and mothers. \add Instead\add*, the two of them shall live together, and they shall become \add so closely united that they are like\add* one person \f + \ft metaphor \f*.'
\v 6 Consequently, \add although they functioned as\add* two \add separate people before\add*, they now \add become as if they were\add* one person \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Since that is true, a man must not separate \add from his wife\add* whom God has joined to him, \add because it is God's plan for them to remain together\add*."

\v 5 He who made them also said, 'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and join to his wife, and the two will become one flesh'?
\v 6 So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one tear apart."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In verse 5, Jesus quotes from Genesis to show that a husband and wife should not divorce.

  * **He who made them also said, 'For this reason ... flesh'?** - This is a continuation of the question that Jesus uses to respond to the Pharisees in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:19:03|19:3]]. This direct quotation can be stated as an indirect quotation. AT: "And surely you know that God also said that this is the reason ... flesh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **For this reason** - This is a part of the quotation from Genesis story about Adam and Eve. In that context the reason a man will leave his father and mother is because God created a woman to be the man's companion.
  * **join to his wife** - "stay close to his wife" or "live with his wife"
  * **the two will become one flesh** - This is a metaphor that emphasizes the unity of a husband and a wife. AT: "they will become like one person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **So they are no longer two, but one flesh** - This is a metaphor that emphasizes the unity of a husband and a wife. AT: "So a husband and wife are no longer like two persons, but they are like one person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
