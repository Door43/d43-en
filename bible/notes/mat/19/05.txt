<usfm> \v 5 That explains why \add God said\add*, '\add When\add* a man \add and woman marry\add*, they should no longer live with their fathers and mothers. \add Instead\add*, the two of them shall live together, and they shall become \add so closely united that they are like\add* one person \f + \ft metaphor \f*.' \v 6 Consequently, \add although they functioned as\add* two \add separate people before\add*, they now \add become as if they were\add* one person \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Since that is true, a man must not separate \add from his wife\add* whom God has joined to him, \add because it is God's plan for them to remain together\add*." \p </usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 5 That explains why God said, 'When a man and woman marry, they should no longer live with their fathers and mothers. Instead, the two of them must live together, and they will become so closely united that they are like one person.' \v 6 Consequently, although they functioned as two separate people before, they now become as if they were one person. Since that is true, a man must not separate from his wife whom God has joined to him."

<usfm> \v 5 And that he said, 'For this cause a man must leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife; and the two will become one flesh?' \v 6 So that they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man put apart." </usfm>
