\v 23 Then Jesus said to the disciples, "Keep this in mind: It is very difficult for rich people to agree to let God rule their lives.
\v 24 Note this also: It is impossible for a camel to go through the eye of a needle. It is even more difficult for rich people to come under the rule of God."

\v 23 Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I say to you, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.
\v 24 Again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus explains to his disciples the rewards of giving up material possessions and relationships to follow him.

  * **Truly I say to you** - "I tell you the truth." This phrase adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.
  * **to enter the kingdom of heaven** - Here "kingdom of heaven" refers to God's rule as king. This phrase is found only in the book of Matthew. If possible, keep "heaven" in your translation. AT: "to accept our God in heaven as their king" or "to enter God's kingdom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **it is easier ... kingdom of God** - Jesus uses an exaggeration to illustrate how very difficult it is for rich people to enter the kingdom of God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **the eye of a needle** - a hole in the end of a needle for passing thread through
