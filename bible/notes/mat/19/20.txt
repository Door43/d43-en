\v 20 \add Thinking that he might not be able to live with God eternally even though he had kept those commandments\add*, the young man said to Jesus, "I have always obeyed all those commandments. What else must I do \add in order to live with God eternally\add*?"
\v 21 Jesus said to him, "If you desire to be all that God intends you to be, go \add home\add*, sell everything that you have and give \add the money\add* to poor people. \add The result will be that\add* you will have \add spiritual\add* riches in heaven. Then come and be my disciple!"
\v 22 When the young man heard those words, he went away feeling sad, because he was very rich \add and did not want to give away everything he owned\add*.

\v 20 The young man said to Jesus, "I have always obeyed all those commandments. What else must I do in order to live with God forever?"
\v 21 Jesus said to him, "If you desire to be exactly how God wants you to be, go home, sell everything that you have, and give the money to poor people. The result will be that you will be wealthy in heaven. Then come, follow me, and be my disciple!"
\v 22 When the young man heard those words, he went away feeling sad, because he was very rich and did not want to give away everything he owned.

\v 20 The young man said to him, "All these things I have obeyed. What do I still need?"
\v 21 Jesus said to him, "If you wish to be perfect, go, sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."
\v 22 But when the young man heard what Jesus said, he went away sorrowful, for he had many possessions.
