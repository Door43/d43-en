\v 14 "When I return from heaven as king, it will be like a man who was about to go on a long journey. He called his servants together and gave them each some of his wealth to invest and gain more money for him.
\v 15 He gave them money according to their ability to use it. For example, he gave one servant five bags of gold, he gave another servant two bags, and he gave another servant one bag. Then he left on his journey.
\v 16 The servant who had received five bags of gold went immediately and used that money to gain five more bags.

\v 14 For it is like when a man was about to go into another country; he called his own servants and gave over to them his wealth.
\v 15 To one of them he gave five talents, to another two, to another one--each according to his own ability, and he went
on his journey.
\v 16 Immediately the one who received the five talents went, traded with them, and made another five talents.

===== Important Terms: =====

  * talents

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * This section starts a new parable of Jesus that is related to the kingdom of heaven. (See: Parable)
  * **it is like**  - "the kingdom of heaven is like"
  * **gave over to them his wealth**  - "put them in charge of his wealth"
  * **his wealth**  - "his property"
  * **five talents**  - Translators should avoid putting this into modern currency. The important point for the parable is to communicate the relative amounts of five, two and one as well as the large amounts of wealth involved (UDB: "five bags of gold")
  * **he gave five talents, to another two, to another one**  -  "he gave five talents, to another two talents, to another one talent"
  * **he went on his journey **- The pronouns "he" and "his" refer to the man who was about to go into another country.
