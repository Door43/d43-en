\v 14 "When I return from heaven as king, it will be like a man who was about to go on a long journey. He called his servants together and gave them each some of his wealth to invest and gain more money for him.
\v 15 He gave them money according to their ability to use it. For example, he gave one servant five bags of gold, he gave another servant two bags, and he gave another servant one bag. Then he left on his journey.
\v 16 The servant who had received five bags of gold went immediately and used that money to gain five more bags.

\v 14 For it is like when a man was about to go into another country; he called his own servants and gave over to them his wealth.
\v 15 To one of them he gave five talents, to another he gave two, and to yet another he gave one talent—each according to his own ability, and he went
on his journey.
\v 16 Immediately the one who received the five talents went, traded with them, and made another five talents.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus begins to tell a parable about faithful and unfaithful servants.

  * **it is like** - The word "it" here refers to "the kingdom of heaven." (See 25:1) 
  * **was about to go** - "was ready to go" or "was to go soon"
  * **gave over to them his wealth** - "put them in charge of his wealth"
  * **his wealth** - "his property"
  * **five talents** - A "talent" was worth twenty year's wages. Translators should avoid putting this into modern currency. The important point for the parable is to communicate the relative amounts of five, two and one as well as the large amounts of wealth involved. (UDB: "five bags of gold") (See: [[en:obe:other:biblicalmoney]])
  * **he went on his journey** - The words "he" and "his" refer to the man or master who was about to go into another country.
  * **and made another five talents** - "and earned another five talents"
