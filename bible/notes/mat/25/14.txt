\v 14 "When the Son of Man returns from heaven as king, it will be like a man who was about to go on a long journey. He called his servants together and gave them each some of his wealth to invest and gain more money for him.
\v 15 He gave them money according to their ability to use it. For example, he gave one servant five bags of gold weighing about 165 kilograms, he gave another servant two bags weighing about sixty-six kilograms, and he gave another servant one bag weighing about thirty-three kilograms. Then he left on his journey.
\v 16 The servant who had received five bags of gold went immediately and used that money to gain five more bags.

\v 14 For it is like when a man was about to go into another country. He called his own servants and gave over to them his wealth.
\v 15 To one of them he gave five talents, to another he gave two, and to yet another he gave one talent. Each one received an amount according to his own ability, and that man went on his journey.
\v 16 The one who received the five talents went at once and invested them and made another five talents.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus tells a parable about faithful and unfaithful servants to illustrate that his disciples should remain faithful during his absence and be prepared for his return. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]])

  * **it is like** - "the kingdom of heaven is like" (See: [[:en:bible:notes:mat:13:24|13:24]]) 
  * **was about to go** - "was ready to go" or "was to go soon"
  * **gave over to them his wealth** - "put them in charge of his wealth"
  * **his wealth** - "his property"
  * **five talents** - "five talents of gold." Avoid translating this into modern money. A "talent" of gold was worth twenty years' wages. The parable is contrasting the relative amounts of five, two, and one, as well as the large amount of wealth involved. AT: "five bags of gold" or "five bags of gold, each worth 20 years' wages" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bmoney]])
  * **to another he gave two ... gave one talent** - The word "talents" is understood from the previous phrase. AT: "to another he gave two talents of gold ... gave one talent of gold" or "to another he gave two bags of gold ... gave one bag of gold" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **according to his own ability** - The implicit information can be stated explicitly. AT: "according to each servant's skill in managing wealth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **made another five talents** - "out of his investments, he earned another five talents"
