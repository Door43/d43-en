\v 37 Then the people whom God has declared to be good will reply, 'Lord, when were you hungry and we saw you and gave you something to eat? When were you thirsty and we gave you something to drink?
\v 38 When were you a stranger in our town and we invited you to stay in our houses? When did you need clothes and we gave you some?
\v 39 When were you sick or in prison and we went to visit you? We do not remember doing any of these things for you.

\v 37 Then the righteous will answer and say, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry, and feed you? Or thirsty and give you a drink?
\v 38 And when did we see you a stranger, and take you in? Or naked and clothe you?
\v 39 And when did we see you sick, or in prison, and come to you?'
\v 40 And the King will answer and say to them, 'Truly I say to you, what you did for one of the least of my brothers here, you did it for me.'
