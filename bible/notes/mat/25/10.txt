\v 10 While they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut.
\v 11 Afterward the other virgins also came and said, 'Master, master, open for us.'
\v 12 But he answered and said, 'Truly I say to you, I do not know you.'
\v 13 Watch therefore, for you do not know the day or the hour.
