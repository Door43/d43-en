  * [[:en:obe:kt:faithful]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:joy]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to tell a parable about faithful and unfaithful servants.

  * **I have made five more talents**  - "I have earned five more talents"
  * **talents** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:25:14|25:15]].
  * **Well done **- "You have done well" or "You have done right." Your culture might have an expression that a master (or someone in authority) would use to show that he approves of what his servant (or someone under him) has done.
