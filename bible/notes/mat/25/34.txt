\v 34 Then I will say to those on my right, 'You people who have been blessed by my Father, come! Come receive all the good things he will give you, for he is now beginning to rule over you completely—things he has been preparing since the time he created the world.
\v 35 These things belong to you, because you gave me something to eat when I was hungry. You gave me something to drink when I was thirsty. When I was a stranger in your town, you invited me to stay in your houses.
\v 36 When I needed clothes, you gave me some. When I was sick, you took care of me. When I was in prison, you came to visit me.'

\v 34 Then the King will say to those on his right hand, 'Come, you who have been blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
\v 35 For I was hungry and you gave me food; I was thirsty and you gave me a drink; I was a stranger and you took me in;
\v 36 I was naked, and you clothed me; I was sick and you cared for me; I was in prison and you came to me.'
