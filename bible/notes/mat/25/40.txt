\v 40 And the King will answer and say to them, 'Truly I say to you, what you did for one of these my least brothers, you did it for me.'
\v 41 Then he will say to those on his left hand, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire that has been prepared for
the devil and his angels,
\v 42 because I was hungry but you did not give me food; I was thirsty but you did not give me a  drink;
\v 43 I was a stranger but you did not take me in; naked but you did not clothe me; sick and in prison, but you did not care for me.'
