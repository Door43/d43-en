Jesus continues to tell a parable about faithful and unfaithful servants.

  * **You wicked and lazy servant** - "You are a wicked servant who does not want to work"
  * **I reap where I have not sowed and harvest where I have not scattered** - See how you translated this idea in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:25:24|25:24]]
  * **received back my own** - "received back my own gold" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **interest**- payment from the banker for the temporary use of the master's money
