\v 26 His master replied, 'You wicked, lazy servant! You knew that I expect to make money even when I have invested nothing.
\v 27 So then, you should have at least put my money on deposit in a bank, so that when I returned I would get it back with the interest it earned!'

\v 26 But his master answered and said him, 'You wicked and lazy servant, you knew that I reap where I have not sowed and harvest where I have not scattered.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues telling a parable about the servants and the talents. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]])

  * **You wicked and lazy servant** - "You are a wicked servant who does not want to work"
  * **I reap where I have not sowed and harvest where I have not scattered** - These two statements mean the same thing. They refer to a farmer who gathers crops that do not belong to him. The servant uses this metaphor to accuse the master of being a ruthless businessman. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:25:24|25:24]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:25:24|25:24]].
  * **received back my own** - The understood information can be stated clearly. AT: "received back my own money" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **interest** - payment from the banker for the temporary use of the master's money
