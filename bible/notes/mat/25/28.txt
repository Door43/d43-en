===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Jesus concludes his parable of the talents that highlights the kingdom of heaven. The master in the parable continues to speak to the wicked and lazy servant.)
  * **from him**  - //him//  is the wicked and lazy servant to whom the master had given one talent.
  * **even more abundantly**  - "even much more" or "even in abundance"
  * **where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth**  - This can be translated as “where people will cry and grind their teeth.”
  * **grinding of teeth **- Possible meanings are 1) you will grind your teeth because you are angry or 2) you will grind your teeth because you are in pain. If your culture does not associate grinding the teeth with anger, it can be translated as “grinding of teeth in anger.” Or you could use a way that people express anger in your culture, such as “stomping your feet” or “clenching your teeth” or “snarling.”
