\v 41 You must keep alert and pray so that you can resist when anyone tempts you to sin. You want to do what I tell you, but you are not strong enough to actually do it."

\v 39 He went a little further, fell on his face, and prayed; he said, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will."
\v 40 He came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, "What, could you not watch with me for one hour?
\v 41 Watch and pray that you do not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."
