===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of the arrest of Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane.

  * **Have you come out with swords and clubs to seize me like a robber?** - AT: "You know that I am not a robber, so it is wrong for you to come out to me bringing swords and clubs." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **clubs** - large pieces of hard wood for hitting people
  * **left him** - If your language has a word that means that they left him when they should have stayed with him, use it here.
