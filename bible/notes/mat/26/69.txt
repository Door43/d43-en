===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - This begins the account of how Peter denies three times that he knows Jesus, as Jesus said he would do.
  * **General Information:** - These events happen at the same time as Jesus' trial before the religious leaders.

  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Here Matthew starts to tell a new part of the story.
  * **I do not know what you are talking about** - Peter was able to understand what the servant girl was saying. He used these words to deny that he had been with Jesus.
