===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **led him away to the house of Caiaphas the high priest**  - The phrase "the house of" is not in the original text but implied by "courtyard" in the next verse. A more literal translation is "led him away to Caiaphas the high priest."
  * **court of the high priest**  - This would have been in a courtyard (open area) in the residence or palace of the high priest.
  * **soldiers **- These would have been guards, not army soldiers.
