He struck the servant of the high priest to kill him, but only cut off his ear. \v 52 Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back in its sheath! All those who try to kill others with a sword–someone else will kill them with a sword! \v 53 Do you think that if I asked my Father, he would not immediately send more than twelve armies of angels to help me? \v 54 But if I did that, what the prophets have written in the Scriptures about what will happen to the Messiah would not be fulfilled."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Do you think that I could not call upon my Father, and he would send me more than twelve legions of angels? **- This is a rhetorical question that could be translated if necessary as "I could call upon my Father, and he would send me more than twelve legions of angels." (See: Rhetorical Question)
  * **my Father **- Jesus is referring here to God the Father.
  * **more than twelve legions of angels **- The specific number of angels is not important; the idea is that the Father could easily defend Jesus if Jesus asked him.
  * **legions**  - A legion was a part of the Roman army that, at the time, was made up of about six thousand soldiers. "Legions" could be translated "regiments" or "armies" (UDB).
  * **the scriptures**  - Jesus is not pointing out specific Scripture prophecies here, but is pointing out that the events happening at that time were fulfillment of Scriptures.
