===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of how Peter denies he knows Jesus.

  * **one of them **- "one of those who were with Jesus"
  * **for your accent gives you away **- "we can tell you are from Galilee because you speak like a Galilean"
  * **curse **- "call down a curse on himself"
  * **swear **- This would be similar to the oath in Peter's second denial (see UDB).
  * **swear, "I do not know the man,"**  - AT: "that he did not know the man," (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
