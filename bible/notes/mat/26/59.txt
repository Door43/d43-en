\v 59 Now the chief priests and the whole council were looking for false testimony against Jesus, so that they might put him to death.
\v 60 They did not find any, even though many false witnesses came forward. But later two came forward
\v 61 and said, "This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"
