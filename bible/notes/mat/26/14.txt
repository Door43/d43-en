===== Important Terms: =====

  * Judas Iscariot
  * priests

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **chief priests**  - See definition of the Important Term "priest" for a description of different kinds of priests.
  * **deliver him to you **- This expression, which means "help you arrest him," can be put into an active voice as in UDB if necessary. (See: Active or Passive)
  * **to deliver him to you **- The pronoun "him" refers to Jesus.
  * **thirty pieces of silver **- Since this amount relates to a specific Old Testament prophecy (Zechariah 11:12), it is better to retain the form of "thirty pieces of silver" or "thirty silver coins" (UDB) than to convert this to a modern currency.
  * **to deliver him to them **- "to help the chief priests arrest Jesus"
