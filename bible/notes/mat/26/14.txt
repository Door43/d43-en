===== Translation Notes: =====

One of the disciples agrees to help the Jewish leaders arrest and kill Jesus.

  * **deliver him to you** - "turn Jesus over to you" or "help you arrest Jesus" 
  * **thirty pieces of silver** - Since these words are the same as those in an Old Testament prophecy, keep this form instead of changing it to modern money.
  * **to deliver him to them** - "to help the chief priests arrest Jesus"
