\v 62 The high priest stood up and said to him, "Do you have no answer? What is it that they are testifying against you?"
\v 63 But Jesus was silent. The high priest said to him, "I command you by the living God, tell us whether
you are the Christ, the Son of God."
\v 64 Jesus replied to him, "You have said it yourself; but I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the

===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of Jesus being questioned by the high priest.

  * **they are testifying against you **- "these witnesses are testifying against you"
  * **tell us whether you are the Christ **- "tell us if you are the Christ"
  * **You have said it yourself** - "As you have said, I am" or "You have just admitted it" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **but I tell you, from now on you **  - Jesus is speaking to the high priest and to the other persons there.
  * **from now on you will see the Son of Man**- Possible meanings: 1) they will see the Son of Man at some time in the future (see UDB) or 2) by "now" Jesus means the time of his death, his coming back from the dead, and his going up to heaven.
  * **at the right hand of Power**  - "at the right hand of Almighty God"
  * **coming on the clouds of heaven**  - "riding to earth on the clouds of heaven"
