This continues the account of Jesus healing the daughter of a Canaanite woman.

  * **even the little dogs eat some of the crumbs that fall from their masters' tables** - The Gentiles should be able to have a small amount of the good things the Jews are throwing away. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **her daughter was healed** - "Jesus healed her daughter" or "Jesus made her daughter well" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **at that hour** - "at exactly the same time" or "immediately"
