\v 18 \add You should know that\add* what comes out of \add people's\add* mouths, \add meaning everything that they say\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f*, comes from their inner beings\f + \ft Or: hearts \f*. Many of the \add things that they say\add* cause \add God to consider\add* them to be unacceptable \add to him\add*.
\v 19 It is people's innermost beings that \add cause them\add* to think things that are evil, to murder people, to \add commit\add* adultery, to commit other sexual sins, to steal things, to testify falsely, and to speak evil about \add others\add*.
\v 20 It is these actions that cause \add God to consider\add* people to be unacceptable \add to him\add*. To eat with unwashed hands does not cause\add God to consider\add* people unacceptable to him."

\v 18 Instead, the evil words that the mouth speaks are what makes God reject a person, because they come from the evil things that the person thinks in his innermost being.
\v 19 This is because it is people's innermost beings that cause them to think things that are evil, to murder people, to commit adultery, to commit other sexual sins, to steal things, to testify falsely, and to speak evil about others.
\v 20 It is these actions that cause God to consider people to be unacceptable to him. But to eat with unwashed hands does not cause God to reject people."

\v 18 But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart. They are the things that defile a person.
\v 19 For from the heart proceed evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, and insults.
\v 20 These are the things that defile a person. But to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a person."
