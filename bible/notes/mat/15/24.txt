===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **l was not sent to anyone except**  - "God sent me only to" (See UDB)
  * **​the lost sheep **- This is a metaphor comparing the Jews to sheep who lost their way. (See: Metaphor.)
  * **she**  - Jesus is speaking to a Canaanite woman.
  * **children's bread and throw it to the dogs **- This is a metaphor. Jesus is referring to the Jews as the "children." The Jews considered Gentiles to be like dogs (of lesser value). This was not the attitude of Jesus, but let the saying stand for the moment. (See: metaphor.)
