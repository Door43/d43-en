====== Matthew 15:4-6 ======

<usfm>
\v 4 God gave these \add two\add* commands: 'Honor your father and your mother,' and 'People who speak evil about their father or mother must be executed.'
\v 5 But you tell people, 'You can say to your father or mother, "What I was going to give to you \add to help provide for you\add*, \add I have now promised\add* to give\add to God\add*."'
\v 6 And if you do that, you think that you do not need to give anything to your parents. In \add that way\add*, \add by teaching people\add* your traditions, you disregard what God commanded.

\v 4 God gave these two commands: 'Honor your father and your mother,' and 'People who speak evil about their father or mother must be executed.'
\v 5 But you tell the people, 'You can say to your father or mother, "What I was going to give to you to help provide for you, I have now promised to give to God."'
\v 6 When you do that, you think that you do not need to give anything to your parents. In that way you ignore what God commanded, just so that you can follow what your ancestors taught you!

<usfm>
\v 4 For God said, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and 'He who speaks evil of his father or mother, will surely die.'
\v 5 But you say, 'Whoever says to his father or mother "Whatever help you would have received from me is now a gift given to God,"'
\v 6 that person does not need to honor his father. In this way you have made void the word of God \f + \ft The best ancient copies have \fqa the word of God \fqa* but some have \fqa the commandment.\f* for the sake of your traditions.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to respond to the Pharisees.
  * **General Information:** - In verse 4, Jesus quotes twice from Exodus to show how God expects people to treat their parents.

  * **will surely die** - "the people will surely execute him"
  * **But you say, 'Whoever says to his father or mother "Whatever help you would have received from me is now a gift given to God,"' that person does not need to honor his father** - This has a quotation within a quotation. If necessary you can translate them as indirect quotations. AT: "But you teach that a person does not need to honor his parents by giving them something that may help them if the person tells his parents that he has already given it as a gift to God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotesinquotes]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **But you say** - Here "you" is plural and refers to the Pharisees and scribes. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **does not need to honor his father** - It is implied that "his father" means "his parents." This means the religious leaders taught that a person does not need to show respect to his parents by taking care of them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **you have made void the word of God for the sake of your traditions** - "you have made your traditions more important than God's commands"
