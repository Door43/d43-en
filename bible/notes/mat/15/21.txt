\v 21 After Jesus took the disciples and left the district of Galilee, they all went toward the region where the cities of Tyre and Sidon are located.
\v 22 A woman from the group of people called Canaanites who live in that region came to Jesus. She kept shouting to him, "Lord, you are the descendant of King David, you are the Messiah! Have pity on me and my daughter! She is suffering very much because a demon controls her."
\v 23 But Jesus did not answer her at all. The disciples said to him, "Tell her to leave because she keeps bothering us by shouting behind us as we go along."

\v 21 Then Jesus went away from there and withdrew toward the regions of the cities of Tyre and Sidon.
\v 22 And behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders; she shouted out and said, "Have mercy on me, O Lord, son of David; my daughter is very tormented by a demon."
\v 23 But Jesus answered her not a word. His disciples came and begged him, saying, "Send her away, for she is shouting after us."

  * **those borders **- the area near the dividing line between Gentile Canaan and Israel.
  * **Lord, son of David**  - the Gentile woman knew that Jesus was of the line of David; she probably didn't know him as the true Lord. Maybe she is addressing him as "sir.'

  * **answered her not a word**  - "said nothing"
  * **shouting after us**  - This could be translated as "shouting behind us as we go along." (UDB)
