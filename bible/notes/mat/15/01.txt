This begins an encounter between Jesus and the religious leaders.

  * **violate the traditions of the elders** - "do not respect the rules given by the older religious leaders."
  * **they do not wash their hands**- "they do not wash their hands in the ceremony required by our law" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
