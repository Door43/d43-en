===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **violate the tradition of the elders**  - This can be translated as "disobey or do not respect the rules given by the older religious leaders."
  * **they **- The word "they" refers to Jesus' disciples**.**
  * **wash their hands **- this is not referring only to washing for eating. The Jewish tradition required washing often and in specific ways. This could be translated as "they do not wash as required."
  * **Jesus answered and said to them**  - The word "them" refers to the Pharisees and scribes only.
  * **And you–why do you **- the pronoun "you" refers to the Pharisees and scribes.
  * **why do you violate the commandment of God **- Jesus is using a rhetorical question to point out their disobedience. (See: Rhetorical Question)
  * **for the sake of your traditions **- This means "to follow what has been passed down to you." Their traditions have become more important than obeying God's word.
