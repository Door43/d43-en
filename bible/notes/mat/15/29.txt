\v 29 Jesus left that place and went near to the sea of Galilee. Then he went up a hill and sat there.
\v 30 Large crowds came to him; they brought with them lame, blind, mute, and crippled people, and many others who were sick. They presented them at Jesus' feet, and he healed them. 
\v 31 So the crowd marveled when they saw the mute persons speak, the crippled made well, the lame walking, and the
blind seeing. They praised the God of Israel.

This begins the account of Jesus healing people in a large crowd in Galilee.

  * **lame, blind, mute, and crippled people** - "people who could not walk, some who could not see, some who could not talk, and others whose arms and legs had been hurt." Some early texts have these words in different order.
  * **They presented them at Jesus' feet** - "The crowds brought the sick to Jesus"
