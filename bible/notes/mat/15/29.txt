\v 29 Jesus left that place and went near to the sea of Galilee; there he went up onto a hill and sat there.
\v 30 Large crowds came to him; they brought with them lame, blind, mute, and crippled people, and many others who were sick. They presented them at Jesus' feet, and he healed them. 
\v 31 So the crowd marveled when they saw the mute persons speak, the crippled made well, the lame walking, and the
blind seeing. They praised the God of Israel.
