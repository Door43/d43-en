\v 29 Then Jesus and his disciples went away from that area, back to the Sea of Galilee. Then Jesus climbed the hill near there and sat down to teach the people.
\v 30 Large crowds kept coming to him for the next two days and brought lame, crippled, and blind people, those who were unable to talk, and many others who had various sicknesses. They laid them in front of Jesus so that he would heal them. And he healed them.
\v 31 The crowd saw him heal people who could not talk, crippled people, lame people, and blind people, and they were amazed. They said, "Praise God who rules over us in Israel!"

\v 29 Jesus left that place and went near to the sea of Galilee. Then he went up a hill and sat there.
\v 30 Large crowds came to him; they brought with them lame, blind, mute, and crippled people, and many others who were sick. They presented them at Jesus' feet, and he healed them. 
\v 31 So the crowd marveled when they saw the mute persons speak, the crippled made well, the lame walking, and the
blind seeing. They praised the God of Israel.

===== Translation Notes: =====

This begins the account of Jesus healing people in a large crowd in Galilee.

  * **lame, blind, mute, and crippled people** - "people who could not walk, some who could not see, some who could not talk, and others whose arms and legs had been hurt." Some early texts have these words in different order.
  * **They presented them at Jesus' feet** - "The crowds brought the sick to Jesus"
