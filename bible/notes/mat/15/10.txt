\v 10 Then Jesus again called the crowd to come nearer to him. He said to them, "Listen to what I am about to tell you and try to understand it.
\v 11 Nothing that a person puts into his mouth to eat causes God to not accept him. Instead, it is what people say—the words that come from their mouths—that causes God to reject them."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus begins to teach the crowd and his disciples about what defiles a person and why the Pharisees and scribes were wrong to criticize him.

  * **Listen and understand** - Jesus is emphasizing the importance of what he is about to say. The implied information can  be made explicit. AT: "Listen carefully to what I say so that you may understand its meaning" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **enters into the mouth...comes out of the mouth** - Jesus is contrasting what a person eats to what a person says. Jesus means that God is concerned with what a person says rather than what a person eats. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
