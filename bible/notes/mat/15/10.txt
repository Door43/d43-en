\v 10 Then Jesus again called the crowd to come nearer to him. He said to them, "Listen to what I am about to tell you and try to understand it.
\v 11 Nothing that a person puts into his mouth to eat causes God to not accept him. Instead, it is what people say—the words that come from their mouths—that causes God to reject them."
