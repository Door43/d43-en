<usfm> \v 10 Then Jesus again summoned the crowd to come nearer to him. He said to them, "Listen to what I am about to tell you and try to understand it. \v 11 Nothing that a person puts into his mouth to eat causes God to not accept him. Instead, it is what people say–the words that come from their mouths–that causes God to reject them."
