\v 12 Later the disciples went to Jesus and said, "Do you know that the Pharisees heard what you said and became angry at you?"
\v 13 Then Jesus told them this parable. "My Father in heaven will get rid of all those who teach things that are against what he says, just like a farmer gets rid of plants that he did not plant by pulling them up by their roots.
\v 14 Do not pay any attention to the Pharisees. They do not help people to understand what God commands, just like blind guides do not help blind people to see where they should walk. Instead, they both fall into the same hole."
