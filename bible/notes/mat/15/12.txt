\v 12 Later the disciples went to Jesus and said, "Do you know that the Pharisees heard what you said and became angry at you?"
\v 13 Then Jesus told them this parable. "My Father in heaven will get rid of all those who teach things that are against what he says, just like a farmer gets rid of plants that he did not plant by pulling them up by their roots.
\v 14 Do not pay any attention to the Pharisees. They do not help people to understand what God commands, just like blind guides do not help blind people to see where they should walk. Instead, they all fall into the same hole."

\v 12 Then the disciples came and said to Jesus, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this statement?"
\v 13 Jesus answered and said, "Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up.
\v 14 Let them alone; they are blind guides. If a blind person guides another blind person, both will fall into a pit."
