\v 12 Later the disciples went to Jesus and said, "Do you know that the Pharisees heard what you said and became angry at you?"
\v 13 Then Jesus told them this parable. "My Father in heaven will get rid of all those who teach things that are against what he says, just like a farmer gets rid of plants that he did not plant by pulling them up by their roots.
\v 14 Do not pay any attention to the Pharisees. They do not help people to understand what God commands, just like blind guides do not help blind people to see where they should walk. Instead, they all fall into the same hole."

\v 12 Then the disciples came and said to Jesus, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this statement?"
\v 13 Jesus answered and said, "Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up.
\v 14 Let them alone, they are blind guides. If a blind person guides another blind person, both will fall into a pit."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the Pharisees were offended when they heard this statement** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "this statement made the Pharisees angry" or "this statement offended the Pharisees." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up** - This is a metaphor. Jesus means that the Pharisees do not actually belong to God, so God will remove them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **my heavenly Father** - This is an important title for God that describes the relationship between God and Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **will be rooted up** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "my Father will uproot them" or "my Father will take them out of the ground" or "my Father will remove them." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Let them alone** - The word "​them"​ refers to the Pharisees.
  * **blind guides...both will fall into a pit** - Jesus uses another metaphor to describe the Pharisees. Jesus means that the Pharisees do not understand God's commands or how to please him. Therefore, they cannot teach others how to please God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
