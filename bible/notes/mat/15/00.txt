====== Matthew 15 General Notes ======

=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent all the lines of 15:8-9, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "Traditions" ==

The "traditions of the elders," that is, the oral laws, are an important concept in this chapter. These were the rules that the religious leaders among the Jews developed in order to ensure that the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|Laws of Moses]] were obeyed. However, these rules often became in practice more important than the provisions in the law of Moses themselves. Jesus rebuked the religious leaders for this, which made them angry.

== Jews and Gentiles ==

The response to Jesus of the Canaanite woman, a Gentile, stood in great contrast with the refusal of the Jewish leaders to acknowledge Jesus' teachings as true. This fact also implied a strong rebuke to those leaders.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Sheep ==

People are often pictured as sheep in Scripture. In this chapter, the image of sheep illustrates that the Jews were spiritually lost without a proper leader to guide them.
