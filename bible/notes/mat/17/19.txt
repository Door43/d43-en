\v 19 Later, some of the disciples approached Jesus when he was by himself and asked him, "Why were we not able to drive out the demon?"
\v 20-21 He answered them, "It is because you did not believe very much in God's power. Think about this: Mustard seeds are very small, but they grow and produce large plants. Similarly, if you believe even a little bit that God will do what you ask him to, you will be able to do anything! You could even say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there!' and it would go where you told it to go."

\v 19 Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, "Why could we not cast it out?"
\v 20 Jesus said to them, "Because of your small faith; for I truly say to you, If you have faith even as small as a grain of mustard, you can say to this mountain, 'Take yourself from here and go over there,' and it will take itself. Nothing will be impossible for you to do. 
\v 21 \f + Many authorities, some ancient, insert v. 21. \fqa But this kind of demon does not go out except with prayer and fasting."\f*
