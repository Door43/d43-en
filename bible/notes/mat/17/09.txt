\v 10 \add Those three disciples had just seen Elijah and he did not do anything to prepare people for the coming of the Messiah\add*, so they asked Jesus, "If \add what you say is true\add*, why do the men who teach the \add Jewish\add* laws say that it is necessary for Elijah to come \add back to earth\add* before \add the Messiah comes\add*?"
