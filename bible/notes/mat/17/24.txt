\v 24 When Jesus and the disciples came to the city of Capernaum, the men who collected taxes for the Temple approached Peter and said to him, "Your teacher pays the Temple tax, does he not?"
\v 25 He answered them, "Yes, he does pay it." When we came into Jesus' house, before Peter began to speak, Jesus said to him, "Simon, from whom do you think rulers collect revenue or taxes? Do they collect taxes from the citizens of their own country, or from citizens of countries they have conquered?"

\v 24 When they had come to Capernaum, the men who collected the half-shekel tax came to Peter and said, "Does not your teacher
pay the half-shekel tax?"
\v 25 He said, "Yes." But when Peter went into the house, Jesus spoke first to him and said, "What do you think, Simon? The kings on earth, from whom do they receive tax or tribute? From their subjects or from foreigners?"
