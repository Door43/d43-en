\v 5 While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, there was a voice out of the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him."
\v 6 When the disciples heard it, they fell on their face and were very afraid.
\v 7 Then Jesus came and touched them and said, "Get up and do not be afraid."
\v 8 Then they looked up but saw no one except Jesus only.
