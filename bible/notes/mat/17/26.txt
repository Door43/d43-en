\v 27 But\add even though the Temple is mine, pay the tax for us so that the Temple tax collectors will not become angry with us. In order to get the money to pay it\add*, go to the lake. Cast your \add fish line and\add* hook, and take the first fish that you catch. When you open its mouth, you will find a silver coin \add that is worth enough to pay the tax\add* for you and me. Take that coin and give \add it\add* to the Temple tax collectors."

\v 26 Peter answered him, "From citizens of other countries." Then Jesus said to him, "So citizens of their own country do not need to pay taxes.
\v 27 But go ahead and pay the tax for us so that the Temple tax collectors will not become angry with us. In order to get the money to pay it, go to the Sea of Galilee, cast your fish line and hook, and take the first fish that you catch. When you open its mouth, you will find a silver coin that is worth enough to pay the tax for you and me. Take that coin and give it to the Temple tax collectors."

\v 26 When Peter said, "From foreigners," Jesus said to him, "Then the subjects are exempt from paying.
\v 27 But lest we cause the tax collectors to sin, go to the sea, throw in a hook, and draw in the fish that comes up first; when you have opened its mouth, you will find a shekel. Take it and give it to the tax collectors for me and you."
