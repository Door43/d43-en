\v 26 Peter answered \add him\add*, "From \add citizens of\add* other \add countries\add*." Then Jesus said to him, "So citizens of their own \add country\add* do not need to \add pay taxes\add*.
\v 27 But\add even though the Temple is mine, pay the tax for us so that the Temple tax collectors will not become angry with us. In order to get the money to pay it\add*, go to the lake. Cast your \add fish line and\add* hook, and take the first fish that you catch. When you open its mouth, you will find a silver coin \add that is worth enough to pay the tax\add* for you and me. Take that coin and give \add it\add* to the Temple tax collectors."

\v 26 Peter answered him, "From citizens of other countries." Then Jesus said to him, "So citizens of their own country do not need to pay taxes.
\v 27 But go ahead and pay the tax for us so that the temple tax collectors will not become angry with us. In order to get the money to pay it, go to the Sea of Galilee, cast your fish line and hook, and take the first fish that you catch. When you open its mouth, you will find a silver coin that is worth enough to pay the tax for you and me. Take that coin and give it to the temple tax collectors."

\v 26 When Peter said, "From foreigners," Jesus said to him, "Then the subjects are exempt from paying.
\v 27 But so that we do not cause the tax collectors to sin, go to the sea, throw in a hook, and draw in the fish that comes up first. When you have opened its mouth, you will find a shekel. Take it and give it to the tax collectors for me and you."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to teach Peter about paying the temple tax.
  * **General Information:** - This is the end of the part of the story that began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:13:54|13:54]], where the writer tells of continued opposition to Jesus' ministry and teaching about the kingdom of heaven.

  * **When Peter said, "From foreigners," Jesus said** - If you translated Jesus' questions as statements in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:17:24|17:25]], you may need to give an alternate response here. You could also state it as an indirect quotation. AT: "When Peter said, 'Yes, that is correct. Kings collect taxes from foreigners,' Jesus said" or "After Peter agreed with Jesus, Jesus said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **From foreigners** - In modern times, leaders usually tax their own citizens. But, in ancient times, the leaders often taxed the people they had conquered rather than their own citizens.
  * **subjects** - people under a ruler or king
  * **But so that we do not cause the tax collectors to sin, go** - "But we do not want to make the tax collectors angry. So, go."
  * **throw in a hook** - Fishermen tied hooks to the end of a line, then threw it in the water to catch fish. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **its mouth** - "the fish's mouth"
  * **a shekel** - a silver coin worth four days' wages (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bmoney]])
  * **Take it** - "Take the shekel"
  * **for me and you** - Here "you" is singular and refers to Peter. Each man had to pay a half shekel tax. So one shekel would be enough for Jesus and Peter to pay their taxes. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
