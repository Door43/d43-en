\v 11 Jesus answered and said, "Elijah will indeed come and restore all things.
\v 12 But I tell you, Elijah has already come, but they did not recognize him; instead, they did whatever they wanted to him. In the same way, the Son of Man will also suffer at their hands."
\v 13 Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them about John the Baptist.

===== Important Terms: =====

  * Elijah
  * restore
  * Son of Man
  * suffer
  * John the Baptist

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Elijah will indeed come and restore all things**  - This is a hyperbole. Jesus answered that God promised that Elijah (who was at this time John the Baptist) would come to prepare many people (not everybody) for the Messiah's coming.
  * **but they did not recognize him **- "they" refers to the leaders (Sadducees & Phariseees) of the Jewish people and "him" refers to John the Baptist.
  * **at their hands - ** <font 14px line-height: 19.6000003814697px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>"their" refers to the leaders (Sadducees & Pharaisees) of the Jewish people,</font>
