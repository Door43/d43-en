\v 11 Jesus answered and said, "Elijah will indeed come and restore all things.
\v 12 But I tell you, Elijah has already come, but they did not recognize him; instead, they did whatever they wanted to him. In the same way, the Son of Man will also suffer at their hands."
\v 13 Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them about John the Baptist.
