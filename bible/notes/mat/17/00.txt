====== Matthew 17 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Elijah ==

The prophet Malachi prophesied that one day Elijah would return before the Messiah came. Jesus explains that John the Baptist fulfilled this prophecy by serving God in the same manner as Elijah. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:obe:kt:christ]]) 

== "He [Jesus] was transfigured" ==

The glory of God is seen as a great, brilliant light in scripture. God's grandeur always produces fear in the person who sees it. Such an event, presented in this chapter, is called the "transfiguration," in which Jesus is changed or transfigured so that he shows some of his divine glory. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:glory]] and [[:en:obe:kt:fear]])
