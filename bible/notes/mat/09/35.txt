===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Verse 35 is the end of the part of the story that began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:08:01|8:1]] about Jesus' healing ministry in Galilee. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_endofstory]])
  * **General Information:** - Verse 36 begins a new part of the story where Jesus teaches his disciples and sends them to preach and heal as he has done.

  * **all the cities** - The word "all" is an exaggeration to emphasize how very many cities Jesus went to. He did not necessarily go to every one of them. AT: "many of the cities" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **cities ... villages** - "large villages ... small villages" or "large towns ... small towns"
  * **the gospel of the kingdom** - Here "kingdom" refers to God's rule as king. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:04:23|4:23]].
  * **all kinds of disease and all kinds of sickness** - "every disease and every sickness." The words "disease" and "sickness" are closely related but should be translated as two different words if possible. "Disease" is what causes a person to be sick. "Sickness" is the physical weakness or affliction that results from having a disease.
  * **They were like sheep without a shepherd** - This simile means they did not have a leader to take care of them. AT: "The people did not have a leader" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
