kingdom, and healing all kinds of disease and all kinds of sickness.

===== Translation Notes: =====

This section summarizes the teaching, preaching and healing ministry of Jesus in the region of Galilee.

  * **all the cities** - "many of the cities." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **cities...villages** - "large villages...small villages" or "large towns...small towns"
  * **all kinds of disease and all kinds of sickness **  - "every disease and every sickness." The words "disease" and "sickness" are closely related but should be translated as two different words if possible. "Disease" is what causes a person to be sick. "Sickness" is the physical weakness or affliction that results from having a disease.
  * **they were like sheep without a shepherd** - "the people did not have a leader" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
