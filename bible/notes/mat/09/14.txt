\v 14 Later, the disciples of John \add the Baptizer\add* came to Jesus and asked him, "We\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* and the Pharisees \add often\add* abstain from food \add to show that we want to please God\add*, but your disciples do not do that. Why\add do they not\add*?"
\v 15 \add Jesus wanted to show them and the Pharisees that it was not appropriate for his disciples to abstain from food and mourn while he was still with them\add*. So he \add gave them this illustration\add*: "When the bridegroom is with \add his friends at the time of the wedding\add*, the groom's friends certainly do not mourn, do they?\f + \ft Or: do the groom's friends mourn? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add No, they do not mourn, because they are not sad at that time. But when\add* the bridegroom is taken \f + \ft Or:\add someone\add* takes the groom\add , Or: his enemies\add* take the groom \f* from them, they will abstain from food, \add because then they will be sad\add*."

\v 14 Then the disciples of John the Baptizer came to Jesus and asked him, "We and the Pharisees often abstain from food because we want to please God, but your disciples do not do that. Why do they not?"
\v 15 Jesus answered, "When the bridegroom is with his friends when he gets married, those people do not mourn, do they? No, because they are not sad at that time. But when the bridegroom has to leave them, they will abstain from food, because they will be sad.

\v 14 Then the disciples of John came to him and said, "Why do we and the Pharisees often fast, but your disciples do not fast?"
\v 15 Jesus said to them, "Can wedding attendants be sorrowful while the bridegroom is still with them? But the days

===== Translation Notes: =====

The disciples of John the Baptist question the fact that Jesus' disciples do not fast.

  * **Can wedding attendants be sorrowful...them?** - No one would expect the wedding attendants to fast while the bridegroom was with them. (See    [[en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion]])
  * **wedding attendants** - a metaphor for Jesus' disciples (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor|]])
  * **the bridegroom is still with them...when the bridegroom will be taken away** - The "bridegroom" is Jesus, who is still alive and so "is still with" his disciples. (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor|]])
  * **the bridegroom will be taken away** - "someone will take the bridegroom away." This is a metaphor for being killed. (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor|]], [[en:ta:translate:active|]])
  * **be sorrowful** - "mourn...be sad" (UDB)
