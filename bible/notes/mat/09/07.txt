===== Translation Notes: =====

This concludes the account of Jesus' healing a paralyzed man. Jesus then calls a tax collector to be one of his disciples.

  * **praise** - Use the same word you used in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:15|5:16]].
  * **such authority** - the authority to declare sins forgiven
  * **Matthew...him...he** - Church tradition says that this Matthew is the author of the Gospel, but the text gives no reason to change the pronouns from "him" and "he" to "me" and "I."
  * **he said to him** - "Jesus said to Matthew"
  * **As Jesus passed by from there** - This phrase is used here to mark the introduction to the incident that begins with "behold" in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:09:07|9:8]]. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **passed by** - Use a general term for going. It is not clear whether Jesus was moving uphill or downhill or toward Capernaum or away from it.
  * **He got up and followed him** - "Matthew got up and followed Jesus" as a disciple (see UDB), not simply to Jesus' next destination.
