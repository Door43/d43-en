===== translationNotes: =====

  * **touched their eyes and said** - It is not clear whether he touched both men's eyes at the same time or used only his right hand to touch one then the other. As the left hand was customarily used for unclean purposes, it is most likely that he used only his right hand. It is also not clear whether he spoke as he was touching them or touched them first and then spoke to them.
  * **Let it be done to you according to your faith** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "I will do as you have believed" or "Because you believe, I will heal you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **their eyes were opened** - This means they were able to see. This can be stated in active form. AT: "God healed their eyes" or "the two blind men were able to see" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **See that no one knows about this** - Here "See" means "be sure." AT: "Be sure no one finds out about this" or "Do not tell anyone that I healed you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **But** - "Instead." The men did not do what Jesus told them to do.
  * **spread the news** - "told many people what had happened to them"
