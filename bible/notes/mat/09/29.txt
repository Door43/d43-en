===== Translation Notes: =====

This completes the account of Jesus healing two blind men.

  * **touched their eyes and said**  - It is not clear whether he touched both men's eyes at the same time or used only his right hand to touch one then the other. As the left hand was customarily used for unclean purposes, it is most likely that he used only his right hand. It is also not clear whether he spoke as he was touching them or touched them first and then spoke to them.
  * **their eyes were opened**  - "God healed their eyes" or "the two blind men were able to see" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]], [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom|Idiom]])
  * **But**  - "Instead." The men did not do what Jesus told them to do.
  * **spread the news**  - "told many people what had happened to them"
