===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - This begins the account of Jesus healing two blind men.

  * **As Jesus passed by from there** - As Jesus was leaving the region
  * **passed by** - "was leaving" or "was going"
  * **followed him** - This means they were walking behind Jesus, not necessarily that they had become his disciples.
  * **Have mercy on us** - It is implied that they wanted Jesus to heal them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Son of David** - Jesus was not David's literal son, so this may be translated as "Descendant of David." However, "Son of David" is also a title for the Messiah, and the men were probably calling Jesus by this title. 
  * **When Jesus had come into the house** - This could be either Jesus' own house or the house in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:09:10|9:10]].
  * **Yes, Lord** - The full content of their answer is not stated, but it is understood. AT: "Yes, Lord, we believe you can heal us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
