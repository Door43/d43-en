===== Translation Notes: =====

This completes the account of Jesus' healing the daughter of the Jewish official.

  * **When the crowd had been put outside** - "After Jesus had sent the crowd outside" or "After the family had sent the people outside"
  * **got up** - "got out of bed." This is the same idea as in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:08:14|8:15]].
  * **The news about this spread into all that region** - This personification means that the news spread because the people told it to other people. "The people of that whole region heard about it" (UDB) or "The people who saw that the girl was alive started telling everyone in the whole area about it." (See: [[en:ta:translate:personification|]])
