===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to answer the question asked by the disciples of John.

  * **No man puts a piece of new cloth on an old garment** - People who know only the old traditions are not eager to accept new ones. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **garment **- "clothing"
  * **the patch** - "the piece of new cloth" used to cover the torn cloth
