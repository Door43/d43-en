===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of Jesus healing the daughter of the Jewish official.

  * **official's house** - This is the Jewish leader's house.
  * **flute** - This is a long hollow musical instrument, which is played by blowing air in or over one end.
  * **flute-players** - "people who play flutes"
  * **Go away** - Jesus was speaking to many people, so use the plural command form if your language has it.
  * **the girl is not dead, but sleeps ** - Jesus is using the image of sleep because her death would only be for a short time, as he knew he was going to raise her from the dead. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
