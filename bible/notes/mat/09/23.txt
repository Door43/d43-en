===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - This returns to the account of Jesus bringing the daughter of the Jewish official back to life.

  * **official's house** - This is the Jewish leader's house.
  * **the flute players and the crowds making much noise** - This is a common way to mourn for someone who has died.
  * **flute players** - "people who play flutes"
  * **Go away** - Jesus was speaking to many people, so use the plural command form if your language has one.
  * **the girl is not dead, but she is asleep** - Jesus is using a play on words. It was common in Jesus' day to refer to a dead person as one who "sleeps." But here the dead girl will get up, as though she had only been sleeping. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
