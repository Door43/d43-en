\v 17 Neither does anyone pour fresh grape juice into old skin bags to store it. If anyone did that, those skin bags would tear when the juice became wine. The bags would be ruined, and the wine would be spilled on the ground. Instead, people put new wine into new skin bags, and the bags will stretch when the wine ferments. In this way, both the wine and the bags will be safe."

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to answer the question asked by the disciples of John.

  * **Neither do people put new wine into old wineskins**  - This is a metaphor or parable to answer the question of John's disciples, which was "Why do we and the Pharisees often fast, but your disciples do not fast?" (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
  * **Neither do people put ** - "neither does anyone pour" (UDB) or "people never put"
  * **new wine** - "grape juice." This refers to wine that has not fermented yet. If grapes are unknown in your area, use the general term for //fruit//.
  * **old wineskins** - This refers to wineskins that have been used many times.
  * **wineskins ** - These were bags made out of animal skins. They could also be called "wine bags" or "skin bags" (UDB).
  * **the skins burst**  - When the new wine ferments and expands, they would tear open because they could no longer stretch out.
  * **destroyed** - "ruined" (UDB)
  * **fresh wineskins ** - "new wineskins" or "new wine bags." This refers to wineskins that have never been used.
