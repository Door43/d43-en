===== Translation Notes: =====

This begins an account of Jesus healing a paralyzed man.

  * **Jesus entered a boat **- The disciples probably went with Jesus (see UDB).
  * **a boat** - Probably the same boat as in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:08:23|8:23]]. Specify only if you need to avoid confusion.
  * **came into his own city**  - "the city where he was staying" (UDB).
  * **Behold**  - This marks the beginning of another event in the larger story. It may involve different people than the previous events. Your language may have a way of doing this.
  * **they...their** -  those who brought the paralyzed man to Jesus. It may include the paralyzed man himself.
  * **Son** - The man was not Jesus' real son. Jesus was speaking to him politely. If this is confusing, it can also be translated "My friend" or "Young man," or even omitted.
  * **your sins have been forgiven** - "God has forgiven your sins" or "I have forgiven your sins"
