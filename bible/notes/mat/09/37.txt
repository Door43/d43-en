===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus uses a figure of speech about harvesting to tell his disciples how they should respond to the needs of the crowds in the previous section.

  * **harvest...laborers** - "Harvest" is a metaphor for those who will believe in Jesus, and "laborers" is for those who will tell others about Jesus. The word picture is of much food growing (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor|]])
  * **pray to the Lord of the harvest** - "pray to the Lord. He is in charge of the harvest." This harvest refers to people who believe and are added to his kingdom. (See: [[en:ta:translate:Metaphor]])
