===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus uses a figure of speech about harvesting to tell his disciples how they should respond to the needs of the crowds in the previous section.

  * **The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few** - This metaphor compares the great number of people who will believe in God and be added to his kingdom to food growing in a field, and those who tell others about God to the laborers. The point of the metaphor is that there are too few people to tell the many people about God. (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor|]])
  * **harvest** - "ripe food"
  * **laborers** - "workers"
  * **pray to the Lord of the harvest** - "pray to the Lord. He is in charge of the harvest."
