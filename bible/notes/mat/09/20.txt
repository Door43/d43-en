\v 20 Behold, a woman who had severe bleeding for twelve years, came up behind Jesus and touched the edge of his garment;
\v 21 for she had said to herself, "If I only touch his garment, I will be made well."
\v 22 But Jesus turned and saw her, and said, "Daughter, take courage; your faith has made you well." And the woman was  instantly made well.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus and his disciples are on their way to the house of the Jewish official when the woman touches Jesus' garment.

  * **had severe bleeding **- "had a severe flow of blood." She was probably bleeding from her womb even when it was not the normal time for it. Some cultures may have a polite way of referring to this condition. (See: Euphemism)
  * **if I only touch his garment, I will be made well **- She did not believe the garment would heal her. She believed Jesus would heal her. (See: Personification)
  * **garment **- this could also be called "robe"
  * **But Jesus turned and saw her**  - "Then Jesus turned around to see who touched him." (UDB)
  * **Daughter, take courage**  - "Be encouraged, dear woman" (UDB) The woman was not the Jesus' daughter.
  * **your faith has made you well**  - "because you believed I could heal you, I have healed you." (UDB)
