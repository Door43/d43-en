\v 20 Behold, a woman who had severe bleeding for twelve years, came up behind Jesus and touched the edge of his garment;
\v 21 for she had said to herself, "If I only touch his garment, I will be made well."
\v 22 But Jesus turned and saw her, and said, "Daughter, take courage; your faith has made you well." And the woman was  instantly made well.

===== Translation Notes: =====

This describes how Jesus healed another woman while on the way to heal the daughter of the Jewish official.

  * **Behold**  - The word "behold" alerts us to a new person in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this.
  * **had severe bleeding **  - "had a severe flow of blood." She was probably bleeding from her womb even when it was not the normal time for it. Some cultures may have a polite way of referring to this condition. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism|Euphemism]])
  * **If I only touch his garment, I will be made well **  - She did not believe the garment would heal her. She believed Jesus would heal her. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification|Personification]])
  * **garment **  - "robe"
  * **But** - "Instead." What the woman hoped would happen did not happen.
  * **Daughter** - The woman was not Jesus' real daughter. Jesus was speaking to her politely. If this is confusing, it can also be translated "Young woman" or even omitted.
