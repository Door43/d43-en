\v 20 Behold, a woman who suffered from a discharge of blood for twelve years came up behind Jesus and touched the edge of his garment.
\v 21 For she had said to herself, "If only I touch his clothes, I will be made well."
\v 22 But Jesus turned and saw her, and said, "Daughter, take courage; your faith has made you well." And the woman was healed from that hour.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - This describes how Jesus healed another woman while he was on the way to the Jewish official's house.

  * **Behold** - The word "Behold" alerts us to a new person in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this.
  * **who suffered from a discharge of blood** - "who had been bleeding" or "who frequently had a flow of blood." She was probably bleeding from her womb even when it was not the normal time for it. Some cultures may have a polite way of referring to this condition. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **twelve years** - "12 years" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **garment** - "robe"
  * **For she had said to herself, "If only I touch his clothes, I will be made well."** - She thought this before she touched Jesus. You can put this statement earlier as in the UDB. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_events]])
  * **If only I touch his clothes** - According to Jewish law, because she was bleeding she was not supposed to touch anyone. She touches his clothes so that Jesus' power would heal her and yet (she thought) he would not know that she touched him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **But** - "Instead." What the woman hoped would happen did not happen.
  * **Daughter** - The woman was not Jesus' real daughter. Jesus was speaking to her politely. If this is confusing, it can also be translated "Young woman" or even omitted.
  * **your faith has made you well** - "because you believed in me, I will heal you"
  * **the woman was healed from that hour** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Jesus healed her at that moment" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
