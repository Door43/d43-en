===== Translation Notes: =====

These events occur at the house of Matthew the tax collector.

  * **the house** - This is probably Matthew's house (see UDB), but it could also be Jesus' house ("dined with Jesus and his disciples"). Specify only if needed to avoid confusion.
  * **behold**  - The word "behold" alerts us to these new people in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this. English uses "There was a man who was…”
  * **When the Pharisees saw it ** - "When the Pharisees saw that Jesus was eating with the tax collectors and sinful people"
