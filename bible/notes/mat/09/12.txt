\v 13 He continued by saying, "You need to learn what these words that \add God said\add* mean: 'I want you to \add act\add* mercifully to people and not \add just to offer\add* sacrifices.' Keep in mind that I came \add from heaven, not\add* to invite \add people who think\add* \f + \ft irony \f* \add that they are\add* righteous \add to turn away from their sinful lives and come to me, but to invite people who know they are\add* sinners \add to turn from their sins and come to me\add*."
