\v 12 Jesus heard what \add they said\add*, so he told them \add this parable\add*: "\add It is\add* people who are sick who need a \add doctor\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, not people who are well." \add What he meant by that was that it was people who knew that they were sinners who were coming to him in order to be helped spiritually\add*.
\v 13 He continued by saying, "You need to learn what these words that \add God said\add* mean: 'I want you to \add act\add* mercifully to people and not \add just to offer\add* sacrifices.' Keep in mind that I came \add from heaven, not\add* to invite \add people who think\add* \f + \ft irony \f* \add that they are\add* righteous \add to turn away from their sinful lives and come to me, but to invite people who know they are\add* sinners \add to turn from their sins and come to me\add*."

\v 12 When Jesus heard this he said, "People who are strong in body do not need a physician, only people who are sick need one.
\v 13 You should go learn what this means, 'I desire mercy and not sacrifice,' for I came, not to call the righteous to repent, but sinners."
