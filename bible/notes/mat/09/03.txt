\v 3 Some of the men who taught the \add Jewish\add* laws said among themselves, "\add He claims that he can forgive sins! That means that he claims to be equal with God\add*! He is insulting God!"
\v 4 Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said, "You should not think evil \add thoughts\add*, \add accusing me because I claim that I am God\add*!\f + \ft Or: Why do you think evil \add thoughts\add*, \add saying that it is wrong for me to claim that I am God\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 5 It would \add not\add* be risky \add for someone\add* to say \add to this man\add*, '\add I\add* forgive your sins', \add because no one could see whether or not it really happened\add*. But \add no one, without having the power to heal\add*, would say \add to him\add*, '\add Get\add* up and walk!', \add because people could easily see whether it happened or not!\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 6 \add So I am going to do something\add* in order that you may know that \add God\add* has authorized \add me\add*, the one who came from heaven, to forgive the sins \add of people while I am\add* on the earth, \add as well as to heal people\add*." Then he said to the paralyzed man, "Get up, pick up your sleeping pad, and go home!"

\v 3 Some of the men who taught the Jewish laws said among themselves, "This man thinks he is God; he cannot forgive sins!"
\v 4 Jesus knew what they were thinking, so he said, "You should not think evil thoughts!
\v 5 What is easier, to tell him that his sins are forgiven or to tell him to get up and walk?
\v 6 So I am going to do something in order that you may know that God has authorized me, the Son of Man, to forgive sins." Then he said to the paralyzed man, "Get up, pick up your sleeping pad, and go home!"

\v 3 Behold, some of the scribes said among themselves, "This man is blaspheming."
\v 4 Jesus knew their thoughts and said, "Why are you thinking evil in your hearts?
\v 5 For which is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?
\v 6 But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,..." he said to the paralytic, "Get up, pick up your mat, and go to your house."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Behold** - This marks the beginning of another event in the larger story. It may involve different people than the previous events. Your language may have a way of doing this.
  * **among themselves** - Possible meanings are 1) each one was thinking to himself, or 2) they were speaking among themselves.
  * **blaspheming** - Jesus was claiming to be able to do things the scribes thought only God can do.
  * **knew their thoughts** - Jesus knew what they were thinking either supernaturally or because he could see them talking to each other.
  * **Why are you thinking evil in your hearts?** - Jesus used this question to rebuke the scribes. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **evil** - This is moral evil or wickedness, not simply error in fact.
  * **in your hearts** - Here "hearts" refers to their minds or their thoughts. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **For which is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?** - Jesus uses a question to challenge the scribes. He does not mean one action is harder for him than the other. He is reminding the scribes that they believe when God heals a person's body it means he has forgiven them of their sins. AT: "For you know it is just as easy to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' as it is to say, 'Get up and walk.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **which is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?** - This can be translated as an indirect quotation. AT: "it is just as easy to tell a person his sins are forgiven as it is to tell him to get up and walk." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **Your sins are forgiven** - Here "your" is singular. This can be stated in active form. AT: "I have forgiven your sins." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **that you may know** - "I will prove to you." The "you" is plural. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **your mat...your house** - Here "you" is singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **go to your house** - Jesus is not forbidding the man to go elsewhere. He is giving the man the opportunity to go home.
