The arrival of Jesus' mother and brothers becomes an opportunity for him to describe his spiritual family.

  * **him who told him ** - "the person who had told Jesus his mother and brothers were waiting to see him"
  * **Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?**  - Alternate translation: "I will tell you who is really my mother and brothers." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **whoever** - "anyone"
