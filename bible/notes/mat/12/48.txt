===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - This is the end of the part of the story that began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:12:01|12:1]], where the writer tells of growing opposition to Jesus' ministry.

  * **who told him** - The details of the message the person told Jesus are understood and not repeated here. AT: "who told Jesus that his mother and brothers wanted to speak to him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **Who is my mother and who are my brothers?** - Jesus uses these questions to teach the people. AT: "I will tell you who are really my mother and brothers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **See** - "Look." This adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.
  * **here are my mother and my brothers** - This is a metaphor that means Jesus' disciples belong to Jesus' spiritual family. This is more important than belonging to his physical family. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **whoever** - "anyone"
  * **Father** - This is an important title for God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
