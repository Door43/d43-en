===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **said to// him//  who told him **- Jesus is talking about the person (in verse 47) who told Jesus his mother and brothers were waiting to see him.
  * **Who is my mother? And who are my brothers**  - This rhetorical question could be translated as "I will tell you who is really like family to me." Jesus was not asking for information. Some languages would use a rhetorical question. (See: Rhetorical Question.)
  * **Verse 50**  -See UDB for meaning.
