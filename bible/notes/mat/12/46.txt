===== Translation Notes: =====

The arrival of Jesus' mother and brothers becomes an opportunity for him to describe his spiritual family.

  * **his mother** - Jesus' human mother
  * **his brothers** - This can mean 1) brothers within the same nuclear or extended family (see UDB) or 2) close friends or associates within Israel.
  * **seeking** - "wanting"
