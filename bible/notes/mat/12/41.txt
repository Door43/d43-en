<usfm> \v 41 When \add God\add* judges \add all people\add*, the people who lived in Nineveh will stand \add in front of him\add* with \add you\add* people who \add have seen me perform miracles\add*. The \add people of Nineveh turned from their sinful ways as a result of hearing what\add* Jonah preached. \add Jonah was important, but I\add*, who am more important than Jonah, \add have come and preached to you, but you have not turned from your sinful ways.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 41 When God judges everyone, the people who lived in the city of Nineveh will stand in front of him beside you people. But they stopped sinning when Jonah warned them. Now I have come to you, and I am far more important than Jonah was, but you have not stopped sinning. So God will judge you. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 41 The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, for they repented at Jonah's preaching, and, see, someone greater than Jonah is here. </usfm>

===== Important Terms: =====

  * Nineveh
  * judgment
  * condemn
  * repented
  * Jonah
  * preaching

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The men of Nineveh****will stand up in judgment**
 - Jesus continues his metaphor of the prophet Jonah, whose preaching of coming judgment to Nineveh brought repentance..
  * **this generation**  - “the people living at this time”, meaning "the people who heard Jesus' preaching"
  * **and behold, someone greater**  - The word “behold” alerts us to the importance of the person who is greater than Jonah in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this. English uses “There is someone who is even greater…” When Jesus said this, he was talking about himself.
