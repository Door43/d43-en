<usfm> \v 43 "\add Sometimes\add* when an evil spirit leaves a person, it wanders around in desolate areas, seeking \add someone in whom it can\add* rest. If it does not find anyone, \v 44 it says \add to itself\add*, 'I will return to the person \f + \ft metaphor \f* in whom I used to live.' So it goes back \add and finds that the Spirit of God is not in control of that\add* person's \add life. The person's life is like\add* a house that has been swept clean and everything put in order \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add but it is\add* empty. \v 45 Then \add this evil spirit\add* goes and gets seven other spirits that are \add even\add* more evil, and they \add all\add* enter \add that person\add* and \add begin\add* living there. \add So, although\add* that person's condition \add was bad\add* before, it becomes much worse. That is what \add you\add* wicked people who \add have heard me teach\add* will experience."

<usfm> \v 43 "Sometimes when an evil spirit leaves a person, it wanders around in desolate areas, seeking someone in whom he can rest. If he does not find anyone, \v 44 he says to itself, 'I will return to the person in whom I used to live.’ So he goes back and finds that the Spirit of God is not in control of that person's life. The person's life is like a house that has been swept clean and everything put in order, but it is empty. \v 45 Then this evil spirit goes and gets seven other spirits that are even more evil, and they all enter that person and begin living there. So although that person's condition was bad before, it becomes much worse. That is what you wicked people who have heard me teach will experience."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 43 But an unclean spirit, when he has gone out from a man, passes through waterless places looking for rest, but does not find it. \v 44 Then he says, "I will return to my house from where I came." When he has gone back, he finds it empty, swept, and put in order. \v 45 Then he goes and takes with himself seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and live there. Then the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. It will be just like that with this evil generation." </usfm>
