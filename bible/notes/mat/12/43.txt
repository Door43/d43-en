\v 43 "\add Sometimes\add* when an evil spirit leaves a person, it wanders around in desolate areas, seeking \add someone in whom it can\add* rest. If it does not find anyone,
\v 44 it says \add to itself\add*, 'I will return to the person \f + \ft metaphor \f* in whom I used to live.' So it goes back \add and finds that the Spirit of God is not in control of that\add* person's \add life. The person's life is like\add* a house that has been swept clean and everything put in order \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add but it is\add* empty.
\v 45 Then \add this evil spirit\add* goes and gets seven other spirits that are \add even\add* more evil, and they \add all\add* enter \add that person\add* and \add begin\add* living there. \add So, although\add* that person's condition \add was bad\add* before, it becomes much worse. That is what \add you\add* wicked people who \add have heard me teach\add* will experience."

\v 43 "Sometimes when an evil spirit leaves a person, it wanders around in desolate areas, seeking someone in whom he can rest. If he does not find anyone,
\v 44 he says to itself, 'I will return to the person in whom I used to live.' So he  goes back and finds that the Spirit of God is not in control of that person's life. The person's life is like a house that has been swept clean and everything put in order, but it is empty.
\v 45 Then this evil spirit goes and gets seven other spirits that are even more evil, and they all enter that person and begin living there. So although that person's condition was bad before, it becomes much worse. That is what you wicked people who have heard me teach will experience."

<usfm>
\v 43 When an unclean spirit has gone away from a man, it passes through waterless places and looks for rest, but does not find it. 
\v 44 Then it says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.' Having returned, it finds that house swept out and put in order.
\v 45 Then it goes and takes along with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they all come in to live there. Then the final condition of that man becomes worse than the first. It will be just like that with this evil generation."
