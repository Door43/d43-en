\v 38 Then some of the Pharisees and men who taught the \add Jewish\add* laws responded \add to what Jesus was teaching\add* by saying to him, "Teacher, we want to see you \add perform\add* a miracle \add that would prove to us that God sent you\add*."
\v 39 Then Jesus said to them, "\add You\add* people \add have already seen me perform miracles\add*, but you are evil, and you do not faithfully worship God \f + \ft metaphor \f*! You want \add me to perform\add* a miracle \add that would prove to you that God sent me\add*, but \add God will enable\add* you to see only one miracle. It will be \add like\add* what happened to Jonah the prophet \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 40 Jonah was in the stomach of a huge fish for three days and nights \add before God caused him to live again\add*. Similarly, for three days and nights I, the one who came from heaven, will be in a place \add where dead people are, and then God will cause me to live again\add*.

\v 38 Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the Jewish laws responded to Jesus, "Teacher, we want to see you perform a miracle that will convince us that God sent you."
\v 39 Then Jesus said to them, "You people have already seen me perform miracles, but you are evil, and you do not faithfully worship God! You want me to prove that God sent me, but God will show you only one miracle. It will be like what happened to Jonah the prophet.
\v 40 Jonah was in the stomach of a huge fish for three days and nights before God caused him to come out. Similarly, for three days and nights I, the Son of Man, will be deep in the earth, and then God will cause me to live again.

\v 38 Then certain scribes and Pharisees answered Jesus and said, "Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you."
\v 39 But Jesus answered and said to them, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet. 
\v 40 For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the big fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus rebukes the unbelieving scribes and Pharisees because they demanded that he perform a sign after he had healed the blind, demon possessed man.

  * **wish** - "want"
  * **evil and adulterous generation** - People living at this time loved doing evil and were unfaithful to God.
  * **no sign will be given to it** - "God will not give a sign to this evil and adulterous generation." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the sign of Jonah** - This could be translated as "what happened to Jonah" or "the miracle that God did for Jonah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in the heart of the earth** - inside a physical grave (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
