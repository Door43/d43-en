===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 42 The queen from Sheba, south of Israel, who lived long ago, came from a distant region in order to listen to King Solomon teach many wise things. Now I have come to you, and I am far more important than Solomon was, but you have not stopped sinning. So when God judges everyone, the queen of Sheba will stand in front of him beside you people, and she will condemn you."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **queen of the south**  - This refers to the Queen of Sheba. Sheba was a kingdom south of Israel.
  * **will rise up in the judgment with**  - “will also stand up and judge”
  * **she came from the ends of the earth**  - “she came a very great distance.” “From the ends of the earth” is an idiom that means “from a place very far away.” (See: [[https://door43.org/en/ta/figuresofspeech/idiom|Idiom]])
  *

**behold, someone greater**  - The word “behold” alerts us to the importance of the person who is greater than the Queen of the South in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this. English uses “There is someone who is even greater…” When Jesus said this, he was talking about himself.
  *

**someone greater than Solomon is here**  - The rebuke that Jesus wanted them to understand was “but you have not listened to me.”
