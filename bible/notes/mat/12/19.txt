\v 20 Until he has justly judged \add the people who trust in him and\add* has declared them not guilty, he will not destroy \add anyone who is weak like\add* a smashed stalk \f + \ft metaphor \f*, nor will he silence \add anyone who is helpless like\add* a smoldering \add linen\add* wick \f + \ft metaphor, doublet \f*.
\v 21 As a result, the non-Jews will confidently expect \add that he will do great things for them\add*.
