\v 19 He will not quarrel \add with people\add*, neither will he shout. He will not \add teach with\add* a loud voice in the \add main\add* streets.
\v 20 Until he has justly judged \add the people who trust in him and\add* has declared them not guilty, he will not destroy \add anyone who is weak like\add* a smashed stalk \f + \ft metaphor \f*, nor will he silence \add anyone who is helpless like\add* a smoldering \add linen\add* wick \f + \ft metaphor, doublet \f*.
\v 21 As a result, the non-Jews will confidently expect \add that he will do great things for them\add*.

\v 20 He will be gentle with the weak people;
\q If a person is barely alive, he will not kill him.
\q And he will judge the people with justice and declare that they are not guilty.

===== Translation Notes: =====

This account continues to explain how the actions of Jesus fulfilled one of the prophecies of Isaiah. These words are God's words that Isaiah wrote down.

  * **He will not break any bruised reed **- "he will not beat down weak people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **bruised**  - "partially broken or damaged"
  * **smoking flax**- a lamp wick after the flame has been blown out, representing people who are helpless or doomed (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **Until**  - This can be translated with a new sentence: "This is what he will do until "
  * **he sends forth judgment to victory**  - "he convinces people that I am just"
  * **in his name** - AT: "in him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
