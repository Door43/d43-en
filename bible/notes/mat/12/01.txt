\v 1 On a Sabbath at that time, Jesus and the disciples were walking past some grain fields. Because the disciples were hungry, they began to pick some of the heads of grain and eat them, something that the law of Moses allowed.
\v 2 Some Pharisees saw them doing that, so they said to Jesus, "Look! Your disciples are doing work on our day of rest. The law does not allow that!"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This is the beginning of a new part of the story where the writer tells of growing opposition to Jesus' ministry. Here, the Pharisees criticize his disciples for picking grain on the Sabbath.

  * **At that time** - This marks a new part of the story. AT: "A little later"
  * **grainfields** - a place to plant grain. If wheat is unknown and "grain" is too general, then you can use "fields of the plant they made bread from." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **pluck heads of grain and eat them ... do what is unlawful to do on the Sabbath** - Picking grain in others' fields and eating it was not considered stealing. The question was whether one could do this otherwise lawful activity on the Sabbath.
  * **to pluck heads of grain and eat them** - "to pick some of the wheat and eat it" or "to pick some of the grain and eat it"
  * **heads of grain** - This is the topmost part of the wheat plant. It holds the mature grain or seeds of the plant.
  * **the Pharisees** - This does not mean all of the Pharisees. AT: "some Pharisees"
  * **See** - "Look." The Pharisees use this word to draw attention to what the disciples are doing.
