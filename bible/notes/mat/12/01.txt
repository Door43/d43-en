\v 1 On a Sabbath at that time, Jesus and the disciples were walking past some grain fields. Because the disciples were hungry, they began to pick some of the heads of grain and eat them, something that the law of Moses allowed.
\v 2 Some Pharisees saw them doing that, so they said to Jesus, "Look! Your disciples are doing work on our day of rest. The law does not allow that!"

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus defends his disciples when the Pharisees criticize them for picking grain to satisfy their hunger on the Sabbath.

  * **grainfields**  - a place to plant grain. If wheat is unknown and "grain" is too general, "fields of the plant they made bread from."
  * **pluck heads of grain and eat them...do what is unlawful to do on the Sabbath** - Plucking grain in others' fields and eating it was not considered stealing (see UDB). The question was whether one could do this otherwise lawful activity on the Sabbath.
  * **them **  - the heads of grain
  * **heads of grain**  - This is the topmost part of the wheat plant, which is a kind of large grass. It holds the mature grain or seeds of the plant.
  * **See**  - Alternative translation: "Look" or "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you."
