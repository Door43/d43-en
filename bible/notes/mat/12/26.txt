===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 26 In the same way, if Satan were driving out his own demons, he would be fighting against himself. He will not be able to continue to rule over his servants!
\v 27 Furthermore, if it is true that Satan enables me to drive out demons, is it also true that your disciples who drive them out do so by Satan's power? No! So they will show you that you are not thinking logically.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 26 If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand?
\v 27 And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your followers drive them out? Because of this, they will be your judges.

===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues an account of the Pharisees saying that it was by the power of Satan that Jesus healed a man.

  * **If Satan drives out Satan** - "If Satan works against his own kingdom" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **how will his kingdom stand** - “Satan's kingdom cannot stand,” or “Satan's kingdom will fall apart.” (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **drive out** - "force out" or "cast out" or "throw out" or "put out"
  * **by whom do your followers drive them out ** - Alternate translation: "it must also be the power of Beelzebul that enables your followers to drive out demons" (or see UDB). (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **they will be your judges ** - Alternate translation: “your followers who cast out demons by God's power will judge you for saying that I cast out demons by Beelzebul's power.”
