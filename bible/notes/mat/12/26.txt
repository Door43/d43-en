===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 26 In the same way, if Satan were driving out his own demons, he would be fighting against himself. He will not be able to continue to rule over his servants!
\v 27 Furthermore, if it is true that Satan enables me to drive out demons, is it also true that your disciples who drive them out do so by Satan's power? No! So they will show you that you are not thinking logically.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 26 If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand?
\v 27 And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your followers drive them out? Because of this, they will be your judges.
