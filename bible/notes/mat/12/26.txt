\v 26 In the same way, if Satan were driving out his own demons, he would be fighting against himself. His kingdom would not continue!
\v 27 Furthermore, if it is true that Satan enables me to drive out demons, is it also true that your disciples who drive them out do so by Satan's power? No! So they will show you that you are not thinking logically.
