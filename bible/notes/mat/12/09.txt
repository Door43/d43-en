\v 10 \add He saw\add* a man with a shriveled hand there. \add The Pharisees thought that Jesus would be disobeying the tradition about not working on the day of rest if he healed the man, so one of\add* them asked him, "Does \add God\add* permit \add us\add* to heal \add people\add* on our day of rest?" \add They asked that question\add* so that they might accuse him \add if he healed someone\add* on the Sabbath\f + \ft Or: on the Jewish rest day \f*.

<usfm>
\v 9 After Jesus left there that day, he went into a synagogue.
\v 10 There he saw a man with a shriveled hand. The Pharisees kept wanting to debate with Jesus about the Sabbath, so one of them asked him, "Does God permit us to heal people on our day of rest?" They were hoping that Jesus would commit a sin by saying something wrong.

\v 9 Then Jesus left from there and went into their synagogue.
\v 10 Behold, there was a man having a dried up hand. The Pharisees asked Jesus, saying, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?" so that they might accuse him of sinning.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus responds to the Pharisees who criticized him for healing a man on the Sabbath.

  * **Then Jesus left from there** - "Jesus left the grainfields"
  * **their** - the synagogue of the Pharisees to whom he was talking
  * **Behold** -  The word "behold" alerts us to a new person in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this.
  * **a dried up hand** - "shriveled" or "bent into a fist"
