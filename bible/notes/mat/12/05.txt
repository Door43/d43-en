\v 5 Also, think about the laws that \add Moses wrote\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. He said that \add even though\add* the priests, \add by working\add* in the Temple on our Jewish day of rest, are not obeying the Jewish day of rest \add laws\add*, they are not guilty. You have surely read that, \add but you do not understand what it means\add*.
\v 6 Note this: \add God allows men to work in\add* the Temple \add on our rest day because that work must be done. But in addition, I\add* tell you that\add I have\add* more \add authority than the authority of\add* the Temple. So, it is more important for you to obey my teachings than to obey your traditions about our rest day.

\v 5 Also, surely you have read what Moses wrote, when he said that even though the priests, by working in the temple on our Sabbath day, are not obeying the Jewish day of rest laws, they are not guilty.
\v 6 Let me tell you what this means: I have come to you, and I am more important than the temple.

\v 5 And have you not read in the law, that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath but are guiltless?
\v 6 But I say to you that one greater than the temple is here.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to respond to the Pharisees.

  * **and have you not read in the law ... but are guiltless?** - Jesus uses a question to respond to the criticism of the Pharisees. Jesus is challenging them to think about the meaning of what they have read in the scriptures. AT: "And, you have read in the law of Moses ... but are guiltless" 
  * **profane the Sabbath** - "do on the Sabbath what they would do on any other day"
  * **are guiltless** - "God will not punish them" or "God does not consider them guilty"
  * **I say to you** - This adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.
  * **one greater than the temple** - "someone who is more important than the temple." Jesus was referring to himself as the one greater. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
