\v 5 Also, think about the laws that \add Moses wrote\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. He said that \add even though\add* the priests, \add by working\add* in the Temple on our Jewish day of rest, are not obeying the Jewish day of rest \add laws\add*, they are not guilty. You have surely read that, \add but you do not understand what it means\add*.
\v 6 Note this: \add God allows men to work in\add* the Temple \add on our rest day because that work must be done. But in addition, I\add* tell you that\add I have\add* more \add authority than the authority of\add* the Temple. So, it is more important for you to obey my teachings than to obey your traditions about our rest day.

\v 5 Also, surely you have read what Moses wrote, when he said that even though the priests, by working in the temple on our Sabbath day, are not obeying the Jewish day of rest laws, they are not guilty.
\v 6 Let me tell you what this means: I have come to you, and I am more important than the temple, so what I teach is more important for you to obey than what our ancestors said about the Sabbath day.

\v 5 And have you not read in the law, that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath but are guiltless?
\v 6 But I say to you that one greater than the temple is here.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to defend his disciples when the Pharisees criticize them for picking grain to eat on the Sabbath.

  * **you...you** - the Pharisees
  * **have you not read in the law ** - "You have read the law, so you know that it says" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **profane the Sabbath** - "do on the Sabbath what they would do on any other day"
  * **are guiltless** - "God is not going to punish them"
  * **one greater than the temple** - "someone who is more important than the temple." Jesus was referring to himself as the one greater.
