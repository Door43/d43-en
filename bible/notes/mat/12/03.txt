===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **them - **  the Pharisees
  * **Have you not ever read**  - This is the beginning of a rhetorical question. Jesus is mildly rebuking them for not learning from what they read. It could be translated as “It is written in the Scriptures.” (UDB) or “You should learn from what you have read” (See: [[https://door43.org/en/ta/figuresofspeech/rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **you - **  the Pharisees
  * **he - **  David
  * **him - **  David
  * **those - **  men who with David
  * **but lawful for the priests?**  -  This rhetorical question could possibly be translated "but God did not consider it wrong".
