  * **them** - The pronoun "them" refers to the Pharisees

It could be translated as “It is written in the Scriptures” (UDB) or “You should learn from what you have read.” (See: [[:en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion]])
  * **you** - The pronouns "you" refers to the Pharisees
  * **he** - The pronouns "he" and "him" refers to David
  * **bread of the presence** - bread that was given to God and on display to him. (UBD)
  * **those who were with him** - "the men who were with David"
  * **lawful only for the priests** - "only priests were permitted to eat it." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion]])
