===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to defend his disciples when the Pharisees criticize them for picking grain to eat on the Sabbath.

  * **them...you** - the Pharisees
  * **Have you never read** - Jesus is mildly rebuking the Pharisees for not learning from what they read. Alternate translation: "You should learn from what you have read about." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **he...him** - David
  * **bread of the presence** - bread that was given to God and on display before him (UBD)
  * **those who were with him** - "the men who were with David"
  * **lawful only for the priests** - "only priests were permitted to eat it" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
