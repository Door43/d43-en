  * **this miracle**  - the miracle of the healing of a blind, deaf and demon possessed man.
  * **This man**  - "Jesus"
  * **cast out demons except by Beelzebub **- They are saying that Jesus is only able to cast out a demon because he is a servant of Satan.
  * **But Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them **- The pronouns "their" and "them" refer to the Pharisees.
  * **Jesus knew their thoughts**  - Jesus, though a human being, was also fully God and had God's wisdom to know what people were thinking.
  * **Every kingdom divided against itself is made desolate, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand **- This is a doublet using two metonyms referring to the people of the kingdom and the people of the city or house.
