\v 16 Before King Herod died, he realized that those men had tricked him, and he became furious. Because he thought that Jesus was still near Bethlehem, Herod sent soldiers there to kill all the boy babies two years old and younger. Herod calculated how old the baby was, according to what the men who studied the stars told him about when the star first appeared.

===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of what happened when Jesus was born as the King of the Jews.

  * **Then Herod** - This describes what Herod did after Joseph fled to Egypt with Mary and Jesus. Herod does not die until [[:en:bible:notes:mat:02:19|2:19]].
  * **he had been mocked** - "the learned men had embarrassed him by tricking him" (see UDB)
  * **He sent and killed all the male children **- Alternative translation: "He gave orders to kill all the boys" or "He sent soldiers there to kill all the boy babies." (UDB)
