Stay there until I tell you that you should leave, because King Herod is about to send soldiers to look for the child so that they can kill him."
\v 14 So Joseph got up that same night; he took the child and his mother, and they fled into Egypt.
\v 15 They stayed there until King Herod died, and then they left Egypt again. In this way, what God had told the prophet Hosea to write came true,
\q "I have called my son to come out of Egypt."

\v 13 After they had departed, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Get up, take the young child and his mother, and flee to Egypt. Remain there until I tell you, for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him."
\v 14 That night Joseph rose and took the young child and his mother and departed into Egypt.
\v 15 He remained there until the death of Herod. This fulfilled what the Lord had spoken through the prophet, "Out of Egypt I have called my son."

===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of what happened when Jesus was born as the King of the Jews.

  * **they had departed** - "the learned men had departed"
  * **appeared to Joseph in a dream** - "came to Joseph while he was dreaming"
  * **Get up, take...flee...Remain...you** - God is speaking to Joseph, so these should all be singular forms. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **until I tell you** - The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. AT: "until I tell you it is safe to come back." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **I tell you** - Here "I" refers to God. The angel is speaking for God.
  * **He remained** - It is implied that Joseph, Mary, and Jesus remained in Egypt. AT: "They remained." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **until the death of Herod** - Herod does not die until [[:en:bible:notes:mat:02:19|2:19]]. This statement describes the length of their stay in Egypt, and does not say that Herod died at this time.
  * **Out of Egypt I have called my son** - Matthew is quoting the prophet Hosea. The wording of the Greek text in Matthew is somewhat different than the Hebrew text in Hosea. The emphasis is on "out of Egypt," not some other place: "It is out of Egypt that I have called my son."
  * **my son** - In Hosea this refers to the people of Israel. In Matthew it refers to Jesus. Translate "son" with the same word the language would naturally use to refer to a human son. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
