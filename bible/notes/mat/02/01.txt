\v 1 Jesus was born in the town of Bethlehem in the province of Judea during the time that King Herod the Great ruled there. Some time after Jesus was born, some men from very far away to the east who studied the stars came to the city of Jerusalem.
\v 2 They asked people, "Where is the one who has been born in order that he might become the king of you Jews? We have seen a star in the east that shows us he has been born, so we have come to worship him."
\p
\v 3 When King Herod heard about what those men were asking, he became very worried. Many of the people in Jerusalem also became worried.

===== Translation Notes: =====

This chapter describes what happened when Jesus was born as the King of the Jews.

  * **Bethlehem of Judea **- "the town of Bethlehem in the province of Judea" (UDB)
  * **learned men **- "men who studied the stars" (UDB)
  * **Herod **- This refers to Herod the Great.
  * **Where is he who was born King of the Jews?**  - The men knew that the one who would become king had been born. They were trying to learn where he was. "A baby who will become the king of the Jews has been born. Where is he?"
  * **his star**  - "the star that tells about him" or "the star that is associated with his birth." They were not saying that the baby was the rightful owner of the star.
  * **worship**  - Possible meanings for this word are 1) they intended to worship the baby as divine, or 2) they wanted to "honor" him as a human king. If your language has a word that includes both meanings, you should consider using it here.
  * **he was troubled**  - "He was worried" that someone else might be proclaimed king of the Jews to replace him.
  * **all Jerusalem**  - "Many of the people in Jerusalem" (UDB) were afraid of what King Herod might do.
