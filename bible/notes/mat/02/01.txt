\v 1 Jesus was born in the town of Bethlehem in the province of Judea during the time that King Herod the Great ruled there. Some time after Jesus was born, some men from very far away to the east who studied the stars came to the city of Jerusalem.
\v 2 They asked people, "Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We have seen a star in the east that shows us he has been born, so we have come to worship him."
\p
\v 3 When King Herod heard about what those men were asking, he became very worried. Many of the people in Jerusalem also became worried.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - A new part of the story begins here and continues through the end of the chapter. The writer tells about Herod's attempt to kill the new King of the Jews.

  * **Bethlehem of Judea** - "the town of Bethlehem in the province of Judea" 
  * **in the days of Herod the king** - "when Herod was king there"
  * **Herod** - This refers to Herod the Great.
  * **learned men** - "men who studied the stars" 
  * **from the east** - "from a country far east of Judea"
  * **Where is he who was born King of the Jews?** - The men knew from studying the stars that the one who would become king had been born. They were trying to learn where he was. AT: "A baby who will become the king of the Jews has been born. Where is he?"
  * **his star** - They were not saying that the baby was the rightful owner of the star. AT: "the star that tells about him" or "the star that is associated with his birth"
  * **in the east** - "as it came up in the east" or "while we were in our country"
  * **worship** - Possible meanings are 1) they intended to worship the baby as divine, or 2) they wanted to honor him as a human king. If your language has a word that includes both meanings, you should consider using it here.
  * **he was troubled** - "he was worried." Herod was worried that this baby would replace him as king.
  * **all Jerusalem** - Here "Jerusalem" refers to the people. Also, "all" means "many." Matthew is exaggerating to emphasize how many people were worried. AT: "many of the people in Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole|Hyperbole]])
