======  Matthew 02 General Notes ======

=== Formatting in this chapter ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent all the lines of verses 6 and 18, which are quotations from the Old Testament. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== His star ==

This is probably a reference to a star, which the learned men believed to be a [[:en:obe:kt:sign|sign]] of the [[:en:obe:kt:christ|messiah]] or a special leader. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Learned men ==

English translations use many different words to translate this phrase. This includes the terms "magi" and "wise men." These men could have been scientists or astrologers. It is best to translate this with the generic term, "learned men," if possible.

== Get up, take the young child and his mother, and flee to Egypt. Remain there ==

Languages often translate a series of events in a narrative differently. It may be necessary to form this construction different. One possible suggestion is: "get up, and then flee with your young child and his mother to Egypt, and then remain there."
