====== Matthew 02 General Notes ======

=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent all the lines of verses 6 and 18, which are quotations from the Old Testament. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "His star" ==

This is probably a reference to a star that the learned men believed to be the sign of a new king of Israel. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sign]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "Learned men" ==

English translations use many different words to translate this phrase. These terms include "magi" and "wise men." These men could have been scientists or astrologers. It is best to translate this with the generic term, "learned men," if possible.
