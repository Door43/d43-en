\v 17 When Herod did this, what the prophet Jeremiah had written long ago came true, when he wrote about Bethlehem near the town of Ramah:
\q
\v 18 Women in Ramah were weeping and wailing loudly. 
\q Rachel, the ancestor of those women, was weeping for their dead children. 
\q People tried to comfort her, but they could not, because all the children were dead.

\v 17 Then was fulfilled what had been spoken through Jeremiah the prophet,
\q
\v 18 "A voice was heard in Ramah,
\q weeping and great mourning,
\q Rachel weeping for her children,
\q and she refused to be comforted, because they were no more."

===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of what happened when Jesus was born as the King of the Jews.

 * Verse 18 is a quotation from Jeremiah [[en:bible:notes:jer:31:15|31:15]]. The wording of the Greek text in Matthew is slightly different than the Hebrew text in Jeremiah.
