\v 17 When Herod did this, what the prophet Jeremiah had written long ago came true, when he wrote about Bethlehem near the town of Ramah:
\q
\v 18 Women in Ramah were weeping and wailing loudly. 
\q Rachel, the ancestor of those women, was weeping for their dead children. 
\q People tried to comfort her, but they could not, because all the children were dead.
