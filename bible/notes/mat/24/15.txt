\v 15 Therefore, when you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand),
\v 16 let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains,
\v 17 let him who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house,
\v 18 and let him who is in the field not return to take his cloak.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the abomination of desolation** - "the shameful one who defiles the things of God"
  * **which was spoken of by Daniel the prophet** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "about which Daniel the prophet wrote" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **let the reader understand** - This is not Jesus speaking. Matthew added this to alert the reader that Jesus was using words that they would need to think about and interpret.
  * **let him who is on the housetop** - Housetops where Jesus lived were flat, and people could stand on them.
