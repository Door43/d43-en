\v 15 Therefore, when you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy 
place (let the reader understand),
\v 16 let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, 
\v 17 let him who is on the housetop not go down to take out anything that is in his house, 
\v 18 and let him who is in the field not return to take his cloak.
