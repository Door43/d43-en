\v 6 You will hear about wars \add that are close\add* and wars that are far away, but do not let that trouble you. Keep in mind that \add God has said that\add* those things must happen. But \add when they happen\add*, it will not mean that the end \add of the world\add* has come!
\v 7 \add Groups in various\add* countries will fight each other, and \add various\add* governments \add will also fight\add* against each other. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
\v 8 These things will happen first. Then there will be other things that \add will happen before I return. What will happen will be as painful as\add* birth pains \f + \ft metaphor \f*.

\v 7 People groups will attack each other, and kings will lead armies against each other. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
\v 8 These things will happen first, but they will be like when a woman starts to suffer pain before she gives birth to a child.

\v 6 You will hear of wars and reports of wars; see that you are not troubled, for 
these things must happen; but the end is not yet.
\v 7 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various 
places.
\v 8 But all these things are only the beginning of birth pains.
