\v 43 You know that if the owners of a house knew at what time in the night thieves would come, they would be awake and prevent the thieves from breaking into their houses. Similarly I \add will come just like unexpectedly as a thief\add*.
\v 44 So you need to be ready \add for my return\add*, because \add I\add*, the one who came from heaven, will return \add to the earth\add* at a time when you do not expect \add me to come\add*."

\v 43 You know that if the owner of a house knew at what time in the night thieves would come, he would be awake and prevent the thieves from breaking in. Similarly, I will come as unexpectedly as a thief.
\v 44 So you need to be ready for my return, because I, the Son of Man, will return to the earth at a time when you do not expect me to come."

\v 43 But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would have been on guard and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.
\v 44 Therefore you must also be ready, for the Son of Man will come in an hour that you do not expect.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus tells his disciples how to get ready for his return.

  * **the thief** - Jesus is saying he will come when people are not expecting him, not that he will come to steal.
  * **he would have been on guard** - "he would have guarded his house" to keep it safe
  * **and would not have allowed his house to be broken into** - "he would not have allowed anyone to get into his house to steal things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
