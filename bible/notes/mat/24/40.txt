\v 40 When I \add return\add*, I \add will not take all people up to heaven. I will take only those who trust in me. For example\add*, two \add people\add* will be in the fields. One of them will be taken \f + \ft Or:\add I\add* will take one of them \f* up \add to heaven\add* and the other \add person\add* will be left \f + \ft Or:and I will leave the other \add person\add* \f* \add here to be punished\add*.
\v 41 \add Similarly\add*, two \add women\add* will be at the mill grinding grain. One of them will be taken up \add to heaven\add* and the other will be left.
\v 42 So, because you do not know what day \add I\add*, your Lord, will return \add to the earth\add*, you need to be ready \add for me to return at any time\add*.

\v 40 When I return, I will not take all people up to heaven. I will take only those who trust in me. For example, two people will be in the fields. One of them will be taken up to heaven and the other person will be left here to be punished.
\v 41 Similarly, two women will be grinding grain with a handmill. One of them will be taken up to heaven and the other will be left.
\v 42 So, because you do not know what day I, your Lord, will return to the earth, you need to be ready for me to return at any time.
