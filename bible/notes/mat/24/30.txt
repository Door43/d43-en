\v 30 After that, everyone will see something in the sky that indicates that I, the Son of Man, am returning to the earth. Then unbelieving people from all people groups on earth will wail because they will be afraid of God punishing them. They will see me, the Son of Man, coming on the clouds with power and great glory as I return to the earth.
\v 31 I will send my angels to the earth from everywhere in the heavens. When they hear the trumpet's loud blast, they will gather together God's people—the ones he has chosen—from across the whole earth."
