  * **he is near** - Jesus is speaking about himself in the third person. AT: "the time for me to come is near." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **close to the gates** - Jesus uses the imagery of a king or important official getting close to the gates of a walled city. It is a metaphor meaning the time for Jesus to come is soon. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
