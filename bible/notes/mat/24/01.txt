===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus begins to describe events that will happen before he comes again during the end times.

  * **from the temple** - It is implied that Jesus was not in the temple itself. He was in the courtyard around the temple. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Do you not see all these things?** - Jesus uses a question to make the disciples think deeply about what he will tell them. AT: "Let me tell you something about all these buildings." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Truly I say to you** - "I tell you the truth." This adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.
  * **not one stone will be left on another which will not be torn down** - It is implied that enemy soldiers will tear down the stones. This can be stated in active form. AT: "when the enemy soldiers come, they will tear down every stone in these buildings" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
