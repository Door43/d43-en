\v 23-24 "At that time people will appear who will say that they are me, the Christ, or that they are true prophets from God. They will perform many kinds of miracles and amazing things, in order to deceive people. They will even try to deceive you people whom God has chosen. So at that time, if someone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or if someone says, 'There is the Christ!' do not believe it!
\v 25 Do not forget that I have warned you about all this before it happens.

\v 23 Then if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or, 'There is the Christ!' do not believe 
it.
\v 24 For false Christs and false prophets will come and show great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if 
possible, even the elect.
\v 25 See, I have told you ahead of time.
