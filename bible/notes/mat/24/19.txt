\v 21 because people will suffer very severely \add when those things happen\add*. People have never suffered that severely since \add God\add* created the world until now, and no one will ever \add suffer like that again\add*.
\v 22 If \add God had not decided to\add* shorten that time \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add when people will suffer so much\add*, everyone \f + \ft litotes \f* would die.

\v 19 How terrible it will be for pregnant women at that time, and for women who will be nursing their babies, because it will be very difficult for them to run away!
\v 20 Pray that you will not have to flee in the winter when it will be hard to travel, or on the Sabbath, the day of rest;
\v 21 because people will suffer very severely when those things happen. People have never suffered that severely since God created the world until now, and no one will ever suffer like that again.
\v 22 If God had not decided to shorten that time when people will suffer so much, everyone would die. But he has decided to shorten it because he is concerned about the people whom he has chosen."

\v 19 But woe to those who are with child and to those who are nursing infants in those days!
\v 20 Pray that your flight not occur in the winter, nor on a Sabbath. 
\v 21 For there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever will be again.
\v 22 Unless those days are shortened, no flesh would be saved; but for the sake of the elect, those days will be 
shortened.
