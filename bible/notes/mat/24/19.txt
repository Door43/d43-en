\v 19 I \add feel\add* very sorry for women who will be pregnant and women who will be nursing \add their babies\add* in those days, \add because it will be very difficult for them to run away\add*!
\v 20 Pray that you will not have to flee in the winter\f + \ft Or: in the rainy season \f* \add when it will be hard to travel\add*. \add People who think that God never allows anyone to do any work on\add* our day of rest\add will not help you as you flee, so\add* pray also that you will not have to flee on such a day,
\v 21 because people will suffer very severely \add when those things happen\add*. People have never suffered that severely since \add God\add* created the world until now, and no one will ever \add suffer like that again\add*.
\v 22 If \add God had not decided to\add* shorten that time \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add when people will suffer so much\add*, everyone \f + \ft litotes \f* would die. But \add he has decided to\add* shorten it because \add he is concerned\add* about\add the people\add* whom \add he\add* has chosen."

\v 19 How terrible it will be for pregnant women at that time, and for women who will be nursing their babies, because it will be very difficult for them to run away!
\v 20 Pray that you will not have to flee in the winter when it will be hard to travel, or on the Sabbath, the day of rest;
\v 21 because people will suffer very severely when those things happen. People have never suffered that severely since God created the world until now, and no one will ever suffer like that again.
\v 22 If God had not decided to shorten that time when people will suffer so much, everyone would die. But he has decided to shorten it because he is concerned about the people whom he has chosen."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 But woe to those who are with child and to those who are nursing infants in those days!
\v 20 Pray that your flight will not occur in the winter or on a Sabbath.
\v 21 For there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever will be again.
\v 22 Unless those days are shortened, no flesh would be saved. But for the sake of the elect, those days will be shortened.
