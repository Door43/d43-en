\v 48 But if an evil servant says in his heart, 'My master has been delayed,'
\v 49 and begins to beat his fellow servants, and eats and drinks with drunkards,
\v 50 the master of that servant will come on a day that the servant does not expect, and at an hour that he does not know.
\v 51 His master will cut him in two and make his fate the same as that of the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.
