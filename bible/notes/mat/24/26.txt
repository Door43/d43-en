\v 26 So if someone says to you, 'Look, \add the Messiah\add* is in the desolate area!' do not go there. \add Likewise, if someone says to you\add*, 'Look, he is in a secret room!' do not believe \add that person\add*,
\v 27 because just like lightning flashes from the east to the west \add and people everywhere can\add* see it \f + \ft simile \f*, when \add I\add*, the one who came from heaven, return again, \add everyone will see me\add*.
\v 28 \add When I return, it will be as obvious to everyone as the fact that\add* wherever you see vultures gathering, you know that there will be an animal carcass \f + \ft metaphor \f* there. \f + \ft Or: Just like the vultures gather together wherever there is an animal carcass, God will punish sinful people wherever they are. \f*"

\v 26 So if someone says to you, 'Look, the Christ is in the wilderness!' do not go there. Likewise, if someone says to you, 'Look, he is in a secret room!' do not believe that person,
\v 27 because just like lightning flashes from the east to the west and people see it, in the same way, when I, the Son of Man, return again, everyone will see me.
\v 28 When I return, it will be as clear to everyone; it is just like wherever you see vultures gathering, you know that an animal carcass is there."

\v 26 Therefore, if they say to you, 'Look, the Christ is in the wilderness,' do not go out to the wilderness; or, 'See, he is in the inner rooms,' do not believe it.
\v 27 For as the lightning shines out from the east and flashes all the way to the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
\v 28 Wherever a dead animal is, there the vultures will gather.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to tell his disciples what will happen before he comes again.

  * **as the lightning shines...so will be the coming** - He will come very fast and be easy to see. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Wherever a dead animal is, there the vultures will gather** - Possible meanings are 1) when the Son of Man comes, everyone will see him and know that he has come or 2) wherever spiritually dead people are, false prophets will be there to tell them lies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **vultures** - birds that eat the bodies of dead or dying creatures
