\v 27 because just like lightning flashes from the east to the west \add and people everywhere can\add* see it \f + \ft simile \f*, when \add I\add*, the one who came from heaven, return again, \add everyone will see me\add*.
\v 28 \add When I return, it will be as obvious to everyone as the fact that\add* wherever you see vultures gathering, you know that there will be an animal carcass \f + \ft metaphor \f* there. \f + \ft Or: Just like the vultures gather together wherever there is an animal carcass, God will punish sinful people wherever they are. \f*"

\v 26 So if someone says to you, 'Look, the Christ is in thewilderness!' do not go there. Likewise, if someone says to you, 'Look, he is in a secret room!' do not believe that person,
\v 27 because just like lightning flashes from the east to the west and people see it, in the same way, when I, the Son of Man, return again, everyone will see me.
\v 28 When I return, it will be as clear to everyone; it is just like wherever you see vultures gathering, you know that is an animal carcass there."

\v 26 Therefore, if they say to you, 'Look, the Christ is in the wilderness,' do not go out to the wilderness; or, "See, he is in the inner rooms,' do not believe it.
\v 27 For as the lightning shines forth from the east and flashes all the way to the west, so will be the coming of the Son of
Man.
\v 28 Wherever a dead animal is, there the eagles will be gathered together.
