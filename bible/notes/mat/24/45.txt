\v 45 So who is the faithful, wise servant, whom his master has set over his household, in order to give them their food at the right time?
\v 46 Blessed is that servant, whom his master will find doing that when he comes.
\v 47 Truly I say to you that the master will set him over everything that he owns.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues his proverb of a master and servants to illustrate that his disciples should be prepared for his return.

  * **So who is the faithful, wise servant, whom his master...time?** - Jesus uses this question to make his disciples think. AT: "So who is the faithful, wise servant? He is the one whom his master...time" or "Be like the faithful and wise servant, whom his master...time." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **give them their food** - "give the people in the master's home their food"
  * **Truly I say to you** - "I tell you the truth." This adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.
