\v 12 Because more and more people will disobey God's laws, many believers will no longer love each other.
\v 13 But all those who keep on believing to the end of their lives, God will save them.
\v 14 Furthermore, believers will preach the good news about how God is ruling in every part of the world, in order to announce it to all people groups. Then the end of the world will come."

  * **to the end** - It is not clear whether the "end" means when a person dies, or when the persecution ends, or the end of the age when God shows himself to be king. The main point is that they endure as long as necessary.
