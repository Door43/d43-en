\v 7 Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and it will be opened to you.
\v 8 For everyone who asks, receives; everyone who seeks, finds; and to the person who knocks, it will be opened.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. The instances of "you" and "your" are all plural. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **Ask ... Seek ... Knock** - These are metaphors for praying to God. The verb form shows that we are to keep praying until he answers. If your language has a form for continuing to do something over and over, use it here. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Ask** - This means to request things from God. 
  * **it will be given to you** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will give you what you need" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Seek** - "Seek from God what you need"
  * **Knock** - To knock on a door was a polite way to request that the person inside the house or room open the door. If knocking on a door is impolite or not done in your culture, use the word that describes how people politely ask for doors to be opened. AT: "Tell God you want him to open the door"
  * **it will be opened to you** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will open it for you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Or which one of you ... a stone?** - Jesus uses a question to teach the people. AT: "There is not one person among you ... a stone." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **a loaf of bread** - This refers to food in general. AT: "some food" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **stone ... fish ... snake** - These nouns should be translated literally.
  * **Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake?** - Jesus asks another question to teach the people. It is understood that Jesus is still referring to a man and his son. AT: "And there is not one person among you, if his son asks for a fish, will give him a snake." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
