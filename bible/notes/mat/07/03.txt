\v 3 None of you should be concerned about someone else's small faults! That would be like noticing a speck in that person's eye. But you should be concerned about your own big faults. They are like logs in your own eye that you do not notice.
\v 4 You should not say to other people about their minor faults, 'Let me remove the speck from your eye!' You should not say that if a log is still in your own eye.
\v 5 You hypocrite, stop sinning in all the large ways you do. Then you will be able to help other people stop sinning in their small ways."

\v 3 And why do you look at the tiny piece of straw that is in your brother's eye, but you do not notice the log that is in your own eye?
\v 4 How can you say to your brother, 'Let me take out the piece of straw that is in your eye', while the log is in your own eye?
\v 5 You hypocrite! First take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the piece of straw that is in your brother's eye.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01|5:1]].

  * Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. The instances of “you” and “your” are all singular, but you may need to translate them as plurals.
  * **why do you look ... How can you say** - Jesus is challenging them to look at their own faults or sins first. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **tiny piece of straw ... log**  - These are metaphors for a person's least important and most important faults. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **brother** - This refers to a fellow believer, not to a literal brother or a neighbor.
  * **eye**  - This is a metaphor for life. 
  * **tiny piece of straw** - "speck" (UDB) or "splinter" or "bit of dust." Use a word for the smallest thing that commonly falls into people's eyes.
  * **log** - The largest part of a tree that has been cut down, a piece of wood far too large to literally go into a person's eye. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
