\v 3 None of you should be concerned about someone else's small faults! That would be like noticing a speck of straw in that person's eye. But you should be concerned about your own big faults because you do not notice a huge wooden plank in your own eye.
\v 4 You should not say to other people about their minor faults, 'Let me remove the speck from your eye!' while you still have a wooden plank in your own eye.
\v 5 If you do that, you are a hypocrite! You should first remove the plank out of your own eye before trying to get the speck out of someone else's eye."

\v 3 Why do you look at the tiny piece of straw that is in your brother's eye, but you do not notice the log that is in your own eye?
\v 4 How can you say to your brother, 'Let me take out the piece of straw that is in your eye,' while the log is in your own eye?
\v 5 You hypocrite! First take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the piece of straw that is in your brother's eye.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. The instances of "you" and "your" are all singular, but you may need to translate them as plurals.

  * **Why do you look ... but you do not notice the log that is in your own eye?** - Jesus uses this question to challenge the people to pay attention to their own sins before they pay attention to another person's sins. AT: "do not look ... but ignore the log that is in your own eye" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the tiny piece of straw that is in your brother's eye** - This is a metaphor that refers to the less important faults of a fellow believer. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **tiny piece of straw** - "speck" or "splinter" or "bit of dust." Use a word for the smallest thing that commonly falls into a person's eyes. 
  * **brother** - All occurrences of "brother" in 7:3-5 refer to a fellow believer, not to a literal brother or a neighbor.
  * **the log that is in your own eye** - This is a metaphor for a person's most important faults. A log could not literally go into a person's eye. Jesus is emphasizing that a person should pay attention to his own more important faults before he deals with another person's less important faults. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **log** - the largest part of a tree that someone has cut down 
  * **How can you say ... your own eye?** - Jesus asks this question to challenge the people to pay attention to their own sins before they pay attention to another person's sins. AT: "You should not say ... your own eye." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
