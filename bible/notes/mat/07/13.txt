\v 13-14 "\add Going to\add* where people live eternally \add with God in heaven\add* is difficult. \add It is like\add* going along a narrow road \f + \ft personification, metaphor \f* that leads to a narrow gate. Not many people find that way. \add The way\add* that most \add people take\add* is easy, \add but it results in their being punished\add* \f + \ft Or:\add God punishing them\add* \f* \add in hell. That way is like a\add* wide road that people walk on \f + \ft personification, metaphor \f* until they reach the wide gate, but that road and that gate lead to where \add they\add* will be destroyed \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* will destroy them \f*. Many people enter that gate. So I \add am telling you to leave the wide road and\add* enter the narrow gate \add to heaven\add*."

\v 13-14 "Going to live forever with God in heaven is difficult; it is like a difficult road that you should take.
There is another road, one that most people take. That road is wide; they walk on until they reach a wide gate, but when they go through it, they will die.  
So I am telling you to take the difficult road and enter the narrow gate to live forever with God in heaven."
