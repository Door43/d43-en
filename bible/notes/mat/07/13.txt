\v 13-14 "\add Going to\add* where people live eternally \add with God in heaven\add* is difficult. \add It is like\add* going along a narrow road \f + \ft personification, metaphor \f* that leads to a narrow gate. Not many people find that way. \add The way\add* that most \add people take\add* is easy, \add but it results in their being punished\add* \f + \ft Or:\add God punishing them\add* \f* \add in hell. That way is like a\add* wide road that people walk on \f + \ft personification, metaphor \f* until they reach the wide gate, but that road and that gate lead to where \add they\add* will be destroyed \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* will destroy them \f*. Many people enter that gate. So I \add am telling you to leave the wide road and\add* enter the narrow gate \add to heaven\add*."

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13-14 "Going to live forever with God in heaven is difficult; it is like a difficult road that you should take.
There is another road, one that most people take. That road is wide; they walk on until they reach a wide gate, but when they go through it, they will die.  
So I am telling you to take the difficult road and enter the narrow gate to live forever with God in heaven."

\v 13 Enter through the narrow gate, for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and there are many people who go through it. 
\v 14 For narrow is the gate, and narrow is the way that lead to life, and few are those who find it.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01|5:1]].

  * Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. The instances of “you” and “your” are plural.
  * When you translate, use appropriate words for "wide" and "broad" that are as different from "narrow" as possible to emphasize the differences between the two sets of gates and ways.
  * **Enter through the narrow gate**  - You may need to move this to the end of verse 14: "Therefore, enter through the narrow gate."
  * **gate … way**  - This metaphor is most likely of people walking the "way," reaching the "gate," and then entering "life" or "destruction" (see UDB, [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor|Metaphor]]). So you may need to translate "broad is the way that leads to destruction and wide is the gate by which people enter it." Others understand the gate and way as hendiadys, which would not need to be reordered. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:hendiadys|Hendiadys]])
  * **wide is the gate and broad is the way … narrow is the gate, and narrow is the way**  - The ULB puts the adjectives before the verbs to emphasize the contrast between the adjectives. Structure your translation the way your language usually contasts adjectives.
  * **destruction**  - This is a general term for people being destroyed. In context it refers literally to physical death (see UDB), which is a metaphor for eternal death. This is the opposite of physical "life," which is a metaphor for eternal life. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor|Metaphor]])
