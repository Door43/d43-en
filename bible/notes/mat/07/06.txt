===== translationWords: =====

  * [[:en:obe:kt:holy]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:pig]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to teach his disciples.

Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. The instances of "you" and "your" are all plural.

  * **dogs...hogs** - These animals were considered dirty and God told the Israelites not to eat them. They are metaphors for wicked people who do not value holy things (see: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]). It would be best to translate these words literally.
  * **pearls** - These are similar to round, valuable stones or beads. They are a metaphor for the knowledge of God (see UDB) or precious things in general.
  * **they will trample** - "the pigs will trample"
  * **and then turn and tear** - "and the dogs will turn and tear"
