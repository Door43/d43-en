\v 6 "You do not give things that belong to God to dogs that would attack you. And you do not throw valuable pearls in front of hogs, because they would just walk on them. In the same way, do not tell wonderful things about God to people who you know will do evil things to you in return.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. The instances of "you" and "your" are all plural.

  * **dogs ... hogs** - Jews considered these animals dirty, and God told the Jews not to eat them. They are metaphors for wicked people who do not value holy things. It would be best to translate these words literally. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **pearls** - These are similar to round, valuable stones or beads. They are a metaphor for the knowledge of God or precious things in general. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **they may trample** - "the pigs may trample"
  * **then turn and tear** - "the dogs will then turn and tear"
