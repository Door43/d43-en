\v 15 Watch out for people who come to you and say falsely that they are telling you what God has said. They are like wolves that have covered themselves with sheepskins to appear harmless but will attack you.
\v 16 By seeing the fruit that plants produce you know what kind of plants they are. Thornbushes cannot
produce grapes and thistles cannot produce figs, so no one thinks of picking grapes from thorns or figs from thistles.
\v 17 Here is another example: All good fruit trees produce good fruit, but all rotten trees produce worthless fruit.

\p
\v 15 Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but are truly ravenous wolves.
\v 16 By their fruits you will know them. Do people gather grapes from a thornbush or figs from thistles?
\v 17 In the same way, every good tree produces good fruit, but the bad tree produces bad fruit.

  * **Beware of** - "Be on guard against"
  * **who come to you in sheep's clothing but are truly ravenous wolves** - This metaphor means false prophets will pretend like they are good and want to help you, but they are really evil and will do you harm. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **By their fruits you will know them** - This metaphor refers to a person's actions. AT: "Just as you know a tree by the fruit that grows on it, you will know false prophets by how they act" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Do people gather ... thistles?** - Jesus uses a question to teach the people. The people would have known that the answer is no. AT: "People do not gather ... thistles." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
