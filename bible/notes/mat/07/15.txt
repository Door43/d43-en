\v 15 Watch out for people who come to you and say falsely that they are telling you what God has said. They seem to be harmless, but that is not true. They are like wolves that have covered themselves with sheepskins. They want people to believe that they are harmless sheep, but they will actually attack you like wolves.
\v 16 So how will you know that they are false? Well, by seeing the fruit that plants produce, you know what kind of plants they are. For example, thornbushes cannot
produce grapes, so no one even thinks of picking grapes from thornbushes. And thistles cannot produce figs, so no one thinks of picking figs from thistles.
\v 17 Here is another example: all good fruit trees produce good fruit, but all rotten trees produce worthless fruit.

\p
\v 15 Beware of false prophets, those who come to you in sheep's clothing, but are truly ravenous wolves.
\v 16 By their fruits you will know them. Do people gather grapes from a thornbush, or figs from thistles?
\v 17 In the same way, every good tree produces good fruit, but the ruined tree produces bad fruit.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to teach his disciples.

  * **Beware of**  - "Be on guard against"
  * **By their fruits**  - Jesus compares the actions of the prophets to fruit produced by plants. Alternate translation: "by the way they act." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **Do people gather …?**  - "People do not gather …." The people Jesus is talking to would have known that the answer is no. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **good tree brings forth good fruit**  - Jesus continues to use the metaphor of fruit to refer to good prophets who produce good works or words.
  * **ruined tree brings forth bad fruit**  - Jesus continues to use the metaphor of fruit to refer to bad prophets who produce evil works or words.
