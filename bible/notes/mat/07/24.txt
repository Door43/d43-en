===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01|5:1]].

  * **Therefore** - "For that reason"
  * **like a wise man who built his house upon a rock** - Jesus compares those who obey his words to a person who builds his house where nothing can harm it. Note that though the rain, wind, and high water reach the house, it does not fall down. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **rock** - This is the bedrock below the topsoil and clay, not a large stone or boulder above the ground.
