===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01|5:1]].

  * Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. The instances of “you” and the commands are plural.
  * **you will be judged **- This could be stated in active form: "God will condemn you" (UDB) or "people will condemn you." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **For**  - Be sure the reader understands that verse 2 is based on verse 1.
  * **measure**  - This can refer to 1) the amount of punishment given (see UDB) or 2) the standard used for judgment.
