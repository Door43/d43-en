===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01|5:1]].

Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. The instances of "you" and the commands are plural.

  * **do not judge** - "do not condemn people harshly"
  * **you will be judged** - AT: "God will condemn you harshly"  or "people will condemn you harshly" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **For** - Be sure the reader understands that verse 2 is based on verse 1.
  * **measure** - This can refer to 1) the amount of punishment given or 2) the standard used for judgment.
