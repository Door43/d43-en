====== Matthew 07 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Since this chapter shifts quickly from one topic to another, it is possible to use a line of space between topics to distinguish between them more easily.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Matthew 5-7 ==

Matthew 5-7 together form one sermon or teaching by Jesus. The chapter divisions cause confusion here.

== "By their fruits you will know them" ==

Fruit is a common image in the scriptures. It is used to describe the results of either good or bad behavior. In this chapter, good fruit is the result of living as God commands. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:fruit]])
