===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - This begins the account of the resurrection of Jesus from the dead.

  * **Now late on the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week** - "After the Sabbath ended, as the sun came up on Sunday morning"
  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Here Matthew starts to tell a new part of the story.
  * **the other Mary** - "the other woman named Mary." This is Mary the mother of James and Joseph. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:mat:27:54|27:56]])
  * **Behold** - The word "behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows. Your language may have a way of doing this.
  * **there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended ... and rolled away the stone** - Possible meanings are 1) the earthquake happened because the angel came down and rolled away the stone (ULB) or 2) all these events happened at the same time .
  * **earthquake** - a sudden and violent shaking of the ground
