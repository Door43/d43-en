===== Translation Notes: =====

This begins the account of the reaction of the authorities to the resurrection.

  * **the women**  - Mary Magdalene and the other Mary
  * **behold** - This marks the beginning of another event in the larger story that involves different people than the events just described. Your language may have a way of doing this.
  * **discussed with them**  - "decided on a plan among themselves." The priests and elders decided to give the money to the soldiers.
  * **Say to others, 'Jesus' disciples came ... while we were sleeping.'**  - "Tell anyone who asks you that Jesus' disciples came ... while you were sleeping."
