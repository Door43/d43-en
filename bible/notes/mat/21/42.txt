\q 'The men who were building a large building rejected a certain stone. But others put that same stone in its proper place, and it has become the most important stone of the building. The Lord has done this, and we marvel as we look at it.'

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus uses the prophets to explain the parable.

  * **Jesus said to them** - "Jesus said to the people" ([[:en:bible:notes:mat:21:40|21:41]])
  * **'The stone which the builders rejected has been made the cornerstone.** - AT: "The stone that was rejected by the builders became the most important one." The authorities will reject Jesus, but God will make him the head of his kingdom. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **This was from the Lord** - "The Lord has caused this great change"
