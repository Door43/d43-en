\q 'The men who were building a large building rejected a certain stone. But others put that same stone in its proper place, and it has become the most important stone of the building. The Lord has done this, and we marvel as we look at it.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Here Jesus begins to explain the parable of the rebellious servants.
  * **General Information:** - Jesus quotes the prophet Isaiah to show that God will honor the one whom the religious leaders reject.

  * **Jesus said to them** - It is unclear to whom Jesus asks the following question. If you need to make "them" specific, use the same audience as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:21:40|21:41]].
  * **Did you never read...eyes?** - Jesus uses a question to make his audience think deeply about what this scripture means. AT: "Think about what you have read...eyes." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **The stone which the builders rejected has been made the cornerstone** - Jesus is quoting from the Psalms. This is a metaphor that means the religious leaders, like builders, will reject Jesus, but God will make him the most important in his kingdom, like the cornerstone in a building. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **has been made the cornerstone** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "has become the cornerstone." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **This was from the Lord** - "The Lord has caused this great change"
  * **it is marvelous in our eyes** - Here "in our eyes" refers to seeing. AT: "it is wonderful to see." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
