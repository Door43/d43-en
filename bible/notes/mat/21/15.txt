\v 16 They thought that Jesus should not be allowing the children to say that, so they asked him, "How can you tolerate this? Do you hear what these children are shouting?" Then Jesus said to them, "Yes, I hear them, but if you remembered what you have read in the Scriptures about children praising me, you would know that God is pleased with them. The psalmist wrote, saying to God, 'You have taught infants and other children to praise you perfectly.'"

\v 17 Then Jesus left the city. The disciples went with him to the village of Bethany, and they stayed there that night.

\v 15 But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the marvelous things that he did, and when they heard the children shouting in the temple and saying, "Hosanna to the son of David," they were moved with resentment.
\v 16 They said to him, "Do you hear what these people are saying?" Jesus said to them, "Yes! But have you never read, 'Out of the mouths of babes and nursing infants you have perfected praise'?"
\v 17 Then Jesus left them and went out of the city to Bethany and slept there.
