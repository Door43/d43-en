\v 15 But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the marvelous things that he did, and when they heard the children shouting in the
temple and saying, "Hosanna to the son of David," they were moved with resentment.
\v 16 They said to him, "Do you hear what these people are saying?" Jesus said to them, "Yes! But have you never read, "Out of the
mouths of babes and nursing infants you have perfected praise?"
\v 17 Then Jesus left them and went out of the city to Bethany and slept there.
