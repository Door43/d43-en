\v 20 The next day when the disciples saw that the fig tree was completely dead. They were astonished and said to Jesus, "We are astonished that the fig tree has dried up so quickly!"
\v 21 Jesus said to them, "Think about this: If you believe that God has power to do what you ask him to and you do not doubt that, you will be able to do things like what I have done to this fig tree. You will even be able to do marvelous deeds like saying to that hill over there, 'Uproot yourself and throw yourself into the sea,' and it will happen!
\v 22 In addition to that, whenever you ask God for something when you pray to him, if you believe that he will give it to you, you will receive it from him."

\v 21 Jesus answered and said to them, "Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to this fig tree, but you will even say to this hill, "Be taken up and thrown into the sea,' and it will be done.
\v 22 Everything for which you ask in prayer while believing, you will receive."
