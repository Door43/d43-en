\v 31 So which of the man's two sons did what their father desired?" They answered, "The older son." Jesus \add explained to them what that parable meant\add* by saying, "Think about this: \add It is more likely that other people, including\add* tax collectors and prostitutes, \add whom you think are very sinful\add*, will enter where God rules, than it is that you \add Jewish leaders\add* will enter.
\v 32 I \add say this to you\add* because, even though John\add the Baptizer\add* explained to you how to live righteously, you did not believe his message. But tax collectors and prostitutes believed his \add message, and they turned away from their sinful behavior\add*. In contrast, you, even though you saw what they did, refused to turn away from your sinful behavior, and you did not believe \add John's message\add*."

\v 31 So which of the man's two sons did what their father desired?" They answered, "The older son." Then Jesus said to them, "So think about this: Other people, including tax collectors and prostitutes, whom you say are very sinful—it is more likely that he will agree to rule over them than that he will agree to rule over you.
\v 32 I say this to you because, even though John the Baptizer explained to you how to live in the right way, you did not believe his message. But tax collectors and prostitutes believed his message, and they turned away from their sinful behavior. In contrast, even though you saw that they changed, you refused to stop sinning, and you did not believe John's message."

\v 31 Which of the two sons did his father's will? They said, 'The first one.'" Jesus said to them, "Truly I say to you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes will enter the kingdom of God before you do. 
\v 32 For John came to you in the path of righteousness, but you did not believe him; while the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. And you, when you saw that happen, did not even repent later in order to believe him.
