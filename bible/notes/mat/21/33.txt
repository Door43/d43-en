\v 33 Listen to another parable. There was a man, a person with extensive land. He planted a vineyard, set a hedge about it, 
dug a winepress in it, built a watchtower, and rented it out to vine growers. Then he went into another country.
\v 34 When the time of the grape harvest drew near, he sent some servants to the vine dressers to get his grapes.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to responds to the religious leaders with a second parable.

  * **person with extensive land** - "a landowner who had much property."
  * **rented it out to vine dressers** - "put vine dressers in charge of the vineyard." The owner still had control of the vineyard.
  * **vine dressers** - people who knew how to properly take care of vines and grapes.
