\v 25 Where did John the Baptizer get his authority to baptize those who came to him? Did he get it from God or from people?' The chief priests and elders debated among themselves about what they should answer. They said to each other, "If we say, 'It was  from God,' he will say to us, 'Then you should have believed his message!'
\v 26 But if we say, 'It was from people,' the crowd might react violently against us, because all the people believe that John was a prophet whom God had sent."
\v 27 So they answered Jesus, "We do not know where John got his authority from." Then Jesus said to them, "Because you did not answer my question, I will not tell you who gave me permission to do the things I did here yesterday."

\v 25 The baptism of John—where did it come from, from heaven or from men?" They discussed among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say to us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'
\v 26 But if we say, 'From men,' we fear the crowd, because they all view John as a prophet."
\v 27 Then they answered Jesus and said, " We do not know." He also said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.
