  * **Connecting Statement:** - This begins the account of the religious leaders questioning Jesus' authority.

  * **had come into the temple** - It is implied that Jesus did not enter the actual temple. He entered the courtyard around the temple. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **these things** - This refers to Jesus teaching and healing in the temple. It probably also refers to Jesus driving out the buyers and sellers the previous day.
