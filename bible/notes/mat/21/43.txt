===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I say to you** - This adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.
  * **to you** - Here "you" is plural. Jesus was speaking to the religious leaders and also to the Jewish people in general. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and will be given to a nation that produces its fruits** - Here "kingdom of God" refers to God's rule as king. This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will reject you, the Jewish people, and he will be king over people from other nations who bear fruit" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **that produces its fruits** - This is an idiom that refers to obedience. AT: "that obeys God's commands" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Whoever falls on this stone will be broken to pieces** - Here, "this stone" is the same stone as in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:21:42|21:42]]. This is a metaphor that means the Christ will destroy anyone who rebels against him. This can be stated in active form. AT: "The stone will break into pieces anyone who falls on it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **But anyone on whom it falls will be crushed** - This means basically the same thing as the previous sentence. It is a metaphor that means the Christ will have the final judgment and will destroy everyone who rebels against him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
