===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus concludes his parable about a landowner who hires workers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]])

  * **Is it not legitimate for me to do what I wish with my own possessions?** - The landowner uses a question to scold the workers who were complaining.  AT: "I can do what I want with my own possessions" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **legitimate** - "lawful" or "fair" or "right"
  * **Or is your eye evil because I am good?** - The landowner uses a question to scold the workers who were complaining. The phrase "evil eye" is an idiom that means "jealous." AT: "Do not be jealous because I am generous to other people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **So the last will be first, and the first last** - Jesus is comparing this age to the next age. Those who are important now, God will consider them unimportant when he establishes his rule on earth. Those who seem unimportant now, God will consider them important when he establishes his rule. See how you translated a similar statement in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:19:29|19:30]].
  * **So the last will be first** - Here the parable has ended and Jesus is speaking. AT: "Then Jesus said, 'So the last will be first'"
