\v 17 As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them,
\v 18 "See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes. They will 
condemn him to death
\v 19 and will deliver him to the Gentiles for them to mock him, flog him, and crucify him. But on the third day he will be raised up."
