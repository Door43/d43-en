\v 22 But Jesus answered and said, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup which I am about to drink?" They said 
to him, "We are able."
\v 23 He said to them, "My cup you will indeed drink. But to sit at my right hand and at 
my left hand is not mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
\v 24 When the other ten disciples heard this, they were very displeased with the two brothers.
