===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - This begins an account of Jesus healing two blind men.

  * **As they went** - This refers to the disciples and Jesus.
  * **followed him** - "followed Jesus"
  * **There were two blind men sitting** - This is sometimes translated as "Behold, there were two blind men sitting." The writer is alerting us to a new people in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this.
  * **When they heard** - "When the two blind men heard"
  * **was passing by** - "was walking by them"
  * **Son of David** - Jesus was not David's literal son, so this may be translated as "Descendant of King David." However, "Son of David" is also a title for the Messiah, and the men were probably calling Jesus by this title.
