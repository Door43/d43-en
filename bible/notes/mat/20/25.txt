\v 27 Yes, and everyone among you who wants God to consider him to be the most important must become a servant for the rest of you.
\v 28 You should imitate me. Even though I am the Son of Man, I did not come for others to serve me. On the contrary, I came in order to serve them and to allow them to kill me, so that my dying would be like a payment to rescue many people from being punished for their sins."

\v 25 But Jesus called them to himself and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles subjugate them, and their important men exercise authority over them.
\v 26 But it must not be this way among you. Instead, whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant.
\v 27 And whoever wishes to be first among you must be your servant,
\v 28 just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."
