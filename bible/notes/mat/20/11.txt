===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues his parable about a landowner paying his workers.

  * **When they received** - "When the workers who had worked the longest received"
  * **property owner** - "landowner" or "vineyard owner"
  * **we who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat** - "we who have worked all day in the hot sun"
