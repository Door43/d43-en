===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of how Satan tempted Jesus.

  * **Again it is written **- This could be translated "Again, I will tell you something that is in the Scriptures."
  * **He said to him **- "The devil said to Jesus"
  * **All these things I will give you **- "I will give you all these things." The tempter is emphasizing that he will give "all these things," not just some of them.
