\v 1 Then God's Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness for the devil to tempt him.
\v 2 After he had not eaten food day and night for forty days, he was hungry.
\v 3 Satan, the tempter, came to him and said, "If you are really the Son of God, prove it by commanding these stones to become bread for yourself!"
\v 4 But Jesus said to him, "No! I will not do this, because God has said in the scriptures, ‘For people to truly live, they must have more than food; they must listen to every word that God has spoken.'"

===== Translation Notes: =====

After Jesus was baptized he was led into the wilderness by the Spirit.

  * **when he had fasted**  - "he" refers to Jesus, who fasted.
  * **he was hungry- **"he" refers to Jesus, not the devil.
  * **"hungry"**  - Jesus would have been weak and in need of food for nourishment.
  * **"the tempter"- ** This is not a name for Satan but rather a descriptive meaning "one who tempts" or "one who attempts"
  * **"if you are the Son of God"- ** Satan is challenging Jesus' divinity and requesting that he prove himself.
  * **"it is written,... the mouth of God."**  - quotation from Dueteronomy 8:3
