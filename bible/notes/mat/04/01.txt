\v 1 Then God's Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness for the devil to tempt him.
\v 2 After he had not eaten food day and night for forty days, he was hungry.
\v 3 Satan, the tempter, came to him and said, "If you are really the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread for yourself!"
\v 4 But Jesus said to him, "No! I will not do this, because God has said in the Scriptures, ‘For people to truly live, they must have more than food; they must listen to every word that God has spoken.'"

===== Translation Notes: =====

This section describes how Satan tempted Jesus.

  * **the devil. ... The tempter** - These refer to the same being. You may have to use the same word to translate both.
  * **he had fasted ... he was hungry**  - These refer to Jesus.
  * **If you are the Son of God, command**  - This can be 1) a temptation to do miracles for his own benefit, "You are the Son of God, so you can command" or 2) a challenge or accusation, "Prove that you are the Son of God by commanding" (see UDB). It is probably best to assume that Satan knew that Jesus is the Son of God.
  * **command these stones to become bread** - "say to these stones, 'Become bread!'"
