\v 1 Then God's Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness for the devil to tempt him.
\v 2 After he had not eaten food day and night for forty days, he was hungry.
\v 3 Satan, the tempter, came to him and said, "If you are really the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread for yourself!"
\v 4 But Jesus said to him, "No! I will not do this, because God has said in the scriptures, 'For people to truly live, they must have more than food; they must listen to every word that God has spoken.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Here the writer begins a new part of the story in which Jesus spends 40 days in the wilderness, where Satan tempts him. In verse 4, Jesus rebukes Satan with a quotation from Deuteronomy.

  * **Jesus was led up by the Spirit** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the Spirit led Jesus" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **to be tempted by the devil** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "so the devil could tempt Jesus" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the devil ... The tempter** - These refer to the same being. You may have to use the same word to translate both.
  * **he had fasted ... he was hungry** - These refer to Jesus.
  * **forty days and forty nights** - "40 days and 40 nights." This refers to 24-hour periods. AT: "40 days" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **If you are the Son of God, command** - It is best to assume that Satan knew that Jesus is the Son of God. Possible meanings are 1) this is a temptation to do miracles for Jesus' own benefit. AT: "You are the Son of God, so you can command" or 2) this is a challenge or accusation. AT: "Prove that you are the Son of God by commanding" 
  * **the Son of God** - This is an important title that describes the relationship between the Jesus and God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **Son of God** - This is an important title for Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **command these stones to become bread** - You could translate this with a direct quotation. AT: "say to these stones, 'Become bread!'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **bread** - Here "food" refers to food in general. AT: "food" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **It is written** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Moses wrote this in the scriptures long ago" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Man shall not live on bread alone** - This implies that there is something more important to life than food.
  * **but by every word that comes out of the mouth of God** - Here "word" and "mouth" refer to what God says. AT: "but by listening to everything that God says" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
