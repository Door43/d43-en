======  Matthew 04 General Notes ======


**Formatting in this chapter**\\

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent all the lines of verses 6, 10, 15 and 16, which are quotations from the Old Testament.

**Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter**\\

== Is Near ==

This phrase can have great theological significance. Scholars often debate whether the "kingdom of heaven" was present at this time or still coming. English translations frequently use the phrase "at hand" but this can create difficulty in translating its meaning properly. Other translations use the phase "is drawing near" and "has come near." In Greek, the word is defined as "to move closer." 

== If you are the Son of God ==

In English, the reader can understand this statement in verse 6 to indicate that [[:en:obe:kt:satan|Satan]] is questioning whether Jesus is the [[:en:obe:kt:sonofgod|Son of God]]. Because Satan probably knows that Jesus is the Son of God, it should not be translated in this way. It can be translated as "since you are the Son of God."
