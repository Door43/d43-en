\v 5 Then the devil took Jesus to Jerusalem, the city that was especially for God. He set him on the highest part of the Temple
\v 6 and said to him, "If you are truly the Son of God, jump down to the ground. You will, of course, not be hurt, because God has said in the Scriptures, 
\q
'God will command his angels to protect you. 
\q They will lift you up in their hands when you are falling, \q and they will keep you from even hitting your foot on a stone.'"

===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of how Satan tempted Jesus.

  * **If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down**  - This could be 1) a temptation to do a miracle for his own benefit, "Since you are truly the Son of God, you can throw yourself down" or 2) a challenge or accusation, "Prove that you are truly the Son of God by throwing yourself down" (see UDB). It is best to assume that Satan knew that Jesus is the Son of God.
  * **down**  - to the ground
  * **He will command …**  - "God will command his angels to take care of you" or "God will say to his angels, 'Take care of him.'"
