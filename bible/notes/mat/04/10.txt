This continues the account of how Satan tempted Jesus.  This is the third time that Jesus rebukes Satan with scripture.

  * **the devil**  - Matthew used a different title, which also refers to "Satan."
  * **behold**  - The word "behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the important new information that follows.
