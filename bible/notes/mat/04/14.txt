\v 14 He went there so that these words that the prophet Isaiah had written long ago might come true:
\p
\q
\v 15 "The regions of Zebulun and Naphtali,
\q regions by the road going to the Sea, on the eastern side of the Jordan River,
\q regions in Galilee, home of many non-Israelites!
\q
\v 16 Those people do not know God, as if they were in darkness,
\q but they will learn the truth, as if a bright light had shone on them.
\q Yes, they have been very afraid of dying,
\q But a brilliant light has shone upon them!"

\v 14 This happened to fulfill what was said by Isaiah the prophet,
\q1
\v 15 "The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,
\q1 toward the sea, beyond the Jordan,
\q1 Galilee of the Gentiles!
\q1
\v 16 The people who sat in darkness
\q1 have seen a great light,
\q1 and to those who sat in the region and shadow of death,
\q1 upon them has a light arisen."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In verses 15 and 16, the writer quotes the prophet Isaiah to show that Jesus' ministry in Galilee was a fulfillment of prophecy.
  * **This happened** - This refers to Jesus going to live in Capernaum.
  * **what was said** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "what God said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali ... Galilee of the Gentiles!** - All of these territories describe the same area. This can be translated as a complete sentence. AT: "In the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali ... in the territory of Galilee live many Gentiles!"
  * **toward the sea** - This is the Sea of Galilee.
  * **The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light** - Here "darkness" refers to moral darkness or sin, which separates people from God. And, "light" refers to God's true message that saves people from their sin. This is the image of people who were without hope now having hope coming from God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to those who sat in the region and shadow of death, upon them has a light arisen** - This basically has the same meaning as the first part of the sentence. Here "region and shadow of death" refers to spiritual death or a separation from God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
