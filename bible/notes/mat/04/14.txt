\v 14 He went there so that these words that the prophet Isaiah had written long ago might come true:
\p
\q
\v 15 "The regions of Zebulun and Naphtali,
\q regions by the road going to the Sea, on the eastern side of the Jordan River,
\q regions in Galilee, home of many non-Israelites!
\q
\v 16 Those people do not know God, as if they were in darkness,
\q but they will learn the truth, as if a bright light had shone on them.
\q Yes, they have been very afraid of dying,
\q But a brilliant light has shone upon them!"

\v 14 This happened so that it might come true what had been spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
\q
\v 15 "The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,
\q Toward the sea, beyond the Jordan,
\q Galilee of the Gentiles!
\q
\v 16 The people who  sat in darkness
\q Have seen a great light,
\q And to those who sat in the region and shadow of death,
\q Upon them has a light arisen."
