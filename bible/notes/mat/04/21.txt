===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus calls his first disciples.

  * **mending their nets **- "They" might include the two brothers and Zebedee, or just the two brothers.
  * **he called them**  - "Jesus called John and James".  This phrase also means that he invited them to come and become Jesus' disciples.
  * **left the boat**  - It should be clear that this is a life change.  These men are no longer going to be fishermen and are leaving "the family business" to follow Jesus for the rest of their lives.
