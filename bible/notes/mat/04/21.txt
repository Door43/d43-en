===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of the beginning of Jesus' ministry in Galilee.

  * **they were mending their nets **- "They" might include the two brothers and Zebedee, or just the two brothers.
  * **He called them,**  - "Jesus called John and James." This phrase also means that Jesus invited them to follow him, live with him, and become his disciples.
  * **immediately **- "at that moment"
  * **left the boat … and followed him**  - It should be clear that this is a life change. These men are no longer going to be fishermen and are leaving the family business to follow Jesus for the rest of their lives.
