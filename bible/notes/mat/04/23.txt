===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of the beginning of Jesus' ministry in Galilee.

  * **all kinds of disease and all kinds of sickness **  - "every disease and every sickness." The words "disease" and "sickness" are closely related but should be translated as two different words if possible. "Disease" is what causes a person to be sick. "Sickness" is the physical weakness or affliction that results from having a disease.
  * **the Decapolis**  - "the Ten Towns" (see UDB), a region to the southeast of the Sea of Galilee
