  * **When the evening had come **- "When it was late in the day" or "When it was nearly evening" (UDB)
  * **the disciples came to him and said**  - The pronoun "him" refers to Jesus.
  * **the disciples**  - If it is necessary to identify who "the disciples" were, this can be translated "his disciples."
  * **a deserted place **- This can be translated as "a place where nobody lives." (UDB). It is the same word translated as "an isolated place" in verse 13.
