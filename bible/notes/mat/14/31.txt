  * **why did you doubt?** - Jesus uses a question to tell Peter than he should not have doubted. You can make explicit what Peter should not have doubted. AT: "you should not have doubted that I could keep you from sinking" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Son of God** - This is an important title for Jesus that describes his relationship to God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
