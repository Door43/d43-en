\v 19 Jesus told the crowd of people who had gathered there to sit on the grass. Then he took the five loaves and the two fish. He looked up toward heaven, thanked God for them, and broke them into pieces. Then he gave the pieces to his disciples, and they distributed them to the crowd.
\v 20 All the people ate until they were no longer hungry. Then some people gathered the pieces that were left over and filled twelve baskets with them.
\v 21 About five thousand men ate at that time, not counting the women and children!

\v 20 They all ate and were filled. Then they took up what remained of the broken pieces of food—twelve baskets full.
\v 21 Those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
