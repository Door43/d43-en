\v 19 Jesus told the crowd of people who had gathered there to sit on the grass. Then he took the five loaves and the two fish. He looked up toward heaven, thanked God for them, and broke them into pieces. Then he gave the pieces to his disciples, and they distributed them to the crowd.
\v 20 All the people ate until they were no longer hungry. Then some people gathered the pieces that were left over and filled twelve baskets with them.
