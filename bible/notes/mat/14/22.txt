\v 22 Right after that happened, Jesus told the disciples to get in the boat and to go ahead of him to the other side of the Sea of Galilee. In the meantime, he was going to send the crowd home.
\v 23 After he sent the crowd away, he went up into the hills to pray by himself. When it was evening, he was still there alone.
\v 24 By this time the disciples were a long distance from the shore. The wind was blowing very hard opposite to how the disciples were trying to sail; the wind made very large waves that were tossing the boat back and forth in the water.

\v 22 Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he himself would send the crowd away.
\v 23 After he had sent the crowd away, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening had fully come, he was there alone.
\v 24 But the boat was now in the midst of the sea, almost uncontrollable because of the waves, for the wind was contrary.

===== Translation Notes: =====

This begins an account of Jesus miraculously walking on the surface of the Sea of Galilee.

  * **Immediately **- "Right after Jesus fed the five thousand,"
  * **he**  - The pronouns "he", "him" and "himself" throughout these verses refer to Jesus.
  * **to the other side**  - The implied information is that this means "to the other side of the Sea of Galilee." (See: Implicit and Explicit Information)
  * **send the crowd away**  - "dismiss the crowd"
  * **the crowd**  - "the crowd of people"
  * **on the mountain**  - This can be translated a "into the hills" (UDB).
  * **When evening had fully come**  - "when it was evening" (UDB) or "late in the evening" or "when it became dark"

  * **in the midst of the sea**  - Literally, "many stadia away from the land." "Stadia" were distance measurements of about 185 meters (607 feet). Your translation might use a more general phrase such as "a long distance from the shore" (UDB).
  * **almost uncontrollable because of the waves **- Literally, "beaten by the waves." This can be translated with an active verb: "the waves were beating against the boat." (See: Active or Passive)
