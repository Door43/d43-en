\v 22 Right after that happened, Jesus told the disciples to get in the boat and to go ahead of him to the other side of the Sea of Galilee. In the meantime, he was going to send the crowd home.
\v 23 After he sent the crowd away, he went up into the hills to pray by himself. When it was evening, he was still there alone.
\v 24 By this time the disciples were a long distance from the shore. The wind was blowing very hard opposite to how the disciples were trying to sail; the wind made very large waves that were tossing the boat back and forth in the water.

\v 22 Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he sent away the crowds.
\v 23 After he had sent away the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.
\v 24 But the boat was now a long way from land, being tossed about by the waves, for the wind was blowing against them.
