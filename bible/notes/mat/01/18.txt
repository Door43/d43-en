\v 18 This is the account of what happened just before Jesus Christ was born. Mary, his mother, had promised to marry Joseph, but before they lived together as husband and wife, they found out that she was expecting a child by the Holy Spirit's power.
\v 19 Now Joseph, who was to be her husband,  was a man who obeyed God's commands, so he decided not to marry her. But he did not want to shame her in front of other people. So he decided to send Mary away in private.
