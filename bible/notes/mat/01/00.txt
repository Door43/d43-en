== Passive Voice == 

The [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Passive Voice]] is used very purposefully in this chapter to indicate that Mary and Joseph did not initiate her conception of Jesus. They were chosen by God to be the "parents" who raised Jesus on earth. Because Jesus did not share any biological traits with Joseph, many scholars have chosen to use the word "incarnation" to refer to God becoming man when Jesus was born. Here, the passive voice emphasizes the Holy Spirit as the subject of the actions. Because many languages do not have a passive voice, translators must decide how to best translate these theological nuances.
