===== Translation Notes: =====

The list of Jesus' ancestors continues. Use the same wording that you used in Matthew [[:en:bible:notes:mat:01:01|1:2-3]].

  * **Asa**  - Sometimes his name is translated as "Asaph."
  * **Joram the father of Uzziah**  - Joram was actually Uzziah's grandfather's grandfather, so "father" can be translated as "ancestor" (UDB).
