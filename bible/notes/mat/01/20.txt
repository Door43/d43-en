\v 20 While he was seriously considering this, an angel whom the Lord sent surprised him in a dream. The angel said, "Joseph, descendant of King David, do not be afraid to marry Mary. For what has been conceived in her is there by the Holy Spirit.
\v 21 She will give birth to a son. Since it is he who will save his people from their sins, name him 'Jesus.'"

===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues to tell about the events leading up to the birth of Jesus.

  * **appeared**  - an angel came suddenly to Joseph
  * **son of David**  - In this case, the expression "son of" means "descendant of." David was not Joseph's father, but David was Joseph's ancestor.
  * **the one who is conceived in her is conceived by the Holy Spirit** - "the Holy Spirit conceived the baby with whom Mary is pregnant." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **She will give birth to a son**  - Because God sent the angel, the angel knew the baby was a boy.
  * **you will call his name**  - This is a command: "call his name" or "give him the name" or "name him"
  * **he will save his people**  - "his people" refers to the Jews
