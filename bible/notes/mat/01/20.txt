===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues to tell about the events leading up to the birth of Jesus.

  * **appeared**  - an angel came suddenly to Joseph
  * **son of David**  - In this case, the expression "son of" means "descendant of." David was not Joseph's father, but David was Joseph's ancestor.
  * **the one who is conceived in her is conceived by the Holy Spirit** - "the Holy Spirit conceived the baby with whom Mary is pregnant." (See: [[en:ta:translate:active|Active or Passive]])
  * **She will give birth to a son**  - Because God sent the angel, the angel knew the baby was a boy.
  * **you will call his name**  - This is a command: "call his name" or "give him the name" or "name him"
  * **he will save his people**  - "his people" refers to the Jews
