===== Translation Notes: =====

After Joseph had decided to divorce Mary, an angel of God came to speak to him.

  * **appeared - **  An angel came suddenly to Joseph.
  * **son of David**  - In this case, the expression "son of" means "descendant of". David was not Joseph's father, but David was Joseph's ancestor.
  * **the one who is conceived in her is conceived by the Holy Spirit -**  "the one" is talking about the baby inside Mary. This could be stated in the active voice as: "The Holy Spirit conceived the baby <font 14px line-height: 19.6000003814697px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>with whom</font>    Mary is pregnant " (See: Passive/Active)
  * **she will give birth to a son**  - Because God sent the angel, the angel knew the baby was a boy.
  * **he will save his people** - "his people" refers to the Jews
