===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Amon** - Sometimes this is translated "Amos."
  * **Josiah was the father of Jechoniah** - Sometimes the word "father" refers to a grandfather or some other ancestor. Josiah was actually Jechoniah's grandfather.
  * **at the time of the deportation to Babylon** - "when they were forced to move to Babylon" or "when the Babylonians conquered them and made them go live in Babylon." If your language needs to specify who went to Babylon, you could say "the Israelites" or "the Israelites who lived in Judah."
  * **Babylon** - Here this means the country of Babylon, not just the city of Babylon.
