\v 28 And, Son of man, prophesy and say that this is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say about the Ammon people-group, and about how I will disgrace them:
\q1 The king of Babylon will say,
\q1 'My soldiers have swords;
\q2 they have pulled out those swords to slaughter many people.
\q1 They have polished them in order to kill people,
\q2 and to flash like lightning.
\q1
\v 29 Your Ammonite prophets have recounted for you false visions about what will happen to you,
\q2 and they have held useless ceremonies that give you false messages.
\q1 So swords will strike the necks
\q2 of those wicked people;
\q1 it is time for my soldier to kill them;
\q2 it is the day when I will punish them because they have not been loyal to me.'

\v 28 So you, Son of man, prophesy and say, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh to the people of Ammon concerning their coming disgrace: A sword, a sword is drawn! It is sharpened for the slaughter in order to devour, so it will be like lightning!
\v 29 While prophets see empty visions for you, while they perform rituals to come up with lies for you, this sword will lie on the necks of the wicked who are about to be killed, whose day of punishment has come and whose time of iniquity is about to end.
