\v 28 And thou, son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah concerning the children of Ammon, and concerning their reproach; and say thou, A sword, a sword is drawn, for the slaughter it is furbished, to cause it to devour, that it may be as lightning;
\v 29 while they see for you false visions, while they divine lies to you, to lay you upon the necks of the wicked that are deadly wounded, whose day is come in the time of the iniquity of the end.
