\v 22 With his right hand he will pick up the arrow marked with the name of Jerusalem. He will then command his soldiers to go to Jerusalem. When they arrive there, they will set up rams to batter down the walls, and then the king will give the command for them to slaughter the people. They will shout the battlecry, and they will set up the rams against the city gates. They will build a dirt ramp against the the walls around the city, and set walls against the city.
\v 23 The people in Jerusalem who had promised to be loyal to the king of Babylonia will think that those magic rituals must be wrong. They will think that his army should not be attacking them. But he will remind them of the disloyalty of which they are guilty, and he will say that they have violated their agreement with him.

\v 21 For the king of Babylon will stop at the crossroads, at the junction, in order to obtain a prophetic message from divination. He will shake some arrows and ask direction from some idols. He will examine a liver!
\q
\v 22 In his right hand will be an omen about Jerusalem, for him to set battering rams against it! For him to open his mouth to order the killing to commence!
\q For him to sound a war cry! For him to set battering rams against the gates!
\q For him to pour out earthen mounds and to build up siege walls!
\q
\v 23 It will seem to be a useless omen in the eyes
\q of the ones in Jerusalem, those who had sworn an oath to the Babylonians! But the king will accuse them of violating their treaty in order to besiege them!
