Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the people of Jerusalem and of the land of Israel.

  * **who are thrown onto the sword! They were my people** - "those whom the sword has killed were my people"
  * **but what if the scepter does not last** - AT: "and it will be very frightening if the sword destroys the scepter and the scepter is gone." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
