\v 12 So, Son of man, cry and wail,
\q2 because I will use my sword to kill my people,
\q2 including the leaders of Israel.

\q2 my sword will kill them all,
\q1 so beat your chests to show that you are sad.

<usfm>
\q
\v 12 Call for help and lament, son of man! For that sword has come against my people! It is against all the leaders of Israel.
\q They are thrown against the sword with my people. Therefore, slap your thigh in grief!
\q
\v 13 For there is a trial, but what if the scepter does not last?—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration.
