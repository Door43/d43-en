===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the people of Ammon.

  * **Return the sword to its sheath** - "Later the sword will be put back in its sheath." This speaks of the soldiers withdrawing from attacking Jerusalem, by saying that Yahweh's sword is put back in its sheath. AT: "But later the soldiers will return their swords to their sheaths, for the time of slaughter will be over" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **sheath** - This is something that holds and covers a sword when no one is using it. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:21:01|21:3]].
  * **In the place of your creation** - The word "creation" may be expressed as a verb. AT: "In the place that I created you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **I will pour out my indignation on you** - This speaks of Yahweh punishing the Babylonians because of his indignation against them as if his indignation were a liquid that he poured out of a container upon them. AT: "I will punish you because of indignation against you" or "Out of my anger I will punish you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will fan the fire of my rage against you** - This compares Yahweh's rage to a consuming fire. AT: "I will bring my rage upon you like a blazing fire" or "I will punish you in my fierce anger" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the hand of cruel men** - The mens' "hand" refers to their control. AT: "the control of cruel men" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
