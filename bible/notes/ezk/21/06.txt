\v 6 And you, Son of man, groan as your loins break! In bitterness groan before their eyes!
\v 7 Then it will be that they will ask you, ‘For what reason are you groaning?’ And you will say, ‘Because of the report that is coming, for every heart will faint away and every hand will falter! Every spirit will grow faint and every knee will flow like water. Behold! It is coming and it will be so!’—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.”
