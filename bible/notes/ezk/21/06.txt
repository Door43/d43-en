\v 6 And you, Son of man, groan as your loins break! In bitterness groan before their eyes!
\v 7 Then it will happen that they will ask you, ‘For what reason are you groaning?’ Then you will say, ‘Because of the news that is coming, for every heart will faint away, and every hand will falter! Every spirit will grow faint, and every knee will flow like water. Behold! It is coming and it will be like this!’ This is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.”
