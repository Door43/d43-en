\q
\v 15 In order to melt their hearts and to multiply their fallen, I have set the slaughter of the sword against their gates! Woe! It is made like lightning, set free to butcher!
\q
\v 16 You, sword! Strike to the right! Strike to the left! Go wherever your sharp edge wishes. 
\q
\v 17 For I will also hit my two hands together, and then I will bring my fury to rest! I, Yahweh, declare it!"
