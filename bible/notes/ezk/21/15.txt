<usfm>
\v 15 I have set the threatening sword against all their gates, that their heart may melt, and their stumblings be multiplied:
ah! it is made as lightning, it is pointed for slaughter.
\v 16 Gather you together, go to the right, set yourself in array, go to the left, wherever your face is set.
\v 17 I will also strike my hands together, and I will cause my wrath to rest: I, Jehovah, have spoken it.
