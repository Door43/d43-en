\q
\v 15 In order to melt their heart and to multiply their stumbling blocks,
I have set the slaughter of the sword against their gates! Woe! It is made like lightning, set free to butcher!
\q
\v 16 You, sword! Strike to the right! Strike to the left! Go wherever your sharp edge wishes. 
\q
\v 17 For I will also hit my two hands together, and then I bring my fury to rest! I, Yahweh, declare it!"

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the people of Jerusalem and of the land of Israel.
 
  * **to multiply their stumbling blocks** - "to make things very difficult for them"
  * **their gates** - The word "their" refers to the people of Jerusalem.
  * **wherever your sharp edge wishes** - AT: "wherever I have assigned your sharp edge to go."
  * **I, Yahweh, declare it** - See how you translated "I, Yahweh have declared this" in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:05:15|5:15]].
