\v 25 Also, say to the king of Judah, 'You very wicked king of Israel, it is your time to die. It is the time for Yahweh to punish you.'
\v 26 And this is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say to you about your king in Jerusalem: 'Take off the king''s turban and his crown, because now things will be different than they were before. I will give power to those who had none, and I will disgrace those who had power.
\v 27 I will cause the Babylonians to destroy everything. No one will be king of Judah again, not until the man comes who deserves to be king. Then I will make him become king.'

\v 25 And you, profane and wicked ruler of Israel whose day of punishment has come, whose time of committing iniquity has ended,
\v 26 The Lord Yahweh says this: Remove the turban and take off the crown! Things will no longer be the same! Exalt the lowly and humble the exalted!
\v 27 I will make everything a ruin! A ruin! A ruin! The crown will exist no longer, not until the one comes who has a right to it. Then I will give it to him.
