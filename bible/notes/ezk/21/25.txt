\v 25 And you, profane and wicked ruler of Israel whose day has come, whose time of iniquity is ended:
\v 26 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Remove the turban and take off the crown! This is not the same! Exalt the lowly and humble the exalted!
\v 27 I will make it a ruin! A ruin! A ruin! This also will no longer exist until the one comes who has right to it. Then I will give it to him.
