\v 10 It will be sharp in order that I can slaughter many people with it;
\q2 I will polish it so that it will flash like lightning.
\q1 The people of Judah will not celebrate about their king's scepter,
\q2 because it will not resist the sword that is coming against it.
\q1
\v 11 So I will polish the sword,
\q2 and the right person will then hold it in his hand.
\q1 Now it is sharp; now it shines,
\q2 ready for the killer to use!

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues to describe the sword of Yahweh which is a metaphor for the enemy army that Yahweh will use to attack Jerusalem. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **It will be sharpened ... It will be polished in order to** - These can be stated in active form. AT: "I will sharpen it ... I will polish it so that it will" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **in order to be like lightning** - This means that the sword will be so shiny that light reflects off of it easily and brightly. AT: "so that it flashes like lightning" or "so that light reflects off of it as brightly as lightning" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Should we rejoice in my son's scepter?** - This rhetorical question emphasizes that the people of Israel will not celebrate their king's power, because it cannot resist the "sword." AT: "The people of Judah will not celebrate about their king's scepter." or "we should not celebrate the power of our king's scepter." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Should we** - The word "we" refers to Ezekiel and the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
  * **in my son's scepter** - Here Yahweh refers to the king of Judah as his son. The king's scepter represents his rule as king.

  * **The coming sword hates every such rod** - Here the "sword" is personified as coming to attack the people. This speaks of the king not being able to resist the "sword", as if the "sword" were hating the king's scepter.
