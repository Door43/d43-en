\v 10 It will be sharp in order that I can slaughter many people with it;
\q2 I will polish it so that it will flash like lightning.
\q1 The people of Judah will not celebrate about their king's scepter,
\q2 because it will not resist the sword that is coming against it.
\q1
\v 11 So I will polish the sword,
\q2 and the right person will then hold it in his hand.
\q1 Now it is sharp; now it shines,
\q2 ready for the killer to use!

\v 10 It will be sharpened in order to engage in great slaughter! It will be polished in order to be like lightening!

\q
\v 11 So the sword will be handed over to be polished, and then to be seized by the hand!
\q The sword is sharpened! And it is polished to give to the hand of a killer!
