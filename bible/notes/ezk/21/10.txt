<usfm>
\v 10 It will be sharp in order that I can slaughter many people with it;
\q2 I will polish it so that it will flash like lightning.
\q1 The people of Judah will not celebrate about their king's scepter,
\q2 because it will not resist the sword that is coming against it.
\q1
\v 11 So I will polish the sword,
\q2 and the right person will then hold it in his hand.
\q1 Now it is sharp; now it shines,
\q2 ready for the killer to use!

\q
\v 10 It will be sharpened in order to engage in great slaughter! It will be polished in order to be like lightning!
\q Should we rejoice in my son's scepter? The coming sword hates every such rod!
\q
\v 11 So the sword will be given to be polished, and then to be grasped by the hand!
\q The sword is sharpened! And it is polished to be given to the hand of a killer!'
