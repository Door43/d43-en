===== translationNotes: =====

  * **take them into your heart and hear them with your ears** - Here "heart" represents a person's mind. AT: "remember them and listen carefully" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Then go to the captives** - The word "captives" refers to the people of Israel who were living in Babylon.
  * **your people** - "your people group." Ezekiel had lived in Judah before the Babylonians took him to Babylon.
  * **Lord Yahweh** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:04|2:4]].
