\v 16 After those seven days had ended, Yahweh gave me this message:
\v 17 "Son of Man, I am appointing you to be like a watchman. So listen to these messages that I will give you, and tell them those messages to warn them.
\v 18 When I say about some wicked people, 'They will surely die because of their sins,' if you do not warn them or tell them that they must turn from their wicked behavior if they want to save their lives, they will die because of their sin, and it will be your responsibility since you did not act to prevent it.
\v 19 But if you warn wicked people and they do not turn from all their wicked behavior, they will die because of their sins, but you will have saved yourself from my punishment.

\v 16 Then it happened after seven days that the word of Yahweh came to me and said,
\v 17 "Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel, so listen to the word from my mouth, and give them my warning!
\v 18 When I say to the wicked, 'You will surely die' and you do not warn him or speak a warning to the wicked about his evil deeds so he might liveâ€”
the wicked one will die for his sin, but  I will require his blood from your hand.   
\v 19 But if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness or from his wicked deeds, then he will die for his sin, but you will
have rescued your own self.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Ezekiel tells about his experience at Tel-Abib.

  * **The word of Yahweh came to me and said** - Alternate translations: "Yahweh's message came to me" or "Yahweh gave me this message" or "Yahweh spoke this message to me."
  * **Son of man**  - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01|2:3]].
  * **house of Israel**  - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:01|3:1]].
  * **watchman**  - God told Ezekiel to warn the people of Israel just as a  watchman would warn the people of a city if enemies were coming, so that they could prepare and be safe.  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]). 
  * **a warning to the wicked about his evil deeds so he might live** - "a warning to the wicked to stop doing his evil deeds so that he might live" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
