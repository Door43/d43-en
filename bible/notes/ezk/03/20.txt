\v 21 But if you warn righteous people not to sin, and they do not sin, they will surely remain alive because they heeded your warning, and you will have saved yourself \add from my punishing you\add*."

\v 20 Similarly, when righteous people turn from their righteous behavior and do evil deeds, I will cause bad things to happen to them. But you must warn them. If you do not warn them, if they do not stop their sinful behavior, they will die because of their sins. I will not think about the righteous things that they did previously, but I will hold you responsible for their deaths .
\v 21 But if you warn righteous people not to sin, and they do not sin; they will surely remain alive because they heeded your warning, and you will have saved yourself from my punishment."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 And if a righteous man turns from his righteousness and acts unjustly, then I will set a stumbling block before him, and he will die,
since you did not warn him. He will die in his sin, and I will not call to mind the righteous deeds that he performed, but I will require his blood
from your hand.
\v 21 But if you warn the righteous man to stop sinning so that he no longer sins, he will surely live since he was warned; and you will have 
rescued your own self."
