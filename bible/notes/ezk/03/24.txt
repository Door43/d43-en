===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **Son of man** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01|2:3]].
  * **they will place ropes upon you and tie you so you cannot go out among them** - This suggests that Ezekiel will not be able to warn the people because they do not want to hear God's message.
