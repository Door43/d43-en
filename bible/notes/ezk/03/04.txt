\v 4 Then he said to me, "You human, go to the Israelite people \f + \ft metonymy \f* and tell them my message.
\v 5 The people to whom I am sending you are not people whose language is very difficult \add to learn\add*, a language which you do not understand. I am sending you to your Israelite people \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 6 I am sending you to people whose language you understand very well. If I were sending you to people whose language was difficult for you to understand, they would pay attention to what you \add say to them\add*.
\v 7 But the Israelite people do not want to listen to you because they do not want to listen to me. They do not want to listen because they are all very stubborn \f + \ft doublet \f*.

\v 4 Then he said to me, "Son of Man, go to the Israelite people and tell them my message.
\v 5 The people to whom I am sending you are not people whose language is very difficult to learn, a language which you do not understand. I am sending you to your Israelite people.
\v 6 I am sending you to people whose language you understand very well. If I were sending you to people whose language was difficult for you to understand, they would pay attention to what you say to them.
\v 7 But because the Israelite people do not want to listen to me, they will not want to listen to you. They do not want to listen because they are all very rebellious.

\v 4 Then he said to me, "Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak my words to them.
\v 5 For you are not being sent to a people of strange speech or difficult language, but to the house of Israel—
\v 6 not to many peoples of strange speech or a difficult language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely if I sent you to them, they would have listened to you.
\v 7 But the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you, for they are not willing to listen to me. So all the house of Israel is strong browed and hard hearted.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Ezekiel continues to tell about the vision that he saw.

  * **he said to me** - If your language has to identify the one speaking, it would be best to identify the speaker as the "one who looked like a man" ([[:en:bible:notes:ezk:01:26|1:26]]). It was not "the Spirit."
  * **the house of Israel** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:01|3:1]]. AT: "the Israelites" or "the Israelite people group" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **of strange speech or a difficult language** - "who speak a strange or difficult language"
  * **not to many peoples of strange speech** - "I am not sending you to a mighty nation whose people speak a strange language"
  * **if I sent you to them, they would have listened to you** - This is a hypothetical situation that could have happened but did not. Yahweh did not send Ezekiel to people who did not understand his language. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **if I sent you to them** - The word "them" refers to a mighty nation other than Israel.
  * **strong browed and hard hearted** - These mean basically the same thing. AT: "very rebellious" (UDB) or "very stubborn" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **strong browed** - This is an idiom. AT: "unwilling to change" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **hard hearted** - This phrase suggests that the people resist God and are unwilling to obey him. The heart is used to describe the place in the body where a person decides what they want to do. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:04|2:4]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
