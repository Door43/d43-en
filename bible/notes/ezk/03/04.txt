\v 4 Then he said to me, "Son of Man, go to the Israelite people  and tell them my message.
\v 5 The people to whom I am sending you are not people whose language is very difficult to learn, a language which you do not understand. I am sending you to your Israelite people .

\v 4 Then he said to me, "Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak my words to them.
\v 5 For you are not being sent to a people of a strange speech or a difficult language, but to the house of Israelâ€”
\v 6 not to a mighty nation of strange speech or a difficult language whose words you could not understand! If I sent
you to them, they would listen to you!
\v 7 But the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you, for they are not willing to listen to me. So all the house of Israel is stubborn-browed and hard-hearted.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Ezekiel continues to tell about the vision that he saw.

  * **He said to me**  - The word "He" refers to the Spirit of God.
  * **Son of man**  - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01|2:3]].
  * **house of Israel**  - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:01|3:1]].
  * **of a strange speech or a difficult language** - "who speak a strange or difficult language."
  * **not to a mighty nation of strange speech**  - "I am not sending you to a mighty nation whose people speak a strange language"
  * **If I sent you to them**  - The word "them" refers to a mighty nation other than Israel.
  * **stubborn-browed and hard-hearted** - "stubborn and rebellious" or "stubborn and unrepentant." Together they mean "very stubborn." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
