\v 22 I felt Yahweh take control, and he spoke to me and said, "Get up and go to the plain, and I will speak to you there."
\v 23 So I got up and went out to the plain. And I saw the glory of Yahweh there, like the glory that I had seen along the Chebar canal. And I threw myself flat onto the ground.

\v 22 So the hand of Yahweh was on me there, and he said to me, "Arise! Go out into the plain, and I will speak with you there!"
\v 23 I arose and went out into the plain, and there the glory of Yahweh was staying, like the glory that I had seen beside the Chebar canal;
so I fell on my face.
