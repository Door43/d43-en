\v 22 So the hand of Yahweh was on me there, and he said to me, "Arise! Go forth into the plain, and I will speak with you there!"
\v 23 I arose and went forth into the plain, and there the glory of Yahweh was staying, like the glory that I had seen beside the river Chebar canal;
so I fell on my face.
