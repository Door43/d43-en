===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Ezekiel continues to tell about the vision that he saw.

  * **He said to me** - The word "He" refers to the "one who looked like a man" ([[:en:bible:notes:ezk:01:26|1:26]]).
  * **Son of man** - "Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01|2:1]]. AT: "Mortal person" or "Human"
  * **what you have found** - This refers to the scroll that God was giving him. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:09|2:9]])
  * **the house of Israel** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. AT: "the Israelites" or "the Israelite people group" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **that scroll** - Many versions have "the scroll" or "this scroll."
  * **feed your belly and fill your stomach with this scroll** - The word "belly" refers to the part of the body people can see from the outside. The word "stomach" refers to the internal organs inside the belly.
  * **it was as sweet as honey** - Honey tastes sweet, and the scroll tasted sweet.
