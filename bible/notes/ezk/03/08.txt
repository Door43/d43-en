===== Translation Notes: =====

The Spirit of God continues speaking to Ezekiel.

  * **Behold!** - The word "Behold" here alerts Ezekiel to pay attention to the surprising information that follows. 
  * **I have made your face as stubborn as their faces** - The words "face" and "faces" are used to stand for the people the sentence is about. Alternate translation: "I have made you as stubborn as they are." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **your brow as hard as their brows** - The "brow" is the forehead or eyebrow.  It used in the same way as "face."
  * **I have made your brow like a diamond, harder than flint** - "I have made your brow like the hardest stone, harder than flint."
  * **flint** - a stone that is hard enough to start a fire by hitting it with metal or another stone
