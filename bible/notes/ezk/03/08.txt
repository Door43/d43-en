===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The Spirit of God continues speaking to Ezekiel.

  * **Behold!** - The word "Behold" here alerts Ezekiel to pay attention to the surprising information that follows. 
  * **I have made your face as stubborn as their faces** - The words "face" and "faces" are used to stand for the people the sentence is about. AT: "I have made you as stubborn as they are" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **I have made ... your brow as hard as their brows** - The "brow" is the forehead or eyebrow and is a metonym for what the person thinks. AT: "I have made ... you strong so you will not stop doing what you are doing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I have made your brow like a diamond, harder than flint** - "I have made your brow like the hardest stone, harder than flint"
  * **flint** - a stone that is hard enough to start a fire by hitting it with metal or another stone
  * **house** - This is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:04|2:5]]. AT: "people group" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
