\v 26 \add Even though\add* they are very rebellious people, I will cause your tongue to stick to the roof of your mouth, with the result that you will be unable to talk and to rebuke them.
\v 27 But then when I speak to you again, I will enable you to talk \f + \ft metonymy \f* and you will say to them, 'This is what Yahweh the Lord says,' \add and you will tell them my message\add*.

\v 27 But then when I speak to you again, I will enable you to talk and tell them 'This is what the Lord Yahweh is saying to you.' The one who wants to hear me will hear me, but the one who ignores the message will come to an end, since they are a rebellious people!"

<usfm>
\v 26 I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth, so you will be mute; and you will not be able to rebuke them, since
they are a rebellious house.
\v 27 But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth so you will say to them, 'The Lord Yahweh says this.' The one who will hear will hear;
the one who will not listen will not listen, for they are a rebellious house!"
