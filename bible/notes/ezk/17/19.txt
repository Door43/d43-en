\v 19 Therefore this is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say: Just as surely as I am alive, I will cause the king of Judah to be punished [IDI] for ignoring the solemn agreement that he made \add with the king of Babylon\add* and then refusing to obey it.
\v 20 \add It will be as though\add* I will spread a net to capture him, and he will be caught in it. He will \add be captured and\add* taken to Babylon and punished because he rebelled against me.

\v 19 Therefore this is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say: Just as surely as I am alive, I will cause the king of Judah to be punished for ignoring the solemn agreement that he made with the king of Babylon and then refusing to obey it, since this violates what I expect.
\v 20 It will be as though I will spread a net to capture him, and he will be caught in it. He will be captured and taken to Babylon and punished because he rebelled against me.
\v 21 Most of his soldiers who try to escape will be killed by their enemies' swords, and those who survive will be scattered in all directions. Then you will know that I, Yahweh, have the power to do what I say that I will do."

\v 19 Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this: As I live, was it not my oath that he despised and my covenant that he broke? So I will bring his punishment on his head!
\v 20 I will spread my net out over him, and he will be caught in my hunting net. Then I will bring him to Babylon and execute judgment on him there for his treason that he committed when he betrayed me!
\v 21 All of his refugees in his armies will fall by the sword, and the ones who remain will be scattered in every direction. Then you will know that I am Yahweh; I have declared this would happen."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **was it not my oath that he despised and my covenant that he broke?** - Yahweh asks this leading question to emphasize the affirmative answer. This question can be translated as a statement. AT: "it was my oath that the king of Jerusalem despised and my covenant that he broke." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]).
  * **I will bring his punishment on his head** - The idiom "bring ... on his head" means that he will experience this punishment. See how you translated this idiom in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:11:19|11:21]]. AT: "I will cause him to suffer his punishment" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **I will spread my net out over him, and he will be caught in my hunting net** - Yahweh speaks of enabling the enemy army to capture the king as if he were trapping the king in a net. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **fall by the sword** - Here the word "sword" represents the enemy soldiers who fight with swords. To "fall by the sword" is an idiom that means to die in battle. AT: "be killed by enemy soldiers" or "die in battle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **the ones who remain will be scattered in every direction** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the ones who remain alive will flee in every direction" or "the enemy soldiers will scatter in every directions the ones who remain alive" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **know that I am Yahweh** - When Yahweh says that people will know that he is Yahweh, he is implying that they will know that he is the one true God who has supreme authority and power. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:06:06|6:7]]. AT: "understand that I am Yahweh, the one true God" or "realize that I, Yahweh, have supreme power and authority" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
