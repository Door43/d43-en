\v 20 \add It will be as though\add* I will spread a net to capture him, and he will be caught in it. He will \add be captured and\add* taken to Babylon and punished because he rebelled against me.

\v 19 Therefore this is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say: Just as surely as I am alive, I will cause the king of Judah to be punished for ignoring the solemn agreement that he made with the king of Babylon and then refusing to obey it, since this violates what I expect.
\v 20 It will be as though I will spread a net to capture him, and he will be caught in it. He will be captured and taken to Babylon and punished because he rebelled against me.
\v 21 Most of his soldiers who try to escape will be killed by their enemies' swords, and those who survive will be scattered in all directions. Then you will know that I, Yahweh, have the power to do what I say that I will do."

\v 19 Therefore'—the Lord Yahweh says this—'as I live, was it not my oath that he despised and my covenant that he broke? So I will bring his punishment on his head!
\v 20 I will spread my net out over him, and he will be caught in my hunting net. Then I will bring him to Babylon and execute judgment on him there for his treason that he committed when he betrayed me!
\v 21 And all of his refugees in his armies will fall by the sword, and the ones who remain will be scattered in every direction. Then you will know that I am Yahweh; I have declared this would happen!"
