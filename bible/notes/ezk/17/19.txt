\v 19 Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: As I live, surely mine oath that he has despised, and my covenant that he has
broken, I will even bring it upon his own head.
\v 20 And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will enter
into judgment with him there for his trespass that he has trespassed against me.
\v 21 And all his fugitives in all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward every
wind: and you shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken it.
