\v 17 And Pharaoh with his mighty army and assembling of many men for war will not protect him in battle, when the Babylonian army builds siege mounds and siege walls to destroy many lives.
\v 18 For the king has despised his oath by breaking the covenant. Behold, he reached out with his hand to promise, but he has done all these things. He will not escape.
