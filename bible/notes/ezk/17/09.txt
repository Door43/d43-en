\v 9 Say to the people, 'The Lord Yahweh says this: Will it prosper?
\q Will it not be uprooted and stripped of its fruit so that it withers, and all its fresh growth will wither?
\q No strong arm or many people will be needed to pull it out by its roots.
\q
\v 10 So behold! After it has been planted, will it grow? Will it not wither when the eastern wind touches it?
\q It will completely wither away in the garden plot where it sprouted.'"
