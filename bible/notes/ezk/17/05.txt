This is a continuation of the parable about the eagle.

Alternate translation: "and planted the seed like a willow tree by water." (See: [[en:ta:translate:parallelism]])
  * **Then it sprouted** - "Then the seed began to grow into a plant"
  * **a spreading vine low to the ground** - "a vine that spreads out on the ground"
