===== Translation Notes: =====

This is a continuation of the parable about the eagle.

  * **he also took**  - The word "he" is the eagle in the parable.
  * **ground ready for sowing** - "a field that was ready for seed to be planted in it." Alternate translations: "a fertile field" or "in good ground."
  * **He set it beside a large body of water** - "the eagle planted the seed in a place where there was a lot of water"
  * **planted it like a willow** - Willow trees grow in places where there is a lot of water. If the eagle planted the seed like a willow, it means that he planted it in a place with a lot of water. Alternate translation: "and planted the seed like a willow tree by water." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Then it sprouted** - "Then the seed began to grow into a plant"
  * **a spreading vine low to the ground** - "a vine that spreads out on the ground"
  * **its branches turned toward him** - The branches of the vine turned toward the eagle.
  * **its roots grew under him**  - The roots of the vine grew under the eagle.
  * **So it became a vine** - "That is how the vine grew"
  * **produced branches and sent out shoots** - "grew branches and spread its shoots"
