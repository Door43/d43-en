===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 I will cause your country to be ruined and desolate. When that happens, people will know that I, Yahweh, \add have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*.
\p
\v 5 You have always been enemies of the Israelite people. You have rejoiced when they experienced a great disaster when \add their enemies attacked them with\add* swords, when I punished them \add for the sins that they had committed\add*.
\v 6 Therefore, I, Yahweh the Lord, declare that as surely as I am alive, I will allow \add your enemies\add* to slaughter \f + \ft metonymy \f* you and continue to slaughter you. You were happy when \f + \ft litotes \f* others were slaughtered;
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 I will destroy your cities, and everyone will leave them. When that happens, you will know that I, Yahweh, have the power to do what I say that I will do.
\p
\v 5 You have always been enemies of the Israelite people. You rejoiced when they experienced a great disaster, when their enemies attacked them, when I was punishing them most severely for the sins that they had committed.
\v 6 Therefore, I, Yahweh the Lord, declare that as surely as I am alive, I will allow your enemies to slaughter you. They will attack you again and again. You enjoyed watching other people die, so I will slaughter you.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 I will make your cities ruins, and you yourself will become desolate; then you will know that I am Yahweh.
\v 5 Because you have always been hostile to the people of Israel, and because you poured them out into the hands of the sword at the time of their distress, at the time their punishment was at its greatest—
\v 6 therefore, as I live—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration—I will prepare you for bloodshed, and bloodshed will pursue you! Since you did not hate bloodshed, bloodshed will pursue you.
