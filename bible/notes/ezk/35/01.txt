===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh tells Ezekiel to speak a prophecy. Ezekiel is to speak to Mount Seir, but the message is for all of the people of Edom.

  * **the word of Yahweh came** - This is an idiom that is used to introduce something that God told his prophets or his people. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:16|3:16]]. AT: "Yahweh spoke this message" or "Yahweh spoke these words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Son of man** - "Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01|2:1]]. AT: "Mortal person" or "Human"
  * **set your face against Mount Seir** - Mount Seir was far away, so Ezekiel could not see it, but Yahweh commands him to stare in that direction as a symbol of harming the people there. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:06:01|6:2]]. AT: "turn toward Mount Seir and stare" or "stare toward Mount Seir so that the people there will be harmed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **Mount Seir and prophesy against it** - "the mountain of Seir." Yahweh tells Ezekiel to speak to Mount Seir as if it could hear him. The message is for all of the people of Edom. AT: "Mount Seir and prophesy against it because of what the people of Edom have done" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **to it** - "to the mountain" or "to the people of Edom"
  * **Behold! I am against you, Mount Seir, and I will strike you with my hand and make you a desolation and a horror** - Yahweh tells Ezekiel to speak to Mount Seir as if it could hear him. The message is for all of the people of Edom. AT: "Listen, Mount Seir, I will strike you with my hand and make you a desolation and a horror because of what your people did" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **Behold!** - The word "Behold" here adds emphasis to what follows. AT: "Listen!" or "Indeed!"
  * **I am against you** - "I am your enemy" (UDB) or "I oppose you"
  * **I will strike you with my hand** - Here "hand" represents power. AT: "I will use my power to strike you" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **make you a desolation and a horror** - The abstract nouns "desolation" and "horror" can be translated as adjectives." AT: "make you desolate and ruined" or "make you a desolate wasteland" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
