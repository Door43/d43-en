\v 10 You have said, "These two nations and these two lands will become mine, and we will possess them," even when Yahweh was present with them.
\v 11 Therefore, as I live—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration—so I will do according to your anger and according to your jealousy that you had in your hatred of Israel, and I will show myself to them when I judge you.
