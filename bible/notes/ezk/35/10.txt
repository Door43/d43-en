\v 10 Because you have said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas Jehovah
was there:
\v 11 therefore, as I live, says the Lord Jehovah, I will do according to your anger, and according to your envy which you
have showed out of your hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I shall judge thee.
\v 12 And you shall know that I, Jehovah, have heard all your revilings which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel,
saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to devour.
