===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This continues Yahweh's message to the people of Mount Seir.

  * **when I cut off from it anyone who passes through and returns again** - Possible meanings are 1) I will destroy anyone who enters it or leaves it" (UDB) or 2) "I will make it so that people do not travel back and forth through it."
  * **killed by the sword** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:31:17|31:17]].
  * **a perpetual desolation** - "desolate forever." This is exaggerated to emphasize the destruction. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **Your cities will not be inhabited** - This can be stated in active form. It may be an exaggeration for emphasis. AT: "People will not live in your cities" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **but you will know** - Here "you" is plural. God is speaking to the people of Mount Sier, rather than to a single mountain. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **will know that I am Yahweh** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:06:06|6:7]].
