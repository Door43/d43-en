===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This continues the message that Ezekiel is to speak to Mount Seir. The message is for all the people of Edom.

  * **when I cut off from it anyone who passes through and returns again** - Possible meanings are 1) "cut off" is a metaphor that means to destroy. AT: "I will destroy anyone who enters it or leaves it" or 2) "cut off" is a metaphor that means to stop someone from doing something. AT: "I will make it so that people do not travel back and forth through it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **with its dead** - The nominal adjective can be stated as an adjective. AT: "with dead people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]])
  * **those killed by the sword** - Here "sword" represents enemies who fought them in battle. This can be stated in active form. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:31:17|31:17]]. AT: "those whom enemies have killed with swords" or "those who have died in battle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **a perpetual desolation** - "desolate forever." This may be an exaggeration to emphasize the destruction. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **Your cities will not be inhabited** - This can be stated in active form. This may be an exaggeration for emphasis. AT: "People will not live in your cities" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **but you will know** - Here "you" is plural. God is speaking to the people of Mount Seir, rather than to a single mountain. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
