\v 13 The Levites' land along the border with the priests' land will be twenty-five thousand cubits in length and ten thousand cubits in width. The entire length of the two tracts of land will be twenty-five thousand cubits in length and twenty thousand cubits in width.
\v 14 They must not sell it or exchange it; none of this firstfruits of the land of Israel must ever be separated from these tracts, for it all is holy to Yahweh.

===== translationWords: =====

  * [[:en:obe:kt:firstfruit]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:holy]]

===== translationNotes: =====
 
  * **twenty-five thousand cubits ... ten thousand cubits** - Each long cubit was about 54 centimeters. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:40:05|40:5]]. AT: "25,000 cubits ... 10,000 cubits" or "13.5 kilometers ... 5.4 kilometers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bdistance]])
  * **this firstfruits** - "this land which is the firstfruits." Here "firstfruits" probably means the best things among all the offerings set aside to give to God. This land is spoken of in that way, as land set aside for Yahweh's use. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
