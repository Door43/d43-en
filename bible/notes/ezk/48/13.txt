\v 13 The Levites' land along the border with the priests' land will be twenty-five thousand cubits long and ten thousand cubits wide. The entire length of the two tracts of land will be twenty-five thousand cubits long and twenty thousand cubits wide.

  * [[:en:obe:kt:firstfruit]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:holy]]

===== translationNotes: =====
 
  * **this firstfruits** - "this land which is the firstfruits." Here "firstfruits" probably means the best things among all the offerings set aside to give to God. This land is spoken of in that way, as land set aside for Yahweh's use. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
