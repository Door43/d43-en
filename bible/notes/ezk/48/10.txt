\v 10 For the priests, there will be a strip of land 8.3 miles\f + \ft Or: 13.3 km. \f* wide and 3.3 miles\f + \ft Or: 5.3 km. \f* wide, with the temple in the center.
\v 11 That area is for the priests who are descendants of Zadok. They are ones who served me faithfully and did not turn away from Yahweh like most of the descendants of Levi and the other Israelite people did.
\v 12 When the land is distributed, that area will be the priests' special portion, land that is very sacred. Next to the priests' territory will be where the other descendants of Levi will live.

\v 10 Within this special area, these will what you will assign to the priests: you will assign them an area of land measuring about 13.5 kilometers on the northern and southern side; and about 5.4 kilometers on the western and eastern sides. The temple of Yahweh will be in the middle of this special area.
\v 11 The temple area will be for the priests, those set apart for my honor, who are descendants of Zadok. They are ones who served me faithfully and did not turn away from Yahweh as the descendants of Levi did.
\v 12 When the land is distributed, you will offer that special area to me, for it to be the priests' special portion; it is land that you will treat as very special to me. Next to the priests' territory will be where the other descendants of Levi will live.
