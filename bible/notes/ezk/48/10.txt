\v 11 That area is for the priests who are descendants of Zadok. They are ones who served me faithfully and did not turn away from Yahweh like most of the descendants of Levi and the other Israelite people did.
\v 12 When the land is distributed, that area will be the priests' special portion, land that is very sacred. Next to the priests' territory will be where the other descendants of Levi will live.

\v 10 And the holy contribution will be for these priests: To the north twenty thousand and to the west ten thousand wide, and there will be a sanctuary of Yahweh in its midst.
\v 11 The sanctuary will be for the priests of the line of Zadok who keep my judgments, who did not go astray by wandering off with the sons of Israel as the Levites went astray.
\v 12 So the contribution to them will be a contribution of the most holy land to the border of the Levites.
