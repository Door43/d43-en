====== Ezekiel 48:10-12 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 For the priests, there will be a strip of land 8.3 miles\f + \ft Or: 13.3 km. \f* wide and 3.3 miles\f + \ft Or: 5.3 km. \f* wide, with the temple in the center.
\v 11 That area is for the priests who are descendants of Zadok. They are ones who served me faithfully and did not turn away from Yahweh like most of the descendants of Levi and the other Israelite people did.
\v 12 When the land is distributed, that area will be the priests' special portion, land that is very sacred. Next to the priests' territory will be where the other descendants of Levi will live.

\v 10 Within this special area, these will what you will assign to the priests: you will assign them an area of land measuring thirteen and one-half kilometers on the northern and southern side; and five and two-fifths kilometers on the western and eastern sides. The temple of Yahweh will be in the middle of this special area.
\v 11 The temple area will be for the priests, those set apart for my honor, who are descendants of Zadok. They are ones who served me faithfully and did not turn away from Yahweh as the descendants of Levi did.
\v 12 When the land is distributed, you will offer that special area to me, for it to be the priests' special portion; it is land that you will treat as very special to me. Next to the priests' territory will be where the other descendants of Levi will live.

\v 10 These will be the assignments of this holy portion of land: the priests will have land assigned to them measuring twenty-five thousand cubits in length on the north side; ten thousand cubits in width on the west side; ten thousand cubits in width on the east side; and twenty-five thousand cubits in length on the south side, with the holy place of Yahweh in the middle of it.
\v 11 This will be for the consecration of the priests of the line of Zadok, who have served me faithfully and who did not go astray when the people of Israel went astray, as the Levites did.
\v 12 The offering for them will be a portion of this most holy land, extending to the border of the Levites.
