\v 11 Tell them, 'What I did is a warning to you. What I did in front of you, they are going to have to do. They will be captured and forced to go to another country.
\v 12 Their king will put his belongings on his shoulder when it becomess dark, and try to escape. His servants will dig a hole through the city wall, and he will take his belongings through it. He will cover his face so others will not recognize him and he won't be able to see the land.
\v 13 But it will be as though I will spread a net for him to be captured; enemy soldiers will capture him, blind him, and take him to the city of Babylon where the Chaldean people live. But he will not be able to see it because he will be blind; and there he will die.

\v 11 Say, 'I am sign to you. As I have done, so it will be done to them; they will go into exile and into captivity.
\v 12 The prince who is among them will lift up his things upon his shoulder in the dark, and will go out through the wall. They will dig through the wall and bring out their things. He will cover his face, so he will not see the land with his eyes.'
\v 13 I will spread out my net over him and he will be caught in my snare; then I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, but
he will not see it. He will die there.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **in the dark** - "at night while it is dark"
  * **I will spread out my net over him and he will be caught in my snare** - The words "net" and "snare" are used because these are different ways to trap an animal. God knows what the leader of Jerusalem will do and has set up events so that he will be captured as he tries to escape. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will bring him to Babylon** - AT: "I will cause him to be taken to Babylon"
