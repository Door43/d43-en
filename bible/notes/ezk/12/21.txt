\v 21 Again the word of Yahweh came to me and said,
\v 22 "Son of man, what is this proverb that you have in the land of Israel that says, 'The days are prolonged, and every vision fails?'
\v 23 Therefore, say to them, 'The Lord Yahweh says this: I will put an end to this proverb so the people of Israel will no longer use it.' Then declare to them, 'The days are approaching, and every vision will speak!'
