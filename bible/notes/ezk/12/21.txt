\v 21 Again the word of Yahweh came to me and said,
\v 22 "Son of man, what is this proverb that you have in the land of Israel that says, "The days are prolonged, and every vision fails'?
\v 23 Therefore, say to them, 'Thus says the Lord Yahweh: I will put an end to this proverb so the people of Israel will no longer use it.' Then declare to them, 'The days draw near, and every vision will speak!'

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the word of Yahweh came to me and said**  - See how you translated this in 3:16.
  * **'The days are prolonged, and every vision fails'** - This is a common proverb known by Israel and is used in God's words or prophecy through the prophet Ezekiel to show the power of God to them. This proverb means: 'The days keep passing, and what the prophets predict never happens.' 
  * **Thus says the Lord Yahweh** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:05|5:5]].
  * **The days draw near ** - "soon will be the time" "soon the day/time/hour will arrive" (See: metaphor).
  * **every vision will speak** - "every prophecy will come to 'pass' or 'happen'" (See: metaphor). In the words of God, the former proverb was changed to: "The days draw near, and every vision will speak!", which is the direct opposite of the common saying. God really wanted to show that he is the Lord and is sovereign or all powerful.
