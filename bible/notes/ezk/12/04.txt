\v 4 And you will bring out your things for an exile in the day in their sight; go out in the evening in their sight in the way that anyone goes into exile.
\v 5 Dig a hole through the wall in their sight, and go out through it.
\v 6 In their sight, lift up your things onto your shoulder, and bring them out in the darkness. Cover your face, for you must not see the land, since I have set you as a sign to the house of Israel."
