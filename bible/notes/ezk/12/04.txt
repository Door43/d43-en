\v 4 You will bring out your things for an exile in the day in their sight; go out in the evening in their sight in the way that anyone goes into exile.
\v 5 Dig a hole through the wall in their sight, and go out through it.
\v 6 In their sight, lift up your things onto your shoulder, and bring them out in the darkness. Cover your face, for you must not see the land, since I have set you as a sign to the house of Israel."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - God is speaking to Ezekiel and describing how he should act out the parable.

  * **in their sight** - "as they watch"
  * **have set you as a sign** - Here the word "sign" refers to something that communicates a special warning to those who see it. Yahweh speaks of Ezekiel and his actions as being this warning. AT: "have made you to be a warning" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **house of Israel** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:01|3:1]]. AT: "the Israelite people group" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
