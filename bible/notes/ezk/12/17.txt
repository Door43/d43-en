===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The word of Yahweh came to me and said** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:16|3:16]].
  * ** Son of man** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01|2:3]].
  * **eat your bread with trembling, and drink your water with shaking and worry**  - AT: "live your daily life with great fear." Eating and drinking are common things done in life and so tell Ezekiel to live with great fear. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]], [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
