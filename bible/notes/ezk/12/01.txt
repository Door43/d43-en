===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The word of Yahweh came** - This is an idiom that is used to introduce something that God told his prophets or his people. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:16|3:16]]. AT: "Yahweh spoke this message" or "Yahweh spoke these words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Son of man** - "Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. AT: "Mortal person" or "Human"
  * **a rebellious house** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:04|2:5]]. AT: "a rebellious people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **they have eyes to see but they do not see ... they have ears to hear but do not listen** - People being unable to understand Yahweh's message and what he is doing is spoken of as if the people were unable physically to see and hear. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
