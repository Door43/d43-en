  * **Son of man, is the house of Israel, that rebellious house, not asking, 'What are you doing?'** - God asks this rhetorical question to remind Ezekiel of something he already knew - that the people had asked him this question.

  * **the house of Israel, a rebellious house** - This is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years.

  * **What are you doing?** - Since the people had seen what Ezekiel was doing, their question implies their desire to know the reason why he was doing it. AT: "What is the meaning of the things you are doing?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
