\v 26 Yahweh also gave me this message:
\v 27 "You human, the Israelite people are constantly saying about you, 'The things that he sees in visions \add will not happen soon\add*. They are about \add things that will happen\add* many years from now, far in the future.'
\p
\v 28 Therefore say to them, 'This is what Yahweh the Lord \f + \ft doublet \f* says: I will no longer delay \add causing to happen\add* any of the things that I have prophesied. Whatever I have predicted will \add soon\add* happen.'~"

\v 26 Again the word of Yahweh came to me and said,
\v 27 "Son of man, behold! The house of Israel has said, 'The vision that he sees is for many days from now, and he prophesies of far off times.'
\v 28 Therefore say to them, 'Thus says the Lord Yahweh: My words will not be delayed any longer, but the word that I have spoken will be done.'  This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration!"

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The Word of Yahweh came to me and said **- See how you translated this in 3:16.
  * **Behold**  - The word “behold” here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.
  * **The vision that he sees is for many days from now, and he prophesies of far off times**  - This is something the people of Israel would say.  They are saying events of the vision Ezekiel has been telling them about will not happen for a very long time.  They do not believe they have to worry about God's judgement during their lifetime.
  * **Thus says the Lord Yahweh**  - See how you translated this in 5:5.
  * **My words will not be delayed any longer, but the word that I have spoken will be done**  - In contrast to the popular saying of Israel in 12:27, God is stating that "my" or "God's" words are going to come to pass and not be "delayed", or happen at a later time. 
  * **This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration**  - See how you translated this in 5:11.
