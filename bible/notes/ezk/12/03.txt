===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh is telling Ezekiel to act out another parable.

  * **Therefore as for you** - "So then, this is what I say to you"
  * **in their sight** - "as they watch"
  * **Perhaps they will begin to see** - People being able to understand Yahweh's message and what he is doing is spoken of as if the people were able physically to see. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a rebellious house** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:04|2:5]]. AT: "a rebellious people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
