===== Translation Notes: =====

Ezekiel is performing another of the acted-out parables.

  * **Therefore as for you** - "So this is for you"
  * **Perhaps they will begin to see, though they are a rebellious house** - AT: "Maybe they will begin to understand what you are describing" The word "see" is used to refer to the Jewish people's ability to understand. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
