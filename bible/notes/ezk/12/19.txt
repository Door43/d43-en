\v 19 Then say to the people of the land, 'The Lord Yahweh says this concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the land of Israel: They will eat their bread with trembling and drink their water while shaking, since the land will be despoiled of its fullness because of the violence of all those who live there.
\v 20 So the cities that were inhabited will be desolate, and the land will become a wasteland; so you will know that I am Yahweh!'"

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Thus says the Lord Yahweh** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:05|5:5]].
  * **They will eat their bread with trembling and drink their water while shaking** - AT: "They will live daily life with great fear." Eating and drinking are used because they tell the people of Israel to live with great fear. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]], [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **cities that were inhabited will be desolate** - "desolate" describes a place where no one lives.  AT: "people in cities will leave or die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **know that I am Yahweh** - See how this phrase is translated in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:06:06|6:6]].
