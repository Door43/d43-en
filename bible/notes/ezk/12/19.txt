\v 19 Then say to the people of the land, 'The Lord Yahweh says this concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the land of Israel: They will eat their bread with trembling and drink their water while shaking, since the land will be despoiled of its fullness because of the violence of all those who live there.
\v 20 So the cities that were inhabited will be desolate, and the land will become a wasteland; so you will know that I am Yahweh!'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **They will eat their bread with trembling and drink their water while shaking** - These two phrases share similar meanings and emphasize that the people will be very afraid, even while doing the most basic things like eating and drinking. AT: "They will live daily life with great fear." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **cities that were inhabited will be desolate** - "desolate" describes a place where no one lives. AT: "people in cities will leave or die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **know that I am Yahweh** - See how this phrase is translated in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:06:06|6:6]].
