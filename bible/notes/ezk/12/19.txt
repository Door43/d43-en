\v 19 Then say to the people of the land, 'Thus says the Lord Yahweh concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the land of Israel: They will
eat their bread with trembling and drink their water while shaking, since the land will be despoiled of its fullness because of the violence 
of all those who dwell there.
\v 20 So the cities that were inhabited will be desolate, and the land will become a wasteland; so you will know that I am Yahweh!'"

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Thus says the Lord Yahweh** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:05|5:5]].
  * **They will eat their bread with trembling and drink their water while shaking** - "They will live with great fear" These phrases "with trembling" and "while shaking" are ways to say a person is very afraid. Eating and drinking are used because they are common things done in life. These are both telling the people of Israel to live with great fear. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]], [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **cities that were inhabited will be desolate** - "active cities with residents will be destroyed" or "uninhabited" like "ghost towns"
  * **land will become a wasteland** - "land will be turned into a land with nothing" or "land we become a desert"
