\v 7 For I will set my face against them. Though they come out from the fire, yet the fire will consume them; so you will know that I am Yahweh, when I set my face against them.
\v 8 Then I will make the land into an abandoned wasteland because they have committed sin—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration."
