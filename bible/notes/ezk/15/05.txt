\v 5 See! When it was complete, it could not make anything; surely then, when the fire has burned, then 
it still will not make anything useful!"
\v 6 Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this: "Unlike the trees in the forests, I have given the vine as fuel for fires; I will act in the same way toward the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
