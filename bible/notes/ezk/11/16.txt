\v 16 Therefore say, 'The Lord Yahweh says this: though I have removed them far off among the nations, and though I have
scattered them among the lands, yet I have been a sanctuary for them for a little while in the lands where they have gone.'
\v 17 Therefore say, 'The Lord Yahweh says this: I will gather you from the peoples, and assemble you from the lands
where you were scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel!'
\v 18 Then they will go there and remove every detestable thing and every abomination from that place.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh gives Ezekiel his message to Israel about those who were scattered.

  * **I have been a sanctuary for them** - AT: "I have been with them to preserve them."
  * **lands where they have gone**  - AT: "nations where they have been taken"
  * **I will gather you from the peoples, and assemble you from the lands** - Yahweh says this promise two times in different ways in order to show that it's important. AT: "I will bring you back from the nations of people" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **detestable** - AT: "horrible," or "offensive"
