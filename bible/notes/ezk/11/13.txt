===== translationNotes: =====

  * **It came about** - This phrase is used here to mark an important event in the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **Pelatiah son of Benaiah** - This is the name of a man. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:11:01|11:1]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **I fell on my face** - "I bowed down to the ground" or "I lay on the ground." Ezekiel did not fall by accident. He went down to the ground to show that he respected and feared Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **Alas, Lord Yahweh** - The word "Alas" is an exclamation that expresses fear and sadness. AT: "Oh no, Lord Yahweh" or "Ah, Lord Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclamations]])
