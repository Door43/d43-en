<usfm>
\v 19 I will give you Israelistes one new heart and I will give you a new way of thinking when you return to Israel. You will not be stubborn, but will be obedient.
\v 20 When I do that, you will carefully obey all my laws. You will be my people, and I will be your God.
\v 21 But as for those who are devoted to worshiping their vile statues and detestable idols, I will punish them as they deserve for the evil things that they have done." This is what Yahweh declared.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit in them when they come near to me; I will take the stone heart from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh,
\v 20 so that they will walk in my statutes, they will carry out my decrees and do them. Then they will be my people, and I will be their God.
\v 21 But to those who walk with affection toward their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their conduct on their own heads—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration."
