===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within them. I will take out the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh,
\v 20 so that they will walk in my statutes, they will carry out my decrees and do them. Then they will be my people, and I will be their God.
\v 21 But to those who walk with affection toward their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their conduct on their own heads—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration."

  * **General Information:** - God continues the prophecy of what will happen to the scattered Israelites.

  * **I will give them one heart** - Here the metonym "heart" represents the will and emotions. Yahweh speaks of causing all of the people to share the same new emotions as if he were giving them one heart. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will put a new spirit within them** - Here the metonym "spirit" represents the thoughts and disposition.

  * **I will take out the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh** - Yahweh speaks of the people being stubborn as if they had a stone heart and of their being willingly obedient as if they had a heart of flesh. He speaks of causing them to become willingly obedient as if he were exchanging those two hearts. AT: "I will cause them to stop being stubborn and instead cause them to obey me willingly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **they will walk in my statutes, they will carry out my decrees and do them** - Each of these phrases have similar meanings and describes the people as obeying what Yahweh has commanded them to do. They are repeated for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **those who walk with affection toward their detestable things** - Yahweh speaks of a person's conduct as if it were the person walking. AT: "those who conduct their lives out of devotion to their detestable things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **detestable things** - This means things that cause hatred or disgust. Here it refers to idols. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:11:16|11:18]].
  * **I will bring their conduct on their own heads** - Here the metonym "conduct" represents the consequences of their actions.
