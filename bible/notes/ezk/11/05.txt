for I know the things that come into your mind.
\v 6 You have multiplied the people you have killed in this city and filled its streets with them.
\v 7 Therefore, thus says the Lord Yahweh: The people you have killed, whose bodies you have laid in the midst of Jerusalem, are the meat,

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to talk to the prophet Ezekiel.

  * **house of Israel**  - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:03:01|3:1]].
  * **Thus says Yahweh**  - “This is what Yahweh says!” or “Yahweh says this.” This sentence introduces what God will say.
  * **them**  - "they" refers to the people of Jerusalem
  * **this city**  - "this city" refers to Jerusalem
  * **The people you have killed...are the meat...this city is the pot** - These phrases are saying the people who have been killed will be the ones protected by the city walls.  They are compared to meat in a pot because a pot protects meat from being burned in a fire. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
