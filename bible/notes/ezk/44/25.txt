\v 25 Priests are permitted to go near the corpse of a father or mother or son or daughter or brother or unmarried sister. But they must not defile themselves by going near a corpse of anyone else.
\v 26 If a priest touches the corpse of a close relative, he \add must perform the rituals to become acceptable to serve God again\add*. After he performs those rituals, he must wait seven days.
\v 27 Then, on the day that he enters the inner courtyard again to serve Yahweh in the temple, he must give an offering to remove his guilt for having sinned. That is what I, Yahweh the Lord, declare.
