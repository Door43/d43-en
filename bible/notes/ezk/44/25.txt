\v 25 Priests are permitted to go near the corpse of a father or mother or son or daughter or brother or unmarried sister. But they must not defile themselves by going near a corpse of anyone else.
\v 26 If a priest touches the corpse of a close relative, he \add must perform the rituals to become acceptable to serve God again\add*. After he performs those rituals, he must wait seven days.
\v 27 Then, on the day that he enters the inner courtyard again to serve Yahweh in the temple, he must give an offering to remove his guilt for having sinned. That is what I, Yahweh the Lord, declare.

\v 25 They will not go to a dead person so as to become unclean, unless it is their father or mother, son or daughter, brother or a sister who has not slept with a man; otherwise, they will become unclean.
\v 26 After a priest has become unclean, people will count seven days for him.
\v 27 Before the day he comes to the sanctuary, to the inner courtyard to serve in the sanctuary, he must bring a sin offering for himself.' This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration.
