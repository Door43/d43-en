====== Ezekiel 44:15-16 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 But most of the priests who are descended from Levi and from the clan of Zadok faithfully worked in my temple when the other Israelites deserted me. So they must come near to me to work for me. They must stand in my presence to offer sacrifices of animals' fat and blood.
\v 16 They are the only ones who are permitted to enter my temple. They are the only ones who are permitted to come near my altar to serve me and do what I tell them to do.

\v 15 And the Levitical priests, the sons of Zadok who fulfilled the duties of my sanctuary when the people of Israel were wandering away from following me—they will come near me to worship me and will stand before me to bring the fat and the blood to me—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration.
\v 16 They will come to my sanctuary; they will approach my table to worship me and to fulfill their duties to me.
