\v 6 Say this to the rebellious Israelite people: 'This is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say: You Israelite people, I will no longer endure the detestable things that you do!
\v 7 In addition to all the other detestable things that you do, you brought into my temple foreign men who had not been circumcised and who were godless [IDI]. By doing that, you caused my temple to be an unacceptable place to worship me, while you offered food and fat and blood, and you disobeyed my agreement with you.
