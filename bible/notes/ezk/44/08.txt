Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the house of Israel.
  * **You have not acted responsibly toward your obligations for me** - "You have not guarded what is holy to me"
  * **you gave others the duty to take care of my sanctuary** - It is implied that it is the foreigners that they have appointed. AT: "you appointed foreigners to guard my temple instead of yourselves." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
