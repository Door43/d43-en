  * **widow** - a woman whose husband has died
  * **from the line of the house of Israel** - "who is a descendant of the people of Israel" 
  * **the house of Israel** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years.
