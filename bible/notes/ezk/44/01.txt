\v 1 Then the man brought me back to the outer entrance to the temple area, the one on the east side, but the gate was shut.
\v 2 Yahweh said to me, "This gate must remain shut. It must not be opened by anyone; no one will be permitted to enter it. It must remain shut because I, Yahweh, the God of Israel, has \add caused it to be sacred by\add* entering through it.

\v 1 Then the man brought me back to the outer sanctuary gate that faced east; it was closed tightly.
\v 2 Yahweh said to me, "This gate has been sealed shut; it will not be opened. No man will go through it, for Yahweh, the God of Israel, has come through it, so it has been closed tightly.
\v 3 The ruler of Israel will sit in it to eat food before Yahweh. He will enter by way of the gate's portico and go out the same way."
