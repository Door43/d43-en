\v 1 Then the man brought me back to the outer sanctuary gate that faced east; it was closed tightly.
\v 2 Yahweh said to me, "This gate has been sealed shut; it will not be opened. No man will go through it, for Yahweh the God of Israel has come through it, so it has been closed tightly.
\v 3 The ruler of Israel will sit in it to eat food before Yahweh. He will enter by way of the gate's  portico and go out the same way."
