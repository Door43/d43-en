\v 13 Yhey will not come near me to act as my priests or to draw near to any of my holy things, to the most holy things! Instead, they will bear their reproach and their guilt for the disgusting actions that they have done.
\v 14 But I will place them as keepers of the work in the house, for all of its duties and everything that is done in it.
