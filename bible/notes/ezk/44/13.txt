====== Ezekiel 44:13-14 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 They must not come near me to serve as priests. They must not come near any sacred things or the holy offerings. They must be ashamed of the shameful things that they did.
\v 14 But I will still put them in charge of the work in the temple, and allow them to do all the work that needs to be done there.

\v 13 They must not come near me to serve as priests. They must not come near any sacred things or the holy offerings. They will be ashamed of the things that they did, of which they are guilty.
\v 14 But I will still put them in charge of the work in the temple, and allow them to do all the work that needs to be done there.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 They will not come near me to act as my priests or to approach any of my holy things, the most holy things. Instead, they will bear their reproach and their guilt for the disgusting actions that they have done.
\v 14 But I will place them as keepers of the work in the house, for all of its duties and everything that is done in it.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the house of Israel.

  * **They** - the Levites ([[:en:bible:notes:ezk:44:10|44:10]])
  * **They will not come near** - "I will not permit them to come near." Yahweh does not want them to come to him the way a servant comes to a king to receive commands, as the descendants of Zadok will do ([[:en:bible:notes:ezk:40:46|40:46]]).
  * **will bear their reproach and their guilt** - "will be ashamed and suffer when I punish them"
  * **disgusting actions** - "the disgusting things you do." God was angry because the people were worshiping idols and false gods. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:09|5:9]].
  * **keepers** - people who guard or take care of something
  * **that is done in it** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "that they need to do in it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
