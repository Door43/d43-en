\v 18 This parable is a warning to you people of Egypt. You think that there is no other nation that is as great and glorious as yours is.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh's parable about the cedar continues.

  * **they also went down with him to Sheol** - "Those trees of Lebanon also died and went down to Sheol with the cedar" 
  * **who had been killed by the sword** - AT: "whom enemies had killed with swords" or "who had died in battle" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] )
  * **These were his strong arm** - "These trees of Lebanon were its strong arm." The phrase "strong arm" means "power." AT: "These trees of Lebanon were the power of the cedar" or "These trees strengthened the cedar." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Which of these trees in Eden was your equal in glory and greatness?** - "Which of these trees in Eden had as much glory as you and was as great as you?" God asks Pharaoh this question to show him that the parable applies to him and his country. It can start with "So Pharaoh" or "So Egypt."   (See"  [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **For you will be brought down** - AT: "For I will bring you down"
  * **with the trees of Eden** - AT: "like the other trees of Eden"
  * **to the lowest parts of the earth** - "to a place deep in the ground"

  * **This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]].
