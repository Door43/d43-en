===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **they** - "Allies of Assyria".
  * **also went down with him to Sheol, to the ones slain by the sword** - "were destroyed along with Assyria".
  * **His** - "Egypt". The focus of this prophecy turns back to Egypt.  Egypt was one of Assyria's important allies near the time of Assyria's destruction.
  * **arms** - A king has an army to fight the nations battles and wars, and is the power of a king. This is a reference to this type of arms.
  * **To whom would you equal thus in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden?** - Egypt was the most powerful of Assyria's allies.
  * **you will be brought down with the trees of Eden to the lowest parts of the earth in the midst of the uncircumcised; you will dwell with those slain by the sword!** - This is a prophecy concerning the downfall of Egypt.
  * **This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration** - See how you translated this in 5:11.
