\v 17 The people represented by the trees that grew in the shade of that  huge tree, the allies of the great nation that the cedar tree represents, had also died and gone down to where the dead people are.

\v 18 This parable is a warning to you people of Egypt. You think that there is no other nation that is as great and glorious as yours is. But your nation will also be destroyed, along with those other nations. Your people will be there among the other people who are not fit to worship me, people who have been killed by their enemies' swords. That is what will happen to the king of Egypt and all his servants." This is what the Lord Yahweh has declared will happen.

\v 17 For they also went down with him to sheol, to the ones who had been killed by the sword! These were his strong arm, those nations who had lived in his shade.
\v 18 Which of the trees in Eden was your equal in glory and greatness? For you will be brought down with the trees of Eden to the lowest parts of the earth among the uncircumcised; you will live with those who were killed by the sword! This is Pharaoh and all of his servants!" This is the Lord Yahwehâ€™s declaration!

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh's parable about the cedar continues.

  * **they also went down with him to Sheol** - "Those trees of Lebanon also died and went down to Sheol with the cedar" 
  * **who had been killed by the sword** - AT: "whom enemies had killed with swords" or "who had died in battle" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] )
  * **These were his strong arm** - "These trees of Lebanon were its strong arm." The phrase "strong arm" means "power." AT: "These trees of Lebanon were the power of the cedar" or "These trees strengthened the cedar." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Which of these trees in Eden was your equal in glory and greatness?** - "Which of these trees in Eden had as much glory as you and was as great as you?" God asks Pharaoh this question to show him that the parable applies to him and his country. It can start with "So Pharaoh" or "So Egypt."   (See"  [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **For you will be brought down** - AT: "For I will bring you down"
  * **with the trees of Eden** - AT: "like the other trees of Eden"
  * **to the lowest parts of the earth** - "to a place deep in the ground"
  * **among the uncircumcised** - AT: "where you will be with people who are not circumcised"
  * **This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]].
