===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh's parable about the cedar continues.

  * **Cedars in the garden of God could not equal it** - Since these were God's words to Pharaoh, it can also be translated as "The cedar trees in my garden were not as great as that tree."
  * **the garden of God** - This is another way of referring to "the garden of Eden."
  * **None among the fir trees matched its branches** - Yahweh was comparing how many branches the trees had. Alternate translation: "None of the fir trees had as many branches as the cedar." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **fir trees** - Fir trees have have very many branches. Their leave are short green needles instead of flat broad leaves. They can grow very tall.
  * **and plane trees could not equal its boughs** - This could be translated as "and plane trees did not have branches like the cedar tree." It was implied Yahweh was comparing the long branches of the cedar tree with the long branches of plane trees. Alternate translation: "and none of the plane trees had branches as long as the branches of the cedar tree."
  * **plane trees** - Plane trees are large, leafy trees with strong branches. They are similar to sycamore trees. 
  * **could equal it in beauty** - "was as beautiful as the cedar tree"
  * **I made it beautiful with its many branches** - "I made the cedar beautiful by giving it many long branches." 
  * **envied it** - "were jealous of the cedar tree"
