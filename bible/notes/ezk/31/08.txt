\v 8 Cedars in the garden of God could not equal it. 
\q None among the cypress trees matched its branches, and plane tree could not equal its boughs. 
\q There was no other tree in the garden of God that was like it in its beauty.
\q
\v 9 I made it beautiful with its many branches
\q and all the trees of Eden that were in the garden of God envied it.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh's parable about the cedar continues.

  * **Cedars in the garden of God could not equal it** - Since these were God's words to Pharaoh, it can also be translated as "The cedar trees in my garden were not as great as that tree."
  * **the garden of God** - This is another way of referring to "the garden of Eden."
  * **None among the cypress trees matched its branches** - Yahweh was comparing how many branches the trees had. AT: "None of the cypress trees had as many branches as the cedar." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **cypress trees** - Cypress trees have very many branches. They can grow very tall.
  * **plane trees could not equal its boughs** - It was implied Yahweh was comparing the long branches of the cedar tree with the long branches of plane trees. AT: "plane trees did not have branches like the cedar tree." or "none of the plane trees had branches as long as the branches of the cedar tree."
  * **plane trees** - Plane trees are large, leafy trees with strong branches. They are similar to sycamore trees. 
  * **was like it in its beauty** - "was as beautiful as the cedar tree"
  * **I made it beautiful with its many branches** - "I made the cedar beautiful by giving it many long branches." 
  * **envied it** - "were jealous of the cedar tree"
