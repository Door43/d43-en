<usfm>
\v 5 Therefore its stature was exalted above all the trees of the field; and its boughs were multiplied, and its branches
became long by reason of many waters, when it shot them forth.
\v 6 All the birds of the heavens made their nests in its boughs; and under its branches did all the beasts of the field bring
forth their young; and under its shadow lived all great nations.
\v 7 Thus was it fair in its greatness, in the length of its branches; for its root was by many waters.
