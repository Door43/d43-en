===== Translation Notes: =====

The comparison of Assyria to a tree continues.

  * **higher than all the trees of the field** - This means this tree is above others.  Therefore, Assyria was higher than others in position, rank, or order. (See: Metaphor).
  * **Its boughs grew long because of many waters as they went forth** - "it grew strong because of all its resources".
  * **every bird of the heavens nested in its branches** - "many nations depended upon Assyria".
  * **every living thing of the field brings forth young under its foliage** - This possibly indicates that Assyria helped many nations to profit.
  * **many nations dwell under its shade** - "Assyria protected many nations"
  * **the length of its branches, for its roots were in many waters!** - "Assyria's influence extended very far!".
