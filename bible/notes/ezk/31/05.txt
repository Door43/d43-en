===== Translation Notes: =====

The parable about the cedar continues.

  * **Its great height was more than any of the other trees in the field** - "The cedar was taller than any of the other trees of the wild lands"
  * **its branches became very many** - "The cedar grew very many branches"
  * **its branches grew long because of many waters as they grew** - "the cedar grew very long branches because it had a lot of water"
  * **every bird of the heavens nested in its branches** - "All of the birds that fly in the sky made nests in the branches of the cedar"
  * **while every living thing of the field gave birth to its young under its foliage** - "and all of the creatures that live in the wild lands gave birth under the branches of the cedar"
  * **All of the many nations lived under its shade** - "all of the powerful nations in the shade of the cedar" or "all of the great nations live in the shade of that tree" (UDB)
  * **It was majestic and beautiful its branches spread out widely** – "The cedar was beautiful because it was very big and because its branches were very long"
  * **because the roots of the tree grew down into the ground where there was plentiful supply of water** – You can translate this as a new sentence: "The cedar grew this way because its roots grew to a place where there was a lot of water."
