<usfm>
\v 16 I caused the people of other nations to tremble when they heard that tree fall to the ground—when they heard that Assyria had been destroyed. All the other people groups had also been like beautiful, well-watered trees in Lebanon, but they were comforted when the king represented by that cedar tree arrived among them in the place where they were as dead people.

<usfm>
\v 16 I brought shuddering to the nations at the sound of his downfall, when I threw him down to sheol with those who went down into the pit! And I comforted all the trees of Eden in the lowest parts of the earth! These had been the choicest and best trees of Lebanon, the trees that drank the waters!

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh's parable about the cedar continues.

  * **when I threw him down to Sheol** - "When I threw that tree down to Sheol." This phrase means, "when I killed the cedar." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **with those who went down into the pit** - "with everyone else who had died and gone into the ground"
  * **in the lowest parts of the earth** - "that were already deep down in the ground". This phrase means "that had already died."
  * **The choicest and best trees of Lebanon, the trees that drink the waters** -  "the best trees of Lebanon that everyone would want, trees that got a lot of water." These are the trees of Eden that were in the lowest parts of the earth.
  * **the choicest** - "The choicest" is something that everyone would want because it is very good.
