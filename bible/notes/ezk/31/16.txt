<usfm>
\v 16 I caused the people of other nations to tremble when they heard that tree fall to the ground—when they heard that Assyria had been destroyed. All the other people groups had also been like beautiful, well-watered trees in Lebanon, but they were comforted when the king represented by that cedar tree arrived among them in the place where they were as dead people.

<usfm>
\v 16 I brought shuddering to the nations at the sound of his downfall, when I threw him down to sheol with those who went down into the pit! And I comforted all the trees of Eden in the lowest parts of the earth! These had been the choicest and best trees of Lebanon, the trees that drank the waters!
