\v 13 Birds settled\f + \ft Or: went to live \f* on the fallen tree, and wild animals lived among its branches.
\v 14 The result of what I have done is that no other trees, even if they have plenty of water, will ever grow very high and become proud, and lift their tops above the branches of other trees. I do not want any other tree to grow high like that cedar tree did; trees will all certainly die and decay in the ground, like people die and go down to their graves.

\q
\v 13 All the birds of the heavens rested on its trunk, 
\q and all the living beasts of the field sat on its branches.
\v 14 This happened so that none of the other watered trees would ever grow that tall, so that they would not raise their tree tops above the foliage, for no other tree that drank up water would never again grow that tall. For they were all handed over to death down to the lowest part of the earth, in the midst of the people of mankind who go down to the pit."

===== Translation Notes: =====

The comparison of Assyria to a tree continues.

  * **All the birds of the heavens dwelt upon its husk; And All the living beasts of the field were in its branches** - This may be a picture the nations like birds and animals surrounding a corpse.
  * **none of the watered trees would grow tall in height, and they would not set their tree tops within the foliage, for they would not stand before them in their heights. None who drank the waters!** - "No other nation would become as great as Assyria".
  * **For they were all given to death upon the lowest part of the earth, in the midst of the children of men who went down to the pit**  - "Nation will die as people die".
