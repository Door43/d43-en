<usfm>
\v 13 Birds settled\f + \ft Or: went to live \f* on the fallen tree, and wild animals lived among its branches.
\v 14 The result of what I have done is that no other trees, even if they have plenty of water, will ever grow very high and become proud, and lift their tops above the branches of other trees. I do not want any other tree to grow high like that cedar tree did; trees will all certainly die and decay in the ground, like people die and go down to their graves.

\v 13 Birds settled on the fallen tree, and wild animals lived among its branches. This is what other nations were like when they depended on Assyria.
\v 14 The result of what I have done is that no other treeâ€”no other nation, even if the tree has plenty of water, will ever grow very high and become proud, or lift its top above the branches of other trees. I do not want any other nation to become as strong as that nation did; nations will all certainly die and decay, as people die and go down to their graves."

\v 13 All the birds of the heavens rested on its trunk,

\v 14 This happened so that none of the other watered trees would ever grow that tall, so that they would not raise their tree tops above the foliage, for no other tree that drank up water would ever again grow that tall. For they were all handed over to death down to the lowest part of the earth, in the midst of the people of mankind who go down to the pit."

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh's parable about the cedar continues.

  * **All the birds of the heavens** - "All the birds that fly in the sky"
  * **rested on its trunk** - This can be translated as "lived on the remains of the cedar" or "lived on the dead wood from the cedar that was laying on the ground"
  * **trunk** - The trunk is a very thick part of the tree that comes out of the ground and holds up the rest of the tree. 
  * **the beasts of the field sat on its branches** - "the wild animals lived in the branches of the cedar"
  * **watered trees** - "trees that get a lot of water"
  * **would not raise their tree tops above the foliage** - Possible meanings are 1) "would not grow taller than the branches of other trees" or 2) "would not put their tops in the clouds."
  * **for no other tree that drank up water would ever again grow that tall** - "and no other trees that get a lot of water will ever grow that tall again"
  * **For they were all handed over to death** - "For I gave them all over to death" or "For I made it so that they all will die." Yahweh is speaking. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **down to the lowest part of the earth** -  "and I made it so that they all will go deep under the ground."  (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **in the midst of the people of mankind who go down the pit** - "to be with those people who have died and gone down to the grave"
