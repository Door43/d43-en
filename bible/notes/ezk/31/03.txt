\q
\v 3 Behold! Assyria was a cedar in Lebanon with beautiful branches, a forested canopy, and great height!
\q And its tree top was up above the branches.
\q
\v 4 Many waters made it tall; the deep waters made it huge. Rivers flowed all around its area,
\q for their channels stretched out to all the trees in the field.
