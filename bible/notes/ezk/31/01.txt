===== translationNotes: =====

  * **it came about** - This phrase is used here to mark the beginning of a new part of the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **in the eleventh year** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:26:01|26:1]].
  * **in the third month, on the first day of the month** - "on the first day of the third month." This is the third month of the Hebrew calendar. This first day is near the beginning of June on western calendars. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_hebrewmonths]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **the word of Yahweh came** - "Yahweh spoke his word." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:01:01|1:1]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Son of man** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01|2:3]].
  * **In your greatness, who are you like?** - "Who is as great as you are?" Yahweh uses this question to introduce a new topic. Pharaoh thought that his nation was the greatest, but God is about to talk about another great nation. AT: "You think that there is no country whose power is as great as the power of your country." (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
