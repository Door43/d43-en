===== Translation Notes: =====

These are Yahweh's words about Egypt.

  * **I will make the rivers into dry ground** - "I will  dry up the rivers of Egypt"
  * **I will sell the land into the hand of wicked men** - Yahweh will give the Babylonians control over Egypt just as a person who sells something gives the one who buys it control over that thing. Alternate translation: "I will give control of the land to wicked men." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will make the land and its fullness desolate by the hand of strangers** - "I will cause people from another nation to destroy the land and everything in it"
  * **its fullness** - "everything in the land"
