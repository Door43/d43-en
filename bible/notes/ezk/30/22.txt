  * **I will make the sword fall from his hand** - "I will knock the sword out of the Pharaoh's hand"
  * **Then I will scatter Egypt among the nations and disperse them among the lands** - This says the same thing in two different ways to emphasize that Yahweh will punish the Egyptians very badly. Alternate translation: "Then I will certainly make the Egyptians leave Egypt and go to other countries." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]]) 
  * **lands** - "countries"
  * **I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon** - "I will make the arms of the king of Babylon strong"
  * **He will groan before the king of Babylon** - When the king of Babylon comes to attack Egypt, Pharaoh will groan.
  * **groan** - A groan is a loud noise that people make when they have a lot of pain or are dying.
  * **with the groans of a dying man** - "as a man who is dying groans" or "like a man who is dying"
