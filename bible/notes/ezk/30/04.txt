===== Translation Notes: =====

These are Yahweh's words about Egypt.

  * **Then a sword will come against Egypt** - The word "sword" here refers to war or an attack. Alternate translations: "There will be war against Egypt" or "An enemy army will attack Egypt." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **there will be anguish in Cush** - "Cush will be very sad" or "the people of Cush will be full of grief"
  * **when the killed people fall in Egypt** - "when many people in Egypt are killed" or "when many people in Egypt die  in the war."
  * **when they take her wealth** - "The attackers will take away the wealth of Egypt"
  * **when her foundations are ruined** - "The attackers will even ruin the foundations of the buildings in Egypt" 
  * **Libya** - Libya is a country west of Egypt. Ezekiel called this region Put. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Lydia** - This probably refers to the kingdom of Lydia which was in what is now Turkey. Ezekiel called this region Lud. 
  * **the people belonging to the covenant** - Possible meanings are 1) "the Jews who live in Egypt" or  2) "the other people in the lands of Egypt's allies."  It is unclear whether "the covenant" refers to the agreement that Yahweh made with the Israelites or to an agreement that Egypt made with other people groups.
  * **will all fall by the sword** - "will all die in battle" or "will all die in the war." This does not mean that every single person will die, but that many people from all of these countries will die.
