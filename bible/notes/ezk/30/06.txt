  * **in the midst of** - "among" or "surrounded by"
  * **their cities will be among all the ruined cities** - Being "among" the ruined cities represents being ruined like the ruined cities of other countries. AT: "their cities will be ruined like the cities of other countries" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
