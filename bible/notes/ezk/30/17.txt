===== Translation Notes: =====

These are Yahweh's words about Egypt.

  * **Heliopolis and Bubastis** - These were cities in northern Egypt. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]) 
  * **will fall by the sword** - The word "sword" is used here to refer to a battle or war. Alternate translation: "will die in battle" or "will die in the war." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **their cities will go into captivity** - "the people of their cities will become captives" or "the people will be taken away as prisoners."
  * **Tahpanhes** - This was an important city in northern Egypt.
  * **the day will hold back its light** - "the day will be dark." This implies that it will be a very scary time. Alternate translations: "It will be as if there is no light that day" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **when I break the yoke of Egypt there** - The word "yoke" here refers to Egypt's power to oppress people. Alternate translation: "when I stop Egypt from oppressing people" or "when I end Egypt's power to cruelly control other nations." 
  * **the pride of her strength will be finished** - "Egypt will not be proud of being strong anymore" or "that country will no longer be proud of being strong" (UDB)
  * **There will be a cloud covering her** - "A cloud will be over Egypt" or "It will be as if there is a cloud over Egypt." Possible meanings are 1) the dark cloud represents how sad the people of Egypt will feel, or 2) there will be a cloud of dust over Egypt from everything that is destroyed.  
  * **her daughters** - Possible meanings are 1) the people of the Egyptian towns or 2) the daughters of the Egyptian people
  * **I will execute acts of judgment in Egypt** - "I will punish Egypt in many ways"
  * **so they** - "so the Egyptians"
  * **will know that I am Yahweh** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:06:06|6:7]].
