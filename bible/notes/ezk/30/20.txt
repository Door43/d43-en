\v 20 Almost eleven years after the Babylonians took us Israelites to their country, Yahweh gave me another message on the seventh day of the first month of that year. He said,
\v 21 "Son of man, I have enabled the army of Nebuchadnezzar to defeat the army of the king of Egypt. It is as though I have broken one of the arms of the king of Egypt, and it has not been bandaged in order that it could be healed, and it has not been put in splints in order that after it heals the arm will be strong enough to hold a sword.

\v 20 Then it came about in the eleventh year, in the first month, in the seventh day of the month, that the word of Yahweh came to me and said,
\v 21 “Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. Behold! It is not bound up and able to receive medicine; no one can put a bandage on it, so it will not be strong enough to grasp a sword."
