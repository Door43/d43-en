\v 8 Then, when I cause everything in Egypt to be burn down,
\q2 and when I cause their enemies to defeat all their allies,
\q2 people will know that I, Yahweh, have the power to do what I say that I will do.
\p
\v 9 At that time, I will send messengers to go swiftly up the Nile River in boats to terrify the people of Cush, who still think they are safe. They will be horrified when they hear that Egypt has been destroyed. This will soon happen!
