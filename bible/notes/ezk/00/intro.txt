=== What is Ezekiel about? ===

This book contains prophecies that were given between 592 BC and 573 BC. Ezekiel tells the Jewish people in exile in Babylonia that God has punished them for their sin and unfaithfulness to him, but that he will restore Judah. God is using Babylon to punish them, but the enemy nations will be crushed in their turn. There is prophecy about the restoration and renewal of worship, the sacrificial system, and the new temple. The book of Ezekiel ends with the reallocation of the Israel's land among all the tribes of Israel. Ezekiel concludes with the overarching principle that “Yahweh is there." 

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

"Ezekiel" may also be called the "The Messages from God brought by Ezekiel." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). 

=== Who wrote the Book of Ezekiel? ===

The prophecies in the Book of Ezekiel came through Ezekiel, a prophet who lived near Babylon in the time of the exile. 

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== What was Ezekiel's temple? ===

A large portion of the Book of Ezekiel gives instructions regarding the building of a new temple. However, this temple is not the same as the temple the people would build after going back to Jerusalem. Because Ezekiel's temple has never been built, some people believe that this temple is to be built in the future. Others believe that Ezekiel's temple is symbolic of the Church.

=== Do the sacrifices in Ezekiel follow the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|law of moses]]? ===

If one was to compare some of the required sacrifices in Numbers 28 with the sacrifices in Ezekiel 46, there are some differences. These differences probably exist because Ezekiel prophesies about a new temple with a new sacrificial system.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

===How do one translate Ezekiel's visions?===

The book of Ezekiel has many dazzling visions and stunning images. His visions are complicated and became the foundation for many apocalyptic books of Scripture. His visions should be translated as they appear in the text, with attempts to explain them.

Also, there are events recorded where it is unclear if Ezekiel has traveled to particular places, or that he simply has a mental idea of the places he is describing. The meaning of the visions may be clear, but the prophet's viewpoint may be difficult to understand. Even so, his messages are about Israel's rescue in the far distant future.

=== What does "and you will know that I am the Lord" mean? ===

This is a common phrase that in the Book of Ezekiel. It is meant to assure the reader that these messages truly come from God, and that he will do what he has promised. The translator may also use the phrase "and you will understand that I am God and what I say will happen."
