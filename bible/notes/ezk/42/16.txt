\f + \ft Instead of  \fqa five hundred cubits \fqa* , which some ancient and most modern versions read, Hebrew reads \fqa five hundred measuring sticks \fqa* , which seems to be an error. \f*
\v 17 He measured the north side—five hundred cubits with the measuring stick.
\f + \ft Instead of  \fqa five hundred cubits \fqa* , which some ancient and most modern versions read, Hebrew reads \fqa five hundred measuring sticks \fqa* , which seems to be an error. \f*
\v 18 He also measured the south side—five hundred cubits with the measuring stick.
