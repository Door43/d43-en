\v 13 Then the man said to me, "These rooms that overlook the temple on the north and south sides are holy. Here the priests who offer sacrifices to Yahweh will eat \add their portions of\add* the sacred offerings. Because these rooms are holy, they will be used to store the sacred offerings: The grain for the grain offerings, the offerings for the sins that people ave committed, and offerings in order that people will no longer be guilty for having sinned.
\v 14 When the priests leave the temple, they will not be allowed to \add immediately\add* enter the outer courtyard. First, they must remove the clothes that they hadbeen wearing inside the temple, because those clothes are holy. They must put on other clothes before they enter the parts of the temple area where the other people gather."

\v 13 Then said he to me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they are the holy
chambers, where the priests that are near to Jehovah shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy
things, and the grain offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering; for the place is holy.
\v 14 When the priests enter in, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the outer court, but there they shall lay
their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy: and they shall put on other garments, and shall approach to that which
pertaineth to the people.
