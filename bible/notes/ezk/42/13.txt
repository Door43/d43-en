\v 13 Then the man said to me, "These rooms that overlook the temple on the north and south sides are holy. Here the priests who offer sacrifices to Yahweh will eat \add their portions of\add* the sacred offerings. Because these rooms are holy, they will be used to store the sacred offerings: The grain for the grain offerings, the offerings for the sins that people ave committed, and offerings in order that people will no longer be guilty for having sinned.
\v 14 When the priests leave the temple, they will not be allowed to \add immediately\add* enter the outer courtyard. First, they must remove the clothes that they hadbeen wearing inside the temple, because those clothes are holy. They must put on other clothes before they enter the parts of the temple area where the other people gather."

\v 13 Then the man said to me, "The rooms on the northern and southern sides that overlook the temple sanctuary are only for Yahweh's special purposes. Here the priests who offer sacrifices to Yahweh will eat their portions of those offerings. Because these rooms are special, they will be used to store the offerings for Yahweh: The flour for the flour offerings, for the offerings for the sins that people have committed, and for the offerings that people make for their sins.
\v 14 When the priests leave the temple, they will not be allowed to immediately enter the outer courtyard. First they must remove the clothes that they had been wearing inside the holy place, because those clothes are special, reserved for their work. They must put on other clothes before they enter the parts of the temple area where the other people gather."

\v 13 Then the man said to me, “The northern rooms and the southern rooms that are in front of the outer courtyard are holy rooms where the priests who work nearest to Yahweh may eat the most holy food. They will put the most holy things there—the food offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering—for this is a holy place.
\v 14 When the priests enter there, they must not go out of the holy place to the outer court, without laying aside the clothes in which they served, since these are holy. So they must dress in other clothes before going near the people.”
