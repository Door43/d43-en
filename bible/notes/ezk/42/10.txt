\v 10 In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, before the separate place, and before the building, there were
chambers.
\v 11 And the way before them was like the appearance of the way of
the chambers which were toward the north; according to their length so was their breadth: and all their egresses were
both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.
\v 12 And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door at the head of the way, even the way
directly before the wall toward the east, as one enters into them.
