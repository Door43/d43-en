\v 10  In the width of the wall of the court on the eastern way, in front of the forecourt and the front of the building were halls.
\v 11 And the way in front of them corresponded to the halls of the northern way in length and also in width. So all the exits were like this in measure and in their doorways.
\v 12 They were like the doors of the hall that was on the southern way, the doors at the head of the pathway in front of the corresponding walls of the eastern path as one enters.
