\v 10 On the south side, along the wall of the outer courtyard, next to the temple courtyard, was a set of rooms,
\v 11 with a walkway in front of them. Those rooms were like the rooms on the north side: They were the same length and width, and had the same kind of entrances.
\v 12 The doorways on the south side were similar to the doorways on the north side. There was an entrance in the wall that faced the doors of the set of rooms, and there was an entrance on the east side, at the end of the inside walkway.
