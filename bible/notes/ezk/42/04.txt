====== Ezekiel 42:4-6 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 Between the two sets of rooms there was a walkway that was 17-1\f + \ft Or: 2 ft., Or: 5.3 meters \f* wide and175 ft.\f + \ft Or: 53 meters \f* long. All its doors were on the north side.
\v 5 Each of the upper set of rooms was narrower than the set of rooms below them, \add because the upper sets needed to have a walkway in front of them\add*.
\v 6 The rooms on the upper levels had no pillars to support them like there were in the courtyard, because those rooms were supported by the walls of the rooms on the first and second levels.

===== UDB: =====

\v 4 To one side of the rooms was a walkway that was five and two-fifths meters wide and fifty-four meters long. All the doors of the rooms were on their north side.
\v 5 Each set of rooms was narrower than the set of rooms below them, because each upper sets had a walkway in front .
\v 6 The rooms on the upper levels had no pillars to support them as there were in the courtyard, because those rooms were supported by the walls of the rooms below.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 A passage ten cubits in width and one hundred cubits in length ran in front of the rooms. The rooms' doors were toward the north.
\f + \ft Some ancient versions and many modern versions read \fqa one hundred cubits \fqa* . Ancient Hebrew copies and some modern versions read read \fqa one cubit \fqa* . \f*
\v 5 But the upper halls were smaller, for the walkways took away from them more space than they did in the lowest and middle levels of the building.
\v 6 For the halls on the third story had no columns, unlike the courtyards, which did have columns. So the highest level's rooms were  smaller in size compared to the rooms in the lowest and middle levels.
