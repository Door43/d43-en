===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 And to the front of the halls was a passage ten cubits wide going inward. The way was one cubit and its doors were towards the north.
\v 5 But the upper halls were smaller, for the galleries took away from them more than the lower and the middle levels of the building.
\v 6 For they were in three stories, and there was no pillars like the pillars of the courts for them; therefore the upper levels were reduced in size compared to the lower and middle levels from the ground.
