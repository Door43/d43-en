<usfm>
\v 4 And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits’ breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors were toward the
north.
\v 5 Now the upper chambers were shorter; for the galleries took away from these, more than from the lower and the middlemost,
in the building.
\v 6 For they were in three stories, and they had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore
the uppermost was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.
