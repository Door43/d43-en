===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 A passage ten cubits wide and one hundred cubits long ran in front of the rooms. The rooms' doors were towards the north.
\v 5 But the upper halls were smaller, for the walkways took away from them space more than the lower and the middle levels of the building.
\v 6 For they were in three stories, and there were no columns, unlike the courtyards, which had columns. So the upper levels were reduced in size compared to the lower and middle levels.
