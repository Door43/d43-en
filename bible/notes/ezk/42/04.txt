\v 4 Between the two sets of rooms there was a walkway that was 17-1\f + \ft Or: 2 ft., Or: 5.3 meters \f* wide and175 ft.\f + \ft Or: 53 meters \f* long. All its doors were on the north side.
\v 5 Each of the upper set of rooms was narrower than the set of rooms below them, \add because the upper sets needed to have a walkway in front of them\add*.
\v 6 The rooms on the upper levels had no pillars to support them like there were in the courtyard, because those rooms were supported by the walls of the rooms on the first and second levels.

\v 5 Each set of rooms was narrower than the set of rooms below them, because each upper sets had a walkway in front .
\v 6 The rooms on the upper levels had no pillars to support them as there were in the courtyard, because those rooms were supported by the walls of the rooms below.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 A passage ten cubits wide and one hundred cubits long ran in front of the rooms. The rooms' doors were towards the north.
\v 5 But the upper halls were smaller, for the walkways took away from them space more than the lower and the middle levels of the building.
\v 6 For they were in three stories, and there were no columns, unlike the courtyards, which had columns. So the upper levels were reduced in size compared to the lower and middle levels.
