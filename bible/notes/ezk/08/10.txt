\v 10 So I went in and looked, and behold! There was every form of creeping thing and detestable beast! Every idol of the house of Israel was carved into the wall all around.
\v 11 Seventy elders of the house of Israel were there, and Jaazaniah, the son of Shaphan, was standing in their midst.
They were standing in front of the images, and each man had his censer in his hand so that the smell of the cloud of incense went up.
