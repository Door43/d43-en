\v 10 So I went in and looked, and behold! There was every form of creeping thing and detestable beast! Every idol of the house of Israel was carved into the wall all around.
\v 11 Seventy elders of the house of Israel were there, and Jaazaniah son of Shaphan was standing in their midst. They were standing in front of the images, and each man had his censer in his hand so that the smell of the cloud of incense went up.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **behold** - This word shows that Ezekiel was surprised by what he saw. Your language may have a different word to show this. 
  * **every form of creeping thing and detestable beast** - "carvings in the wall of all kinds of creeping animals and detestable beasts." The phrase "creeping thing" refer to insects and other small animals.

See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:01|3:1]]. AT: "the Israelites" or "the Israelite people group" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the wall all around** - You may need to make explicit which wall. AT: "the wall all around the temple" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Jaazaniah ... Shaphan** - men's names (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
