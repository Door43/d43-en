In the middle of the winter when the days start to get longer the people of Babylon believed Tammuz had come back to life. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:translatenames|How to Translate Names]])
  * **Do you see this, Son of man**  - God uses the word "see" in this question to refer to Ezekiel's understanding.  The question is asked to show show God's disgust and assumes Ezekiel would be disgusted as well. (See: [[en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion]])
