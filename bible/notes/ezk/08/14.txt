===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the entrance of the gate of Yahweh's house that was on the north side** - This was the outer north gate—not the same one as in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:08:03|8:3]]. See the UDB.
  * **behold**  - The word "behold" here shows that Ezekiel was surprised by what he saw.
  * **mourning for Tammuz**  - "grieving because the false god Tammuz had died.  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
