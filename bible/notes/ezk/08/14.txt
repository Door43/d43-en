===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the entrance of the gate of Yahweh's house that was on the north side** - This was the outer north gate—not the same one as in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:08:03|8:3]].
  * **behold!** - This word shows that Ezekiel was surprised by what he saw.
  * **mourning for Tammuz** - grieving because the false god Tammuz had died (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Do you see this ... man?** - Yahweh is commanding Ezekiel to think about what he has just seen. AT: "Think about this ... man." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
