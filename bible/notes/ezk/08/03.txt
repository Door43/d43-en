\v 3 And he reached out the form of a hand and took me by the hair of my head; the Spirit lifted me up between earth and
heaven, and brought me in visions from God to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the inner Northern Gate, where was standing the idol that provokes great jealousy.
\v 4 And the glory of the God of Israel, whose appearance was the same as I had seen in the plain, was there.
