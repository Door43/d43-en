\v 3 He reached out what seemed to be a hand and grabbed me by the hair of my head. The Spirit lifted me up high above the earth, and in visions God took me \add from Babylon\add* to Jerusalem. He took me \add to the temple\add* to the north gate, to the place where there was an idol that caused Yahweh to be very disgusted and furious.
\v 4 And there in front of me was the brilliant light that indicated the presence of the God whom the Israelite people \add previously worshiped\add*. It was like the vision that I had seen alongside the Kebar River\f + \ft Or: Canal \f*.

\v 3 He reached out what seemed to be a hand and grabbed me by the hair of my head. The Spirit lifted me up high above the earth, and in visions God took me from Babylon to Jerusalem. He took me to the temple, to the inner north gate, to the place where there was an idol that caused Yahweh to be very disgusted and furious.
\v 4 And there in front of me was the very bright light of God himself whom the Israelite people previously worshiped. It was like the vision that I had seen in the plain.

\v 3 And he reached out the form of a hand and took me by the hair of my head; the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, and in visions from God, he brought me to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the inner Northern Gate, where the idol that provokes great jealousy was standing.
\v 4 And the glory of the God of Israel, whose appearance was the same as I had seen in the plain, was there.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Ezekiel continues telling about the vision from God.

  * **between earth and heaven** - "between the ground and sky"
  * **in visions from God, he brought me to Jerusalem** - The words "in visions" mean that this experience is happening in Ezekiel's thoughts.  He would still be in his home while God shows him these things.
  * **the inner Northern Gate** - "the inner Northern Gate of the temple" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * ** the idol that provokes great jealousy** - "the idol that causes great jealousy" or "the idol that causes God to be jealous"
  * **whose appearance was the same as I had seen in the plain** - "who looked the same as the one I had seen in the plain"  
  * **the plain** - a large area of flat land that has few trees.
