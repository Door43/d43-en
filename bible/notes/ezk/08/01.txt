\v 1 And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth
day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord Jehovah fell

\v 2 Then I beheld, and, lo, a likeness as the appearance of fire; from the appearance of his loins and downward, fire; and
from his loins and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as it were glowing metal.
