\v 1 On the fifth day of the sixth month, almost six years after the Babylonians had taken us Israelites to their land, I was sitting with the leaders of Judah in my house when I felt the presence of Yahweh the Lord come on me again.
\v 2 Then in a vision I saw someone who resembled a man, but below his waist his body was like fire and above his waist his body was glowing like very hot metal.

\v 1 So it came about in the sixth year and the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord Yahweh again fell on me there.
\v 2 So I looked, and behold, there was a figure like a man, with what looked like fire from his hips downward! And from his hips upward there was a shining appearance like glowing metal!

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Ezekiel tells about another vision he saw.

  * **So it came about** - This phrase is used here to mark the beginning of a new part of the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **in the sixth year** - AT: "in the sixth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month** - "the fifth day of the sixth month." This is the sixth month of the Hebrew calendar. The fifth day is near the beginning of September on Western calendars. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_hebrewmonths]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **the hand of the Lord Yahweh again fell on me** - This should be translated literally, as Ezekiel later sees something like a hand. Others may choose to consider the hand a metaphor for Yahweh's presence or power. (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **fell on** - "took hold of"
  * **glowing metal** - When metal is very hot, it glows with a yellow or orange light.
