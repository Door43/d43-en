\v 1 So it came about  in the sixth year and the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord Yahweh again fell on me there.
\v 2 So I looked, and behold, there was a figure like a man, with what looked like fire from his hips downward! And from his hips upward there was a shining appearance like glowing metal!
