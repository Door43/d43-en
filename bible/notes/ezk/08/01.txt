\v 1 So it came about  in the sixth year and the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord Yahweh again fell on me there.
\v 2 So I looked, and behold, there was a figure like a man, with what looked like fire from his hips downward! And from his hips upward there was a shining appearance like glowing metal!

===== Translation Notes: =====

Ezekiel tells about another vision he saw.

  * **So it came about**  -  This phrase is used here to mark the beginning of a new part of the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **the hand of the Lord Yahweh again fell on me**  - The word "hand" is often used to refer to power or actions. AT: "the power of Yahweh began to control me." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **glowing metal**  - When metal is very hot, it glows with a yellow or orange light.
