\v 12 God said to me, "Son of man, look at what the Israelite elders are doing here in the darkness, each of them standing in his rooms with the carved images, worshiping his own idols! They are saying, 'Yahweh does not see us; Yahweh has deserted this country.'"

\v 12 He said to me, "Son of man, do you see what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the dark? Each one does this in the hidden chamber of his idol, for they say, 'Yahweh does not see us! Yahweh has forsaken the land.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **do you see what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the dark?** - God is commanding Ezekiel to look at what the elders are doing. AT: "look at what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the dark." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the house of Israel** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:01|3:1]]. AT: "the Israelites" or "the Israelite people group" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the hidden chamber of his idol** - "the room where no one can see him worship his idol" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
