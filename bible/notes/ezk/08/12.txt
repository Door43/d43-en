\v 12 Then he said to me, "Son of man, do you see what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the dark? Every man does this in his
hidden chambers with his idols, for they say, 'Yahweh does not see us! Yahweh has forsaken the land!'"
\v 13 And he said to me, "Turn again and see the other great abominations that they are doing."
