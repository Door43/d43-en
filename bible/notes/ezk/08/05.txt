\v 5 Yahweh said to me, "You human, look toward the north!" So I looked, and I saw in the entrance of the gate near the altar that idol that caused Yahweh to be disgusted and furious.
\p
\v 6 He said to me, "You human, do you see what the Israelite people \f + \ft metonymy \f* are doing? They are doing detestable things here, things that will cause me to abandon my temple. But you will see things that are even more detestable."

\v 5 Then he said to me, "Son of man, lift up your eyes to the north." So I lifted up my eyes to the north, and to the north of the gate leading to the altar, there in the entrance, was the idol of jealousy.
\v 6 So he said to me, "Son of man, do you see what they are doing? These are great abominations that the house of Israel is doing here to make me go far from my own sanctuary. But you will turn and see even greater abominations."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The "figure like a man" ([[:en:bible:notes:ezk:08:01|8:2]]) speaks to Ezekiel.

  * **Son of man** - "Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01|2:1]]. AT: "Mortal person" or "Human" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **lift up your eyes ... lifted up my eyes** - This idiom means that he should look towards something. AT: "look up ... looked up" or "turn your head and look ... turned my head and looked" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **gate leading to the altar** - "gate through which people would walk so they could go to the altar"
  * **do you see what they are doing?** - God uses this question to bring Ezekiel's attention to what the people were doing. AT: "I want you to understand why I hate what the people here are doing." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the house of Israel** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:01|3:1]]. AT: "the Israelites" or "the Israelite people group" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
