\v 22 Then on the second day you will offer a male goat without blemish from the goats as a sin offering; the priests will cleanse the altar just as they cleansed it with the bull.
\v 23 When you finish its cleansing, offer an unblemished bull from the cattle and an unblemished ram from the flock.
\v 24 Offer them before Yahweh; the priests will throw salt onto them and raise them up as a burnt offering to Yahweh.
