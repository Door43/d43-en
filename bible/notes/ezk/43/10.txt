\v 10 Son of man, you yourself must tell the house of Israel about this house so they will be ashamed of their iniquities. They should think about this description.
\v 11 For if they are ashamed of all that they have done, then reveal to them the design of the house, its details, its exits, its entrances, and all its details, all its decrees and rules. Then write this down before their eyes so they will keep to all its design and all its rules, so as to obey them.
