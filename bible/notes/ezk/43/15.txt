===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The hearth** - the place where sacrifices were either cooked or burnt up with fire
  * **four cubits ... twelve cubits ... fourteen cubits ... a half cubit ... a cubit** - Each "long cubit" was about 54 centimeters. You may choose not to include this information if you give modern measurements instead of "cubits" as the UDB does. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:40:05|40:5]]. AT: "about 2.2 meters ... about 6.5 meters ... about 7.6 meters ... about 27 centimeters ... about 54 centimeters" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bdistance]])
  * **horns** - The horns were the parts of the altar at the four corners of the altar that stuck up above the rest of the altar.
  * **with its steps facing east** - "with steps on the east side of the altar" or "and the altar's steps are on its east side"
