====== Ezekiel 43:3-5 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 What I saw in this vision was like what I saw in the visions that I had seen previously, first by the Kebar River and later when God came to destroy Jerusalem. I prostrated myself on the ground.
\v 4 The glory of Yahweh entered the temple through the east entrance.
\v 5 Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner courtyard, and the glory of Yahweh filled the temple.

\v 3 And it was like the vision that I saw when he had come to destroy the city, and like the vision that I saw at the Chebar Canal—and I fell to my face.
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa when he came \fqa* , which some Hebrew copies and some ancient and many modern versions read, Hebrew reads \fqa when I came \fqa* . \f*
\v 4 So the glory of Yahweh came to the house by way of the gate that opened to the east.
\v 5 Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court. Behold! The glory of Yahweh was filling the house.
