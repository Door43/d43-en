\v 3 What I saw in this vision was like what I saw in the visions that I had seen previously, first by the Kebar River and later when God came to destroy Jerusalem. I prostrated myself on the ground.
\v 4 The glory of Yahweh entered the temple through the east entrance.
\v 5 Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner courtyard, and the glory of Yahweh filled the temple.
