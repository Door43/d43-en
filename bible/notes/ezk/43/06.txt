\v 6 Then while the man was standing beside me, I heard someone speak to me from inside the temple.
\v 7 He said, "You human, this is my temple, the place where \add I sit on\add* my throne and where I rest my feet. This is where I will live with the Israelite people forever. The Israelite people and their kings will never again disgrace me \f + \ft synecdoche \f* by worshiping other gods \f + \ft metaphor \f* at the shrines on their hilltops, or by building monuments to honor their kings who have died.
\v 8 They placed their altars near mine, and the doorposts of their temples were next to the doorposts of my temple. There was only a wall between them. And they disgraced me by the detestable things that they did. So, being very angry with them, I got rid of them.

\v 6 Then I heard one speaking to me from the house, and there was a man standing beside me.
\v 7 He said to me, “Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place for the soles of my feet where I will dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel forever, and the house of Israel will no longer profane my holy name—they or their kings with their promiscuity and with the corpses of their kings in their high places;
\v 8 with the setting of their thresholds with my thresholds, and their gateposts beside my gateposts. For there was a wall between me and them yet they profaned my holy name with their abominations that they did so that I consumed them with my anger.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Then I heard one speaking to me from the house, and there was a man standing beside ****me**  - There are two separate persons in this verse: there is one person who is inside the house (the temple) and who is speaking. There is also the man standing beside Ezekiel; this is the same man mentioned in 40:3

  * **midst**  - "among" or "in the middle of"
  * **profane**  - to treat a holy or sacred thing or place with disrepect

  * **a wall between me and them**  - This phrase means that there was a barrier or separation between God and the Israelites (See: [[:en:ta:translate:idiom]])
