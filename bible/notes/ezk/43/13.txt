\v 13 These will be the measurements of the altar in cubits—each cubit being a cubit and a span. So the groove of the altar will be a cubit, and the width will be a cubit. And its border around its surrounding edge will be one handspan. This will be the base of the altar.
\v 14 From the groove of the earth to the lower edging – two cubits, and one cubit wide. Then from the smaller edging to the greater edging – four cubits, and a cubit wide.
