\v 13 These are the measurements of the altar, using the same kind of measuring stick that was used for the temple area: There is a gutter around the altar that is about one half meter deep and one half meter wide. There is a rim around it that is about eight centimeters wide. This will compose the base for the rest of the altar.
\v 14 The lower part of the gutter is about one meter high to the lower ledge that surrounds the altar. The lower ledge is about one half meter wide. From that ledge to the upper ledge, it is about 2.1 meters. That ledge is also one half meter wide.

\v 13 These will be the measurements of the altar in long cubits—each long cubit being a regular cubit and a span long. So the gutter around the altar will be a cubit deep, and its width will also be a cubit. And the border around its surrounding edge will be one span. This will be the base of the altar.
\v 14 From the gutter at the ground level up to the lower ledge of the altar is two cubits, and that ledge itself is one cubit wide. Then from the small ledge up to the large edge of the altar, it is four cubits, and the large edge is a cubit wide.
