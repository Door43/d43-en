\v 18 Next he said to me, “Son of man, thus says the Lord Yahweh: These are the regulations for the altar on the day they make it, for raising the burnt offering onto it, and for sprinkling blood on it.
\v 19 You will give a bull from the cattle as a sin offering for the Levitical priests who are the descendants of Zadok, those who come near to me to serve me." This is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.
