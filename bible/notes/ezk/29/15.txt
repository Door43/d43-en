===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 It will be the least important of all the nations; it will never again be greater than the nearby countries. I will cause Egypy to be very weak, with the result that they will never again rule over other nations.
\v 16 When that happens, \add the leaders of\add* Israel will no longer be tempted to ask Egypt to help them. Egypt wIll be punished, and that will cause the Israelite people to not forget that they previously sinned by trusting that Egypt could help them. And the people of Israel will know that I, Yahweh the Lord, \add have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*."

\v 15 It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it any more lift itself up above the nations: and I will diminish
them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.
\v 16 And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing iniquity to remembrance, when they turn to look
after them: and they shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.
