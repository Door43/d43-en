\v 15 It will be the least important of all the nations; it will never again be greater than the nearby countries. Yahweh says that he will cause Egypt to be very weak, and that they will never again rule over other nations.
\v 16 When that happens, the leaders of Israel will no longer think of asking Egypt to help them. When Yahweh punishes Egypt, the Israelites will be reminded that they previously sinned by trusting that Egypt could help them. And the people of Israel will know that Yahweh the Lord has the power to do what he says he will do."

\v 15 It will be the lowliest of the kingdoms, and it will not be lifted up any more among the nations. I will diminish them so they will no longer rule over nations.
\v 16 The Egyptians will no longer be a reason for confidence for the house of Israel. Instead, they will be a reminder of the iniquity that Israel committed when they turned to Egypt for help. Then they will know that I am the Lord Yahweh!’”
