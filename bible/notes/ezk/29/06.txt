\v 6 Then all the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am Yahweh,
\q because they have been a reed stalk to the house of Israel.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Pharaoh.

  * **they have been a reed stalk** - Yahweh compares the people of Egypt and Pharaoh with a reed stalk because the people of Israel relied on the Egyptians to help them in war, but the Egyptians were not strong enough to help them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **reed** - a plant that grows near water and looks like very large grass
  * **stalk** - the part of a reed that is long and like a thick stick. People can use them like sticks, but the stalks of reeds are not as strong as wood and can break suddenly.
  * **took hold of you** - The word "you" refers to Pharaoh.
  * **you shattered their legs and made their hip to shake** - "you injured their entire hip"
