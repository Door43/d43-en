\v 6 Then all the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am Yahweh,
\q because they have been a reed stalk to the house of Israel!
\q
\v 7 When they took hold of you in their hand, you broke into splinters and pierced their shoulder;
\q when they leaned on you, you shattered their legs and made their hip to shake.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Pharaoh.
*  
  * **they have been a reed stalk** - Yahweh compares the people of Egypt and Pharaoh with a reed stalk because the people of Israel relied on the Egyptians to help them in war, but the Egyptians were not strong enough to help them. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **reed** - a plant that grows near water and looks like very large grass
  * **stalk** - the part of a reed that that is long and like a thick stick. People can use them like sticks, but the stalks of reeds are not as strong as wood and can break suddenly.
  * **took hold of you** - The word "you" refers to Pharaoh.
  * **you shattered their legs and made their hip to shake** - "you injured their entire hip"
