Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Pharaoh.
  * **will know that I am Yahweh**  - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:06:06|6:7]].
  * **they have been a reed stalk** - Yahweh compares the people of Egypt and Pharaoh with a reed stalk because the people of Israel relied on the Egyptians to help them in war, but the Egyptians were not strong enough to help them. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **reed** - a plant that grows near water and looks like very large grass
  * **stalk** - the part of a reed that that is long and like a thick stick. People can use them like sticks, but the stalks of reeds are not as strong as wood and can break suddenly.
  * **the house of Israel** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:01|3:1]].
  * **When they** - "When the house of Israel"
  * **took hold of you** - The word "you" refers to Pharaoh.
