\v 8 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold! I will bring a sword against you;I will cut off both man and beast from you.
\v 9 So the land of Egypt will become desolate and a ruin; then they will know that I am Yahweh, because the sea monster had said, "The river is mine, for I have made it!"
\v 10 Therefore, behold! I am against you and against your river, so I will give the land of Egypt over to desolation and waste, and you will become a wasteland from the Migdol to Syene and the borders of Cush.
