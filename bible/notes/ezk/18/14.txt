\v 14 But behold! Suppose there is a man who bears a son, and his son sees all the sins that his father has committed, and though he sees them, he does not do those things. 
\v 15 That son does not eat upon the mountains, and he does not lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, and he does not defile his neighbor's wife, what can be said about him?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **behold!** - The word "behold" here adds emphasis to what follows.
  * **That son does not eat upon the mountains** - People often worshiped and offered sacrifices to pagan gods on the mountains. It is implied that this person has not participated in these kinds of pagan rituals. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:18:05|18:6]]. AT: "That son does not eat meat sacrificed to idols upon the mountains" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **he does not lift up his eyes to the idols** - The idiom "lifted up his eyes" refers to looking toward something. With reference to idols, this gesture represents worshiping or praying to idols. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:18:05|18:6]]. AT: "he does not worship the idols" or "he does not pray to the idols" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **the house of Israel** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:16|3:1]]. AT: "the Israelite people group" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
