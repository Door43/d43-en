\v 20 It is those who sin who will die because of their sins. I will not punish people because their parents have sinned, or because their children have sinned. I will reward people who do live rightly, and I will punish the wicked people, those who live wrongly.

\v 19 But you say "Why does the son not bear the iniquity of his father?" Because the son carries out justice and righteousness and keeps all my statutes; he does them. He will certainly live!
\v 20 The one who sins, he will die. A son will not bear his father's iniquity, and a father will not bear his son's iniquity. The righteousness of the one who acts rightly will be on himself, and the wickedness of the wicked person will be on himself.
