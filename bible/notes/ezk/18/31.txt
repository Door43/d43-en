\v 31 Stop doing wicked things; start thinking in a new way. You Israelite people, do you really want me to kill you because you have sinned?

\v 31 Throw away from yourselves all of the transgressions that you have committed; make for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. Why should you die, house of Israel?
\v 32 For I have no delight in the death of the one who dies—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration—so repent and live!"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to speak to the people of Israel.
 
  * **Throw away from yourselves all of the transgressions that you have committed** - Yahweh speaks of the people determining to stop committing transgressions as if the transgressions were objects, such as clothing, that they removed and threw away. AT: "Get rid of all of the transgressions that you have committed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **make for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit** - Here the word "heart" represents the will and emotions and the word "spirit" represents the thoughts and disposition. Yahweh speaks of the people having new emotions and thoughts as if they were making a new heart and spirit for themselves. AT: "get for yourselves new emotions and a new way of thinking" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Why should you die, house of Israel?** - Yahweh asks this rhetorical question to comfort the people of Israel. AT: "There is no reason for you to die, house of Israel." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **house of Israel** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:16|3:1]]. AT: "the Israelite people group" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
