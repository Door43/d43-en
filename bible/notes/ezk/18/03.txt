\v 3 As I live—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration—there will certainly no longer be any occasion for you to use this proverb in Israel.
\v 4 Behold! Every life belong to me—the life of the father as well as the life of the son, they belong to me! The soul who sins is the one who will die!

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **As I live** - "As surely as I am alive." Yahweh uses this expression to show that what he says next is certainly true. This is a way of making a solemn promise. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]]. AT: "I solemnly swear" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]]. AT: "this is what the Lord Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **Behold!** - The word "Behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.
  * **The soul who sins** - Here the word "soul" represents the person. AT: "The person who sins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
