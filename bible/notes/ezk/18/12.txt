<usfm>
\v 12 Suppose that he oppresses the poor and needy, and that he seizes and robs and does not return a pledge. Suppose that he lifts up his eyes to the idols or commits disgusting actions. 
\v 13 Suppose that he lends charging interest or gains unjust profit. Should he live? He will not live! He has done all these disgusting actions. He will surely die, and his blood will be on him.
