===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 if he oppresses the poor and needy, if he seizes and robs and does not return a pledge, if he lifts up his eyes to the idols or commits disgusting actions; 
\v 13 if he lends charging interest or gains unjust profit, should he live? He will not live! He has done all these disgusting actions. He will surely die; his blood is on him.

  * **the poor and needy**  - Both of these are people who are poor.  Needy people are those who need help to survive. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **seizes and robs** - Both of these words refer to a person taking something that does not belong to them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **and does not return a pledge**  - A pledge is something given to guarantee a loan. Often, a cloak was used as a pledge for a debt and would be needed for warmth.
  * **who lifts up his eyes to the idols - **  Another translation could be "nor look to idols for help" or "nor worshipped idols."
  * **He/His**  - These pronouns refers to the violent son in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:18:10
