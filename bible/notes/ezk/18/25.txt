\v 25 But you say, 'The way of the Lord is not fair!' Listen, house of Israel! Are my ways unfair? Is it not your ways that are unfair?
\v 26 When the righteous man turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity and dies because of them, then he will die in the iniquity that he has done.

===== Translation Notes: =====

 
  * **dies because of them...dies in the iniquity that he has done**- These phrases repeat the thought of a man dying because of his sin to express that it was his fault and the fault of no one else. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
