\v 25 But you say, 'The way of the Lord is not fair!' Listen, house of Israel! Are my ways unfair? Is it not your ways that are unfair?
\v 26 When the righteous man turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity and dies because of them, then he will die in the iniquity that he has done.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **house of Israel** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:16|3:1]]. AT: "the Israelite people group" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **Are my ways unfair?** - Yahweh asks this rhetorical question to emphasize the negative answer. AT: "My ways are not unfair." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Is it not your ways that are unfair?** - Yahweh asks this rhetorical question to emphasize the positive answer. AT: "It is your ways that are unfair." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **dies because of them ... die in the iniquity that he has done** - These phrases repeat the thought of a man dying because of his sin to express that it was his fault and the fault of no one else. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
