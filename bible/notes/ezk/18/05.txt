===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **and has not eaten on the mountains...nor lifted up his eyes to the idols** - These are both phrases referring to idol worship.  People ate the food at the mountain temples to honor the idols.  The phrase "lifted up his eyes" refers to looking at the idols and honoring them.  AT: "and has not honored idol" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]], [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
