===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 if he does not oppress anyone, seize a pledge, or take stolen things, but instead gives his food to the hungry and covers the naked with clothes—
\v 17 if he draws his hand back from the poor and does not take interest or unjust profit; if he carries out my decrees and walks according to my statutes, then he will not die for his father's sin; he will surely live!
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa the poor \fqb , some ancient and many modern versions have \fqb from sin \fqa . \f*
