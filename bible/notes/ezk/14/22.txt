\v 22 Yet, behold! A remnant will be left in her, survivors who will go out with sons and daughters. Behold! They will go out to you, and you will see their ways and actions and be comforted concerning the punishment that I have sent to Jerusalem, and about everything else that I have sent against the land.
\v 23 The survivors will comfort you when you see their ways and their actions; so you will know all these things that I have done against her—I have not done them in vain!—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration."

===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues to speak with Ezekiel about the punishment of the people of Israel.
  * **behold!** - The word "behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the information that follows.
  * **left in her...done against her** - The word "her" refers to Jerusalem.
  * **their ways and their actions** - Both of these phrases refer to what the people of Israel have done.  The word "ways" refers to the way they live their life.  This is another way to say their "actions." If your language has only one way to express this you can translate this in one word."their actions" or "the things they do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]]
