\v 12 Then the word of Yahweh came to me and said,
\v 13 "Son of man, when a land sins against me by committing a trespass so I stretch out my hand against and break the
staff of its bread, and send out over it a famine and cut off both man and beast from it;
\v 14 even if  these three men--Noah, Daniel, and Job--were in its midst, they could only deliver their own souls by their
righteousness.--This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration.
