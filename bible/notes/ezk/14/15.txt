\v 15 If I send evil beasts through the land and make it barren so that it becomes a wasteland where no man may pass through because of the beasts,
\v 16 then even if these same three men were in it—as I live, declares the Lord Yahweh—they would not be able to rescue even their own sons or daughters; only their own lives would be rescued, but the land would become a wasteland.
