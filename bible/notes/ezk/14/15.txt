\v 15 "If I send evil beasts through the land and make it barren so that it becomes a wasteland where no man may pass
through because of the beasts,
\v 16 then even if these same three men were in itâ€”as I live," declares the Lord Yahweh, "they would not be able to rescue even their own sons or daughters;
only their own lives would be rescued, but the land would become a wasteland!
