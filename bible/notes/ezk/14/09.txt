\v 9 And if the prophet be deceived and speak a word, I, Jehovah, have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand
upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.
\v 10 And they shall bear their iniquity: the iniquity of the prophet shall be even as the iniquity of him that seeks
to him;
\v 11 that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither defile themselves any more with all their transgressions;
but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, says the Lord Jehovah.
