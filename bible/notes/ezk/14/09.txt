\v 9 If a prophet is deceived and speaks a message, then I, Yahweh, will deceive that prophet; I will reach out with my hand against him and destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.
\v 10 They will carry their own iniquity; the iniquity of the prophet will be the same as the iniquity of the one who inquires from him.
\v 11 Because of this, the house of Israel will no longer wander away from following me nor defile themselves any longer through all their transgressions. They will be my people, and I will be their God—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration.'"

  * **I will reach out with my hand against him** - God's hand refers to what he does. AT: "I will work against him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **They will carry their own iniquity** - Here the word "iniquity" represents the guilt that people incur for committing iniquity. Yahweh speaks of people suffering the consequences of their iniquity as if they were carrying the iniquity. AT: "They will suffer the consequences of their own iniquity" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **house of Israel** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:16|3:1]]. AT: "the Israelite people group" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **will no longer wander away from following me** - Yahweh speaks of the people no longer worshiping him as if they were to wander away from him and no longer follow him. AT: "will no longer stop worshiping me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]]. AT: "this is what the Lord Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
