<usfm>
\v 19 Or, if I send a plague into that land and cause the people and the animals to die \add from the plague\add* because I am very angry with those people,
\v 20 as surely as I am alive, even if Noah, Daniel and Job were in that country, they would not be able to save even their sons and daughters. They would save only themselves because of their being righteous. That is what I, Yahweh the Lord, declare.

<usfm>
\v 19 Or if I send a plague against this land and pour out my fury against it through blood, in order to cut off both man and beast,
\v 20 though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in that land--as I live, declares the Lord Yahweh--they could not deliver either son or
daughte; only their own lives will be delivered by their righteousness.
