\v 4 Therefore announce this to them and say to them, 'The Lord Yahweh says this: Every man of the house of Israel who takes his idols into his heart, or who puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and who then comes to a prophet—I, Yahweh, will answer him according to the number of his idols.
\v 5 I will do this so that I may take back the house of Israel in their hearts that have been driven far from me through their idols.'

See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:16|3:1]]. AT: "the Israelite people group" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **who takes his idols into his heart** - Yahweh speaks of the people committing themselves to worshiping idols as if they had taken their idols into their hearts.

  * **who puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face** - Yahweh speaks of the idols that people worship as if they were blocks over which the people stumble, and of being determined to worship those idols as if they had placed those stumbling blocks in front of their faces.
