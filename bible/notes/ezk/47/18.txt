\v 18 On the east side, between Hauran and Damascus and between Gilead and the land of Israel will be the Jordan River. You must measure from the border to the eastern sea; all of this will be the eastern border.
\f + \ft The Hebrew text reads \fqa You must measure from the border to the eastern sea \fqa* . However, some ancient and modern versions read \fqa to the eastern sea as far as Tamar \fqa* . \f*


\v 19 Then the south side: South of Tamar to the waters of Meribah Kadesh, the brook of Egypt to the Great Sea, and the southern side toward the south.
\v 20 Then the western boundary will be the Great Sea to where it goes opposite Lebo Hamath. This will be the western side.
