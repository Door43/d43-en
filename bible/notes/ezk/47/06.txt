===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Son of man** - "Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01|2:1]]. AT: "Mortal person" or "Human"
  * **do you see this?** - Yahweh is commanding Ezekiel to think about what he has just seen. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:08:14|8:15]]. AT: "think about this." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
