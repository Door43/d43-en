\v 6 And he said to me, Son of man, have you seen this? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the bank of
the river.
\v 7 Now when I had returned, behold, upon the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.
\v 8 Then said he to me, These waters issue forth toward the eastern region, and shall go down into the Arabah; and they
shall go toward the sea; into the sea shall the waters go which were made to issue forth; and the waters shall be
healed.
