\v 3 As the man continued walking toward the east, he had a measuring line in his hand. He measured off 1,750 ft.\f + \ft Or: 530 meters \f* and then led me through water that covered my ankles.
\v 4 Then he measured off another 1,750 ft.\f + \ft Or: 530 meters \f* and led me through water that was up to my knees. Then he measured off another 1,750 ft.\f + \ft Or: 530 meters \f* and led me through water that was up to my waist.
\v 5 Then he measured off another 1,750 ft.\f + \ft Or: 530 meters \f* and led me through water that was now a river that I could not cross, because the water had risen very high, with the result that it would be necessary to swim across it. It was a river that no one could cross \add by walking across it\add*.

\p
\v 3 And when the man went out eastward, there was a measuring line in his hand, and he measured a thousand cubits, and brought me through the waters to ankle-deep water.
\v 4 Then he measured a thousand cubits and brought me through the waters to knee-deep waters; and he measured a thousand cubits and brought me through to hip-deep water.
\v 5 Next he measured a thousand cubits—it was a river that I was not able to pass through since the waters had gone up. Swimming water, a river that could not be passed through.
