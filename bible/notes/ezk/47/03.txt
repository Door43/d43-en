\v 3 As the man continued walking toward the east, he had a measuring line in his hand. He measured off 1,750 ft.\f + \ft Or: 530 meters \f* and then led me through water that covered my ankles.
\v 4 Then he measured off another 1,750 ft.\f + \ft Or: 530 meters \f* and led me through water that was up to my knees. Then he measured off another 1,750 ft.\f + \ft Or: 530 meters \f* and led me through water that was up to my waist.
\v 5 Then he measured off another 1,750 ft.\f + \ft Or: 530 meters \f* and led me through water that was now a river that I could not cross, because the water had risen very high, with the result that it would be necessary to swim across it. It was a river that no one could cross \add by walking across it\add*.

\v 3 When the man went forth eastward with the line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and he caused me to pass
through the waters, waters that were to the ankles.
\v 4 Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the knees. Again he measured a
thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the loins.
\v 5 Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass through; for the waters were risen,
waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed through.
