\c 47
\p
\v 1 Then the man took me back to the entrance to the temple, and behold! Water was flowing out from under the temple threshold of the house toward the east—for the front of the temple faced east— and the water was flowing down the south side of the temple, to the right of the altar.
\v 2 So he brought me out through the northern gate and led around to the gate facing east. Behold, the water was flowing from this gate on its south side.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Behold** - The word “behold” here shows that what Ezekiel saw was important. 
  * **faced east** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:40:05|40:6]].
  * **to the right of the altar** - This is the right side of the altar when a person looks at it while they are facing east. So, it is on the south side of the altar. AT: "on the south side of the altar."
