\v 9 It will happen all kinds of animals will swarm where the water goes. There will be multitudes of fish because of this water, and the Salt Sea will be fresh. Everything will live wherever the river goes.
\v 10 Then it will happen that fishermen of En Gedi will stand by the water, and there will be a place to dry out the fishing nets by En Eglaim. There will be many kinds of fish in the Salt Sea, like the fish in the Great Sea for their abundance.
