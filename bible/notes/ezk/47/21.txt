\v 21 In this way you will divide this land for yourselves, for the tribes of Israel.
\v 22 And it will happen that you will throw lots for inheritances for yourselves and for the foreigners in your midst, those who have given birth to children in your midst and who are, with you, like the native born people of Israel. You will throw lots for inheritances among the tribes of Israel.
\v 23 Then it will happen that the foreigner will be with the tribe among whom he is living. You must give him an inheritance—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration."
