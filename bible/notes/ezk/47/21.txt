\v 21 You must distribute this land among yourselves, among the tribes of Israel.
\v 22 You must allot the land to be a permanent possession for yourselves, and also for any foreigners who are living among you and raising their children. You must consider them to be like native born Israelites, and they must be allotted land among the tribes of Israel.
\v 23 Wherever foreigners are living, you must give them some land to belong to them permanently. That is what I, Yahweh the Lord, declare."

\v 21 In this way you will divide this land for yourselves, for the tribes of Israel.
\v 22 So you will distribute the inheritances for yourselves and for the foreigners in your midst, those who have given birth to children in your midst and who are, with you, like the native born people of Israel. You will cast lots for inheritances among the tribes of Israel.
\v 23 Then it will happen that the foreigner will be with the tribe among whom he is living. You must give him an inheritance—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration."
