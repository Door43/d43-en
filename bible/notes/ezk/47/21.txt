\v 21 So you will divide this land for yourselves to the tribes of Israel.
\v 22 And it will be you cause lots to fall as an inheritance for yourselves and for the sojourners in your midst who have birthed children in your midst and who are with you like the natives of the children of Israel with you. The lots will fall for an inheritance among the tribes of Israel.
