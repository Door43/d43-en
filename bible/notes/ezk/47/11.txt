\v 11 But the swamps and marshes \add along the shore\add* will not become fresh; they will be left to make salt.
\v 12 Many kinds of fruit trees will grow on both sides of the river. Their leaves will not wither, and they will always have fruit. They will bear more fruit every month, because the water that comes from the temple flows continually to the trees. Their fruit will be good to eat and their leaves will be good for healing."

\v 11 But the miry places thereof, and the marshes thereof, shall not be healed; they shall be given up to salt.
\v 12 And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow every tree for food, whose leaf shall
not whither, neither shall the fruit thereof fail: it shall bring forth new fruit every month, because the waters thereof issue
out of the sanctuary; and the fruit thereof shall be for food, and the leaf thereof for healing.
