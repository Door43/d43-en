\v 11 But the swamps and marshes \add along the shore\add* will not become fresh; they will be left to make salt.
\v 12 Many kinds of fruit trees will grow on both sides of the river. Their leaves will not wither, and they will always have fruit. They will bear more fruit every month, because the water that comes from the temple flows continually to the trees. Their fruit will be good to eat and their leaves will be good for healing."

\v 11 Its swamps and marshes will not be healed; they will be given over to salt.
\v 12 So beside the river on its banks, on both sides, every edible tree will grow up; its leaf will not wither, and its fruit will not run out. It will bear fruit for each new moon, since its waters are from the Sanctuary – they go out and its fruit will be food and its leaf will be medicine!
