\v 13 The Lord Yahweh says this: This will be the way that you divide the land up for the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph will have two portions.
\v 14 And you, each man and brother among you, will inherit it. As I lifted up my hand to swear to give it to your fathers, in the same way this land has become your inheritance.
