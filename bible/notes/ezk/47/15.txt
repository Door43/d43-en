\li1 On the north side, it will extend from the Mediterranean Sea east along the road to Hethlon, past Lebo-Hamath to Zedad,
\li1
\v 16 Berothah, and Sibraim, which is on the border between Damascus and Hamath, as far as Hazer-Hatticon, which is on the border of the Hauran \add region\add*.

\v 15 This will be the boundary of the land on the north side from the Great Sea by way of Hethlon and on to Lebo Hamath to Zedad.
\v 16 Then the boundary will go to Berothah, to Sibraim—which is between Damascus and Hamath, to Hazer Hatticon—which is beside the boundary of Hauran.
\v 17 So the boundary will go from the sea to Hazar Enon on the border with  Damascus and Hamath to the north. This will be the north side.
