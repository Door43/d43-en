\v 11 Therefore, I, Yahweh the Lord, declare that as surely as I am alive, because you have polluted my temple with all your disgusting statues of idols and by the other detestable things that you do, I will no longer bless you. I will not pity you or act mercifully toward you.
\v 12 One-third of your people will die inside the city because of the plagues they will experience, or by famine\f + \ft Or: lack of food \f*. One-third of your people will be killed by \add your enemies' \add* swords outside the city.

\v 11 Therefore, I, Yahweh the Lord, make this declaration! That as surely as I am alive, because you have polluted my temple with all your disgusting statues of idols and by the other detestable things that you do, I will no longer bless you. I will not pity you or act mercifully toward you.
\v 12 One-third of your people will die inside the city because of the plagues they will experience, or by famine. One-third of your people will be killed by your enemies'  swords outside the city. And one-third I will scatter in every direction, but your enemies will still pursue you and kill you with their swords.

<usfm>
\v 11 Therefore, as I live--this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration--it is certainly because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable
practices and with all your abominations that I myself will diminish you, and my eye will not have pity on you and I will not spare you.
\v 12 A third of you will die by plague, and they will be be consumed by famine in your midst. A third of you will fall by the sword surrounding you.
Then I will scatter a third of you in every direction, and draw out a sword to chase after them as well.
