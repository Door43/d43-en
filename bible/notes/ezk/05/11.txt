===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 Therefore, I, Yahweh the Lord, declare that as surely as I am alive, because you have polluted my temple with all your disgusting statues of idols and by the other detestable things that you do, I will no longer bless you. I will not pity you or act mercifully toward you.
\v 12 One-third of your people will die inside the city because of the plagues they will experience, or by famine\f + \ft Or: lack of food \f*. One-third of your people will be killed by \add your enemies' \add* swords outside the city. And one-third I will cause to be scattered in all directions; but \add your enemies\add* will still pursue you and kill you with their swords.

<usfm>
\v 11 Therefore, I, Yahweh the Lord, make this declaration! That as surely as I am alive, because you have polluted my temple with all your disgusting idols and with the other awful things that you do, I will no longer bless you. I  will not pity you or act mercifully toward you.
\v 12 One third of your people will die inside the city because of the plagues they will experience, or by famine. One third of your people will be killed by your enemies'  swords outside the city. And one third I will scatter in every direction, but your enemies will still pursue you and kill you with their swords.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 Therefore, as I live—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration—it is certainly because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your hateful things and with all your disgusting deeds, that I myself will reduce you in number; my eye will not have pity on you, and I will not spare you.
\v 12 A third of you will die by plague, and they will be consumed by famine in your midst. A third of you will fall by the sword surrounding you. Then I will scatter a third of you in every direction, and draw out a sword to chase after them as well.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to speak to the people of Israel and Judah.

  * **Therefore, as I live—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration** - This can be reordered:  "This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration. 'Therefore, as I live.'"
  * **as I live** - "as surely as I live." God said this to show that what he was about to say was true. This can be translated as "as true as it is that I am alive, it is true that"
  * **with all your hateful things** - "with all of those things of yours that I hate." It can be made explicit that this refers to idols:  "with all your idols, which I hate" or "with all your disgusting idols" (UDB). (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **and with all your disgusting deeds** - "and with all the disgusting things that you do"
  * **they will be consumed by famine in your midst** - "many of them will die because of famine"
