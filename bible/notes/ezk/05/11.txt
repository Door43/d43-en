====== Ezekiel 05:11-12 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 Therefore, I, Yahweh the Lord, declare that as surely as I am alive, because you have polluted my temple with all your disgusting statues of idols and by the other detestable things that you do, I will no longer bless you. I will not pity you or act mercifully toward you.
\v 12 One-third of your people will die inside the city because of the plagues they will experience, or by famine\f + \ft Or: lack of food \f*. One-third of your people will be killed by \add your enemies' \add* swords outside the city. And one-third I will cause to be scattered in all directions; but \add your enemies\add* will still pursue you and kill you with their swords.

\v 11 Therefore, I, Yahweh the Lord, make this declaration! That as surely as I am alive, because you have polluted my temple with all your disgusting idols and with the other awful things that you do, I will no longer bless you. I will not pity you or act mercifully toward you.
\v 12 One-third of your people will die inside the city because of the plagues they will experience, or by famine. One-third of your people will be killed by your enemies' swords outside the city. And one-third I will scatter in every direction, but your enemies will still pursue you and kill you with their swords.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 Therefore, as I live—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration—it is certainly because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your hateful things and with all your disgusting deeds, that I myself will reduce you in number; my eye will not have pity on you, and I will not spare you.
\v 12 A third of you will die by plague, and they will be consumed by famine in your midst. A third will fall by the sword surrounding you. Then I will scatter a third in every direction, and draw out a sword to chase after them as well.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to speak to the people of Israel and Judah.

  * **as I live** - "as surely as I am alive." Yahweh uses this expression to show that what he says next is certainly true. This is a way of making a solemn promise. AT: "I solemnly swear" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. AT: "this is what the Lord Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **Lord Yahweh** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:04|2:4]]. 
  * **defiled ... sanctuary** - ruined the place that Yahweh had set aside to be only for his use
  * **with all your hateful things** - "with all of those things of yours that I hate." You may need to make explicit that this refers to idols: "with all your idols, which I hate" or "with all your disgusting idols." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **and with all your disgusting deeds** - "and with all the disgusting things that you do"
  * **my eye will not have pity on you** - The word "eye" is a metonym for what Yahweh thinks. AT: "I will not have pity on you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I will not spare you** - "I will surely punish you"
  * **they will be consumed by famine in your midst** - "many of them will die because of famine"
