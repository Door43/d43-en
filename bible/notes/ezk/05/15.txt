===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to speak to the people of Israel and Judah.

  * **harsh arrows of famine** - "intense famine"
  * **break your staff of bread!** - A "staff" was something that people leaned upon to support them. This phrase is a metaphor which means "remove the supply of food that you are depending upon." AT: "cut off your food supply" (UDB). (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **plague and blood will pass through you** - "plague and violent death will pass through you." This violent death would be caused by war. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
