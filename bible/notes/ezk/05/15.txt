\v 15 They will scorn you and taunt you. When I severely punish you because of my great anger, they will be horrified and you will be a warning to them. That will surely happen because I, Yahweh, have said it.
\v 16 And when I cut off your food supply and cause there to be more famine, it will be as though I am shooting at you with my arrows that will destroy you.
\v 17 So I will cause you to experience a famine, and I will send wild beasts to attack you and your children, and all your children will be killed. You will experience plagues and wars, and I will cause your enemies to attack you with their swords. That will surely happen because I, Yahweh, have said it."

\v 15 So Jerusalem will become something for other people to condemn and to mock, a warning and a horror to the nations that surround you; when I
will execute judgments against you in wrath and fury, and with a furious rebuke"—I, Yahweh have declared this!—
\v 16 "and when I send out harsh arrows of famine against them that will become the destruction that I will send to destroy you, since I will
increase the famine upon you and break your staff of bread!
\v 17 Then I will send a famine against you, and disasters so you will be childless. Plague and blood will pass through you, and I will bring
a sword upon you. I, Yahweh, have declared this!"

  * **that will become the destruction that I will send to destroy you** "that will cause the destruction I will have destroy you" 
  * **break your staff of bread!** - A "staff" was something that people leaned upon to support them. This phrase is a metaphor which means "remove the supply of food that you are depending upon." Alternate translation: "cut off your food supply" (UDB). (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
