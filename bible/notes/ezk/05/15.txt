<usfm>
\v 15 So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment, to the nations that are round about thee,
when I shall execute judgments on you in anger and in wrath, and in wrathful rebukes (I, Jehovah, have spoken it);
\v 16 when I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, that are for destruction, which I will send to destroy you. And I
will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread;
\v 17 and I will send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through
thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee: I, Jehovah, have spoken it.
