\v 5 The Lord Yahweh says this, "This is Jerusalem in the midst of the nations, where I have placed her, and where I have surrounded her with other lands.
\v 6 But she has in wickedness rejected my decrees more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that surround her. The people have rejected my judgments and have not walked in my statutes."
