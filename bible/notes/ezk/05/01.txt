then take scales to weigh and divide your hair.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking to Ezekiel.

  * **Son of man**  - This refers to Ezekiel. See how you translated it in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01|2:3]].
  * **barber's razor**  - "blade for cutting hair"
  * **pass the razor over your head and your beard**  - "shave your head and your face" or "remove the hair from your head and your beard"
  * **Burn a third of it**  - "Burn a third of your hair"
  * **in the midst of the city**  - "in the middle of the city." The phrase "the city" probably refers to the picture of Jerusalem.
  * **when the days of the siege are completed**  - "when the days of Jerusalem's siege have ended" or "when the days have ended that you show how Jerusalem will put under siege"
  * **take a third of the hair**  - "take one of the three piles of hair"
  * **and strike it with the sword all around the city**  - "and hit it with your sword all over the city"
  * **scatter a third of it to the wind**  - Alternate translation: "let the wind blow the last third of your hair in different directions."
  * **I will draw out a sword** - "I will pull a sword out of its container"
  * **I will draw out a sword to chase after the people**  - The word "sword" refers to enemy soldiers who will attack with their swords. Alternate translation: "I will still cause their enemies to pursue them and attack them with swords." (UDB) (See [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
