\v 1 "Then, son of man, when you start doing those things, take a sharp sword and use it like a barber's razor to shave your head and your beard. Put the hair that you shaved off on scales, and divide the hair into three equal parts.
\v 2 When the time during which you will symbolize that the city will be surrounded by enemy troops ends, put a third of the hair inside the drawing of the city and burn it. Take another third of the hair, scatter it all around the drawing of the city, and then strike it with your sword. That will symbolize that I will strike the people of Jerusalem with their enemies' swords. Then allow the wind to scatter the other third of the hair. That will symbolize that even if they flee from the city, I will still cause their enemies to pursue them and attack them with swords.

\v 1 "Then you, son of man, take a sharp sword as a barber's razor for yourself, and pass the razor over your head and your beard, then take scales to weigh and divide your hair.
\v 2 Burn a third of it with fire in the midst of the city when the days of the siege are completed, and take a third of the hair and strike it with the sword all around the city. Then scatter a third of it to the wind, and I will draw out a sword to chase after the people.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to Ezekiel. All instances of "the city" refer to the "city" that Ezekiel carved onto the brick ([[:en:bible:notes:ezk:04:01|4:1]]).

  * **son of man** - "son of a human being" or "son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01|2:1]]. AT: "mortal person" or "human"
  * **barber's razor** - "blade for cutting hair"
  * **pass the razor over your head and your beard** - "shave your head and your face" or "remove the hair from your head and the beard from your face"
  * **Burn a third of it** - "Burn a third of your hair" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_fraction]])
  * **midst** - middle
  * **when the days of the siege are completed** - "when the days of Jerusalem's siege have ended" or "when the days have ended that you show how Jerusalem will put under siege"
  * **take a third of the hair** - "take one of the three piles of hair" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_fraction]])
  * **and strike it with the sword all around the city** - "and hit it with your sword all over the city"
  * **scatter a third of it to the wind** - "let the wind blow the last third of your hair in different directions" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_fraction]])
  * **I will draw out a sword to chase after the people** - The word "sword" is a metonym for enemy soldiers who will attack with their swords, and to "draw out a sword" is to send the soldiers into battle. AT: "I will cause their enemies to pursue them and attack them with swords." (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I will draw out a sword** - "I will pull a sword out of its container"
