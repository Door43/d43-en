===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel and Judah

  * **what I have not done and the like of which I will not do again** - "as I have not done before and will not do in a similar way again" or "like I have never done before and will never do again" (UDB).
  * **because of all your disgusting actions** - "because of all the disgusting things you do." The people were worshiping idols and false gods, and God hated that they were doing that.
  * **I will execute judgment on you** - "I will judge you" or "I will punish you severely" (UDB)
  * **and scatter to every direction all of you who are left** - Alternate translations: and throw all of you who are left in all directions" or "I will send all of you who are left to go to different places."
