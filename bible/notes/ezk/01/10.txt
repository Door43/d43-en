\v 10 The appearance of their faces were like the face of a man, next, the face of a lion to the right, next, the face of an ox to the left, and finally, the face of an eagle.
\v 11 Ttheir faces were like that, and their wings were spread out above, so that each creature had a pair of wings that touched another creature's wing, and also a pair of wings that covered their bodies.
\v 12 Each went straight forward, so that wherever the Spirit directed them to go, they went without turning.
