\v 10 As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man; and they four had the face of a lion on the right side;
and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four had also the face of an eagle.
\v 11 And their faces and their wings were separate above; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.
\v 12 And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; they turned not when they went.
