\v 15 Then I looked at the living creatures; there was one wheel on the ground beside the living creatures.
\v 16 This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: each wheel was like beryl, and the four had the same likeness; their appearance and structure was like a wheel intersecting another wheel.
