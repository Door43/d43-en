\v 15 Then I looked at the living creatures; there was one wheel on the ground  beside the living creatures.
\v 16 This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: each wheel was like beryl, and the four were all the same; they looked like a wheel intersecting another  wheel.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Ezekiel continues to tell about his vision

  * **there was one wheel on the ground beside the living creatures** - "there was one wheel on the ground by each one of the living creatures, one wheel for each direction the creatures faced"
  * **This was the appearance and structure of the wheels** - "This is what the wheels looked like and how they were made"
  * **each wheel was like beryl** - Beryl is a kind of clear, valuable stone. This kind of beryl has a yellow or golden color. Alternate translation: "the wheels were clear and yellow like a beryl stone" or "the wheels were clear and yellow like a precious stone."
  * **and the four were all the same** - "and all four of the wheels looked the same""
  * **they looked like a wheel intersecting another wheel** - "they were made with one wheel going through another wheel"
