\v 4 In one of the visions, I saw a windstorm coming from the north. There was a huge cloud, and lightning was flashing within it continually, and a brilliant light surrounded the cloud. In the center of where the lightning was flashing, there was amber-colored fire.
\v 5 In the center of the storm I saw what resembled four living creatures. They resembled humans,
\v 6 but each of them had four faces and four wings.

\v 4 Then I looked, and there was a windstorm coming from the north; a great cloud with fire flashing within it and brightness surrounding it and inside of it, and the fire was the color of amber inside the cloud.
\v 5 In the middle was the likeness of four living creatures. This was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man,
\v 6 but they had four faces each, and each of the creatures had four wings.
