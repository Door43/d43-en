\v 22 Over the heads of the living creatures was what looked like an expansive dome; it looked like awe-inspiring crystal stretched out over their heads above.
\v 23 Beneath the dome, each one of the creature's wings stretched out straight and touched another creature's wings. Each of the living creatures also had a pair to cover themselves; each had a pair to cover his own body.
