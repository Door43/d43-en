\v 24 Then I heard the sound of their wings! Like the noise of rushing water. Like the voice of the Almighty. Whenever they moved there was the sound of a rainstorm. It was like the sound of an army. Whenever they stood still, they lowered their wings.
\v 25 And a voice came from above the dome over their heads whenever they stood still and lowered their wings.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Ezekiel continues to tell about his vision of the living creatures.

  * **Like the noise of rushing water** - This can be translated as a sentence: "The sound of their wings was loud like rushing water." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]]) 
  * **rushing water** - This simply means "a lot of water." It could refer to "a loud river" or "a large waterfall" or "the waves crashing at the ocean". All of these are very loud. 
  * **Like the voice of the Almighty** - The Bible sometimes refers to thunder as "the voice of the Almighty." Alternate translation: "It sounded like the voice of the Almighty God" or "It sounded like the thunder of the Almighty." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * ** there was the sound of a rainstorm** - Possible meanings are: 1) "the sound of very big storm" or 2) "the sound of a very large crowd of people." Alternate translations: "there was a sound that was loud like a big storm" or "there was a sound that was loud like a very large crowd of people."
  * **Whenever they stood still** - "Whenever the creatures stopped moving"
  * **they lowered their wings** - "the creatures let their wings hang down by their sides." They did this when they were not using their wings to fly.
  * **the dome over their heads** - "the dome that was over the heads of the creatures"
  * **the dome** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:01:22|1:23]]
