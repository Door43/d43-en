  * ** there was the sound of a rainstorm** - Possible meanings are: 1) "the sound of very big storm" or 2) "the sound of a very large crowd of people." Alternate translations: "there was a sound that was loud like a big storm" or "there was a sound that was loud like a very large crowd of people."
  * **Whenever they stood still** - "Whenever the creatures stopped moving"
