\v 1-2 "When I, Ezekiel, was thirty years old, I was living among the Israelite people by the Chebar canal, which was south of Babylon. The Babylonians had taken us from the land of Judah and brought us here. On the fifth day of the fourth month of that year, it was as though the sky opened and I saw visions from God.
\p The fifth day of the fourth month was almost five years after King Jehoiachin had been exiled."
\v 3 So God gave Ezekiel the priest, son of Buzi, messages in Babylonia while he was beside the Chebar canal. Yahweh's power went to him there.

\v 1 In the thirtieth year, the fourth month, and the fifth day of the month, it came about that I was living among the captives by the Chebar canal. The heavens opened, and I saw visions of God!
\v 2 On the fifth day of that month—it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin,
\v 3 the word of Yahweh came with power to Ezekiel son of Buzi, the priest, in the land of the Chaldeans by the Chebar canal; the hand of Yahweh came upon him there.
