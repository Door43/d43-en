\v 1-2 "When I, Ezekiel, was thirty years old, I was living among the Israelite people by the Chebar canal, which was south of Babylon. The Babylonians had taken us from the land of Judah and brought us here. On the fifth day of the fourth month of that year, it was as though the sky opened and I saw visions from God.
\p The fifth day of the fourth month was almost five years after King Jehoiachin had been exiled."
\v 3 So God gave Ezekiel the priest, son of Buzi, messages in Babylonia while he was beside the Chebar canal. Yahweh's power went to him there.
