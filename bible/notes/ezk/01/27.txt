\v 27 I saw a figure that looked like glowing metal with fire in it from his hips up; from his hips downward it looked like fire and brightness all around.
\v 28 It looked like a rainbow that appears in the clouds on a rainy day—and like bright light surrounding it. This appeared as the likeness of the glory of Yahweh. When I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice speaking.
