\v 19 Whenever the living creatures moved, the wheels moved beside them. When the living creatures rose up from the earth, the wheels also rose up.
\v 20 Wherever the Spirit moved, they moved to where where the Spirit had gone; the wheels rose up beside them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
\v 21 Whenever the creatures moved, the wheels also moved; and when the creatures stood still, the wheels stood still; when the creatures rose up from the earth, the wheels rose up beside them, since the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **When the living creatures rose up from the earth** - It was implied that the creatures were flying in the air after they left the ground. AT: "So when the creatures left the ground and went up into the air." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the spirit of the living creature** - Possible meanings are that Ezekiel is 1) speaking of the "creatures" of verse 19 as if they were one creature, "the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels" or 2) using an idiom to speak of AT: "the spirit of life" or "the living spirit" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]) or 3) "the same spirit that gave life to the creatures also gave life to the wheels."
  * **the wheels also rose up** - "the wheels also left the ground and went into the air"
  * **Wherever the Spirit moved, they moved** - The word "they" refers to the creatures.
  * **the wheels rose up beside them** - "the wheels went up into the air with the living creatures"
