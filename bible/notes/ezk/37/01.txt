\v 1 The hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he brought me out in the Spirit of Jehovah, and set me down in the midst of the
valley; and it was full of bones.
\v 2 And he caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were
very dry.
\v 3 And he said to me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord Jehovah, you knowest.
