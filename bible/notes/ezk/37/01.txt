\c 37
\p
\v 1 The hand of Yahweh came on me, sent me out by the Spirit of Yahweh, and set me down in the midst of a valley. It was full of bones.
\v 2 Then he made me pass through them round and round. Behold! A great many of them were in the valley. And behold! They were very dry.
\v 3 He said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live again?” So I said, “Lord Yahweh, you alone know!”

Ezekiel is speaking

  * **in the midst** - AT: "in the middle"
  * **round and round** - AT: "in every direction"
  * **Behold** - The word “behold” here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.
  * **Son of man** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01|2:3]].
