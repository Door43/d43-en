\c 37
\p
\v 1 The hand of Yahweh came on me, sent me out by the Spirit of Yahweh, and set me down in the midst of a valley. It was full of bones.
\v 2 Then he made me pass through them round and round. Behold! A great many of them were in the valley. And behold! They were very dry.
\v 3 He said to me, "Son of man, can these bones live again?" So I said, "Lord Yahweh, you alone know!"
