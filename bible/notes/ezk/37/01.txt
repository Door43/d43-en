\v 1 The hand of Yahweh came upon me and sent me out by the Spirit of Yahweh and set me in the midst of the valley plain. And It was full of bones.
\v 2 Then he brought me across them, surrounded all around, and behold! A great many of them in the valley plain! Then behold! They were very dry!
\v 3 And he said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” So I said, “Lord Yahweh, You alone know!”
