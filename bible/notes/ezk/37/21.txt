\v 21 Then declare to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold! I am taking the sons of Israel from among the nations where they went and gather them from the surrounding lands. For I will bring them to their land.
\v 22 And I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and there will be one king as king over all of them, and they will no longer be two nations and will no longer be divided into two kingdoms any more.
\v 23 Then they will no longer pollute with their idols and their abhorrent things or any of their sins, for I will save them from all of their dwellings wherein they have sinned and I will purify them so they will be my people and I will be their God!
