\v 21 and say to the people, 'This is what Yahweh the Lord says: I will take you Israelite people out of the countries to which you have been forced to go. I will gather you from all those nations and bring you back to your own land.
\v 22 And I will cause you to again be one nation in that land, on the mountains of Israel. And there will be one king to rule over all of you. Never again will you be two nations or divided into two kingdoms.
\v 23 No longer will you defile yourselves\f + \ft Or: make yourselves unacceptable to me \f* by \add worshiping\add* idols and disgusting statues \add of your gods\add*, because I will enable you to quit your sinful behavior and to stop rejecting me. You will be my people, and I will be your God.'

\v 21 Then declare to them, 'The Lord Yahweh says this: Behold! I am about to take the people of Israel from among the nations where they went. I will gather them from the surrounding lands. For I will bring them to their land.
\v 22 I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel, and there will be one king as king over all of them, and they will no longer be two nations; they will no longer be divided into two kingdoms.
\v 23 Then they will no longer defile themselves with their idols, their disgusting things, or any of their other sins. For I will save them from all of their faithless actions with which they have sinned, and I will purify them, so they will be my people and I will be their God.
\f + \ft Some ancient and most modern versions read in this way: \fqa from all of their faithless actions \fqa* . However, the Hebrew text reads \fqa from their dwelling places \fqa* , which many think makes little sense in this context. \f*
