\v 21 Then declare to them, 'The Lord Yahweh says this: Behold! I am about to take the people of Israel from among the nations where they went. I will gather them from the surrounding lands. For I will bring them to their land.
\v 22 I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and there will be one king as king over all of them, and they will no longer be two nations; they will no longer be divided into two kingdoms.
\v 23 Then they will no longer defile themselves with their idols, their disgusting things, or any of their other sins. For I will save them from all of their faithless actions with which they have sinned, and I will purify them, so they will be my people and I will be their God.
