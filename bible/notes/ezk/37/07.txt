====== Ezekiel 37:7-8 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 So I spoke to the bones what Yahweh commanded me to speak. As I was speaking, there was a noise, a rattling sound, and the bones came together, bones joining to each other.
\v 8 While I was looking, I saw tendons fastening to them and flesh covering them, and then skin covered the flesh, but they did not breathe.

\v 7 So I prophesied as I was commanded; as I prophesied, behold, a sound came, that of shaking. Then the bones drew together—bone against bone.
\v 8 I looked and, behold, sinews were now on them! And flesh grew up and skin covered them! But there was still no life in them.
