\v 4 Then he said to me, "Prophesy over these bones and say to them, 'Dry bones. Listen to the word of Yahweh.
\v 5 The Lord Yahweh says this to these bones: Behold! I am about to put a spirit into you, and you will live.
\v 6 I will place sinews over you and bring flesh onto you. I will cover you with skin and set breath within you so you will live. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.'"
