\v 15 Then the word of Yahweh came to me and said,
\v 16 "Now you, Son of man, take one stick for yourself and write on it, 'For Judah and for the people of Israel, his companions.' And take another stick and write on it, 'For Joseph, the branch of Ephraim, and for all the people of Israel, their companions.' 
\v 17 Then bring both of them together into one stick, so that they become one in your hand.
