\v 15 Then the word of Yahweh came to me and said,
\v 16 “Now you, son of man, take one stick for yourself and write upon it, ‘For Judah and the sons of Israel his companions.’ And take another stick and write upon it, ‘For Joseph, the branch of Ephraim and all the sons of Israel their companions.’
