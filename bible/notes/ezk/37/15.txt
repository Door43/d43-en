\v 15 Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
\v 16 "So now you, son of man, take one stick for yourself and write on it, 'For Judah and for the people of Israel, his companions.' Then take another stick and write on it, 'For Joseph, the branch of Ephraim, and for all the people of Israel, their companions.'
\v 17 Bring both of them together into one stick, so that they become one in your hand.
