===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the entire house of Israel** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:01|3:1]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Behold!** - The word "Behold" here adds emphasis to what follows. AT: "Indeed!"
  * **We have been cut off** - The people being destroyed and removed from their land is spoken of as if they had been cut off like a person would cut off a branch or piece of cloth. AT: "Our nation is destroyed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will open your graves and lift you out from them** - Yahweh restoring the people and bringing them back to their land is spoken of as if he will bring them back to life again. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
