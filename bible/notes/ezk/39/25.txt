\v 25 Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this: 'Now I will restore the fortunes of Jacob, and I will have compassion on all the house of Israel, when I act in zeal for my holy name!
\v 26 Then they will forget their shame and all the treason in which they betrayed me. They will forget all this when they rest in their land in safety, with no one to terrify them.
\v 27 When I restore them from the peoples and gather them from the lands of their enemies, I will show myself to be holy in the sight of many nations.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message about the house of Israel.
  * **Thus says the Lord Yahweh** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:05|5:5]].
  * **will restore the fortunes of Jacob** - See how you translated "will restore their fortunes" in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:16:53|16:53]].
  * **the treason** - "the unfaithfulness"
  * **I will be sanctified through them in the eyes of many nations** - AT: "many nations will understand that I am holy because of what did for the house of Israel." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
