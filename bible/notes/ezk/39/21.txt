===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh gives Ezekiel a message about what will happen to Israel.

  * **I will set my glory among the nations** - Yahweh speaks of his glory as if he will place it in the middle of the nations where they can see it. AT: "I will make the nations see my glory" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **my judgment that I perform and my hand that I have set against them** - Both of these phrases refer to the punishment that Yahweh will inflict upon Israel and are repeated for emphasis. They can be combined into a single phrase. AT: "the way that I will judge them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **my hand** - Here the metonym "hand" refers to Yahweh's power that he uses to bring punishment. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **against them** - "against Gog and his great army"
  * **The house of Israel** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:01|3:1]]. AT: "the Israelites" or "the Israelite people group" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
