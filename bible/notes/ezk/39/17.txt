\v 17 Now to you, Son of man, the Lord Yahweh says this: Say to all the winged birds and all the wild beasts in the fields, "Gather together and come! Gather from all around to the sacrifice that I myself am making for you, a large sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, so that you may consume flesh and drink blood.
\v 18 You will consume the flesh of warriors and drink the blood of the princes of the earth; they will be rams, lambs, goats, and bulls, they were all fattened in Bashan.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh gives Ezekiel his message to the birds and the wild animals.
  * **to the sacrifice** - "to the feast" or "to the slaughter." Yahweh means that he will give the birds and animals a very good meal and not that he is worshiping them.
  * **they were all fattened in Bashan** - AT: "they all became fat while grazing in Bashan." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
