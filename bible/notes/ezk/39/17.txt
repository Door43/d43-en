\v 17 Now to you, son of man, the Lord Yahweh says this: Say to all the winged birds and all the wild beasts in the fields, 'Gather together and come. Gather from all around to the sacrifice that I myself am making for you, a large sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, so that you may consume flesh and drink blood.
\v 18 You will consume the flesh of warriors and drink the blood of the princes of the earth; they will be rams, lambs, goats, and bulls, they were all fattened in Bashan.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh gives Ezekiel a message for the birds and the wild animals about what they will do to Gog.

  * **son of man** - "son of a human being" or "son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01|2:1]]. AT: "mortal person" or "human"
  * **to the sacrifice** - "to the feast" or "to the slaughter." Yahweh means that he will give the birds and animals a very good meal and not that he is worshiping them.
  * **they will be rams, lambs, goats, and bulls** - Yahweh is speaking with irony. Normally people sacrificed animals to God. Here, God is sacrificing people to animals. AT: "as if they were male sheep, lambs, goats, and bulls" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **they were all fattened in Bashan** - That can be stated in active form. AT: "they all became fat while grazing in Bashan" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
