===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues to give Ezekiel a message about what will happen to Israel.

  * **the house of Israel** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:01|3:1]]. AT: "the Israelites" or "the Israelite people group" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **because of their iniquity by which they betrayed me** - The abstract noun "iniquity" can be stated as a verb. AT: "because they sinned and betrayed me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **I hid my face from them** - Here "face" refers to Yahweh's help and protection. AT: "I stopped protecting them and taking care of them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **gave them into the hand of their adversaries** - Here the metonym "hand" refers to power. AT: "gave their enemies power over them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **all of them fell by the sword** - Here falling represents being killed, and the sword represents battle. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:32:22|32:23]]. AT: "their enemies killed them all in battle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **their uncleanness and their sins** - This speaks of the people's disgusting behavior as if they were physically unclean. Here "uncleanness" means basically the same as "sins." AT: "their disgusting behavior and their sins" (UDB) or "their sins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
