===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 At that time, those Israelites who live in the towns will go out and gather the weapons \add from the dead soldiers\add*, and use them to make fires to cook their food. They will burn the small and large shields, the bows and arrows, the war clubs, and spears. There will be enough weapons to use as firewood for seven years.
\v 10 They will not need to gather firewood in the fields or cut wood from trees in the forests, because those weapons will be all the firewood \add that they will need\add*. And they will take valuable things from those who took valuable things from them, and steal things from people who stole things from them. That is what I, Yahweh the Lord, declare will happen.
