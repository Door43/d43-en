====== Ezekiel 39:9-10 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 At that time, those Israelites who live in the towns will go out and gather the weapons \add from the dead soldiers\add*, and use them to make fires to cook their food. They will burn the small and large shields, the bows and arrows, the war clubs, and spears. There will be enough weapons to use as firewood for seven years.
\v 10 They will not need to gather firewood in the fields or cut wood from trees in the forests, because those weapons will be all the firewood \add that they will need\add*. And they will take valuable things from those who took valuable things from them, and steal things from people who stole things from them. That is what I, Yahweh the Lord, declare will happen.

\v 9 The ones living in the cities of Israel will go out and burn the weapons, small shields, large shields, bows, arrows, the clubs and spears; they will burn them with fire for seven years.
\v 10 They will not gather wood from the fields or cut down the forests, since they will burn the weapons; they will take from those who took from them; they will plunder those who plundered them—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.
