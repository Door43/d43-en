===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh gives Ezekiel his message to Gog.

  * **son of man** - "son of a human being" or "son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01|2:1]]. AT: "mortal person" or "human"
  * **Behold!** - This tells the reader to pay special attention to what follows. AT: "Look!" or "Listen!" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you!"
  * **I am against you** - "I am your enemy" 
  * **chief of Meshech and Tubal** - Some modern versions interpret the Hebrew expression as "prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal." This is another title for Gog. See how you translated these names in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:38:01|38:2-3]]. AT: "who is the prince of Meshech and Tubal" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **I will turn you and lead you on** - God speaks of leading Gog as if Gog was an animal. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **bring you up** - God speaks of bringing Gog "up" to Israel because it was located in the mountains. 
  * **I will knock your bow out of your left hand and make the arrows fall from your right hand.** - Knocking Gog's bow and arrows out of his hands is spoken of as if God is destroying Gog's military power. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
