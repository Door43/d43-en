===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Gog.
  * **I will make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel** - AT: "I will make my people, Israel, know my holy name." The people of Israel will have a clearer understanding of character of Yahweh. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Behold!** - Alternate translation: "Look!" or "Listen!" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you!"
