\v 4 You and all the soldiers that are with you will die on the mountains of Israel. I will give your corpses to be food for the birds that eat dead flesh, and to the wild animals.
\v 5 You will die in the open fields. \add That will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh the Lord, \add have said that it will happen\add*.
\v 6 I will cause many fires to burn in Magog and to all those who live safely in the areas along their coasts, and they will know that it is I, Yahweh, \add who have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*.'

\v 5 You will die in the open fields. This will certainly happen because I, Yahweh the Lord, have said that it will happen.
\v 6 I will cause many fires to burn in Magog and to all those who live safely in the areas along their coasts, and they will know that it is I, Yahweh, who have the power to do what I say that I will do.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 You will fall dead on the mountains of Israel—you and all your troops and the soldiers who are with you. I will give you to the birds of prey and the wild beasts of the fields for food.
\v 5 You will fall dead on the surface of the field, for I myself declare it—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration.
\v 6 Then I will send out fire on Magog and on those living in safety on the coasts, and they will know that I am Yahweh.
