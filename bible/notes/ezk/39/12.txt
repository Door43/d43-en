===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues to tell Ezekiel what will happen to Gog.

  * **seven months** - "7 months." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **the house of Israel** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:01|3:1]]. AT: "the Israelites" or "the Israelite people group" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **will bury them in order to purify the land** - In Jewish law, a dead body defiled anything it touched and made it "unclean." Burying these bodies is spoken of as cleansing or purifying the land. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **bury them** - "bury the soldiers of Gog's army"
  * **this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]]. AT: "this is what the Lord Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
