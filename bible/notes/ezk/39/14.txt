\v 14 And they shall set apart men of continual employment, that shall pass through the land, and, with them that pass through,
those that bury them that remain upon the face of the land, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall they search.
\v 15 And they that pass through the land shall pass through; and when any sees a man’s bone, then shall he set up a sign by
it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-gog.
\v 16 And Hamonah shall also be the name of a city. Thus shall they cleanse the land.
