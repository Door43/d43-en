\v 28 The Israelite people will know that I, Yahweh, have done this. They will know that because I forced them to go to other countries, and then I gathered them together in their own country. I will not leave any of them in those countries.
\v 29 I will no longer turn away from them; I will give my Spirit to the Israelite people. This will certainly happen because I, Yahweh the Lord, have said it."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues to give Ezekiel a message about what will happen to Israel.
 
  * **I sent them into captivity ... I will gather them back to their land** - At the time when Ezekiel wrote, Israel was still in captivity in Babylon. 
  * **I will no longer hide my face from them** - Here "no longer hide my face" is an idiom that means Yahweh will not continue to abandon Israel to exile in Babylon. AT: "I will no longer abandon them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **when I pour out my Spirit on the house of Israel** - Here to give the Spirit abundantly is spoken of as to "pour out" the Spirit. AT: "when I generously give my Spirit to the house of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the house of Israel** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:01|3:1]]. AT: "the Israelites" or "the Israelite people group" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]]. AT: "this is what the Lord Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
