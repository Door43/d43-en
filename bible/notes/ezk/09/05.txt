<usfm>
\v 5 While I was listening, he said to the other six men, "Follow the man wearing the white robe, and kill people. Do not pity them or act mercifully toward them.
\v 6 Slaughter old men, young men and women, older women and children, but do not harm any of those who have that mark on their forehead. Start at my temple." So they began by killing the elders who were \add worshiping idols\add* in front of the temple.

\v 5 Then he spoke to the others within my hearing, "Pass through the city after him and kill. Do not let your eyes have compassion, and do not spare
\v 6 either old man, young man, virgin, little children or women. Kill all of them! But do not approach anyone who has the mark on his head. Begin at my sanctuary!" So they began with the elders who were in front of the house.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **he spoke to the others within my hearing** - The word "others" refers to the guards ([[:en:bible:notes:ezk:09:01|9:1]]).
  * **Do not let your eyes have compassion** - The word "eyes" is a metonym for what people feel. AT: "Do not have compassion on the people you see" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **do not spare** - "do not refrain from killing"
  * **mark on his head** - These were the people who groaned about the abominations happening in Jerusalem. See how you translated "mark" in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:09:03|9:4]].
  * **Begin at my sanctuary** - You may need to make explicit what the people are to begin to do at the sanctuary. AT: "Begin to kill the ones who do not have the mark at my sanctuary" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the elders** - Possible meanings are 1) the "seventy elders of the house of Israel" ([[:en:bible:notes:ezk:08:10|8:11]]) or 2) any "old man" (see the beginning of the verse).
