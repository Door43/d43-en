God continuing to speak to the guards judging the people of Israel.

  * **struck the city**  - The word "struck" means to be hit with something.  Here it's used to say the city was hit with violence or attacked suddenly. Alternate translation: "attacked the city" 
  * **And as they were striking it**  - "And as they were attacking it"
  * **fell on my face**  - This phrase is means that Ezekiel dropped to his knees and bowed his head to the ground in worship. (See: [[en:ta:translate:idiom]])  See how this is translated in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:03:22|3:23]]
  * **Alas, Lord Yahweh**  - The word "alas" is used to show that Ezekiel is very troubled by what the Lord has told him. The word in Hebrew is what someone would yell if they were surprised by something painful.  See how this is translated in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:04:14|4:14]]
  * **in the outpour of your wrath**  - God is using the terms "outpour" to compare his acting in anger with pouring out water. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor|Metaphor]])
