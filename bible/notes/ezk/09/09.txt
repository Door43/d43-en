====== Ezekiel 09:9-11 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 He replied, "The sins of the people \f + \ft metonymy \f* of Israel and Judah are extremely great. People are murdered \f + \ft metonymy \f* everywhere \add in this country\add*, and this city is full of people who act unjustly. They say, 'Yahweh has abandoned this country, and he does not see \add what we are doing\add*.'
\v 10 So I will not pity them or act mercifully toward them. I will do to them the evil things that they have done to other people."
\p
\v 11 Then the man wearing the linen robe returned, saying, "I have done what you commanded me to do."

\v 9 He replied, "The sins of the people are numerous and severe! There is murder everywhere in this country, and this city is full of people who act unjustly. They say, 'Yahweh has abandoned this country, and he does not see what we are doing.'
\v 10 So I will not pity them or act mercifully toward them. I will do to them the evil things that they have done to other people."
\p
\v 11 Then the man wearing the linen robe returned, saying, "I have done what you commanded me to do."

\p
\v 9 He said to me, "The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great. The land is full of blood and the city full of perversions, since they say, 'Yahweh has forgotten the land,' and 'Yahweh does not see!'
\v 10 So then, my eye will not look with compassion, and I will not spare them. I will instead bring it all on their heads."
\v 11 And behold! The man dressed in linen who had the scribe's equipment by his side came back. He reported and said, "I have done all that you have commanded."
