\v 21 For I will summon a sword against him on all my mountains'—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration; 'Each man’s sword will be against his brother.
\v 22 And I will judge them with plague, blood, flooding rains, and hailstones of fire. I will bring rains of brimstone upon him and upon his troops and the many people with him.
\v 23 For I will show my greatness and my holiness and I will make myself known in the eyes of the many nations, and they will know that I am Yahweh!’"
