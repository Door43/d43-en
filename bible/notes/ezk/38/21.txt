===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message about Gog.
 
  * **I will summon a sword against him** - Here "sword" refers to a military attack. AT: "I will cause fighting to happen in his midst" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **on all my mountains** - This refers to the land of Israel. AT: "on all the mountains of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **each man's sword will be against his brother** - Here "sword" represents battle. AT: "all of his soldiers will fight each other" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **his brother** - "his fellow soldier"
  * **by plague and blood** - Here "blood" refers to injury and death when blood is shed. AT: "by causing them to be sick and to be wounded or killed in battle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **overflowing rain and hailstones and burning sulfur I will rain down upon him** - It may be helpful to change the order of this sentence. AT: "I will rain down overflowing rain and hailstones and burning sulfur upon him"
  * **hailstones** - ice that falls out of the sky
  * **show my greatness and my holiness** - The abstract nouns "greatness" and "holiness" can be stated as adjectives. AT: "show that I am great and holy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **I will make myself known in the eyes of the many nations** - Here "eyes" refers to sight, which is a metonym for understanding. AT: "I will cause many nations to understand who I am" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **know that I am Yahweh** - When Yahweh says that people will know that he is Yahweh, he is implying that they will know that he is the one true God who has supreme authority and power. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:06:06|6:7]]. AT: "understand that I am Yahweh, the one true God" or "realize that I, Yahweh, have supreme power and authority" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
