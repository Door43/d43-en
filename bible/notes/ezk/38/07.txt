\v 7 Get ready! Yes, ready yourself and your companies assembled with you, and be a watchman for them.
\v 8 You will be visited after many days, at the end of some years you will go to a land recovered from sword, gathered from many peoples—unto the mountains of Israel that has been a continuous ruin. But it will be brought out of the peoples and they will dwell securely, all of them!
