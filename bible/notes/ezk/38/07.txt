\v 7 Tell Gog this: 'Get ready, and be prepared to be the commander of all those soldiers.
\v 8 At some future time, I will command you to lead those armies to attack Israel, a country whose buildings have been rebuilt after they were destroyed in wars. I will have brought their people back from many nations to live again on the hills of Israel, where no one had been living for long time. I will bring the Israelites back from other lands, and they will be living peacefully.
\v 9 You and all those armies from many nations will go up to Israel, advancing like a great storm. Your army will be like a huge cloud that covers the land.

\v 7 Get ready! Yes, prepare yourself and your troops assembled with you, and be their commander.
\v 8 You will be called after many days, and after some years you will go to a land that has recovered from the sword and that has been gathered from many peoples, gathered back to the mountains of Israel that had been a continuous ruin. But the land's people will be brought out of the peoples, and they will live in safety, all of them!

\v 9 So you will go up as a storm goes; you will be like a cloud covering the land, you and all your troops, all the many soldiers with you.
