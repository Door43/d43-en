<usfm>
\v 14 Therefore, you human, prophesy about Gog and say to him, 'This is what Yahweh the Lord says: At that time, when my people of Israel are living safely, you will certainly think about that.
\v 15 So you will come from your place far north \add of Israel\add*, with the armies of many other nations, all riding horses, a huge army.
\v 16 You will march toward my Israelite people, and your soldiers will cover the land like a huge cloud. Gog, I will bring your army to attack the country that belongs to me, but \add what I do\add* for you will show the people of other nations that I am holy.

\v 14 Therefore, Son of man, take my message about Gog and say to him, 'This is what the Lord Yahweh says: At that time, when my people of Israel are living safely, you will certainly think about them.
\v 15 You will come from your place far north of Israel, with the armies of many other nations, all riding horses, a huge army.
\v 16 You will march toward my Israelite people, and your soldiers will cover the land like a huge cloud. Gog, I will bring your army to attack the country that belongs to me, but what I will do to you will show the people of other nations that I am holy.

\v 14 Therefore prophesy, Son of man, and say to Gog, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this:
On that day, when my people Israel are living securely, will you not learn about them?

\v 15 You will come from your place far away in the north with a great army,
all of them riding on horses, a great company, a large army?

\v 16 And you will attack my people Israel like a cloud that covers the land. It will happen that in the coming days I will bring you against my land, so the nations might know me when Gog sees my holiness.’

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Gog.
  * **On that day...learn about them** - Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that Gog will indeed hear about the people living in Israel. AT: "On that day, when my people Israel are living securely, you will know about them." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **might recognize me** - "might know me" or "might know who I am"
