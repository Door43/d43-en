\v 10 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: it will be in that day,
\q Words will arise in your hearts, and you will devise wicked plans.
\q
\v 11 Then you will say, ‘I will go up to the open land; I will go to the quiet people dwelling in security,
\q All of them dwelling where there is no walls or bars, and there is no gates with them;
\q
\v 12 To seize spoils and to steal plunder, in order to turn your hand against the ruins that are inhabited,
\q And against the people gathered from the nations, working livestock and property, dwelling in the navel of the earth!’
