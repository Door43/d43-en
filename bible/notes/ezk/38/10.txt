\v 10 But this is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say: On that day, you will plan to do something very evil.
\v 11 You will say this to yourself: "My army will invade a country where the villages do not have walls around them. We will attack people who are peaceful and think that no one will harm them. Their towns and villages do not have walls with gates and bars.
\v 12 So it will be easy for us to attack these people. They are people who come back together from many countries where they had lived for many years, people who now live safely in their land with all their livestock and other possessions. They are living in the country that is in the middle of the most important countries  in the world. Our soldiers will take away all their valuable possessions."

\v 10 The Lord Yahweh says this: it will happen on that day that plans will form in your hearts, and you will devise wicked schemes.

\v 11 Then you will say, ‘I will go up to the open land; I will go to the quiet people living in safety, all of them living where there are no walls or bars, and where there are no city gates.

\v 12 I will capture booty and steal plunder, in order to bring my hand against the ruins that are newly inhabited, and against the people gathered from the nations, people who are gaining livestock and property, and who are living at the center of the earth.’
