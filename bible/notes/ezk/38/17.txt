\v 17 The Lord Yahweh says this: 'Are you not the one of whom I spoke in former days by the hand of my servants, the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in their own time for years that I would bring you against them?

\v 18 So it will come to be in that day when Gog attacks the land of Israel.' This is the Lord Yahwehâ€™s declaration: 'My fury will arise in my nostrils!

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Gog.
  * **Are you not the one of whom...them** - Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that he was the one who brought Gog to the land of Israel. AT: "You are the one of whom...them." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **of whom I spoke** - "that I spoke about"
  * **against them** - "against the people of Israel"
