\v 17 The Lord Yahweh says this: Are you not the one of whom I spoke in former days by the hand of my servants, the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in their own time for years that I would bring you against them?

\v 18 So it will come to be in that day when Gog attacks the land of Israel.' This is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration: 'My fury will arise in my nostrils!
