===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 In this city men uncover the nakedness of their father. Within the city they have violated unclean women during their menstrual period.
\v 11 Men who commit abominations with their neighbors' wives, and men who make their own daughters-in-law shamefully unclean; men who abuse their own sisters—daughters of their own fathers—all these are among you.
\v 12 These men take bribes among you in order to pour out blood. You have taken interest and gained too much profit, you have damaged your neighbors through oppression, and you have forgotten me—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration.
