<usfm>
\v 10 The nakedness of a father is revealed within you. They have abused the unclean woman within you during her impurity.
\v 11 Men who commit abominations with their neighbors' wives, and men who make their own daughters-in-law shamefully unclean; men who abuse their own sisters—daughters of their own fathers—all these are among you.
\v 12 These men take bribes among you in order to pour out blood. You have taken interest and gained too much profit, you have damaged your neighbors through oppression, and you have forgotten me—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration.
