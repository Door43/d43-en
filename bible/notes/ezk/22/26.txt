====== Ezekiel 22:26-28 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 26 Their priests disobey my laws and disrespect my sacred things by saying that there is no difference between things that are sacred and those that are not sacred, and by ignoring my laws about honoring the Sabbath days. As a resut, they no longer honor me.
\v 27 Their officials are like \f + \ft simile \f* wolves that tear apart the animals that they have killed: they murder people \f + \ft doublet \f* in order to get their money.
\v 28 Their prophets try to cover up \f + \ft metaphor \f*\f + \ft Or: say that it is all right to commit \f*those sins by falsely saying they have received visions \add from God\add*, and giving false messages. They say, 'This is what Yahweh the Lord says' when I have said nothing to them.

<usfm>
\v 26 Her priests do violence to my law, and they profane my holy things. They do not distinguish between holy things and profane things, and do not teach the difference between the unclean and the clean. They hide their eyes from my Sabbaths so that I am profaned in their midst!
\v 27 Her princes within her are like wolves tearing apart their victims. They pour out blood and destroy life, to make a profit dishonestly.
\v 28 And her prophets have painted them over with whitewash; they see false visions and predict falsehoods to them. they say "The Lord Yahweh says this" when Yahweh has not spoken!
