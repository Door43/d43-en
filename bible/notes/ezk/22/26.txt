\v 26 Their priests disobey my laws and disrespect my sacred things by saying that there is no difference between things that are sacred and those that are not sacred, and by ignoring my laws about honoring the Sabbath days. As a resut, they no longer honor me.
\v 27 Their officials are like \f + \ft simile \f* wolves that tear apart the animals that they have killed: they murder people \f + \ft doublet \f* in order to get their money.
\v 28 Their prophets try to cover up \f + \ft metaphor \f*\f + \ft Or: say that it is all right to commit \f*those sins by falsely saying they have received visions \add from God\add*, and giving false messages. They say, 'This is what Yahweh the Lord says' when I have said nothing to them.

\v 26 Her priests have done violence to my law, and have profaned my holy things: they have made no distinction between the
holy and the common, neither have they caused men to discern between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my
sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.
\v 27 Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood,
and to destroy souls, that they may get dishonest gain.
\v 28 And her prophets have daubed for them with untempered mortar, seeing false visions, and divining lies to
them, saying, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, when Jehovah has not spoken.
