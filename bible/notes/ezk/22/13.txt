\v 13 "So look! With my hand I have struck the dishonest gain that you have made, and the bloodshed that is in your midst.
\v 14 Will your heart stand, will your hands be strong on the days when I myself will deal with you? I, Yahweh, am declaring this, and I will do it.
\v 15 So I will scatter you among the nations and disperse you through the lands. In this way, I will purge your uncleanness from you.
\v 16 So you will become unclean in the eyes of the nations. Then you will know that I am Yahweh!"
