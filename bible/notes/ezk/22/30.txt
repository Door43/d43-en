<usfm>
\v 30 So I searched for a man from them who would build up a wall and who would stand before me in its breach for the land so I would not destroy it, but I found no one.
\v 31 So I will pour out my indignation upon them! I will finish them with the fire of my indignation and set their way on their own heads—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration.'"

  * **the fire of my indignation** - judgment of God is like fire because it is very intense. 
  * **set their way on their own heads** - Setting something on a person's head refers to making them carry it or take responsibility for it. AT: "make them take responsibility for what they have done" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
