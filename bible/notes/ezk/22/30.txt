<usfm>
\v 30 So I searched for a man from them who would build up a wall and who would stand before me in its breach for the land so I would not destroy it, but I found no one.
\v 31 So I will pour out my indignation upon them! I will finish them with the fire of my indignation and set their way on their own heads.’ This is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.”

===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh compares the leaders of Jerusalem to a wall and himself to an invading army. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

    * **a man from them who would build up a wall** - a leader putting himself between Yahweh and the people by taking responsibility to lead them back into righteousness. AT: "a man from them who would act like a wall" 
    * **stand in the breach** - to stand in the place the wall has a gap or has been broken. A leader defending the people of Israel is like a warrior defending a city in battle. 
    * **pour out my indignation upon them!** - judgement that can be poured out like water from a bowl. 
    * **the fire of my indignation** - judgement of God is like fire because it is very intense. 
    * **set their way upon their own heads** - Setting something on a person's head refers to making them carry it or take responsibility for it. AT: "make them take responsibility for what they have done" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
