\v 20 As a collection of silver and bronze, iron, lead and tin in the midst of the furnace to have fire blown against it, I will melt you. So I will gather you in my 
wrath and fury, and I will lay you there and, to blow the fire upon it, to
melt it; so will I gather you in mine anger and in my wrath, and I will lay you there and pour you out.
\v 21 So I will gather you and blow against you with the fire of my wrath so you will be poured out in her midst.
\v 22 As melting silver in the midst of the furnace, so you will be melted down in its midst and you will know that I, Yahweh, have poured our my fury against you!”
