\v 20 As a collection of silver and bronze, iron, lead and tin in the midst of the furnace must have fire blown against it, I will melt you. So I will gather you in my 
wrath and fury. I will put you there and blow the fire on it to
melt it; so will I gather you in my anger and in my wrath, and I will put you there and pour you out.
\v 21 So I will gather you and blow against you with the fire of my wrath so that you will be poured out in her midst.
\v 22 As melting silver in the middle of a furnace, you will be melted down in its midst, and you will know that I, Yahweh, have poured out my fury against you!'‚Äù
