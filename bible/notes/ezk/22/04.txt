\v 4 You have become guilty by doing both of those things \f + \ft doublet \f*. You have brought to an end your time to remain alive \f + \ft doublet \f*. Therefore I will cause you to become a group whom the people of other nations will scorn; they will all laugh at you \f + \ft doublet \f*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 You have become guilty by murdering innocent people. You have made it impossible for me to accept you, by making idols for yourselves. You are bringing your time to an end. Therefore I will cause the other people groups to laugh at you and mock you.
\v 5 People in countries that are near you and people who live far from you will make fun of you, because your city is full of confusion, and because you have made it impossible for me, your own God, to accept you.

<usfm>
\v 4 You are guilty by the blood that you have poured out, and are made unclean by the idols that you have made! For you have drawn your days close and approached your final years. Therefore I will make you a reproach to the nations and a derision in the sight of every land.
\v 5 Both those who are near and those who are far away from you will mock you, you unclean city, with the reputation known everywhere as being full of confusion!
