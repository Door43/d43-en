===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 Yahweh also said to me,
\v 18 "You human, your Israelite people \f + \ft metonymy \f* have become \add useless\add* to me. They are like \f + \ft metaphor \f* dross\f + \ft Or: slag \f* to me. They are like \f + \ft simile \f* the \add useless\add* copper, tin, iron, and lead that remains after silver is melted in a \add very hot\add* furnace
\v 19 Therefore, this is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say: Because you have all become like dross\f + \ft Or: slag \f*, I will gather you in Jerusalem.

\v 17 Yahweh then said to me,
\v 18 "Son of man, your Israelite people have become useless to me. They are like dross to me. They are like the useless copper, tin, iron, and lead that remains after silver is melted in a very hot furnace
\v 19 Therefore, this is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say: Because you have all become like dross, I will gather you in Jerusalem.

\v 17 Next the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
\v 18 "Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to me. All of them are the leftovers of bronze and tin, and iron and lead in your midst. They will be like the dross of silver in your furnace.
\v 19 Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this, 'Because all of you have become like dross, therefore, behold! I am about to gather you into the center of Jerusalem.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the word of Yahweh came** - This is an idiom that is used to introduce something that God told his prophets or his people. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:16|3:16]]. AT: "Yahweh spoke this message" or "Yahweh spoke these words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **the house of Israel has** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:01|3:1]]. AT: "the Israelites have" or "the Israelite people group has" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **has become dross to me** - Dross is the impurities that are left over after silver or gold has been purified in a furnace. Here Yahweh speaks of the people being worthless to him as if they were dross. AT: "has become as worthless to me as dross" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **All of them are the leftovers of bronze and tin ... like the dross of silver in your furnace** - Yahweh continues to speaks about how the people have become worthless to him as if they were dross. AT: "All of them are as worthless as the leftover of bronze and tin, and iron and lead that remain after you melt silver in the furnace" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **behold** - "listen." The word "behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.
