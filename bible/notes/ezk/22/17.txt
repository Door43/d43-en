\v 17 Next the word of Yahweh came to me and said, 
\v 18 “Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to me. All of them are the leftovers of bronze and tin, and iron and lead in your midst. They will be like the dross of 
silver in your furnace.
\v 19 Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this: ‘Because all of you have become like dross, therefore behold! I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The Word of Yahweh came to me and said** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:16|3:16]].
  * **dross**  - This word means the worthless material that comes out of a metal when it is purified. (See: Metaphor)
  * **All of them are bronze and tin, and iron and lead in your midst. They will be like the dross of silver in your furnace.**  - Here, the idea that the people of Israel are like dross in a purification process is repeated for emphasis. Bronze, tin, iron, and lead are all different kinds of metals which are being removed from the more valuable metal silver. 
  * **behold!**  - The word “behold” here adds emphasis to what follows. It can also be translated as “Indeed.”
