\v 17 Next the word of Yahweh came to me and said, 
\v 18 “Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to me. All of them are the leftovers of bronze and tin, and iron and lead in your midst. They will be like the dross of 
silver in your furnace.
\v 19 Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this: ‘Because all of you have become like dross, therefore behold! I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.
