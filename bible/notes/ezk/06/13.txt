\v 13 Some of your people's corpses will lie among their idols around their altars, on every high hilltop and on all the mountaintops, under every big tree—at all the places where they burned incense to honor their idols. When this happens you will realize that I, Yahweh, have done this.
\v 14 For I will strike with my hand and cause every area in which they live in your country to become an empty wasteland, from the desert in the far south to the town of Diblah in the far north. Then they will realize that I, Yahweh, have done this.'"

\v 13 Then you will know that I am Yahweh, when their dead are in your midst, their idols surrounding their altars on every high hill, on all the mountain peaks,
and under every flourishing tree and thick oak—the places where they offered soothing fragrances to all their idols!
\v 14 I will display my power and make the land desolate and a waste, from the wilderness to Diblah, throughout all the places where they live. Then they will know that I am Yahweh!'"

===== Translation Notes: =====
These are Yahweh's words to the people of Israel.

  * **know that I am Yahweh** - Possible meanings are 1) "understand who I, Yahweh, am" or 2) "understand that I am Yahweh, the one true God" or 3) "realize that I, Yahweh, have done this" (UDB).
  * **when their dead are in your midst** - "when the bodies of those who have been killed by the enemy are among you"
  * **under every flourishing tree and thick oak** - The word "flourishing" describes something that is healthy and growing. An oak is a type of large tree. It is described as "thick" because it is large and old.  
  * **stretch out my arm** - "strike them with my hand" (UDB). The word "arm" refers to God's power. AT: "cause them harm with my power" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Diblah** - Some early texts say Riblah. Riblah was the name of a city in the north. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
