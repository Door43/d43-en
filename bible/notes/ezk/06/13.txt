\v 13 Some of your people's corpses will lie among their idols around their altars, on every high hilltop and on all the mountaintops, under every big tree —at all the places where they burned incense to honor their idols. When this happens you will realize that I, Yahweh, have done this.
\v 14 For I will stretch out my arm and cause every area in which they live in your country to become an empty wasteland, from the desert in the far south to Diblah town in the far north. Then they will realize that I, Yahweh, have the power to do the things that I say that I will do.'"

\v 13 Then you will know that I am Yahweh, when their dead are in your midst, their idols surrounding their altars on every high hill, on all the mountain peaks,
and under every flourishing tree and thick oak--the places where they offered soothing fragrances to all their idols!
\v 14 I will strike them with my hand and make the land desolate and a waste, from the wilderness to Diblah, throughout all their dwelling places.
Then they will know that I am Yahweh!"

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Then you will know that I am Yahweh** - The word "you" refers to Ezekiel. God is saying to Ezekiel that when he sees that he has judged those who worshiped idols and destroyed their altars, he will understand this was done through his power and because He alone is God.
  * **when their dead are in your midst** - "when the bodies of those who have been killed by the enemy are among you"
  * **their idols** - The word "their" refers to the people of Israel who had worshiped idols. 
  * **on every high hill, on all the mountain peaks,
and under every flourishing tree and thick oak** - These are all the places Ezekiel will find the bodies of the people of Israel. They will be in all the places they had worshiped idols.
  * **under every flourishing tree and thick oak** - The word "flourishing" describes something that is healthy and growing. An oak is a type of large tree. It is described as "thick" because it is large and old.  
  * **strike them with my hand** - "cause them harm with my hand". The word hand is used to refer to God's power. Alternate translation: "cause them harm with my power" (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
  * **make the land desolate and a waste, from the wilderness to Diblah** - Possible meanings for Diblah: 1) name of a city or a place of abundance or "fig cake" in the original language. This could mean that God will destroy the whole country, from the places without food and water to the places where they eat cakes made with fruit. "make the land useless with no people, from places where no one lives to places where they eat cakes made with fruit" (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]]) (See: [[en:ta:translate:translatenames]])
  * **throughout all their dwelling places** - "Everywhere the people of Israel live"
