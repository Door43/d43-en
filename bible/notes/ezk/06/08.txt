\v 9 When that happens, in those nations to which you have been forced to go, those of you who have escaped death will think about me. You will remember that I was very grieved because you turned away from me, because you were disloyal to me, and because you desired to worship your idols. You will hate yourselves because of the evil and detestable things that you have done.
\v 10 And you will realize that I, Yahweh, have punished you. You will realize that when I threatened to punish you, I surely intended to do that.

\v 8 But I will preserve a remnant among you, and there will be some who escape the sword among the nations, when you are scattered
throughout the countries.
\v 9 Then those who escape will think of me among the nations where they will be held captive, that I was grieved by their
promiscuous heart that turned away from me, and by their eyes that whored after their idols. Then they will show loathing on their face
for the wickedness which they have committed with all their abominations.
\v 10 So they will know that I am Yahweh. It was for a reason that I said I would bring this evil to them.

===== Translation Notes: =====

These are Yahweh's words to the people of Israel.

    * **some who escape the sword** - "some who are not killed in battle." The sword represents being killed in war.  (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **when you are scattered throughout the countries** - "when you go live in different countries" 
    * **I was grieved** - "I was saddened"
    * **by their promiscuous heart that turned away from me** -  A promiscuous person is not faithful to the one they married but has many sexual partners. Alternate translations: "by their unfaithful heart that turned away from me" or "because they were like a promiscuous wife and left me" (See:[[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **and by their eyes that prostituted after their idols** - The people of Israel were like a prostitute because they were worshiping idols rather than God. Alternate translations: "and by their eyes that looked to idols and worshiped them" or "because they were like a prostitute and worship their idols"  (See:[[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **they will show loathing on their face for the wickedness which they have committed** - Possible meanings are  1) "they will hate themselves because of the wicked things they did" or 2) "they will hate the wicked things that they did."
