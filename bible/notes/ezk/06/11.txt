\v 11 So this is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say to you, Ezekiel: Slap your hands and stamp your feet and cry out to show that you are distressed, and groan about what will happen to the Israelite people because of all their wicked and detestable behavior. They will be killed by their enemies' swords, they will die from hunger, and they will die from plagues.
\v 12 Those who are far from Jerusalem will die from plagues, those who are close to Jerusalem will be killed by their enemies' swords. Those who are still alive after that will die from hunger. That is how I will punish them.

\v 11 The Lord Yahweh says this: Clap your hands and stomp your foot! Say, 'Alas!' because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! For they will fall by sword, famine, and plague.
\v 12 The one far away will die by plague, and the one who is near will fall by the sword. Those who remain and survive will die by famine. In this way I will accomplish my fury against them.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to speak to Ezekiel.

  * **The Lord Yahweh says this** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to remind Ezekiel and the people that what he is saying is important. AT: "I, the Lord Yahweh, say this" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **Lord Yahweh** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:04|2:4]]. 
  * **Clap your hands and stomp your foot** - Ezekiel was to do this symbolic action to get the people's attention. This was not applause. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_symlanguage]])
  * **Alas** - This word is spoken by those who see people doing bad things and realize that bad things will happen to the evildoers as a result. If your language has a similar word, you might want to use it here.
  * **the house of Israel** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:01|3:1]]. AT: "the Israelites" or "the Israelite people group" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **they will fall by sword, famine, and plague.** - To "fall" is a euphemism for to "die." The sword is a metonym for dying in war. AT: "they will die in war, they will starve to death, and they will die of disease" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I will accomplish my fury against them** - "I will satisfy my anger against them" or "I will punish them until I am no longer angry"
