\v 11 So this is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say to you, Ezekiel: Slap your hands and stamp your feet and cry out to show that you are distressed, and groan about what will happen to the Israelite people because of all their wicked and detestable behavior. They will be killed by their enemies' swords, they will die from hunger, and they will die from plagues.
\v 12 Those who are far from Jerusalem will die from plagues, those who are close to Jerusalem will be killed by their enemies' swords. Those who are still alive after that will die from hunger. That is how I will punish them.

\v 11 The Lord Yahweh says this: Clap your hands and stomp your foot! Say, "Alas!" because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! For they will fall by sword, famine, and plague.
\v 12 The one far away will die by plague, and the one who is near will fall by the sword. Those who remain and survive will die by famine; in this way I will accomplish my fury against them.

  * **Alas** - The word "Alas" is used to express sadness.
  * **house of Israel** - "the people of Israel"
  * **For they will fall by sword, famine, and plague.** - "For they will die by sword, famine, and plague." "Sword", "famine", and "plague" are the different ways that they will die. The word "sword" represents war. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
