<usfm>
\v 1 This is also what I, Yahweh the Lord, declare: The east gateway of the inner courtyard must be shut during the six days in which you work each week, but on the Sabbath days and on the days when there is a new moon, the gateway must remain open.
\v 2 The king must enter the courtyard through the entry room of the gateway, and stand alongside the gatepost. Then the priests must sacrifice the animal that will be completely burned \add on the altar\add*, and also his offering to maintain fellowship with Yahweh. The king must worship Yahweh at the entrance of the gateway, and then he must go out. But the gateway will not be shut until that evening.

\v 1 The Lord Yahweh says this: The gate of the inner courtyard, facing east, will be shut for the six days of work, but on the Sabbath it will be opened, and on the day of the new moon it will be opened.
\v 2 The prince will enter the outer courtyard by the way of the gate and its portico from outside, and he will stand before the doorposts of the inner gate while the priests perform his burnt offering and peace offering.
