\v 1 This is also what I, Yahweh the Lord, declare: The east gateway of the inner courtyard must be shut during the six days in which you work each week, but on the Sabbath days and on the days when there is a new moon, the gateway must remain open.
\v 2 The king must enter the courtyard through the entry room of the gateway, and stand alongside the gatepost. Then the priests must sacrifice the animal that will be completely burned \add on the altar\add*, and also his offering to maintain fellowship with Yahweh.

\v 2 The prince will enter the outer courtyard by the way of the gate and its portico from outside, and he will stand before the doorposts of the inner gate while the priests perform his burnt offering and peace offering.
