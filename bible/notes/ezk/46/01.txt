\v 1 This is also what I, Yahweh the Lord, declare: The east gateway of the inner courtyard must be shut during the six days in which you work each week, but on the Sabbath days and on the days when there is a new moon, the gateway must remain open.
\v 2 The king must enter the courtyard through the entry room of the gateway, and stand alongside the gatepost. Then the priests must sacrifice the animal that will be completely burned \add on the altar\add*, and also his offering to maintain fellowship with Yahweh. The king must worship Yahweh at the entrance of the gateway, and then he must go out. But the gateway will not be shut until that evening.

\c 46
\p
\v 1 Thus says the Lord Jehovah: The gate of the inner court that looks toward the east shall be shut the six working days;
but on the sabbath day it shall be opened, and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened.
\v 2 And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate; and the
priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace-offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he
shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.
