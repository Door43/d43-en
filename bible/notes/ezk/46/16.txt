====== Ezekiel 46:16-18 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 This is what I, Yahweh the Lord, declare: If the king gives some of his land to one of his sons, to belong to him permanently, it will then eventually permanently belong to his son's descendants.
\v 17 However, if he gives some of his land to one of his servants, the servant is allowed to keep that land until the Year of Celebration. Then the king will own it again. But if the king gives land to his sons, that land will belong to them permanently.
\v 18 The king must not take any land that the people own and force them to live somewhere else. The land that he gives to his sons must be from his own property, \add not from anyone else's property\add*, in order that none of my people will be separated from his own property.'~"

\v 17 However, if he gives some of his land to one of his servants, the servant is allowed to keep that land until the Year of Jubilee. Then the ruler must take possession of it again. But if the ruler gives land to his sons, that land will belong to them permanently.
\v 18 The ruler must not take any land that the people own and force them to live somewhere else. The land that he gives to his sons must be from his own property, not from anyone else's property, in order that none of my people will be separated from his own property.'"

\v 16 The Lord Yahweh says this: 'If the prince gives a gift to any of his sons, it is his inheritance. It will be the property of his sons, it is an inheritance.
\v 17 But if he gives a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants, then it will be that servant's until the year of liberty, and then it will return to the prince. His inheritance will certainly be for his sons.
\v 18 The prince will not take the people’s inheritance away from their own property; he must provide for his sons from his own property so that my people will not be scattered, each man from his own property.’”
