\v 19 Then, \add in the vision\add*, the man brought me through the entrance alongside the gateway to the sacred rooms on the north side, the rooms that belonged to the priests, and he showed me a place at the western end.
\v 20 He said to me, "This is the place where the priests will cook the meat of the offerings that people make because they failed to do what they promised Yahweh that they would do, and offerings to cause people to become acceptable to God, and where they will bake bread made with the flour brought as offerings. They will cook those things in their rooms in order to avoid bringing them into the outer courtyard \add to cook them there\add*, lest someone \add might be harmed by\add* touching them."

\v 19 Then he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers for the priests, which
looked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the hinder part westward.
\v 20 And he said to me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass-offering and the sin-offering,
and where they shall bake the grain offering; that they bring them not forth into the outer court, to sanctify the
people.
