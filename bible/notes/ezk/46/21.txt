\v 21 Then he brought me to the outer courtyard and he led me past the four corners of that courtyard, and I saw that in at every corner of the courtyard there was a another court.
\v 22 In the four corners of the outer courtyard there were four small courtyards, forty cubits in length and thirty in width. There the same dimensions for all four of the courtyards.
\f + \ft The Hebrew word translated here as \fqa small \fqa* is unclear. It is translated in this way by some ancient and some modern versions. However, other modern versions translate it differently. \f*
\v 23 There was a row made of stone all around the four of them, and cooking hearths were under the stone row.
