\v 9 But when the people of the land come before Yahweh at the appointed festivals, anyone entering through the north gate to worship must leave through the south gate; and anyone entering through the south gate must leave through the north gate. No one may turn back to the gate through which he entered, for he must go out straight ahead.
\v 10 And the prince must be in their midst; when they go in, he must go in, and when they leave, he must leave.
