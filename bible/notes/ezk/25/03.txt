\v 3 Say to the sons of Ammon, ‘Hear the word of the Lord Yahweh, thus says the Lord Yahweh: Because you have said, “Aha!” against my sanctuary when it was profaned and against the land of Israel when it was desolate, and against the house of Judah when they went into exile; 
\v 4 therefore behold! I am giving you to the sons of the east as a property and they will set up encampments against you and make their tents in you. They will eat your fruit and they will drink your milk!
\v 5 And I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels and the sons of Ammon a field for flocks, so you will know that I am Yahweh!
