\v 4 Therefore, I am going to allow an army of the people in the east to come and conquer you. They will set up their tents in your country and live there. They will eat the fruit from your fruit trees and drink the milk from your cattle.
\v 5 I will cause your capital city of Rabbah to become a pasture for camels, and the rest of Ammon, where your people are now living, to become only a resting place for sheep. Then you will know that I, Yahweh, have the power to do what I say that I will do.

\v 3 Say to the people of Ammon, ‘Hear the word of the Lord Yahweh. This is what the Lord Yahweh says: You have said, “Aha!” against my sanctuary when it was profaned, and against the land of Israel when it was desolate, and against the house of Judah when they went into exile. 
\v 4 Therefore behold! I am giving you to a people in the east as their possession; they will set up camp against you and make their tents in you. They will eat your fruit, and they will drink your milk!
\v 5 And I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels and the people of Ammon a field for flocks, so you will know that I am Yahweh!

Yahweh tells Ezekiel what to say to the people of Ammon.

  * **hear the word of the Lord Yahweh** - "Listen to this message from the Lord Yahweh"
  * **thus says the Lord Yahweh** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:05:05|5:5]].
  * **Because you have said, “Aha!” against** - The word "Aha" is a sound people make when they are happy about something. In this case the people were happy because bad things happened to Israel and Judah. Alternate translation: "Because you laughed at" or "Because you cheered against."

  * **behold** - This can be translated as “look” or “listen” or “pay attention to what I am about to tell you.”
  * **I am giving you to the sons of the east as a property** - "I will cause an army from a land that is east of you to come and conquer you"
  * **and they will set up encampments against you and make their tents in you** - This could be translated as a new sentence: "They will set up tents and live in your country."
  * **the sons of Ammon a field for flocks** - "and I will make the cities where the people of Ammon lived into a field for flocks"
  * **and the sons of Ammon a field for flocks** - Here "the sons of Amon" refers to the land that belonged to the people of Ammon. Alternate translation: "and I will make the rest of the land of Ammon a field for flocks." (See [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]] and [[en:ta:translate:ellipsis]])
