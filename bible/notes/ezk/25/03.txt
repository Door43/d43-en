\v 3 Say about them, 'This is what Yahweh the Lord says: You shouted joyfully when my temple in Jerusalem was destroyed, and when the country of Israel was ruined, and when the people of Judah were exiled to Babylon.
\v 4 Therefore, I am going to allow an army of the people in the east to come and conquer you. They will set up their tents in your country and live there. They will eat the fruit from your fruit trees and drink the milk from your cattle.
\v 5 I will cause your capital city of Rabbah to become a pasture for camels, and the rest of Ammon, where your people are now living, to become only a resting place for sheep. Then you will know that I, Yahweh, have the power to do what I say that I will do.

\v 3 Say to the people of Ammon, 'Hear the word of the Lord Yahweh. This is what the Lord Yahweh says: Because you said, "Aha!" over my sanctuary when it was profaned, and against the land of Israel when it was desolate, and against the house of Judah when they went into exile,
\v 4 therefore, behold, I am giving you to a people in the east as their possession. They will set up camp against you and set up their tents among you. They will eat your fruit and they will drink your milk.
\v 5 I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels and the people of Ammon a field for flocks. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh tells Ezekiel what to say to the people of Ammon.

  * **Hear the word of the Lord Yahweh** - "Listen to this message from the Lord Yahweh"
  * **you said, "Aha!"** - "you cheered." The word "Aha" is a sound people make when they are happy about something. In this case the people were happy because bad things happened to Israel and Judah. 
  * **over my sanctuary when it was profaned** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "against my sanctuary when the enemy army profaned it"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **against the land ... against the house** - "over the land ... over the house" 
  * **the house of Judah** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the descendants of Judah over many years. See how you translated these words in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:01|3:1]]. AT: "the Judah people group" or "the people of Judah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **behold** - "indeed." The word "behold" here adds emphasis to what follows.
  * **I am giving you to a people in the east as their possession** - This speaks of the enemy army conquering the land of Ammon and taking possession of the land and everything in it as if the enemy were taking the people of Ammon as their possession. It is not implied here that the enemy took the people of Ammon as slaves. AT: "I will cause an army from a land that is east of you to come and conquer you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **They will set up camp against you and set up their tents among you** - "They will set up tents and live in your country"
  * **They will eat your fruit and they will drink your milk** - It may be helpful to specify the source of the fruit and milk. AT: "They will eat the fruit from your trees and drink the milk from your cattle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the people of Ammon a field for flocks** - Here the phrase "the people of Ammon" refers to the land that belonged to the people of Ammon. Also the missing words at the beginning of this phrase may be added. AT: "I will make the rest of the land of Ammon a field for flocks" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **know that I am Yahweh** - When Yahweh says that people will know that he is Yahweh, he is implying that they will know that he is the one true God who has supreme authority and power. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:06:06|6:7]]. AT: "understand that I am Yahweh, the one true God" or "realize that I, Yahweh, have supreme power and authority" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
