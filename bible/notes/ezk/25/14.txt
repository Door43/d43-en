===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel** - Here the "hand" of Israel is a metonym for Israel's army. Yahweh speaks of taking revenge on the people of Edom as if his vengeance were like a sheet that he covered them with. AT: "I will use my people Israel to take revenge against the people of Edom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **they will do to Edom according to my anger and my fury** - "they will show Edom my anger and fury" or "they will punish Edom according to my anger and fury against the people of Edom"
  * **my anger and my fury** - The word "fury" means basically the same thing as and intensifies the word "anger." AT: "my furious anger" or "my extreme anger" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **they will know my vengeance** - The word "vengeance" may be expressed as a verb. AT: "the people of Edom will know that I have taken revenge against them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]]. AT: "this is what the Lord Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
