  * **the house of Judah** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the descendants of Judah over many years.

  * **I will make them ... from Teman to Dedan** - "I will make all of Edom ... from Teman to Dedan." These are two cities at opposite ends of Edom. This means that Yahweh will destroy all of Edom. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
