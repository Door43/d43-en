<usfm> \p \v 8 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Because Moab and Seir say, “Behold! The house of Judah is like every nation!” \v 9 Therefore behold! I will open the slopes of Moab from his cities on the borders—the splendor of Beth Jeshimoth, Baal-Meon, and Kiraiathaim— \v 10 to the children of the east who were against the sons of Ammon. And I will give them up like a property like the sons of Ammon will not be remembered among the nations. \v 11 So I will perform judgments against Moab and they will know that I am Yahweh! </usfm>
