\v 8 This is also what Yahweh the Lord says: "The people of Moab \add south of Ammon\add* and the people of Seir \add south of Moab despised Israel and\add* said, 'The people \f + \ft metonymy \f* of Israel have become \add as unimportant\add* as all the other nations!'
\v 9 Therefore, I will destroy the cities that protect the borders of Moab, starting at Beth-Jeshimoth, Baal-Meon, and Kiriathaim, the finest cities in Moab.
\v 10 I will enable people from the east to conquer Moab and also to conquer Ammon. As the result, just like \add I will cause that\add* Ammon will no longer be remembered by other nations,
\v 11 I will also punish the people of Moab. When that happens, people will know that I, Yahweh, \add have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*."

\v 8 The Lord Yahweh says this, 'Because Moab and Seir say, "Behold! The house of Judah is like every other nation."
\v 9 Therefore, behold! I will open the slopes of Moab, starting at his cities on the border—the splendor of Beth Jeshimoth, Baal Meon, and Kiriathaim—
\v 10 to the people of the east who have been against the people of Ammon. I will give them up as a possession so that the people of Ammon will not be remembered among the nations.
\v 11 So I will perform judgments against Moab, and they will know that I am Yahweh.'
