\v 15 The Lord Yahweh says this: "The Philistines have taken vengeance on Judah and destroyed her, because of very old hostility and contempt in their hearts."
\v 16 So this is what the Lord Yahweh says: Behold! I will reach out with my hand against the Philistines, and I will cut off the Kerethites and destroy the remnant who are along the sea coast!
\v 17 For I will take great vengeance against them with furious acts of punishment, so they will know that I am Yahweh, when I take my vengeance on them!
