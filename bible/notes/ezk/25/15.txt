\v 15 The Lord Yahweh says this, 'The Philistines have taken vengeance with malice and from within themselves they tried to destroy Judah again and again.
\v 16 So this is what the Lord Yahweh says: Behold! I will reach out with my hand against the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites and destroy the remnant who are along the sea coast!
\v 17 For I will take great vengeance against them with furious acts of punishment, so they will know that I am Yahweh, when I take my vengeance on them!'"
