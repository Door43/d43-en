\v 15 The Lord Yahweh says this: "Because of what the Philistines have done through vengeance when they took vengeance with disdain in their soul to destroy Judah with very old hostility"—
\v 16 therefore, this is what the Lord Yahweh says: Behold! I will reach out with my hand against the Philistines, and I will cut off the Kerethites and destroy the remnant who are along the sea coast!
\v 17 For I will take great vengeance against them with furious acts of punishment, so they will know that I am Yahweh, when I take my vengeance on them!”
