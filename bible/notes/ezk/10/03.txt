\v 3 The four winged creatures were standing on the south side of the temple when the man wearing the white robe entered. Then a cloud filled the inner courtyard of the temple.
\v 4 And the glory of Yahweh went up from directly over the winged creatures and stood over the doorway of the temple. It filled the entire temple with cloud and everything in the courtyard was bright because of Yahweh's glorious presence.
\v 5 I also heard the sound made by the wings of the winged creatures in the courtyard outside the temple. It was very loud, like the voice of Almighty God when he speaks.

\v 3 The cherubim stood on the right side of the house when the man went in, and a cloud filled the inner courtyard.
\v 4 The glory of Yahweh rose up from the cherubim and stood over the threshhold of the house; it filled the house with the 
cloud, and the courtyard was full of the brightness of Yahweh's glory.
\v 5 Then I heard the sound of the cherubim's wings in the outer courtyard, like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.
