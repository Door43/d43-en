\v 20 These were the living creatures that I had seen below the God of Israel by the Chebar Canal, so I knew that they were cherubim!
\v 21 They had four faces each and four wings each, and the likeness of human hands under their wings,
\v 22 and the likeness of their faces was like the faces that I had seen in the vision at the Chebar Canal, and each of them went straight ahead.
