\v 20 These were the living creatures that I had seen below the God of Israel by the Chebar canal, so I knew that they were cherubim!
\v 21 They had four faces each and four wings each, and the likeness of human hands under their wings;
\v 22 and the likeness of their faces was like the faces that I had seen in the vision at the Chebar canal, and each of them went straight ahead.
