\v 20 This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim.
\v 21 Every one had four faces, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.
\v 22 And as for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and
themselves; they went every one straight forward.
