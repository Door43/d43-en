\v 15 Then the winged creatures rose up. They were the same living creatures that I had seen alongside the Kebar River\f + \ft Or: Canal \f*.
\v 16 When the winged creatures moved, the wheels moved with them. When the winged creatures spread their wings to fly over the ground, the wheels did not leave them.
\v 17 When the winged creatures stopped, the wheels stopped. When the winged creatures started to fly, the wheels flew with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.

\v 15 Then the cherubim—these were the living creatures that I had seen by the river Chebar—rose up.
\v 16 Whenever the cherubim moved, the wheels would go beside them; and whenever the cherubim lifted up their wings to rise up
from the earth, the wheels did not turn. They still stayed beside them.
\v 17 When the cherubim stood still, the wheels stood still, and when they rose up the wheels rose up with them, for the Spirit of the 
living creature was in the wheels.
