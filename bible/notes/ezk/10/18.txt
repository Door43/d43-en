\v 18 Then the glory of Yahweh went out from over the threshold of the house and stood over the cherubim.
\v 19 The cherubim lifted up their wings and rose from the earth in my sight when they went out, and the wheels did the same
beside them. They stood at the eastern entrance to Yahweh's house, and the glory of the God of Israel came upon them from above.
