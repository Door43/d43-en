\v 1 Then I looked towards the dome that was over the heads of the cherubim; something appeared above them like a
sapphire with the appearance of the likeness of a throne.
\v 2 And Yahweh spoke to the man dressed in linen and said, "Go between the wheels, underneath the cherubim, and fill both your 
hands with fiery coals from between the cherubim and scatter them over the city." Then the man went in as I watched.
