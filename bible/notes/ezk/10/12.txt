\v 12 Their whole body—including their backs, their hands, and their wings—was covered with eyes, and eyes covered the four wheels all around also.
\v 13 As I listened, the wheels were called, "Whirling."
\v 14 They had four faces each; the first face was the face of a cherub, the second face was the face of a man, the third the face of 
a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
