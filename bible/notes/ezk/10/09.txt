\v 9 And I looked, and behold, four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub, and another wheel beside another
cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like to a beryl stone.
\v 10 And as for their appearance, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been within a wheel.
\v 11 When they went, they went in their four directions: they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head
looked they followed it; they turned not as they went.
