\v 6 And it came about, when God commanded the man dressed in linen and said, "Take fire from between the wheels that are between
the cherubim;" then the man went in and stood beside a wheel.
\v 7 A cherub reached out his hand between the cherubim to the fire that was among the cherubim, and lifted it up and placed
it into the hands of the one dressed in linen. The man took it and went back out.
\v 8 I saw on the cherubim something like a man’s hand under their wings.
