\v 6 When Yahweh commanded the man wearing the linen robe to take burning coals from among those winged creatures, the man went into \add the courtyard\add* and stood beside one of the wheels.
\v 7 Then one of those winged creatures reached out his hand to the fire that was there among them. He picked up some of the coals and put them in the hands of the man wearing the linen robe, and that man took them and left.

\v 6 And it came about, when God commanded the man dressed in linen and said, "Take fire from between the wheels that are between the cherubim," the man went in and stood beside a wheel.
\v 7 A cherub reached out his hand between the cherubim to the fire that was among the cherubim, and lifted it up and placed it into the hands of the one dressed in linen. The man took it and went back out.
\v 8 I saw on the cherubim something like a man's hand under their wings.
