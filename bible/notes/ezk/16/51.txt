\v 51 Neither did Samaria commit even half of your sins; instead, you have done many more disgusting things than they did, and you have shown that your sisters were better than you because of all 
the disgusting things that you do!
\v 52 Especially you, show your own shame; in this way you have shown that your sisters were better than you, because of the sins you committed in all those disgusting ways. Your sisters now seem better than you. Especially you, show your own shame, for in this way you have shown that your sisters were better than you.

===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues to refer to other nations as relatives of Jerusalem.
  * **you have shown that your sisters were better than you** - Yahweh uses this phrase three times.  Repeating this phrase shows how important it is. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Especially you, show your own shame** - Yahweh uses this phrase two times. This is repeated to show how important it is that the people of Israel understand that their actions are wrong. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
