===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 32 You are like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a woman who commits adultery: You prefer to \add have sex with\add* strangers rather than with your husband.
\v 33 Prostitutes are paid, but \add it is as though\add* you give gifts to all your lovers; you bribe them to come to you from everywhere to have sex with you.
\v 34 So although you act like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a prostitute, you are not like other prostitutes: no one needs to request you to have sex \f + \ft euphemism \f* with them. You are the opposite of other prostitutes; instead of them giving any money to you, you give men money to have sex with you.

<usfm>
\v 32 A wife that committeth adultery! that takes strangers instead of her husband!
\v 33 They give gifts to all harlots; but you give your gifts to all your lovers, and bribest them, that they may come to
you on every side for your whoredoms.
\v 34 And you are different from other women in your whoredoms, in that none follows you to play the harlot; and
whereas you give hire, and no hire is given to thee, therefore you are different.
