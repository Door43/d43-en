\v 16 \add It was as though\add* you took some of your clothes to make beautifully decorated shrines, and that is where you had sex with those men. Those things should certainly never occur!

\v 15 But you trusted in your own beauty, and you acted like a whore because of your fame; you poured out your acts of prostitution on everyone who passed by. They were for them.
\v 16 Then you took your clothes and with them you made high places for yourself decorated in various colors, and there you acted like a prostitute. This should not have happened. Nor should such a thing exist.
