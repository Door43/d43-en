\v 15 "But you trusted in your own beauty, and you acted like a whore because of your fame; you poured out your acts of prostitution on
everyone who passed by. You became the property of those men!
\v 16 Then you took your clothes and with them you made for yourself shrines decorated in various colors, and you acted like a whore at them. 
This should not have come about! It should not have been!
