===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh speaks to Ezekiel about the origins of the people of Israel.

  * **the word of Yahweh came** - This is an idiom that is used to introduce something that God told his prophets or his people. AT: "Yahweh spoke this message" or "Yahweh spoke these words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Son of man** - "Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. AT: "Mortal person" or "Human"
  * **Your beginning and your birth** - Both of these speak of when the city of Jerusalem was founded. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **father was an Amorite, and your mother was a Hittite** - Both of these nations developed the city of Jerusalem before the people of Israel existed. AT: "you were founded by the Amorites and the Hittites"
