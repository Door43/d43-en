===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In this chapter, Yahweh speaks about Jerusalem as if the city were his unfaithful bride. He describes her growth from infancy to adulthood. The city represents the people who live there. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

  * **the word of Yahweh came** - This is an idiom that is used to introduce something that God told his prophets or his people. AT: "Yahweh spoke this message" or "Yahweh spoke these words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Son of man** - "Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. AT: "Mortal person" or "Human"
  * **Your beginning and your birth** - These two phrases share similar meanings. Yahweh speaks of when people founded the city as if it were the city's birth. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **your father was an Amorite, and your mother was a Hittite** - The Amorites and Hittites were both pagan people groups. Yahweh speaks of Jerusalem's father and mother belonging to these people groups to express that she was born into idolatry. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
