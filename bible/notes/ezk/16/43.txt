===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues to speak about Jerusalem and the people of Israel as his unfaithful wife.
  * **did not call to mind** - Remembering something is referred to as someone telling information to come to their mind. Possible meanings: 1) forgot or 2) did not remember
  * **the days of your youth** - By referring to the period of time Jerusalem was young Yahweh is referring to the events that happened during that time. AT: "my kindness to you when you were young"  (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy
]])
  * **Behold** - The word “behold” here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows. 
  * **I myself will bring the punishment for your conduct on your own head** - Yahweh says "I myself" to refer to himself alone. Jerusalem's head is used to refer to her as a person or as the nation of Israel. The head is used because it is considered to be the most important part of the body. AT: "I will punish you for how you have acted" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]]) 
  * **This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration**  - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]].
