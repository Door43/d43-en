\v 47 Now do not walk in their ways or after their disgusting actions, as if those were very small things. Indeed, in all your ways you have been worse than they have been.
\v 48 As I live"—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration—"Sodom, your sister and her daughters, have not done as much evil as you and your daughters have done!
