===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues to refer to other nations as relatives of Jerusalem.
  * **Now** - This word is used to mark a break in the teaching.  Yahweh changes from his parable to command the people of Jerusalem.
  * **do not walk in their ways or after their disgusting actions** - Both of these phrases are referring to the sinful behaviors the other nations do.  The word "walk" compares choices made in life to taking steps down a road. AT: "do not act like them or try to do the things that they do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration**- See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]].
