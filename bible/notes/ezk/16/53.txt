\v 53 For I will restore their fortunes! The fortunes of Sodom and her daughters, and the fortunes of Samaria and her
daughters; but your fortunes will be in their midst.
\v 54 On account of these things you will life up your shame and be humiliated because of everything that you have done, and so you will be a comfort to them.
\v 55 So your sisters Sodom and her daughters will be restored to their former estate and Samaria and her daughters will be restored to their former estate; and 
then you and your daughters will be restored to your former estate.
