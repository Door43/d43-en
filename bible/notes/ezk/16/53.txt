\v 53 For I will restore their fortunes—the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters, and the fortunes of Samaria and her
daughters; but your fortunes will be among them.
\v 54 On account of these things you will show your shame; you will be humiliated because of everything that you have done, and in this way you will be a comfort to them.
\v 55 So your sisters Sodom and her daughters will be restored to their former condition,  and Samaria and her daughters will be restored to their former estate. Then you and your daughters will be restored to your former condition.
