\v 27 So look! I will strike you with my hand and cut off your food. I will hand your life over to your enemies, the daughters of the Philistines, to
bring you shame because of your lustful behavior.
\v 28 You have acted like a prostitute with the Assyrians because you could not be satisfied. You acted like a prostitute and still were not satisfied.
\v 29 And you performed many more acts of prostitution in the land of the merchants of Chaldea, and even this did not satisfy you.
