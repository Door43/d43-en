\v 35 Therefore, you people of Jerusalem, you, who are like a prostitute, listen to what Yahweh the Lord is saying about you!
\v 36 He says that what you have done is as though you have lusted for everyone around you and had slept with them and with the male idols you made, so that you even made your own children to be sacrifices to them.
\v 37 So what I am going to do is as though I will gather those who you think have loved you and those whom you hated. I will gather them around you to attack you, and what I will do is as though I will strip your clothes off you, and they will see you when you are completely naked.

\v 35 Therefore, you prostitute, listen to the word of Yahweh.
\v 36 The Lord Yahweh says this: Because you have poured out your lust and uncovered your nakedness through your acts of prostitution with your lovers and with all your detestable idols, and because you gave them your children's blood,
\v 37 therefore, behold, I will gather all your lovers that you have met, all those whom you loved and all those whom you hated, and I will gather them against you on every side. I will uncover your nakedness to them so they see all your nakedness.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to speak about Jerusalem as if the city were his unfaithful wife. The city represents the people who live there. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

  * **you have poured your lust out** - Yahweh speaks of Jerusalem's lust as if it were liquid and of committing actions repeatedly to gratify that lust as if it were pouring that liquid from a container. AT: "you repeatedly committed actions to gratify your lust" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **poured your lust out** - Some modern versions translate "poured your wealth out." 
  * **the blood of your children that you gave to your idols** - This refers to killing children as a sacrifice to idols.
  * **behold!** - The word "behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.
  * **so they can see all your nakedness** - Stripping a person naked in front of others was an action intended to humiliate the person. The word "nakedness" can be translated as an adjective. AT: "so they can see you completely naked" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
