\v 35 Therefore, you people of Jerusalem, who are like a prostitute , listen to what Yahweh the Lord is saying about you!
\v 36 He says that what you have done is as though you have lusted for everyone around you and had sex with them and with the male-idols you made, so that you even made your own children to be sacrifices to them.
\v 37 So what I am going to do is as though I will gather those who you think have loved you and those whom you hated. I will gather them around you to attack you, and what I will do is as though I will strip your clothes off you, and they will see you when you are completely naked.

\v 35 Therefore, whore, listen to the word of Yahweh!
\v 36 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Because you have poured your lust out and exposed your genitals through your whoredoms
with all of your lovers and with all the idols of your abominations, and because of the blood of your children that you gave to them;
\v 37 therefore behold! I will gather all your lovers that you have passed by, both all them that you loved and all them that you hated,
and I will gather them against you on every side, and will expose your genitals to them so they can see all your nakedness!
