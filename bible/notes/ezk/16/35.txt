\v 35 Therefore, you people of Jerusalem, who are like a prostitute , listen to what Yahweh the Lord is saying about you!
\v 36 He says that what you have done is as though you have lusted for everyone around you and had sex with them and with the male-idols you made, so that you even made your own children to be sacrifices to them.
\v 37 So what I am going to do is as though I will gather those who you think have loved you and those whom you hated. I will gather them around you to attack you, and what I will do is as though I will strip your clothes off you, and they will see you when you are completely naked.

\v 35 Therefore, you prostitute, listen to the word of Yahweh!
\v 36 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: 'Because you have poured your lust out and exposed your genitals through your acts of prostitution with all of your lovers and with all your disgusting idols, and because of the blood of your children that you gave to your idols;
\v 37 therefore behold! I will gather all your lovers that you have met, all those whom you loved and all those whom you hated,
and I will gather them against you on every side. I will expose your genitals to them so they can see all your nakedness!

    * **disgusting idols**  - The word "disgusting" is a strong word and it may be translated "terrible" or "horrible."
    * **therefore, behold**  - The word “behold” here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.
