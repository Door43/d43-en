===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh speaks about enemy soldiers as the lovers of Jerusalem.

  * **I will calm my fury against you; my anger will leave you** - Yahweh's punishment of Jerusalem is referred to as his "anger" or "fury."  Both words mean the same thing. AT: "I will not allow you to be punished anymore" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
