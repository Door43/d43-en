===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to speak about Jerusalem as if the city were his unfaithful wife. The city represents the people who live there. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

  * **arrogant in her leisure, careless and unconcerned about anything** - Yahweh describes Sodom as a rich woman who has more than enough food and lives in security. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **She did not strengthen the hands of the poor and needy people** - Here the word "hands" represents the people who work with their hands. The words "poor" and "needy" emphasize that these are people who cannot help themselves. AT: "She did not help the people who could not help themselves" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
