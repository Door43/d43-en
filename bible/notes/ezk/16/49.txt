\v 49 These are the sins of the people who lived in Sodom, who were like your sister people among them: they were prideful and didn't think they would ever be punished. They ignored poor and hurting people around them.

<usfm>
\v 49 Behold! This was the sin of your sister Sodom: she was arrogant in her leisure,  carelessness and unconcerned about anything. The hands of the poor and needy
reached out to her and her daughters, but she would not help them.
\v 50 She was arrogant and committed disgusting actions before me, so I took them away just as you have seen.
