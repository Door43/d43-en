===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh speaks about enemy soldiers as the lovers of Jerusalem
 
  * **throw down your ritual places and break down your shrines** - These phrases are saying the same thing in different ways.  This adds emphasis to the phrase. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **naked and bare** - Both of these words express the same thing.  This adds emphasis to the words but if your language only has one word for "naked" that can be used.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
