===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 30 I, Yahweh the Lord, declare that when you did all those things, acting like  a bold prostitute, you were showing that you could not control your lust and would do anything, no matter how promiscuous, that you wanted to to satisfy your desires.
\v 31 But when you built shrines to worship idols in every city square, you were not really like a prostitute because prostitutes charge money. You refused to take money for what you did!

\v 30 Why is your heart so weak?"—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration—"that you would do all these things, deeds of a promiscuous and shameless woman?
\v 31 When you built your ritual places at the head of every street and made your shrines in every public place, you were not actually a prostitute, since you
refused to take pay for your actions!

===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues to speak about Jerusalem and the people of Israel as his unfaithful wife.

    * **Why is your heart so weak?** - Here, the word "heart" refers to love and faithfulness. AT: "Why do you love me so little?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
    * **promiscuous and shameless**  - The word "promiscuous" refers to a person who sleeps with many different people." The word "shameless" refers to a person who openly sins. Both of these words describe one thought.  AT: "shamelessly promiscuous" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hendiadys]])
    * **head of every street**  - See how this is translated in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:16:25|16:25]].
