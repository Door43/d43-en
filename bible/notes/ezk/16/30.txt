\v 30 I, Yahweh the Lord, declare that when you did all those things, acting like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a bold prostitute, you were showing that you were ready to do anything that you wanted to [IDI].
\v 31 When you built shrines to worship idols in every city square\f + \ft Or: plaza \f*, and in every city square\f + \ft Or: plaza \f*, you were not like a prostitute: Prostitutes charge money, but you refused to take money for what you did.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 30 I, Yahweh the Lord, declare that when you did all those things, acting like a bold prostitute, you were showing that you could not control your lust and would do anything, no matter how promiscuous, that you wanted to to satisfy your desires.
\v 31 But when you built the houses on the hills to worship idols in every city square, you were not really like a prostitute because prostitutes charge money. You refused to take money for what you did!

\v 30 Why is your heart so weak?—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration—that you would do all these things, deeds of a promiscuous and shameless woman?
\v 31 You have built your high places at the head of every street and made your lofty place in every public square. Yet you were not like a prostitute because you refused to take payment!
