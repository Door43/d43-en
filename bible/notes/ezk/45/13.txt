\v 13 This is the contribution that you must present: a sixth of an ephah for every homer of wheat, and you will give a sixth of an ephah for every homer of barley.
\v 14 The regulation offering of oil will be a tenth of a bath for every kor (which is ten baths), or for every homer, since a homer is also ten baths.
\v 15 One sheep or goat from the flock for every two hundred animals from the watered regions of Israel will be used for any burnt offering or peace offering to make atonement for the people.' This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration.
