\v 15 Also, I, Yahweh, declare that you must take one sheep or goat from each 200 in your flocks in the pastures of Israel. The sheep that you take will be used with the offerings of things made from grain and for the offerings that will be completely burned and the offerings to maintain fellowship with Yahweh, offerings to cause the people to no longer be guilty for their sins.

<usfm>
\v 13 You must present to the ruler one measure of wheat or barley for every sixty measures that you harvest.
\v 14 You must give him one measure of olive oil for every one hundred measures that you produce.
\v 15 Also, Yahweh declares that you must take one sheep or goat from every two hundred in your flocks in the lush pastures of Israel. You must offer a sheep or a goat for various offerings: Burnt offerings and offerings to promise friendship with Yahweh, offerings to atone for the people's sins. "This is the Lord Yahweh's command."

<usfm>

\v 13 This is the contribution that you must present: A sixth of an ephah for every homer of wheat, and you will give a sixth of an ephah for every homer of barley.
\v 14 The regulation offering of oil will be a tenth of a bath for every cor (which is ten baths), or for every homer, since a homer is also ten baths. 
\v 15 One sheep or goat from the flock for every two hundred animals from the watered regions of Israel will be used for any burnt offering or peace offering to make atonement for the people—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration.
