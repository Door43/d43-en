\v 3 Inside the sacred district, measure a section about 13.5 kilometers long and about 5.4 kilometers wide.
\v 4 It will be the sacred portion of the land for the priests who work in the temple, those who come near to Yahweh to serve him. It will be a place very special for Yahweh, for the priests' houses, as well as for the temple.
\v 5 An area about 13.5 kilometers long and about 5.4 kilometers wide will be for the descendants of Levi who work in the temple. That area will belong to them, and they can build towns there to live in.

\v 3 From this area you will measure a portion that is twenty-five thousand cubits long and ten thousand wide; it will be a sanctuary for you, a most holy place.
\v 4 It will be a sanctuary in the land for the priests who serve Yahweh, who come near Yahweh to serve him. It will be a place for their houses and holy for the sanctuary.
\v 5 So it will be twenty-five thousand cubits long and ten thousand wide, and it will be for towns for the Levites who serve in the house.
