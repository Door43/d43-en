\v 3 From this area you will measure a portion that is twenty-five thousand cubits long and ten thousand wide; it will be a sanctuary for you, a most holy place.
\v 4 It will be a sanctuary in the land for the priests who serve Yahweh, who come near Yahweh to serve him. It will be a place for their houses and holy for the sanctuary.
\v 5 So it will be twenty-five thousand cubits long and ten thousand wide, and it will be for towns for the Levites who serve in the house.
