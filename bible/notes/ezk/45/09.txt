\v 9 This is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say: You rulers of Israel must stop acting violently and oppressing the people! You must do what is fair and right. Stop taking land from the people; stop forcing them off their land!
\v 10 Also, you must use accurate scales and accurate containers for measuring things.
\v 11 The baskets for measuring dry things and containers for measuring liquids must be the same size; each must hold twenty-two liters—called an ephah (for dry measure) and a bath (for liquid measure).
\v 12 When you weigh things, you must use weights that everyone accepts as being correct. The shekel is to be divided into twenty gerahs, and a mina will be worth sixty shekels.

\v 9 The Lord Yahweh says this: 'It is enough for you, princes of Israel! Remove violence and strife; do justice and righteousness! Quit your evictions of my people!" This is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.
\v 10 "You must have accurate balances, accurate ephahs, and accurate baths!
\v 11 The ephah and the bath will be the same amount, so that a bath will be a tenth of a homer; the ephah will be a tenth of a homer. Their measure will be corresponding to the homer.
\v 12 The shekel will be twenty gerahs; sixty shekels will make a mina for you.
