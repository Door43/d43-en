\v 1 When you cast lots to divide up the land as an inheritance, you must make an offering to Yahweh; this offering will be a holy part of the land, twenty-five thousand cubits in length, and ten thousand cubits in width. It will be holy, all its area round about.
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa ten thousand \fqa* , which the Hebrew text and some modern versions have, some ancient copies and many modern versions have \fqa twenty thousand \fqa* . \f*
\v 2 From this there will be a five hundred cubits by five hundred cubits square surrounding the holy place, with a surrounding border fifty cubits in width.
