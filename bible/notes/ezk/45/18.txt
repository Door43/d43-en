\v 19 The Supreme Priest must take some of the blood of the offering to cause people to become acceptable to God, and smear it on the doorposts of the temple, on the four corners of the upper ledge of the altar, and on the gateposts of the inner courtyard.
\v 20 You must do the same thing on the seventh day of the month for any people who sin accidentally or without knowing that what they did is sinful. By doing that you will purify the temple.

\v 18 The Lord Yahweh says this: 'In the first month, on the first day of the month, you will take an unblemished bull from the herd and perform a sin offering for the sanctuary.
\v 19 The priest will take some of the blood of the sin offering and place it on the doorposts of the house and on the four corners of the border of the altar, and on the doorposts of the gate to the inner court.
\v 20 You will do this on the seventh of the month for each person's sin by accident or ignorance; in this way you will atone for the temple.
