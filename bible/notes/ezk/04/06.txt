\v 6 When you have completed these days, then lie down a second time on your right side, for you will carry the sin of the house
of Judah for forty days. I am assigning to you one day for each year.
\v 7 And you will set your face against Jerusalem that is under siege, with your arm uncovered, and you will prophesy against it.
\v 8 For behold! I am placing bonds on you so you will not turn from one side to the other until you have completed the days of your siege.
