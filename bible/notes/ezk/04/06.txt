\v 6 After that, lie down again. This time, lie on your right side for forty days. That will symbolize that the Judean people, the southern kingdom, will be punished for their sins, one year for each day that you lie there.
\v 7 Turn your face toward the drawing of Jerusalem and bare your arm like a soldier does who prepares to go into battle, and prophesy about what will happen to the city.
\v 8 You will not be able to move; it will be as though I have tied you with ropes so that you cannot turn from one side to the other until you have finished symbolizing how many years the city will be besieged.

<usfm>
\v 6 When you have completed these days, then lie down a second time on your right side, for you will carry the sin of the house of Judah for forty days. I am assigning to you one day for each year.
\v 7 And you will set your face against Jerusalem that is under siege, with your arm uncovered, and you will prophesy against it.
\v 8 For behold! I am placing bonds on you so you will not turn from one side to the other until you have completed the days of your siege.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The Spirit continues speaking to Ezekiel.

  * **When you have completed these days** - "These days" refers to the days Ezekiel lies down on his side to illustrate the siege of the kingdom of Israel.
  * **you will carry the sin** - See how you translated "you will carry their sin" in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:04:04|4:4]].
  * **I am assigning to you one day for each year** - "I will make you do this one day for each year that I will punish them."
  * **set your face against** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:04:01|4:3]]
  * **you will prophesy against it** - "you will prophesy about the bad things that will happen to Jerusalem"
  * **behold!** - AT: "look!" or "listen!" or "pay attention to what I am about to tell you!" 
  * **I am placing bonds on you** - Bonds are ropes or chains that keep a person from moving. It is not clear whether the word "bonds" is a metaphor for something Yahweh does that is as if he had bound Ezekiel (UDB) or if he used literal, physical ropes. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
