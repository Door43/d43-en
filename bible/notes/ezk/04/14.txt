\v 14 Then I said, "No, Yahweh God! \add Do not force me to do that\add*! I have never caused myself to become unacceptable to you. From the time when I was young, I have never eaten meat of any animal that was found dead or that had been killed by wild animals. And I have never eaten any meat that is unacceptable to you."
\p
\v 15 Yahweh replied, "Okay, I will allow you to bake your bread using dried cow manure instead of human dung \add for fuel\add*."

\v 14 But I said, "Alas, Lord Yahweh! I have never been unclean! I have never eaten either anything that died or anything killed by animals, from my youth until now, and foul meat has never entered my mouth!"
\v 15 So he said to me, "Look! I have given you cow's dung instead of man's dung so you can prepare your bread over the cow's dung."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Alas** - Ezekiel says this to show that he is very troubled by what the Lord has told him to do.
  * **Lord Yahweh** - See how you translated "the Lord Yahweh" in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:04|2:4]]. Here Ezekiel is saying this to the Lord.
  * **foul meat** - This refers to meat that is unclean because it came from an animal that died of sickness or old age or was killed by another animal. The word "foul" shows his disgust over meat like this. AT: "unclean meat."
  * **foul meat has never entered my mouth** - This means "I have never eaten foul meat."
  * **Look! I have given you** - The word "Look" is used to bring Ezekiel's attention to what God is about to say to him.
  * **man's dung** - See how you translated human excrement in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:04:12|4:12]].
