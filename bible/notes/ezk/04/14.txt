\v 14 Then I said, "No, Yahweh God! \add Do not force me to do that\add*! I have never caused myself to become unacceptable to you. From the time when I was young, I have never eaten meat of any animal that was found dead or that had been killed by wild animals. And I have never eaten any meat that is unacceptable to you."

\v 15 Yahweh replied, "Okay, I will allow you to bake your bread using dried cow manure instead of human dung \add for fuel\add*."

\v 14 But I said, "Alas, Lord Yahweh! My soul has never been unclean! I have never eaten either anything that died or anything killed by animals, 
from my youth until now, and foul meat has never entered my mouth!"
