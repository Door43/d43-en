\v 14 Then I said, "No, Yahweh God! \add Do not force me to do that\add*! I have never caused myself to become unacceptable to you. From the time when I was young, I have never eaten meat of any animal that was found dead or that had been killed by wild animals. And I have never eaten any meat that is unacceptable to you."
\p
\v 15 Yahweh replied, "Okay, I will allow you to bake your bread using dried cow manure instead of human dung \add for fuel\add*."

\v 14 But I said, "Alas, Lord Yahweh! I have never been unclean! I have never eaten either anything that died or anything killed by animals, from my youth until now, and foul meat has never entered my mouth!"
\v 15 So he said to me, "Look! I have given you cow manure instead of human dung so you can prepare your bread over that."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Alas** - "It would be wrong for me to do that." Ezekiel is very troubled by what the Lord has told him to do. 
  * **Lord Yahweh** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:04|2:4]]. Here Ezekiel is speaking to the Lord.
  * **foul meat has never entered my mouth** - "I have never eaten foul meat"
  * **foul meat** - "disgusting, unclean meat." This refers to meat that is unclean because it has come from an animal that has died of sickness or old age or was killed by another animal. The word "foul" shows his disgust over meat like this. 
  * **Look** - "Listen" or "Pay attention to the important thing I will tell you now"
  * **I have given you** - "I will allow you to use"
  * **cow manure** - solid waste from cows. Your language may have a polite way of expressing this.
  * **human dung** - solid waste from humans.  Your language may have a polite way of expressing this. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:04:12|4:12]].
