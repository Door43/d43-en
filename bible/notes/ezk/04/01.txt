\v 1 You also, son of man, take you a tile, and lay it before you, and portray upon it a city, even Jerusalem:
\v 2 and lay siege against it, and build forts against it, and cast up a mound against it; set camps also against it, and plant
battering rams against it round about.
\v 3 And take you to you an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between you and the city: and set your face toward it,
and it shall be besieged, and you shall lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.
