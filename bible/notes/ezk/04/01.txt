\v 1 But you, Son of man, take a brick for yourself and place it before you. Then carve the city of Jerusalem on it.
\v 2 Then lay siege against it, and build forts against it. Raise up an assault ramp against it and set camps around it. Place
battering rams all around it.
\v 3 And you, take for yourself an iron pan, and use it as an iron wall between yourself and the city. Set your face against it and the city,
for it will be under siege. So lay siege against it! This will be a sign to the house of Israel.

===== Translation Notes: =====

In this chapter God tells Ezekiel to act out how God would punish the people of Israel and Judah.

  * **Son of man**  - The phrase "Son of man" refers to Ezekiel. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01|2:3]]
  * **carve the city of Jerusalem**  - "carve a picture of the city of Jerusalem"
  * **lay siege against it**  - "surround the city in order to capture it"
  * **build forts against it**  - "build strong walls against it." The walls would keep people from leaving the city.
  * **Raise up an assault ramp against it**  - "build a ramp outside of it for the enemies to get inside." Jerusalem had a wall around it to protect the people inside. The enemies could only get inside if they had a ramp to climb up over the wall.
  * **Place battering rams all around it**  - The term "battering rams" refers to a large tree or pole that many men in an army would lift and hit against a wall or door so they could break it down and get inside. "Set huge poles around it to break down the gates and get inside."
  * **Set your face against it**  - "look at it with hostility" or "turn toward it with anger" or "look at it angrily" (See: [[:en:ta:translate:idiom|Idiom]])
  * **house of Israel**  - "the people of Israel" or "the people who live in Israel." This refers specifically to the people of the northern kingdom of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metonymy|Metonymy]]) See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:01|3:1]].
