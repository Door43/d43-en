\v 16 Then he said to me, "You human, I will cause the supply of food to Jerusalem to be cut off. Then the people will eat the small amounts of food and drink the small amounts of water \add that the government permits them to have\add*, and they will be very distressed and anxious as they do that,
\v 17 because water and food will be very scarce. They will see each other becoming extremely thin, and they will be appalled; but this will happen because \add they are being punished for\add* the sins \add that they have committed\add*."

\v 16 Then he said to me, "Son of man, I will cause the supply of food to Jerusalem to be cut off. Then the people will eat the small amounts of food and drink the small amounts of water that their leaders permit them to have, and they will be very distressed and anxious as they do that,
\v 17 because water and food will be very scarce. They will see each other becoming extremely thin, and they will be appalled; but this will happen because they are being punished for the sins that they have committed."

\v 16 He also said to me, "Son of man, behold! I am breaking the staff of bread in Jerusalem, and they will eat bread while rationing it in anxiety
and drink water while rationing it in trembling.
\v 17 Because they will lack bread and water, every man will be dismayed at his brother and melt away because of their iniquity."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Son of man**  - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01|2:3]].
  * **behold**  - This can be translated as “Look” or “Listen” or “Pay attention to what I am about to tell you.”
  * **the staff of bread** - "the supply of food." The supply is called a staff because like a staff, it supports people. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I am breaking the staff of bread in Jerusalem**  - "I will stop the supply of food to Jerusalem."
  * **they will eat bread while rationing it in anxiety** - This means that "they will carefully divide their bread because they fear that that there will not be enough."  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **rationing it in trembling**  - "rationing it while shaking" or  "rationing it in fear" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **every man will be dismayed at his brother**  - "everyone will look at his brother and be worried about the food" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **melt away because of their iniquity**  - "become extremely thin because of their iniquity." As ice melts away when heated, people become thin when they do not eat. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
