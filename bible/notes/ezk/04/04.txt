===== Translation Notes: =====

The Spirit continues speaking to Ezekiel.
 
  * **take the sin of the house of Israel on yourself** - Possible meanings are 1) "symbolically bearing the punishment for the sins of the Israelites" (UDB) or 2) "suffer by lying on your side because of their sin."
  * **house of Israel** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:04:01|4:3]].
  * **you will carry their sin**  - Possible meanings are 1) "you will be guilty of their sin" or 2) "you will be punished for their sin." Either of these meanings will be demonstrated "symbolically" by Ezekiel as noted in the UDB. 
  * **lie down against the house of Israel** - Alternate translation: "lie facing the kingdom of Israel in a hostile manner."
  * **I myself am assigning to you one day to represent each year of their punishment** - Alternate translation: "I myself command you to lay on your side for the same number of days as the number of years that I will punish them."
  * **each year of their punishment** - Possible meanings are 1) each year that they will be punished for their sins or 2) each year that they have sinned.
