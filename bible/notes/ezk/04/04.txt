===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to Ezekiel.
 
  * **put the sin of the house of Israel on it** - Possible meanings are 1) "symbolically bear the punishment for the sins of the Israelites" (UDB) or 2) "suffer by lying on your side because of their sin."
  * **the house of Israel** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:01|3:1]]. AT: "the Israelites" or "the Israelite people group" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **you will carry their sin** - Possible meanings are 1) "you will be guilty of their sin" or 2) "you will be punished for their sin." Either of these meanings will be demonstrated "symbolically" by Ezekiel as noted in the UDB. 
  * **lie down against the house of Israel** - "lie facing the kingdom of Israel in a hostile manner"
  * **I myself am assigning to you one day to represent each year of their punishment** - "I myself command you to lie on your side for the same number of days as the number of years that I will punish them"
  * **each year of their punishment** - Possible meanings are 1) each year that they will be punished for their sins or 2) each year that they have sinned.
