\v 22 But I will rescue my people, and you will no longer steal from them. I will judge between one person and another.
\v 23 And I will appoint one leader for them, someone who will be like King David, who served me very well. That leader will take care of them and be like their shepherd.
\v 24 I, Yahweh, will be their God, and the one who is like King David will be their king. That will surely happen because I, Yahweh, have said it.
