\v 14 I will feed them with good pasture; and upon the mountains of the height of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they
lie down in a good fold; and on fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.
\v 15 I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will cause them to lie down, says the Lord Jehovah.
\v 16 I will seek that which was lost, and will bring back that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken,
and will strengthen that which was sick: but the fat and the strong I will destroy; I will feed them in justice.
