===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the leaders of Israel.

  * **their grazing places** - "places where they can eat" 
  * **abundant pastures** - lands that have a lot of grass and plants
  * **graze** - eat grass and other plants
  * **I myself** - The word "myself" adds emphasis. God would do this because the shepherds were not doing it right.
  * **will shepherd** - "will feed and take care of"
  * **will make them lie down** - "will let them lie down" 
  * **This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]].
  * **the lost** - "those that are lost." AT: "any sheep or goats that are lost" 
  * **restore the outcast** - AT: "bring back those that have been chased away"
  * **bind up the broken sheep** - "wrap a cloth around any sheep's broken bone" or "wrap a cloth around any sheep's wound" 
  * **will annihilate** - "will kill" or "will destroy"
