<usfm>
\v 14 I will put them in good pastures; the high mountains of Israel will be their grazing places. They will lie down there in good places for grazing, in abundant pastures, and they will graze on the mountains of Israel.
\v 15 I myself will shepherd my flock, and I myself will make them lie down—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—
\v 16 I will seek the lost and restore the outcast; I will bind up the broken sheep and heal the sick sheep. And I will annihilate those who are fattened and strong! I will shepherd with justice!

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the leaders of Israel.

  * **their grazing places** - "places where they can eat" 
  * **abundant pastures** - lands that have a lot of grass and plants
  * **graze** - eat grass and other plants
  * **I myself** - The word "myself" adds emphasis. God would do this because the shepherds were not doing it right.
  * **will shepherd** - "will feed and take care of"
  * **will make them lie down** - "will let them lie down" 
  * **this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]].
  * **the lost** - "those that are lost." AT: "any sheep or goats that are lost" 
  * **restore the outcast** - AT: "bring back those that have been chased away"
  * **bind up the broken sheep** - "wrap a cloth around any sheep's broken bone" or "wrap a cloth around any sheep's wound" 
  * **will annihilate** - "will kill" or "will destroy"
