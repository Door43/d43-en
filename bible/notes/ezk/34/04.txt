\v 4 You have not strengthened those with disease, and do not heal the ones who are ill. You do not bind up the ones who are broke,  and you do not restore the outcasts or seek the lost, but you rule over them through strength and violence!
\v 5 Then they were scattered without a shepherd, and became food for all the living things of the field, since they were scattered!
\v 6 My flock strays on all of the mountains and on every high hill, and my flock is dispersed over the entire face of the earth! Yet there is no one searching for or seeking them!
