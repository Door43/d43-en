\v 11 For thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold! I myself will seek out my flock and I will look after them,
\v 12 like a shepherd seeking his herd in the day he is within the midst of his scattered flock. Thus I will seek my flock and I will deliver them from all the places where they were scattered in the day of clouds and darkness!
\v 13 Then I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the lands, and bring them to your land and shepherd them to the mountains of Israel by the streams and in every inhabitation of the land!
