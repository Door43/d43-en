\v 11 For thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I myself, even I, will search for my sheep, and will seek them out.
\v 12 As a shepherd seeks out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered abroad, so will I seek out
my sheep; and I will deliver them out of all places whither they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.
\v 13 And I will bring them out from the peoples, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land;
and I will feed them upon the mountains of Israel, by the watercourses, and in all the inhabited places of the country.
