\v 11 This is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say to you leaders: 'I myself will search for my sheep and take care of them.
\v 12 Like a shepherd takes care of his sheep when he is with them, I will rescue my people from all the places to which they have been scattered, at a time when things were very gloomy and they experienced disasters.
\v 13 I will bring them back from those countries and gather them together again in their own land. \add Because it is as though they are my sheep\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add it is as though\add* I will enable them to find good pastureland on the hills of Israel, and in the ravines, and in the villages of Israel.

\v 11 I, the Lord Yahweh, tell you leaders that I myself will search for my sheep and take care of them.
\v 12 As a shepherd takes care of his sheep, I will rescue my people from all the places to which you scattered them, when disasters struck them and they were afraid.
\v 13 I will bring them back from those countries and gather them together again in their own land. I will lead my sheep to good pastureland on the hills of Israel, in the ravines, and in the villages of Israel.

\v 11 For the Lord Yahweh says this: "Behold! I myself will seek out my flock and I will look after them,
\v 12 like a shepherd seeking his flock on the day he is within the midst of his scattered flock. Thus I will seek my flock, and I will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered on the day of clouds and darkness.
\v 13 Then I will bring them out from among the peoples; I will gather them from the lands and bring them to your land. I will put them in pastures on the mountainsides of Israel, by the streams, and in every settlement in the land.
