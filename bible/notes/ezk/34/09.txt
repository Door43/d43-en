<usfm>
\v 9 Therefore, shepherds, hear the declaration of Yahweh:
\v 10 "The Lord Yahweh says this: Behold! I am against the shepherds, and I will require my flock from their hand. Then I will dismiss them from shepherding the flock; neither will the shepherds any longer shepherd themselves since I will take away my flock from their mouths, so that my flock will no longer be food for them."
