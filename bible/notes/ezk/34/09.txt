\v 9 Therefore, you who should be shepherds of my people, listen to me.
\v 10 I am opposed to you leaders. I will punish you for mistreating my people. I will remove you from taking care of my people; you will no longer feed yourselves while ignoring them. I will rescue my people from you, and you will longer be able to butcher them and eat them.

<usfm>
\v 9 Therefore, shepherds, hear the declaration of Yahweh:
\v 10 The Lord Yahweh says this: Behold! I am against the shepherds, and I will require my flock from their hand. Then I will dismiss them from shepherding the flock; neither will the shepherds any longer shepherd themselves since I will take away my flock from their mouths, so that my flock will no longer be food for them.
