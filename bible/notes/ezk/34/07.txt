\v 8 As surely as I am alive, my people are like a flock of sheep without any shepherd, and as a result it is as though wild animals have attacked my people and eaten them. You shepherds did not search for them; instead, you only wanted to provide food for yourselves.

\v 7 Therefore, shepherds, hear the word of Yahweh:
\v 8 As I live—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration—because my flock has become plunder and food for all the beasts in the fields, because there was no shepherd and none of my shepherds sought my flock, but the shepherds guarded themselves and did not shepherd my flock.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the leaders of Israel.
  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking of the people of Israel as if they were a flock of sheep and the leaders of Israel as if they were shepherds who have not cared for the flock. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **hear the word of Yahweh** - This is an idiom that is used to introduce a special message from God. AT: "listen to Yahweh's message" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **As I live** - "As surely as I am alive." Yahweh uses this expression to show that what he says next is certainly true. This is a way of making a solemn promise. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]]. AT: "I solemnly swear" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]]. AT: "this is what the Lord Yahweh declares" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, declare" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **because my flock has become plunder and food for all the beasts in the fields** - This can be stated in the active form. AT: "because all the beasts in the fields steal my flock and eat them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **plunder** - things that are stolen
  * **all the beasts in the fields** - This is an exaggeration to show how vulnerable the people of Israel are. AT: "all the wild animals in the fields" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **because there was no shepherd** - "because they did not have a shepherd"
  * **none of my shepherds sought my flock** - "none of my shepherds tried to find my flock"
  * **guarded themselves** - "shepherded themselves" or "fed and cared for themselves"
