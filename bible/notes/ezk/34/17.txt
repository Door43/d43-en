\v 17 And as for you who are like \f + \ft metaphor \f* my sheep, this is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say: 'I will judge between each of you; and I will separate between \add those that are peaceful like\add* sheep and \add those that are always trying to dominate others like\add* goats.
\v 18 It is bad that \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* some of you keep the best pastures for yourselves. It is even worse that \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* you trample the good grass with your feet. It is bad that \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* you yourselves drink the clear water. It is worse that \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* with your feet you cause the other water to become muddy.
\v 19 \add It is as though\add* you \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* are forcing my flock to eat the grass that you have trampled and to drink the water that you have caused to become muddy!

\v 17 And as for you, O my flock, thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I judge between sheep and sheep, the rams and the
he-goats.
\v 18 Seemeth it a small thing to you to have fed upon the good pasture, but you must tread down with your feet the residue of
your pasture? and to have drunk of the clear waters, but you must foul the residue with your feet?
\v 19 And as for my sheep, they eat that which you have trodden with your feet, and they drink that which you have fouled with
your feet.
