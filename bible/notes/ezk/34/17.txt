\v 17 And You, my flock, thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold! I am a judge between sheep, rams, and goats!
\v 18 Is it a small thing to be shepherded on the good pasture, so you trample what is left of the pasture with your feet? Or to have drank from clear waters yet your muddy the rivers with your feet?
\v 19 But my sheep are being shepherded where you have trampled with your feet and drinking what you have muddied with your feet!
