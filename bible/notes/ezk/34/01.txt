\v 1 Yahweh gave me another message. He said,
\v 2 "Son of man, speak my message against the leaders of Israel. They should be taking care of my people, like shepherds take care of their flocks. Say to them that this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, have to tell them: 'You shepherds of Israel, terrible things will happen to you because you take care only of yourselves. You should certainly take care of my sheep.
\v 3 But you are like shepherds who eat the fat sheep, who slaughter the best animals for their wool. You are not real shepherds at all.

\v 1 Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
\v 2 "Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel. Prophesy and say to them, 'The Lord Yahweh says this to the shepherds: Woe to the shepherds of Israel who are shepherding themselves. Should not shepherds guard the flock?
\v 3 You eat the fatty portions and you dress in wool. You slaughter the fatlings of the flock. You do not shepherd at all.

===== translationNotes: =====
  * **General Information:** - In chapter 34, Yahweh speaks of the people of Israel as if they were a flock of sheep and the leaders of Israel were the shepherds that were supposed to care for the flock but have not. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **the word of Yahweh came** - This is an idiom that is used to introduce something that God told his prophets or his people. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:16|3:16]]. AT: "Yahweh spoke this message" or "Yahweh spoke these words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Son of man** - "Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01|2:1]]. AT: "Mortal person" or "Human"
  * **the shepherds of Israel** - The leaders of Israel are spoken as if they were shepherds. They were supposed to take care of their people like shepherds take care of their flock. AT: "the leaders of Israel who are like shepherds" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **are shepherding themselves** - The leaders taking care of themselves instead of the people are spoken of as if they were shepherding themselves. AT "are feeding and taking care of themselves" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Should not shepherds guard the flock?** - Yahweh uses this question to scold the leaders for not taking care of the people. AT: "Shepherds should feed the flock and take care of it." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **You eat the fatty portions ... dress in wool** - This continues speaking of the leaders of Israel as if they were bad shepherds that kill the best animals in their flock for food and clothing. AT: "You are like shepherds who eat the fatty portions ... dress in wool" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **You eat the fatty portions** - The fatty portions come from the sheep and the goats. AT: "You eat the fatty parts of the sheep and goats" or "You eat the best parts of the sheep and goats" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **dress in wool** - "wear the wool from the sheep"
  * **You slaughter the fatlings of the flock** - "You kill the fatlings of the flock" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the fatlings** - "the youngest and fattest sheep and goats"
  * **do not shepherd at all** - "do not feed and take care of the flock"
