\v 25 Then I will make a covenant of peace with them and remove the evil wild animals from the land, so my sheep will live securely in the wilderness and sleep in the forests.
\v 26 I will also bring blessings on them and my surrounding hills, for I will send out showers in due season. These will be showers of blessing!
\v 27 Then the trees of the field will produce their fruit, and the earth will yield its produce. My sheep will be secure in their land; then they will know that I am Yahweh, when I break the bars of their yoke, and when I rescue them from the hand of those who enslaved them.
