securely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.
\v 26 And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in its
season; there shall be showers of blessing.

their land; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have broken the bars of their yoke, and have delivered them out of
