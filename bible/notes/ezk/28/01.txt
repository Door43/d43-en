\q1 You have very proudly claimed, 'I am a god!
\q2 I sit on a throne \add in a city on an island\add* in the sea!'

\v 1 Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
\v 2 "Son of man, say to the ruler of Tyre, 'The Lord Yahweh says this: Your heart is arrogant! You have said, "I am a god! I will sit in the seat of the gods in the heart of the seas!" Even though you are a man and not a god, you make your heart like the heart of a god;

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the word of Yahweh came** - This is an idiom that is used to introduce something that God told his prophets or his people. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:16|3:16]]. AT: "Yahweh spoke this message" or "Yahweh spoke these words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Son of man** - "Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. AT: "Mortal person" or "Human"
  * **Your heart is arrogant** - Here "heart" represents the will or thoughts of the ruler of Tyre. AT: "You are arrogant" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **arrogant** - "proud"
  * **I will sit in the seat of the gods** - "I will sit on the throne of the gods." Here sitting in the seat of the gods represents claiming to be in the same exalted position as if he were one of the gods. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **heart of the seas** - "middle of the seas." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:27:04|27:4]].
