\v 1 Then Yahweh gave me another message. He said:
\v 2 "You human, give to the king of Tyre this message from me, Yahweh the Lord:
\q1 You have very proudly claimed, 'I am a god!
\q2 I sit on a throne \add in a city on an island\add* in the sea!'
\q1 You boast that you are a god,
\q2 but you are only a man, not a god.
\q1
\v 3 You think that you are wiser than Daniel was,
\q2 and you think that you can understand every secret.

\v 1 Then the word of Yahweh came to me and said,
\v 2 “Son of man, say to the ruler of Tyre, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Your heart is arrogant! You have said, “I am a god! I will sit in the seat of the gods in the heart of the seas!” Even though you are a man and not God, you make your heart like the heart of a god;
\v 3 you think that you are wiser than Daniel, and that no secret amazes you!
