====== Ezekiel 28:18-19 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 By committing many sins
\q2 and by buying and selling things dishonestly,
\q2 you caused your places of worship to become unacceptable to me.
\q1 So I caused a fire to burn down your city.
\q2 Your city was burned completely;
\q1 the people who were watching it saw
\q2 that only ashes remained on the ground.
\q1
\v 19 All the people who knew what your city was like previously
\q2 were appalled.
\q1 Now your city has disappeared,
\q2 and it will not exist anymore.'~"

\v 18 Because of your many sins and your dishonest trade, you have defiled your holy places! So I have made fire come out from you; it will consume you. I will turn you into ashes on the earth in the sight of all who look at you.
\v 19 All the ones who knew you among the peoples will shudder at you; they will be horrified, and you will never exist again!’”
