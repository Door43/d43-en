\v 25 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: 'When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they were scattered, and when I am sanctified among them in the eyes of the nations, then they will live in the land that I will give to my servant Jacob!
\v 26 Then they will live securely within her and build houses, plant vineyards, and live securely when I execute justice on all the ones who now despise them from all around; so they will know that I am Yahweh their God!’”
