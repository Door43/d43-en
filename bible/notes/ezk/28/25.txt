\v 25 And this is also what Yahweh the Lord says: "Some day the people of Israel will live in their own land again, the land that I gave to Jacob, who also served me. I will gather them from distant countries where I have scattered them. And I will reveal to the nations that I am holy among my people.
\v 26 My people will live safely in Israel; they will build houses and plant vineyards. And when I punish the nearby nations that despised them, they will know that it is I, Yahweh their God, \add who has done it\add*."

\v 25 The Lord Yahweh says this: 'When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they were scattered, and when I am sanctified in them, so the nations may see. Then they will make their homes in the land I will give to my servant Jacob!
\v 26 Then they will live securely within her and build houses, plant vineyards, and live securely when I execute justice on all the ones who now despise them from all around; so they will know that I am Yahweh their God!'"
