\v 11 The word of Yahweh came again to me and said,
\v 12 “Son of man, lift up a lament for the king of Tyre and say to him, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: You were the model of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty!
\v 13 You were in Eden, the garden of God! Every precious stone covered you: carnelian, chrysolite, and onyx! Topaz, malachite, and jasper! Sapphire, emerald, and beryl! Gold settings held these stones in place on you! They were prepared on the day of your creation for you to wear them!
