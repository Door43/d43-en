\v 8 They will bring you down to your graves;
\q1 you will die violently
\q2 like \f + \ft metaphor \f* those who died in the sea.
\q1
\v 9 Then you will certainly not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* say to those who are killing you,
\q2 'I am a god!'
\q1 \add because they will know that\add* you are not a god;
\q2 you are only a man.
\q1
\v 10 You will die like other people that are unacceptable to me die,
\q2 killed by foreigners.
\m \add That will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it."

<usfm>
\v 8 They will send you down to the pit, and you will die the death of those who die in the heart of the seas.
\v 9 Will you truly say, "I am a god" to the face of one who kills you? You are a man and not God, and you will be in the hand of the one who pierces you.
\v 10 You will die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of foreigners, for I have declared it—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration.'"
