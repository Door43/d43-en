<usfm>
\v 8 They will send you down to the pit, and you will die the death of those who die in the heart of the seas!
\v 9 Will you truly say, "I am a god" to the face of one who kills you? You are a man and not God, and you will be in the hand of the one who pierces you!
\v 10 You will die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of foreigners, for I have declared it!.' This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration."
