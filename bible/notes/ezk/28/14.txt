===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the king of Tyre.
 
  * **the fiery stones** - "the stones of fire." This probably refers to the colorful and bright stones mentioned in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:28:11|28:13]].
  * **from the day you were created** - AT: "since the day that I created you." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
