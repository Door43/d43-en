\v 20 Then the word of Yahweh came to me and said, 
\v 21 “Son of man, set your face against Sidon and prophesy against her! 
\v 22 Say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Behold! I am against you, Sidon! For I will be glorified in your midst so your people will know that I am Yahweh when I execute justice within you. I will be shown to be holy in you!
