===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Tyre.

  * **Your borders** - "The boundaries of your kingdom"
  * **in the heart of the seas** - This phrase means "in the middle of the seas" or "in the seas." Tyre even had control over parts of the seas. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **your builders have perfected your beauty** - "those who built you have made you completely beautiful." Yahweh begins to use a metaphor to compare Tyre with a beautiful and strong ship.
  * **your planks** - Possible meanings are 1) "your boards" or 2) "your decks."
  * **with firs** - "out of firs"
  * **a mast** - a large pole on a ship that holds up the sails of the ship
