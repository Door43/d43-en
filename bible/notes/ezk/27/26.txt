\v 26 Your rowers have brought you into great waters: the east wind has broken you in the heart of the seas.
\v 27 Your riches, and your wares, your merchandise, your mariners, and your pilots, your calkers, and the dealers in your
merchandise, and all your men of war, that are in thee, with all your company which is in the midst of thee, shall fall into the
heart of the seas in the day of your ruin.
\v 28 At the sound of the cry of your pilots the suburbs shall shake.
