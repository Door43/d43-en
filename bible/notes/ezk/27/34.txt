\v 34 But when you were shattered by the seas, by deep waters,
\q your merchandise and all your crew sank!
\q
\v 35 All the inhabitants of the coasts were appalled at you,
\q and their kings shuddered in horror! Their faces trembled!

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Tyre.
 
  * **were appalled at you** - "were shocked and terrified by what happened to you"
  * **hiss at you** - "hiss out of grief for you." Hissing was a way of expressing grief.
  * **you have become a horror** - "it has become terrifying for people to think about you"
