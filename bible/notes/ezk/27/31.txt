\q
\v 31 They will shave their heads bald for you and bind themselves with sackcloth,
\q and they will weep for you in bitterness of soul and mourning.
\q
\v 32 They will lift up their wails of lamentation for you and sing dirges over you,
\q Who is like Tyre, who has now been brought to silence in the middle of the sea?
\q
\v 33 When your merchandise went ashore from the sea, it satisfied many peoples;
\q you enriched the kings of the earth with your great wealth and merchandise!
