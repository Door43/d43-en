\v 17 And they will lift up a lamentation for you and say concerning you,
\q How you who were inhabited by sailors has been destroyed! The infamous city that was strong—it is in the sea!
\q And the ones dwelling in her who gave their terrors against everyone dwelling there,
\q
\v 18 now the coasts tremble in the day of your fall!
\q The coasts are terrified that you have gone out into the waters!
