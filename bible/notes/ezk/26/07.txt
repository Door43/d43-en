===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Tyre.

  * **Behold** - "Look" or "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you"
  * **Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of kings** - The phrase "king of kings" was a title, meaning that he was the greatest of kings, the king that other kings obeyed. AT: "Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the greatest king" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **a great many people** - This emphasizes the great size of Nebuchadnezzar's army.
  * **He will kill** - Here the word "He" refers to Nebuchadnezzar and is a metonym for his army. AT: "His army will kill" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **your daughters in the field** - Possible meanings are 1) "your daughters" refers to the young women of Tyre who were working in the fields or 2) "your daughters" is a metonym for nearby towns and villages on the mainland that supported the main city of Tyre. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:26:05|26:6]]. AT: "your daughter communities who are on the mainland." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
