\v 19 This is also what I, Yahweh the Lord, say: 'When I cause the city of Tyre to become desolate\f + \ft Or: empty \f*, like other cities in which people no longer live, and when I cause the huge waves of the sea to cover it,
\v 20 then I will bring the people of that city down to be with those who have gone down to where the dead people are, people who lived long ago. I will cause them to live in the place below the earth that is like old\f + \ft Or: ancient \f* ruins, with those who have gone down to that pit previously, and they will never return to the earth, to where people are alive.
\v 21 I will cause them to die in a horrible way \f + \ft Or: people will be very afraid because of what happens to that city \f*, and that will be the end of them\f + \ft Or: their lives \f*. People will search for that city but it will no longer exist. That is what I, Yahweh the Lord, declare \add will happen\add*.'~"

\v 19 For thus says the Lord Jehovah: When I shall make you a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I
shall bring up the deep upon thee, and the great waters shall cover thee;
\v 20 then will I bring you down with them that descend into the pit, to the people of old time, and will make you to dwell
in the nether parts of the earth, in the places that are desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that you be not
inhabited; and I will set glory in the land of the living.
\v 21 I will make you a terror, and you shall no more have any being; yough you be sought for, yet shall you never be
found again, says the Lord Jehovah.
