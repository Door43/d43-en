<usfm>
\v 5 Out in the sea, the part of your city that is on an island will become a place where men spread their fishing nets to dry them. That will surely happen because I, Yahweh the Lord, have predicted it: People from many nations will carry off everything of value in your city.
\v 6 The people in small villages on the coast near Tyre—your enemies will kill them with their swords. Then people will know that I, Yahweh, have the power to do what I say that I will do.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues to give Ezekiel his message to Tyre.

  * **She will become** - The city of Tyre is spoken of here as if it were a woman. AT: "Tyre will become" or "It will become" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **a place for nets to dry out in the midst of the sea** - Part of Tyre was an island. This expression is a metonym for the results of Tyre's destruction. AT: "an empty island used for drying fishing nets" or "a deserted island where people dry out their fishing nets" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]]. AT: "this is what the Lord Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **she will become plunder for the nations** - "Plunder" means things that people steal or take by force. Here Tyre becoming plunder represents its wealth being carried off by other nations. AT: "the armies of the nations will take away every valuable thing from Tyre" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Her daughters who are in the fields will be slaughtered by the swords** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "The enemy armies will slaughter with swords her daughters who are in the fields" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Her daughters who are in the fields** - Possible meanings are 1) "Her daughters" were the young women of Tyre who were working in the fields or 2) "Her daughters" is a metonym for nearby towns and villages on the mainland that supported the main city of Tyre. AT: "Her daughter communities who are on the mainland" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **know that I am Yahweh** - When Yahweh says that people will know that he is Yahweh, he is implying that they will know that he is the one true God who has supreme authority and power. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:06:06|6:7]]. AT: "understand that I am Yahweh, the one true God" or "realize that I, Yahweh, have supreme power and authority" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
