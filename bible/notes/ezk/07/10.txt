===== Translation Notes: =====

These are Yahweh's words about Israel.

  * **Behold**  - This can be translated as “Look” or “Listen” or “Pay attention to what I am about to tell you.”
  * **The day is coming**  - "The day of your punishment is coming." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]
  * **Doom has gone forth**  - This shows the certainty that disasters will come to Israel. Alternate translations: "Disaster has begun to come to Israel" or "Terrible things have begun to happen."
  * **The rod has bloomed with the blossom of pride** -   "A flower has begun to grow on the stick and it has grown big with pride."  Here the rod represents either Israel or violence. Possible meanings are 1) "The people of Israel have grown very proud" or "The people of Israel have become very violent and very proud." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  *  **Violence has grown up into a rod of wickedness**  - "The people's violence has led them to do more wicked things"
