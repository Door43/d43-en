\v 26 Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumor shall be upon rumor; and they shall seek a vision of the prophet; but the
law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.
\v 27 The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be
troubled: I will do to them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am
Jehovah.
