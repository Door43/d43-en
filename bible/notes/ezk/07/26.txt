\q
\v 26 Disaster upon disaster will come, and there will be rumor after rumor! 
\q Then they will seek a vision from the prophet, but the law will perish from the priest and advice from the elders.
\q
\v 27 The king will mourn and the prince will dress in despair, 
\q while the hands of the people of the land will tremble in fear. According to their own ways I will do this to them! 
\q And I will judge them with their own standards until they know that I am Yahweh!"

===== Translation Notes: =====

These are Yahweh's words about Israel.

    * **They will seek a vision from the prophet**  - "They will ask the prophets what visions they have seen." 
    * **the Law will perish from the priest and counsel from the elders**  - "The priests will not teach the Law and the elders will not be able to give good counsel." This is because God will not give them wisdom.
    * **the prince will dress in despair**  - "The prince will be full of despair" or "the prince will not have any hope."  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
    * **hands of the people of the land will tremble in fear**  - "the people of the land will be so afraid that their hands will tremble" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
    * **know that I am Yahweh** - Possible meanings are 1) "understand who I, Yahweh, am" or 2) "understand that I am Yahweh, the one true God" or 3) "know that I, Yahweh, have the power to do what I say that I will do." (UDB)
