\v 26 Disaster upon disaster will come, and there will be rumor after rumor! 
\q Then they will seek a vision from the prophet, but the Law will perish from the priest and advice from the elders.

    * **the Law will perish from the priest and counsel from the elders**  - "The priests will not teach the Law and the elders will not be able to give good counsel." This is because God will not give them wisdom.

    * **hands of the people of the land will tremble in fear**  - "the people of the land will be so afraid that their hands will tremble" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
    * **know that I am Yahweh** - Possible meanings are 1) “understand who I, Yahweh, am” or 2) “understand that I am Yahweh, the one true God” or 3) “know that I, Yahweh, have the power to do what I say that I will do.” (UDB)
