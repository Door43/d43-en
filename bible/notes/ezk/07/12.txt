====== Ezekiel 07:12-13 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 Now is the time; that day has arrived.
\v 13 People who buy things should not rejoice \add because of buying things very cheaply\add*, and those who sell things should not be sad \add because they had to sell things cheaply\add*, because Yahweh will be punishing \f + \ft metonymy \f* everyone.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 Now is the time; that day has arrived. People who buy things should not rejoice because they bought things very cheaply and those who sell things should not be sad because they had to sell things cheaply, because Yahweh will be punishing everyone.
\v 13 People who sell some of their property will never be able to buy it back—they will not even be able to return to see it; because they have sinned, not one of them will succeed in staying alive.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 12 The time is coming; the day has come close. Do not let the buyer rejoice,
\q nor the seller mourn, since my anger is on the entire multitude!
\q
\v 13 For the seller will not return to the land he sold as long as they both live, 
\q because the vision concerning the entire multitude will not be reversed;
\q and because of their sins, none of them will be strengthened!
</usfm>
