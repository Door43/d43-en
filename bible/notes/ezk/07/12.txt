\v 13 People who buy things should not rejoice \add because of buying things very cheaply\add*, and those who sell things should not be sad \add because they had to sell things cheaply\add*, because Yahweh will be punishing \f + \ft metonymy \f* everyone.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 Now is the time; that day has arrived. People who buy things should not rejoice because they bought things very cheaply and those who sell things should not be sad because they had to sell things cheaply, because Yahweh will be punishing everyone.
\v 13 People who sell some of their property will never be able to buy it back—they will not even be able to return to see it; because they have sinned, not one of them will succeed in staying alive.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 12 The time is coming; the day has drawn near. Let not the buyer rejoice, 
\q nor the seller mourn, since my anger is upon the entire multitude!
\q
\v 13 For the seller will never return to that which is sold for as long as they live, 
\q since the vision is against the entire multitude; they will not return, 
\q for no man living in his sin will be strengthened!
</usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

These are Yahweh's words about Israel.

  * **The time is coming; the day has drawn near**  - Both "The time" and "the day" refer to the time when God will punish the people of Israel. Alternative translation: "Israel's punishment will happen very soon" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **the vision is against the entire multitude** - "what God has shown will happen to the the multitude"
  * **multitude** - a very large number of people. Here it refers to the people of Israel. 
  * **as long as they live** - The word "they" refers to the people of Israel who sell things.
  * **they will not return**  - "they will not go back to Israel." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **no man living in his sin will be strengthened**  - The word "strengthened" refers to God's helping a person to keep going when things are hard through hope, encouragement and physical energy. "no one alive who keeps disobeying God will be helped by God."
