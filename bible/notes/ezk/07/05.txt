  * **Disaster! Disaster after disaster. Behold, it is coming.** - "Behold, many disasters are coming to you" or "Behold, many terrible things will happen to you."
  * **Behold** - The word "behold" here adds emphasis to what follows. Alternate translations: "Look" or "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you."
