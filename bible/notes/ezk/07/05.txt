===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - These are Yahweh's words to the people of Israel.

  * **The Lord Yahweh says this** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to remind Ezekiel and the people that what he is saying is important. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:06:11|6:11]]. AT: "I, the Lord Yahweh, say this" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **Lord Yahweh** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:04|2:4]]. 
  * **Disaster! A unique disaster! Behold, it is coming.** - These exclamations are meant to make the passage very strong. AT: "Behold, a terrible disaster is coming, one that no one has ever experienced before"
  * **Behold** - The word "behold" here adds emphasis to what follows. AT: "Look" or "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you"
  * **The end has woken up against you** - The judgment that is coming is treated as if it were an enemy waking up from sleep. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **the mountains will no longer be joyful** - The word "mountains" is a metonym for the people who live on the mountains. AT: "the people on the mountains will not have any more joy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
