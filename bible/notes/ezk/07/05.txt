===== Translation Notes: =====

These are Yahweh's words to the people of Israel.

  * **Thus says the Lord Yahweh** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:05|5:5]].
  * **Disaster! Disaster after disaster! Behold, it is coming!** - "Behold, many disasters are coming to you" or "Behold, many terrible things will happen to you."
  * **Behold** - The word "behold" here adds emphasis to what follows. Alternate translations: "Look" or "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you."
  * **the end has woken up against you** - The judgment that is coming is treated as if it were an enemy waking up from sleep. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **the mountains will no longer be joyful** - "the people on the mountains will not have anymore joy."  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
