\v 17 \add Because they will be very afraid\add*, all the people's hands will become limp and their knees will become very weak.
\v 18 They will put on clothes made from rough cloth, and they will be terrified. Their faces will show that they are ashamed, and they will shave their heads \add to show that they are very sad\add*.
\v 19 They will throw their silver into the streets, and consider that their gold is only like \f + \ft simile \f* garbage, because they will realize that their silver and gold will not be able to rescue them when I, Yahweh, punish them. They will not be able to use their gold and silver to buy things to fill their stomachs, because having a lot of gold and silver has led them to sin.

<usfm>
\v 17 All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.
\v 18 They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and
baldness upon all their heads.
\v 19 They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be as an unclean thing; their silver and their gold
shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of Jehovah: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their
bowels; because it has been the stumbling block of their iniquity.
