<usfm>
\v 17 \add Because they will be very afraid\add*, all the people's hands will become limp and their knees will become very weak.
\v 18 They will put on clothes made from rough cloth, and they will be terrified. Their faces will show that they are ashamed, and they will shave their heads \add to show that they are very sad\add*.
\v 19 They will throw their silver into the streets, and consider that their gold is only like \f + \ft simile \f* garbage, because they will realize that their silver and gold will not be able to rescue them when I, Yahweh, punish them. They will not be able to use their gold and silver to buy things to fill their stomachs, because having a lot of gold and silver has led them to sin.

\v 17 Because they will be very afraid, all the people's hands will become limp and weak, and their knees will become very weak and unable to hold themselves up.
\v 18 They will put on clothes made from rough cloth, and they will be terrified. Their faces will show that they are ashamed, and they will shave their heads to show that they are very sad.
\v 19 They will throw their silver into the streets, and consider their gold the same way they would consider garbage, because they will realize that their silver and gold will not be able to rescue them when I, Yahweh, punish them.

\q
\v 17 Every hand will falter and every knee will be weak as water,
\q
\v 18 and they will wear sackcloth, and terror will cover them; 
\q and shame will be on every face, and baldness on all of their heads.
\q
\v 19 They will throw their silver into the streets and their gold will be like refuse. Their silver and their gold
\q will not be able to deliver them in the day of Yahweh's rage. Their life will not be saved, 
\q and their stomachs will not be filled, since their iniquity has become a stumbling block.

===== Translation Notes: =====

God continues his prophecy of judgment on Israel through  Ezekiel and tells how the people will react.

    * **Every hand will falter and every knee will be weak as water**  - These are both used to show how afraid people will be.  The word "falter" means fail or not work.  "Every hand will falter" means they will not be able to hold anything.  This passage is speaking of not being able to hold a sword to fight.  "Every knee will be weak as water" means they will not be able to use their knees.  This phrase is speaking of not being able to run. (See: [[en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit]])
    * **and terror will cover them** - The word "terror" refers to being afraid but is used as something that could physically cover them.  This shows how complete their fear is. "and they will be very afraid" (See:[[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
    * **in the day of Yahweh's rage** - "in the day when God acts on his anger"
    * **and their stomachs will not be filled**  - "and they will have no food to eat"
