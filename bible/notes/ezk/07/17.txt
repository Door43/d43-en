===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 \add Because they will be very afraid\add*, all the people's hands will become limp and their knees will become very weak.
\v 18 They will put on clothes made from rough cloth, and they will be terrified. Their faces will show that they are ashamed, and they will shave their heads \add to show that they are very sad\add*.
\v 19 They will throw their silver into the streets, and consider that their gold is only like \f + \ft simile \f* garbage, because they will realize that their silver and gold will not be able to rescue them when I, Yahweh, punish them. They will not be able to use their gold and silver to buy things to fill their stomachs, because having a lot of gold and silver has led them to sin.

\v 17 Because they will be very afraid, all the people's hands will become limp and weak, and their knees will become very weak and unable to hold them up.
\v 18 They will put on clothes made from rough cloth, and they will be terrified. Their faces will show that they are ashamed, and they will shave their heads to show that they are very sad.
\v 19 They will throw their silver into the streets, and consider their gold the same way they would consider garbage, because they will realize that their silver and gold will not be able to rescue them when I, Yahweh, punish them. They will not be able to buy food to fill their stomachs, because having a lot of gold and silver has led them to sin.

\q
\v 17 Every hand will falter and every knee will be weak as water,
\q
\v 18 and they will wear sackcloth, and terror will cover them; 
\q and shame will be on every face, and baldness on all of their heads.
\q
\v 19 They will throw their silver into the streets and their gold will be like refuse. Their silver and their gold
\q will not be able to rescue them in the day of Yahweh's rage. Their life will not be saved, 
\q and their stomachs will not be filled, since their iniquity has become a stumbling block.
