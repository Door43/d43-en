\v 20 They took jeweled ornaments in their pride and they formed idolatrous figures depicting their abominations—their detestable acts they performed with them,  
\q therefore, I am making these things unclean to them.
\q
\v 21 And I will give those things into the hand of strangers as plunder and to the wicked of the earth as plunder, 
\q and they will defile them.
\q
