===== Translation Notes: =====

These are Yahweh's words to the people of Israel.

  * **the end is upon you** - "your life is finished" or "the end of your time has arrived"
  * **according to your ways** -  "according to the things you do" or "because of the wicked things you do"
  * **I will bring all your abominations upon you** - "I will make you experience the consequences of your disgusting behavior" or "I will punish you for doing those things that I hate so much"
  * **abominations** - This refers here to behavior that God hates.
  * **For my eyes will not look compassionately at you** - "For I will not look at you with compassion"
  * **I will bring your ways upon you** - "I will make you experience the consequences of your bad behavior" or "I will punish you for the bad things you do."
  * **your abominations will be in your midst** - 1) "the consequences of your disgusting behavior will surround you" or 2) "your idols will be with you and powerless." Abominations here either refers to punishment for the behavior that God hates, or to their idols, which God hates. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]).
