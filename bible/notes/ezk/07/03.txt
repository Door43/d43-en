===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - These are Yahweh's words to the people of Israel.

  * **the end is upon you** - The "end" is spoken of as if it were a robber attacking the people. AT: "your life is finished" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **I am sending out my wrath on you** - "Wrath" is spoken of as if it were an arrow that Yahweh was shooting at the people. AT: "I am angry, and I will punish you"
  * **according to your ways** - "according to the things you do" or "because of the wicked things you do"
  * **I will bring all your abominations upon you** - "I will punish you for doing those things that I hate so much"
  * **For my eyes will not pity you** - The eye is a metonym for what the person thinks. AT: "For I will not look at you with compassion" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I will bring your ways upon you** - The way a person lives is spoken of as a path on which one walks. AT: "I will punish you for the things you have done" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **your abominations will be in your midst** - Possible meanings are 1) "I will punish all of you because of your abominations" or 2) "this will happen as long as you continue to worship idols."
  * **know that I am Yahweh** - When Yahweh says that people will know that he is Yahweh, he is implying that they will know that he is the one true God who has supreme authority and power.
