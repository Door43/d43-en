====== Ezekiel 07:14-16 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 People who sell some of their property will never be able to buy it back, because I, Yahweh, will never change my mind about what I have shown in a vision about \add destroying\add* all of you people.
\p
\v 15 \add When those things happen, your enemies'\add* will be outside \add the city\add* with their swords, and there will be plagues and famines inside \add the city\add*. Those \add who flee from the city\add* into the countryside will be killed by \add their enemies'\add* swords, and those who stay in the city will die from famines and plagues.
\v 16 Those who survive and escape will flee to the mountains, and they all will moan like doves because of their sins.
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 Your commanders will blow trumpets to get the army ready to fight, but no one will respond, because I will be angry at all the people.
\p
\v 15 When those things happen, your enemies' will be outside the city with their swords, and there will be plagues and famines inside the city. Those who are caught outside of the city in the fields will be killed by their enemies' swords, and those who are in the city will die from famines and plagues.
\v 16 Those who survive and escape will flee to the mountains, and they all will moan because of their sins, as doves moan.

\q
\v 14 They have blown the trumpet and made everything ready, but there is no one marching to battle; 
\q since my anger is on the entire multitude!
\q
\v 15 The sword is on the outside, and plague and famine are inside the building. 
\q Those who are in the field will die by the sword, while famine and plague will consume those in the city.
\q
\v 16 But some survivors will escape from among them, and they will go to the mountains. 
\q Like doves of the valleys, all of them will moan—each man for in his iniquity.

===== Translation Notes: =====

These are Yahweh's words about Israel.

  * **They have blown the trumpet** - "They have blown the trumpet to call people to fight against the enemy"
  * **A sword is on the outside**  - A sword represents battle or war. Alternate translation: "There is fighting outside." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **plague and famine are inside the building** - The building probably refers to the city.
  * **while famine and plague will consume those in the city**  - Here the word "consume" means "totally destroy." Alternate translation: "and most of the people in the city will die from hunger and sickness." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Like doves of the valleys, all of them will moan**  - Doves make a low-pitched noise that sounds like a moan. A moan is the sound a person makes when he has constant pain or deep sadness.
