  * **Now before long**  - "Very soon now"
  * **I will pour out my fury against you and fill up my wrath upon you**  - God is using the terms "pour out" and "fill up" to compare his acting in anger and completing his punishment with pouring out water and filling a jar. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **fury**  - "wrath" or "great anger"
  * **For my eye will not look compassionately**  - The phrase "my eye" means God himself. "For I will not look with compassion" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **I will not spare you**  - "I will not leave you without punishment" or "I will punish you"
  * **your abominations will be in your midst so you will know that I am Yahweh**  - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:07:03|7:4]].
