\v 48 Then he brought me to the entry room of the temple, and measured the walls on each side of the entrance: they were 8-3\f + \ft Or: 4 ft.( Or: 3 ).6 meters \f* thick. The entrance was 24-1\f + \ft Or: 2 ft., Or: 7.4 meters \f* wide, and the walls on each side of the entrance were 5 ft.\f + \ft Or: 1.6 meters \f* long.
\v 49 The entry room was 17-1\f + \ft Or: 2 ft., Or: 7.3 meters \f* wide on each side. There were ten steps up to it, and there were pillars on each side of the entrance.

\v 48 Then he brought me to the portico of the sanctuary and measured the doorposts and their walls on each side of the entrance; they were about two and three-quarters meters thick. The doorway was seven meters wide, and the sides on each side of it were one and three-fifths meters wide.
\v 49 The portico was eleven meters wide, and its depth was six meters on each side. There were steps leading up to it, and there were columns on each side of the portico.

\v 48 Then the man brought me to the portico of the house and measured its doorpostsâ€”they were five cubits thick on either side. The entryway itself was fourteen cubits in width, and the walls on each side of it were three cubits in width.
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa the walls on each side of it were three cubits in width \fqa* , the Hebrew text reads \fqa the entrance was three cubits in width \fqa* , but this seems to be a mistake, judging from the preceding words in this verse. \f*
\v 49 The length of the portico was twenty cubits, and its depth was eleven cubits. There were steps that went up to it and columns that stood on either side of it.
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa steps \fqa* , some ancient and modern versions read \fqa ten steps \fqa* . \f*
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa eleven cubits \fqa* , some ancient and modern versions read \fqa twelve cubits \fqa* . \f*
