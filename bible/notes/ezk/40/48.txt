===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 48 Then he brought me to the entry room of the temple, and measured the walls on each side of the entrance: they were 8-3\f + \ft Or: 4 ft.( Or: 3 ).6 meters \f* thick. The entrance was 24-1\f + \ft Or: 2 ft., Or: 7.4 meters \f* wide, and the walls on each side of the entrance were 5 ft.\f + \ft Or: 1.6 meters \f* long.
\v 49 The entry room was 17-1\f + \ft Or: 2 ft., Or: 7.3 meters \f* wide on each side. There were ten steps up to it, and there were pillars on each side of the entrance.

\v 48 Then he brought me to the portico of the sanctuary and measured the doorposts and their walls on each side of the entrance; they were about 2.7 meters thick. The doorway was about seven meters wide, and the sides on each side of it were about 1.6 meters wide.
\v 49 The portico was about eleven meters wide, and its depth was about six meters on each side. There were steps leading up to it, and there were columns on each side of the portico.

\v 48 Then the man brought me to the portico of the house and measured its doorposts—they were five cubits thick on either side. The entryway itself was fourteen cubits wide, and the walls on each side of it were three cubits wide.
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa the walls on each side of it were three cubits wide \fqa* , the Hebrew text reads \fqa the entrance was three cubits wide \fqa* , but this seems to be a mistake, judging from the preceding words in this verse. |f*
\v 49 The sanctuary's portico was twenty cubits long, and its depth was eleven cubits. There were steps that went up to it and columns that stood on either side of it.
