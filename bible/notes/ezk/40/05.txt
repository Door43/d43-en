\v 5 \add In the vision I saw that\add* there was a wall that completely surrounded the temple area. The measuring stick in the man's hand was 10.5 ft.\f + \ft Or: 3.2 meters \f* long. He measured the wall: it was 10.5 ft. thick and 10.5 ft.high.
\p
\v 6 Then he went to gate on the east side \add of the temple\add*. He climbed the steps and measured the threshold\f + \ft Or: opening \f* for the gate: it was 10.5 ft. thick and 10.5 ft. high. There were alcoves\f + \ft Or: very small rooms \f* where the guards stood on each side of the gateway; the alcoves were built into the walls. Each of the alcoves was 10.5 ft. on each side. There was a distance of 8.7 5 ft.\f + \ft Or: 2.7 meters \f* between each alcove along the wall.
\v 7 The inner threshold\f + \ft Or: opening \f* for the gate, which led to the entry room at the inner end of the hall facing the temple, was 10.5 ft. long.

\v 5 In the vision I saw that there was a wall that completely surrounded the temple area. The measuring stick in the man's hand was about 3.2 meters long. He measured the wall; it was about 3.2 meters thick and about 3.2 meters high. 
\p
\v 6 Then he went to the gate in the temple wall on the temple's east side. He climbed the steps and measured the gateway that faced outward; it was about 3.2 meters deep.
\v 7 Next, there were alcoves for the temple guards, each being about 3.2 meters long and deep. The distance of the wall between each alcove was about 2.7 meters. The gateway that faced inward, which led to the temple portico, was also about 3.2 meters deep.

\p
\v 5 There was a wall surrounding the temple complex, and there was a measuring stick in the man's hand, six cubits in length—each "long" cubit equaling a cubit and a handbreadth. The man measured the width of the wall—one stick—and the height—one stick.
\v 6 Then he went to the temple gate that faced east and up its steps. He measured the threshold of the gate—one stick in depth.
\v 7 The guards' niches were each one stick long and one stick wide; there were five cubits between any two of the niches, and the threshold of the temple gate by the temple portico was one stick deep.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **surrounding the temple complex** - "going all the way around the temple area"
  * **six cubits in length** - "six cubits long." This was about 3.2 meters. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bdistance]])
  * **each "long" cubit equaling a cubit and a handbreadth** - Each long cubit was about 54 centimeters. You may choose not to include this information if you give modern measurements instead of "cubits" as the UDB does. AT: "these were the long cubits, which were the length of a regular cubit plus a handbreadth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bdistance]])
  * **handbreadth** - "the width of a hand." This was about 8 centimeters. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bdistance]])
  * **the width of the wall** - "how wide the wall was." The wall was hollow like a building.
  * **one stick** - "it was one stick wide." This was about 3.2 meters.
  * **the height—one stick** - AT: "and one stick high" 
  * **up its steps** - "and he went up the steps of the gate"
  * **in depth** - "from the front edge of the threshold to the back edge"
  * **The guards' niches** - These were like open rooms that were built inside of the gate where guards stayed to protect the gate.
  * **five cubits** - about 2.7 meters (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bdistance]])
  * **between any two of the niches** - "between the rooms"
  * **portico** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:08:16|8:16]].
