====== Ezekiel 40:5-7 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 \add In the vision I saw that\add* there was a wall that completely surrounded the temple area. The measuring stick in the man's hand was 10.5 ft.\f + \ft Or: 3.2 meters \f* long. He measured the wall: it was 10.5 ft. thick and 10.5 ft.high.
\p
\v 6 Then he went to gate on the east side \add of the temple\add*. He climbed the steps and measured the threshold\f + \ft Or: opening \f* for the gate: it was 10.5 ft. thick and 10.5 ft. high. There were alcoves\f + \ft Or: very small rooms \f* where the guards stood on each side of the gateway; the alcoves were built into the walls. Each of the alcoves was 10.5 ft. on each side. There was a distance of 8.7 5 ft.\f + \ft Or: 2.7 meters \f* between each alcove along the wall.
\v 7 The inner threshold\f + \ft Or: opening \f* for the gate, which led to the entry room at the inner end of the hall facing the temple, was 10.5 ft. long.

\v 5 In the vision I saw that there was a wall that completely surrounded the temple area. The measuring stick in the man's hand was three and one-tenth meters long. He measured the wall and it was three and one-tenth meters thick and three and one-tenth meters high.
\p
\v 6 Then he went to the gate in the temple wall on the temple's east side. He climbed the steps and measured the gateway that faced outward; it was three and one-tenth meters deep.
\v 7 Next, there were alcoves for the temple guards, each being three and one-tenth meters long and deep. The distance of the wall between each alcove was two and three-quarters  meters. The gateway that faced inward, which led to the temple portico, was also three and one-tenth meters deep.

===== ULB: =====

\p
\v 5 There was a wall surrounding the temple area. The length of the measuring stick in the man's hand was six long cubits. Each long cubit was a cubit and a handbreadth in length. So he measured the wall, and it was one measuring stick thick and one rod high. 
\v 6 Then he went to the temple gate that faced east. He went up its steps and measured the threshold of the gate—one stick in depth.
\f + \ft After \fqa one stick in depth \fqa* , the Hebrew text reads in addition: \fqa one threshold one stick in depth" \fqa* . Many modern versions, however, leave this expression out, because it seems to be a repetition of preceding text. \f*

\v 7 The guard chambers were each one stick in length and one stick in width; there were five cubits between any two of the chambers, and the threshold of the temple gate by the temple portico was one stick deep.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **surrounding the temple area** - "entirely around the temple area"
  * **Each long cubit was a cubit and a handbreadth in length** - Each "long cubit" was about 54 centimeters. You may choose not to include this information if you give modern measurements instead of "cubits" as the UDB does. AT: "These were the long cubits, which were the length of a regular cubit plus a handbreadth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bdistance]])
  * **handbreadth** - "the width of a hand." This was about 8 centimeters. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bdistance]])
  * **one stick** - "it was one stick wide." This was about 3.2 meters.
  * **the temple gate that faced east** - This gate was part of the wall that surrounded the temple area. It was not part of the temple building itself. AT: "the gate on the eastern side of the wall" or "the gate on the east side of the temple wall" 
  * **up its steps** - "up the steps of the gate"
  * **in depth** - "from the front edge of the threshold to its back edge"
  * **The guard chambers** - These were rooms that were built inside of the gate where guards stayed to protect the gate.
  * **five cubits** - about 2.7 meters (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bdistance]])
  * **there were five cubits between any two of the chambers** - "the chambers next to each other were five cubits apart" or "there were five cubits between a chamber and the one next to it"
  * **the chambers** - "the rooms"
  * **portico** - This was a covering in front of an entrance with columns or posts for support. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:08:16|8:16]].
