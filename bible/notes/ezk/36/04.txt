\v 4 Therefore, mountains of Israel, listen to the word of the Lord Yahweh, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh to the mountains and the high hills, to the stream beds and valleys, to the uninhabited desolations and the forsaken cities that have become plunder and a derision to the remnant of the nations that surround them:
\v 5 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: Surely in the fires of my fury I have spoken against the remnants of the nations, against Edom and all who take my land for themselves as a possession with joy in every heart and disdain in their spirits to cast Jerusalem out as plunder.
\v 6 Therefore, prophesy to the land of Israel and say to the mountains and to the high hills, to the stream beds and to the valleys, thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold! In my fury and in my anger I have declared this according to your bearing the insult of nations.
