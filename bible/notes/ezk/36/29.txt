===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Israel.

  * **I will summon the grain** - "I will call the grain to come." This phrase presents the grain as a servant of Yahweh. AT: "will cause there to be grain in the land of Israel." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **you will no longer bear the shame of famine among the nations** - "the nations will no longer make you feel ashamed because you suffer from famine" 
  * **disgusting deeds** - See how you translated "disgusting actions" in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:05:09|5:9]].
