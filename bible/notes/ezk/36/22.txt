\v 22 Therefore, say to the Israelite people, 'This is what Yahweh the Lord says: You Israelite people, it is not for your sake that I am going to do these things. Instead, it is for the sake of my sacred reputation, which you have disgraced among the nations to which you were forced to go.
\v 23 I will show that my reputation is sacred, a reputation which you have disgraced among the nations to which you were forced to go. And when I show the nations that I am holy, the people of those nations will know that I, Yahweh, \add have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*.
