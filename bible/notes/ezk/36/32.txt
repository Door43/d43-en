\v 32 But I, Yahweh the Lord, declare that I want you to know that it is not for your sake that I will do those things. You Israelite people ought to be ashamed of your behavior.

\v 33 This is also what I, Yahweh the Lord, say: At the time that I forgive you for all the sins that you have committed, I will enable you to live in your towns again and to build houses where there are now only ruins.
\v 34 People who walk through your country will see that your land is again cultivated instead of being desolate\f + \ft Or: having nothing growing in them \f*.

\p
\v 32 I am not doing this for your sake’—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration. ‘Let it be known to you: Be ashamed and disgraced in your ways, house of Israel.
\v 33 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: On the day that I purify you from all your iniquity, I will cause you to inhabit the cities and to rebuild the ruined places.
\v 34 For you will plow the ruined land until it is no longer a ruin before the eyes of all who pass by.
