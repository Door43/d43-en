====== Ezekiel 36:32-34 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 32 But I, Yahweh the Lord, declare that I want you to know that it is not for your sake that I will do those things. You Israelite people ought to be ashamed of your behavior.
\p
\v 33 This is also what I, Yahweh the Lord, say: At the time that I forgive you for all the sins that you have committed, I will enable you to live in your towns again and to build houses where there are now only ruins.
\v 34 People who walk through your country will see that your land is again cultivated instead of being desolate\f + \ft Or: having nothing growing in them \f*.
</usfm>

<usfm>
\v 32 But I, the Lord Yahweh, tell you this: It is not for your sake that I will do those things. You Israelite people ought to be ashamed of your behavior.
\p
\v 33 I, the Lord Yahweh, also tell you this: At the time that I cleanse you from all the sins that you have committed, I will enable you to live in your cities again and to build houses where there are now only ruins.
\v 34 People who walk through your country will see that you are once again cultivating your land, and that your people are living in it again.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 32 I am not doing this for your sake—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration—let this be known to you. So be ashamed and disgraced because of your ways, house of Israel.
\v 33 The Lord Yahweh says this: On the day that I purify you from all your iniquity, I will cause you to inhabit the cities and to rebuild the ruined places.
\v 34 For you will plow the ruined land until it is no longer a ruin before the eyes of all who pass by.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Israel.

  * **for your sake** - "for you"
  * **this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]]. AT: "this is what the Lord Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **let this be known to you** - "know this" or "you can be sure of this." Yahweh says this to emphasize that it is not because the people are good that he will restore them. This phrase can be moved to the beginning of the verse. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **So be ashamed and disgraced** - The words "ashamed" and "disgraced" share similar meanings. Together they emphasize the intensity of the shame. AT: "So be very ashamed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **because of your ways** - "because of what you do"
  * **house of Israel** - Here "house" represents people. AT: "people of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **you will plow the ruined land** - "you will farm the ruined land"
  * **before the eyes of all who pass by** - The eyes represent sight. AT: "to those who pass by and see it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
