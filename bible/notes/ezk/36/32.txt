\v 32 But I, Yahweh the Lord, declare that I want you to know that it is not for your sake that I will do those things. You Israelite people ought to be ashamed of your behavior.

\v 33 This is also what I, Yahweh the Lord, say: At the time that I forgive you for all the sins that you have committed, I will enable you to live in your towns again and to build houses where there are now only ruins.
\v 34 People who walk through your country will see that your land is again cultivated instead of being desolate\f + \ft Or: having nothing growing in them \f*.

\v 32 I am not doing this for your sake’—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration. ‘Let this be known to you. So be ashamed and disgraced because of your ways, house of Israel.'
\v 33 The Lord Yahweh says this: 'On the day that I purify you from all your iniquity, I will cause you to inhabit the cities and to rebuild the ruined places.
\v 34 For you will plow the ruined land until it is no longer a ruin before the eyes of all who pass by.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Israel.

    * **for your sake** - "for you"
    * **this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]].
    * **Let this be known to you** - AT: "Know this" or "You can be sure of this." Yahweh says this to emphasize that it is not because the people are good that he will restore them. This phrase can be moved to the beginning of the verse. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
    * **So be ashamed and disgraced** - The words "ashamed" and "disgraced" mean the same thing. AT: "So be very ashamed." (See:[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
    * **in your ways** - "because of your ways" of "because of what you do"
    * **house of Israel** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:01|3:1]].
    * **Thus says the Lord Yahweh** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:05|5:5]].
    * **you will plow the ruined land** -  "you will farm the ruined land"
    * **before the eyes of all who pass by** - AT: "and all who travel in the land will see it." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
