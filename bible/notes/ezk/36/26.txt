===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Israel.

  * **a new heart and a new spirit** - See how you translated "heart" and "spirit" in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:11:19|11:19]].  
  * **in your innermost parts** - "within you" or "inside of you"
  * **the heart of stone** - This compares the people's stubborn hearts to hard stone. AT: "the heart that is as hard as stone." See how you translated "stone heart" in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:11:19|11:19]].  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **your flesh** - "your body"
  * **a heart of flesh** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:11:19|11:19]]. This is a heart that is not stubborn, but is willing to obey God.
