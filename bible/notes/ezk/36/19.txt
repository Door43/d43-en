\v 19 So I made their enemies scatter them into other lands. I punished them as  they deserved to be punished because they had done so many evil things.
\v 20 Wherever they went among those lands, they caused caused other people to mock me. Those people have been saying, 'The Israelites belong to Yahweh, but he was not strong enough to protect them. They had to leave the land that he had given to them.'
\v 21 The people of Israel had disgraced me among the people-groups to which they had to go, but I want those people-groups to respect me instead.

\v 19 I scattered them among the nations; they were dispersed through the lands. I judged them according to their ways and their deeds.
\v 20 Then they went to the nations, and wherever they went, they profaned my holy name when people said of them, ‘Are these really the people of Yahweh? For they have been thrown out of his land.’
\v 21 But I had compassion on account of my holy name that the house of Israel had defiled among the nations, when they went there.
