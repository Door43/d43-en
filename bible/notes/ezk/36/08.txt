===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues Yahweh's message to the mountains of Israel.

  * **you will grow branches and bear fruit** -  AT: "your trees will grow will grow branches and bear fruit."
  * **Behold**  - The word “behold” here adds emphasis to what follows. AT: “Indeed”
  * **I am for you** - "I want to do good things to you." The word "you" refers to the mountains of Israel.
  * **and I treat you with favor** - "I will be kind to you" (UDB)
  * **you will be plowed and sown with seed** - AT: "My people, Israel, will plow your ground and sow it with seed." To plow means to cut rows in the ground in order to plant seeds in them. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
