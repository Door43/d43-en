===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues Yahweh's message to the mountains of Israel.

  * **I will lift up my hand to swear** - AT: "I lift up my hand and swear" or "I have sworn." Lifting up the hand shows that he will truly do what he has sworn.
  * **that the nations that surround you will certainly carry their own shame** - AT: "that people will certainly mock the nations that surround you"
  * **surround you** - The word "you" refers to the mountains of Israel.
