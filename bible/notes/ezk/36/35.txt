\v 35 They will say, 'This land that was ruined has become \add very fertile\f + \ft Or: productive \f*\add* like \f + \ft simile \f* the garden of Eden. The cities that were piles of ruins, empty and destroyed, now have walls around them, and people live in those cities.'
\v 36 When that happens, the people in the nations that are around you that still exist will know that it is I, Yahweh, who have enabled you to rebuild what was destroyed, and to again plant crops in the fields that had nothing growing in them. I, Yahweh, have said \add that it will happen\add*, and I will cause it to happen.'

\v 35 Then they will say, "This land that was ruined has become very fertile, like the garden of Eden. The cities that were piles of ruins, empty and destroyed, now have houses around them, and people are living in those cities."
\v 36 When that happens, the people who are still left in the lands that are around you will know that it is I, Yahweh, who have enabled you to rebuild what was destroyed, and to again plant crops in the fields that had nothing growing in them. I, Yahweh, have said that it will happen, and I will cause it to happen.

\v 35 Then they will say, "This land was desolate, but it has become like the garden of Eden; the desolate cities and the uninhabited ruins that were inaccessible are now inhabited."
\v 36 Then the other nations around you will know that I am Yahweh, that I built up the ruins and replanted the abandoned places. I am Yahweh. I have declared it and I will do it.
