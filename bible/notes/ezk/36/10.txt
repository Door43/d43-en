    * **they will multiply and be fruitful** - "they will become very many people and have very many children"
    * **you to be inhabited as you previously were** - "people to live on you mountains as they did before"
    * **will know that I am Yahweh** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:06:06|6:7]].

    * **you will no longer cause their children to die** - It is implied that in the past children died because there was not enough food in the land. Now the land would produce enough food. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
