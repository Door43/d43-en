\v 11 I will cause the number of people and domestic animals to increase. People will have many children [IDI, DOU].

Then you will know that it is I, Yahweh, \add who have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*.
\v 12 I will enable my Israelite people to walk through your mountains. They will own you; you will be their permanent possession. Never again will their children die.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This continues Yahweh's message to the mountains of Israel. The message is intended for the people of Israel.

  * **So I will multiply upon you** - Yahweh is speaking to the mountains. This can be stated explicitly. AT: "So, mountains of Israel, I will multiply upon you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **even the whole house of Israel** - Here "house" represents people. AT: "all of the people of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **The cities will be inhabited and the ruins rebuilt** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Then people will live in the cities and will rebuild the ruins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) 
  * **they will multiply and be fruitful** - Here "be fruitful" is an idiom that means to have many children and descendants. AT: "they will become very many people and have very many children" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **you to be inhabited as you previously were** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "people to live on you mountains as they did before" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) 
  * **know that I am Yahweh** - When Yahweh says that people will know that he is Yahweh, he is implying that they will know that he is the one true God who has supreme authority and power. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:06:06|6:7]]. AT: "understand that I am Yahweh, the one true God" or "realize that I, Yahweh, have supreme power and authority" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **They will possess you, and you will be their inheritance** - The people living in the mountains and land of Israel permanently is spoke of as if the people would inherit them. AT: "They will possess you permanently" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you will no longer cause their children to die** - It is implied that in the past children died because there was not enough food in the land. Now the land would produce enough food. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
