\v 2 This is what Yahweh the Lord says: Your enemies \add happily\add* said about you, 'Aha! The mountains of Israel that have existed for a long time have become ours!'
\v 3 Therefore prophesy about those mountains and say, 'This is what Yahweh the Lord declares: \add Armies of other nations\add* attacked you \f + \ft doublet \f* from every direction, with the result that your land became abandoned, and people of other nations occupied you, and they spoke maliciously about you and slandered you.

<usfm>
\v 1 Yahweh said to Ezekiel, "Son of man, give a message to the hill country and mountains in Israel just as if they were people. Tell them to listen to my message for them.
\v 2 This is it: the enemies of Israel, those people groups who live nearby, are now very happy, because they are saying that Jerusalem has been destroyed, so the hill country and mountains of Israel will now belong to them.
\v 3 So you, Ezekiel, must tell the mountains of Israel what I, the Lord Yahweh, am saying to them: 'Armies of other nations attacked you from every direction, and everyone has left you. Those foreign armies are now in your land. They have spoken very maliciously about your people, the Israelites, and have told all kinds of lies about them.

\v 2 The Lord Yahweh says this: The enemy has said about you, "Aha!" and "The ancient high places have become our possession."'
\v 3 Therefore prophesy and say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Because of your desolation and because of the attacks that came on you from all sides, you have become a possession of the other nations; you have been the subject of slanderous lips and tongues, and of people's stories.
