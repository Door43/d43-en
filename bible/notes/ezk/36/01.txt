\v 2 This is what Yahweh the Lord says: Your enemies \add happily\add* said about you, 'Aha! The mountains of Israel that have existed for a long time have become ours!'
\v 3 Therefore prophesy about those mountains and say, 'This is what Yahweh the Lord declares: \add Armies of other nations\add* attacked you \f + \ft doublet \f* from every direction, with the result that your land became abandoned, and people of other nations occupied you, and they spoke maliciously about you and slandered you.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Yahweh said to Ezekiel, "Son of man, give a message to the hill country and mountains in Israel just as if they were people. Tell them to listen to my message for them.
\v 2 This is it: The enemies of Israel, those people groups who live nearby, are now very happy, because they are saying that Jerusalem has been destroyed, so the ancient mountains of Israel will now belong to them.
\v 3 So you, Ezekiel, must tell the mountains of Israel what I, the Lord Yahweh, am saying to them: 'Armies of other nations attacked you from every direction, and everyone has left you. Those foreign armies are now in your land. They have spoken very maliciously about your people, the Israelites, and have told all kinds of lies about them.

\v 2 The Lord Yahweh says this: The enemy has said about you, "Aha!" and "The ancient high places have become our possession."'
\v 3 Therefore prophesy and say, 'The Lord Yahweh says this: Because of your desolation and because of the attacks that came on you from all sides, you have become a possession of the other nations; you have been the subject of slanderous lips and tongues, and of people's stories.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh tells Ezekiel to speak a prophecy. Ezekiel is to speak to the mountains of Israel, but the message is for all of the people of Israel.

  * **son of man** - "son of a human being" or "son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01|2:1]]. AT: "mortal person" or "human"
  * **prophesy to the mountains of Israel** - God wants Ezekiel to speak to the mountains as if they were people. The message is for the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **Aha** - This is an expression of joy. It can be translated as "I am very happy" or "This is great."
  * **The ancient high places** - "The very old mountains." This refers to the high mountains of Israel.  
  * **have become our possession** - "now belong to us"
  * **Because of your desolation** - The abstract noun "desolation" can be stated as "desolate." AT: "Because you, mountains of Israel, have become desolate" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **because of the attacks that came on you from all sides** - "because you were attacked from every direction" or "because your enemies attacked you from every direction"
  * **you have been the subject of slanderous lips and tongues, and of people's stories** - Here, "lips" and "tongues" represent people speaking. AT: "people are saying bad things about you, and the nations are telling bad stories about you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
