===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking to Ezekiel.

    * **I will show myself to the house of Israel when I do this for them** - Possible meanings are 1) "I will let Israel know me when I do this for them" 2) "I will let Israel ask me to do this for them"
    * **when I multiply their population like sheep** - "I will make them multiply like a flock of sheep." Sheep multiply very quickly. AT: "I will make the people multiply quickly like sheep." ([[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
    * **will know that I am Yahweh** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:06:06|6:7]].
