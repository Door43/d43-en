====== Ezekiel 36:13-15 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 This is also what I, Yahweh the Lord, say to you, \add my people\add*: People say that only a small amount of food is produced on your mountains, and as a result your children die from hunger.
\v 14 Therefore, I, Yahweh the Lord, declare that no longer will that happen.
\v 15 No longer will the people of other nations ridicule you; no longer will they laugh at you; no longer will \add the armies of\add* other nations conquer you. \add That will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have declared that it will happen.'~"

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 I, Yahweh the Lord, am telling you mountains this: It is true that people have said they could not grow many crops on you, and so they died from hunger.
\v 14 But that will no longer happen.
\v 15 No longer will the other people groups ridicule you mountains. No longer will they laugh at you; no longer will you mountains make your nation suffer defeat. I, the Lord Yahweh, am telling you this myself.'"

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 The Lord Yahweh says this: Because they are saying to you, "You devour people, and your nation's children have died,"
\v 14 therefore you will not consume people any longer, and you will no longer make your nation mourn their deaths. This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration.
\v 15 Nor will I allow you to hear the insults of the nations any longer; you will no longer have to bear the shame of the peoples or cause your nation to fall—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration.'"

  * **they are saying to you** - "other nations are saying to you mountains"
