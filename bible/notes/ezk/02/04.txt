===== Translation Notes: =====

God continues to speak to Ezekiel.

  * **Their children**  - The word "their" refers to the past generations of Israel who had rebelled against God.  The word "children" refers to current generation of people living in Israel.
  * **stubborn faces and hard hearts**  - These two descriptions are both used to describe the people of Israel not wanting to change how they live in order to obey God.  (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **they have stubborn faces** - "the expression on their faces shows that they are stubborn" or "they are stubborn" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **stubborn** - "unwilling to change"
  * **hard hearts**  - This phrase suggests the people's resistance to God and their unwillingness to obey him.  The heart is used to describe the place in the body where a person decides what they want to do. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **They are a rebellious house**  - "They are a people who disobey God"
