  * **Their descendants** - The descendants of the past generations of Israel who had rebelled against God, referring to the people living in Israel at the time Ezekiel writes.
  * **stubborn faces and hard hearts** - The words "stubborn faces" refers to the way they act on the outside, and the words "heard hearts" refers to the way they think and feel. Together they emphasize that the people of Israel would not change how they lived in order to obey God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
