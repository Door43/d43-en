===== Translation Notes: =====

Ezekiel continues to tell about the vision that he saw.

  * **The voice**  - The phrase "the voice" refers to God speaking to Ezekiel.
  * **Son of man**  - God called Ezekiel this to emphasize Ezekiel's humanity. God is powerful, but people are not. It can also be translated as "Man" or "Human."
  * **to the people of Israel, to rebellious nations** - "to the Israelites, to rebellious peoples" or "to the people of Israel, who are rebellious."
  * **up to this very day**  - This means that the people of Israel were continuing to disobey God. Alternate translation: "even now" or "even today."
