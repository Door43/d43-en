===== Translation Notes: =====

These verses are a continuation of Ezekiel's lament to the King of Egypt, meaning the Egypt nation.

  * **For I will give your flesh to the mountains and fill the valleys with your corpses** - "The mountains and the valleys will be filled with your dead bodies." - This metaphor shows the extent to which Yahweh will completely destroy the people to the extent that their body parts will be scattered and divided. (See: Metaphor). This shows the extent of God's judgment. (See: Hyperbole).
  * **Then I will irrigate the land of your infection up to the mountains with your blood** - "Your bodies, bones, and blood will be spread out through the land".
  * **And the stream beds will be filled with you!** - "and the canals and rivers where water runs will be filled with human parts." This shows how, after God's judgment, he will leave a reminder to other peoples and nations. (See: Personification).
