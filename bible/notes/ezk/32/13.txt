===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking.
  * **all the livestock** - Livestock are animals that people have to eat and for other reasons. Cows, sheep, and goats are all livestock.
  * **from beside the plentiful waters** - "from the places where there is a lot of water"
  * **the foot of man** - "the feet of people"
  * **Then I will calm their waters** - Possible meanings are 1) "I will make the water calm" or 2) "I will make the water clear."  When no one stirs up the water, the dirt settles down and the water becomes clear.
  * **make their rivers run like oil** - Oil flows slowly and smoothly. AT: "make the rivers run smoothly like oil"  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]].
