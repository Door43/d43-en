===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to speak to Pharaoh.

  * **each warrior a terror of nations** - Here "terror" represents a cause of terror or fear. AT: "Each warrior terrifies the nations" or "each one of them makes the nations afraid" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **will devastate the pride of Egypt** - Stopping the Egyptians from being proud of their wealth and power is spoken of as destroying their pride. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **destroy all of its multitudes** - Here "all"  is probably a generalization that refers to the killing of large numbers of soldiers, and perhaps other people also. AT: "kill a very large number of people who live in Egypt" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
