\v 26 There is Meshech, Tubal, and all their multitude; their graves are round about them; all of them uncircumcised, slain by
the sword; for they caused their terror in the land of the living.
\v 27 And they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the uncircumcised, that are gone down to Sheol with their
weapons of war, and have laid their swords under their heads, and their iniquities are upon their bones; for
they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.
