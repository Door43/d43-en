\v 26 Corpses of all the soldiers of the lands of Meshech and Tubal will be there, surrounded by the graves of a huge crowd of their servants. While they were alive, they also caused people in many places to be terrified. They were all godless people whom their enemies will have killed.
\v 27  They will surely lie there, along with other godless soldiers who have died. Their shields will be with their bodies, and their swords will lie under their heads.
While they were alive, they terrified many people on earth, so I will be punish them for their sins.

\q
\v 26 Meshech, Tubal, and all their servants are there! Their graves surround them!
\q All of them are uncircumcised, killed by the sword, because they had brought their terrors on the land of the living!
\q
\v 27 Do they not lie with the fallen warriors of the uncircumcised who have gone down to sheol
\q with all their weapons of war, and with their swords placed under their heads
\q and their shields placed on their bones? For they were the terror of warriors in the land of the living!

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking to Ezekiel about nations in Sheol.

  * **all their servants** - Possible meanings are 1) "all their army" or 2) "all their many people."
  * **Their graves surround them** – See how you translated "her graves around her" in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:32:22|32:22]].
  * **All of them...land of the living** - See how you translated "All of them...land of the living" in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:32:24|32:25]].
  * **Do they not lie** - Possible meanings are 1) this is the beginning of a rhetorical question that emphasizes that the people of Meshech and Tubal are dead or 2) this is a statement that says that they will not lie in honor with their weapons and swords. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **And their shields placed on their bones** - Possible meanings are 1) "And with their shields placed on their bones or 2) "But with their sins on their bones." If it is about their sins, it would mean that they still had a lot of guilt. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]) 
  * **For they were the terror of warriors in the land of the living** - AT: "because, while they were still alive, they made warriors very afraid"
