  * **All of them were killed by the sword** - AT: "All of them died by the sword" or "All of them had died in battle." See how you translated "who had been killed by the sword" in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:31:17|31:17]].
  * **are set in the recesses of the pit** - "are in the deepest part of the pit"
  * **all those who were killed, who fell by the sword** - AT: "all those whom enemies killed with swords" or "all those who died when enemies killed them in battle (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **those who brought terror on the land of the living** - "those who had caused people in the land of the living to be very afraid." AT: "those who, when they were still alive, caused people to be extremely afraid"
