\v 1 Almost twelve years after the Babylonians had taken us Israelites to their land, Yahweh gave me another message, on the first day of the twelfth month of that year. He told me,
\v 2 "Son of man, sing a sad song about Pharaoh the king of Egypt. Sing this to him:
\q1 'People think that you are like a lion among the nations;
\q1 but you are like a sea monster in the river
\q2 thrashing around in the water,
\q2 churning up the water with your feet
\q2 and making all the water muddy.
