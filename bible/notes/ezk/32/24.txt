\v 24 A great number of the people of Elam will be there. They also were killed by \add their enemies'\add* swords. They had caused people in many places \f + \ft hyperbole \f* to be terrified. At that time they will lie there in that deep pit below the earth, and they, along with the others who have gone there, will be disgraced.

\v 24 Many, many people from the country of Elam will be there, too, and Elam's servants, because their enemies will have killed them. These were soldiers who had terrified people in many places. At that time they will lie there in that deep pit below the earth, and they, along with the others who have gone there, will be disgraced.

\q
\v 24 Elam is there with all her servants! Her graves surround her; all of them were killed!
\q Those who fell by the sword, who have gone down uncircumcised to the lowest parts of the earth,
\q who brought their terrors on the land of the living and who now carry their own shame with them, they are going down to the pit!
\q
\v 25 They set a bedroll for Elam and all her servants in the midst of the killed; her graves surround her!
\q All of them are uncircumcised, those killed by the sword, those who brought their terrors to the land of the living!
\q So they carry their own shame with them, together with the ones going down to the pit among all those who have been killed, those who are going down to the pit. Elam is among all those who were killed.
