===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues telling Pharaoh what he will do to Egypt.

  * **Then when I put out your lamp** - "when I snuff out your flame." Yahweh  compares the way he will destroy Pharaoh to the way he would put out the flame of a lamp. AT: "When I destroy you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will cover the heavens** - Yahweh will cover the sky so that people on earth cannot see the light of the stars, sun and moon.
  * **darken its stars** - "I will make the stars dark." They will have no light.
  * **I will put darkness over your land** - "I will make it dark in your land"
  * **This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]].
