\v 31 The king of Egypt and all his army will see them, and they will be comforted about the death of their servants, because they know that there were other huge groups of people whom their enemies killed.
\v 32 While that king was living, I allowed him to terrify others in many countries, but he and his huge army will be there among other godless people whom their enemies have killed." This will certainly surely happen because the Lord Yahweh has said that it would happen.
