They were godless, and they will lie there along with others whom their enemies will have killed. They, along with everyone else who goes down into that deep pit, will be disgraced.

\v 30 The princes of the north are there â€”all of them and all the Sidonians who went down with the dead! They were powerful and made others to be afraid, but now they lie there in shame, uncircumcised with those who were killed by the sword. They carry their own shame, together with the others who are going down to the pit.
