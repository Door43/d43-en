===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to speak to Pharaoh and to compare him to a monster that lives in the water.

  * **The Lord Yahweh says this** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:05|5:5]].
  * **So I will spread my net over you in the assembly of many peoples** -  AT: "So I will gather many peoples and throw my net over you." ([[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **they will lift you up in my net** -  AT: "using my net, the peoples will pull you up out of the water" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **I will abandon you in the land** - "I will leave you helpless on the land." The monster that was scary when it was in the water cannot do anything when it is left on dry land. 
  * **all the birds of heaven** - "all the birds that fly in the sky"
  * **the hunger of all living animals on earth will be satisfied by you** - AT: "I will let all the animals of the earth eat your body until they are not hungry anymore" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
