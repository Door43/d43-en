<usfm>
\v 15 When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate and waste, a land destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall strike
all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I am Jehovah.
\v 16 This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament; the daughters of the nations shall lament therewith; over Egypt, and
over all her multitude, shall they lament therewith, says the Lord Jehovah.
