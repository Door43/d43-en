===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 When I cause Egypt to become empty\f + \ft Or: desolate \f*
\q2 and strip off everything that grows on the land,
\q1 and when I get rid of all the people who live there,
\q2 people will know that it is I, Yahweh, \add who have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*.'
\p
\v 16 That is the sad song that people will sing about Egypt.
\p Women of many nations will sing it;
\q2 they will chant it about Egypt and all its people;
\q2 \add that will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said that it would happen."

<usfm>
\v 15 He also says this: "When I cause Egypt to become empty,
\q2 when I strip off everything that grows on the land,
\q1 and when I get rid of all the people who live there,
\q2 people will know that it is I, Yahweh, who have the power to do what I say that I will do.
\p
\v 16 There will be a sad song that people will sing about Egypt.
\p Women of many nations will sing it;
\q2 they will chant it about Egypt and all its many people."
\q2 This will surely happen because Yahweh has said that it would happen.

\q
\v 15 When I make the land of Egypt an abandoned place, when the land is made bare of all its fullness, 
\q when I attack all the inhabitants in her, they will know that I am Yahweh.
\q
\v 16 There will be a lament; the daughters of the nations will lament over her; they will lament over Egypt,
\q over all her multitudes they will lament—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration.'"

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking.

  * **When I make the land of Egypt an abandoned place** - This can be put into active form. AT: "When I make the land of Egypt a place where no one is living" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **when the land is made bare of all its fullness** - "when the country is made to lose all its wealth"
  * **when I attack all the inhabitants in her** - Here the idea of attacking represents destroying. AT: "when I destroy all who live in her" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

  * **know that I am Yahweh** - When Yahweh says that people will know that he is Yahweh, he is implying that they will know that he is the one true God who has supreme authority and power.

AT: "understand that I am Yahweh, the one true God" or "realize that I, Yahweh, have supreme power and authority" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
