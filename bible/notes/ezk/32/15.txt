<usfm>
\v 15 When I cause Egypt to become empty\f + \ft Or: desolate \f*
\q2 and strip off everything that grows on the land,
\q1 and when I get rid of all the people who live there,
\q2 people will know that it is I, Yahweh, \add who have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*.'

\v 16 That is the sad song that people will sing about Egypt.

<usfm>
\v 15 He also says this: "When I cause Egypt to become empty,
\q2 when I strip off everything that grows on the land,
\q1 and when I get rid of all the people who live there,
\q2 people will know that it is I, Yahweh, who have the power to do what I say that I will do.
\p
\v 16 That is the sad song that people will sing about Egypt.
\p Women of many nations will sing it;
\q2 they will chant it about Egypt and all its servants."
\q2 This will surely happen because Yahweh has said that it would happen.

\v 15 "When I make the land of Egypt—a land that was full—a ruined place, an abandoned place;
\q when I attack all of her inhabitants, then they will know that I am Yahweh!
\q
\v 16 There will be a lament! For the daughters of the nations will lament over her; they will lament over Egypt.
\q They will lament over all her servants!" This is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration!
