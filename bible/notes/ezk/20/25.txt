\v 25 I also allowed them to obey laws that were not good, and laws that would not enable them to live a long time \add if they obeyed them\add*.
\v 26 I allowed them to become unacceptable to me by sacrificing their firstborn children in the fire. I did that in order that they would be horrified, and in order that they would know that I, Yahweh, \add have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*.

\v 25 So I also allowed them to obey laws that were not good, laws that would not help them live a long time.
\v 26 I allowed them to do things that made it impossible for me to accept them: I allowed them to sacrifice their firstborn children in fire. I did allowed them to do that in order that they would be horrified at themselves, and in order that they would know that I, Yahweh, have the power to do what I say that I will do.

<usfm>
\v 25 Then I also gave them statutes that were not good, and decrees by which they could not live.

  * **Then I also gave them statutes that were not good, and decrees by which they could not live** - The words statutes in this phrase do not refer to God's law. God permitted them to live by human laws and judgments that were not good.
  * **gave them** - The word "them" refers to the children of those whom Yahweh brought out of Egypt.
  * **by their gifts** - AT: "by the gifts that they gave me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
