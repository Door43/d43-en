\v 33 As I live—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—I will certainly reign over you with a mighty hand, a raised arm, and fury that will be poured out on you!
\v 34 I will bring you out from the other peoples and will gather you out of the countries among whom you have been scattered. I will do this with a mighty hand and with fury poured out.
\v 35 Then I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will judge you face to face.
