<usfm>
\v 42 Then,  when I bring you to the land of Israel, to the land that I have lifted my hand up  to give to your fathers, you will know that I am Yahweh.
\v 43 Then you will call to mind there your evil ways, and all of your deeds by which you made yourselves unclean, and you will hate yourselves in your own 
eyes for all your evil actions that you have committed.
\v 44 So you will know that I am Yahweh when I do this to you for my name's sake, not for your evil ways or your corrupt deeds, house of Israel!'" This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration.
