\v 42 Then you will know that I am Yahweh when I bring you to the land of Israel, to the land that I have lifted my hand up  to give to your fathers.
\v 43 Then you will remember your ways there, and all of your deeds by which you made yourselves unclean and you will loath yourselves in your own 
eyes for all your evils that you have done.
\v 44 So you will know that I am Yahweh when I do this to you for my name’s sake, not according to your evil ways and your corrupt deeds, house of Israel!’
—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.”
