\v 8 But they rebelled against me. They would not pay attention to me. They did not get rid of the disgusting idols they loved; they did not reject the idols that they saw in Egypt. So because I was angry with them, I said that I would punish them in Egypt.
\v 9 But for the sake of my own reputation, I decided to do something for your people so that the other people-groups would not laugh at me and say I had no power. I decided that they would see me bring my people out of Egypt.

\v 8 But they rebelled against me and were unilling to listen to me. Each man did not throw away the detestable things from before his eyes nor forsake the idols of Egypt, so I determined to pour out my fury upon them to satisfy my wrath among them in the middle of the land of Egypt.
\v 9 I acted for my name’s sake so it would not be profaned in the eyes of the nations among whom they were staying. I made myself 
known to them, in their eyes, by bringing them out of the land of Egypt.
