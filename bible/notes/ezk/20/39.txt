===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the house of Israel.
 
  * **house of Israel** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:16|3:1]]. AT: "the Israelite people group" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **to listen to me** - "to obey me" or "to pay attention to me"
  * **profane my holy name** - Here the word "name" represents Yahweh himself. AT: "dishonor me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
