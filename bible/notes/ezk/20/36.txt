\v 38 I will get rid of those people among you who rebel \f + \ft doublet \f* against me. Although I will bring them out of \add Babylonia\add*, where they are now living, they will not enter Israel. Then you will know that it is I, Yahweh, \add who have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 36 As I judged your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so also I will judge you!—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration. 
\v 37 I will cause you to pass under my rod, and I will bring you into the bonds of the covenant;
\v 38 I will purge from among you the rebels and those who revolt against me. I will send them out from the land where they are staying as foreigners, but they will not enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.
