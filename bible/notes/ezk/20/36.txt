\v 38 I will get rid of those people among you who rebel \f + \ft doublet \f* against me. Although I will bring them out of \add Babylonia\add*, where they are now living, they will not enter Israel. Then you will know that it is I, Yahweh, \add who have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*.

\v 36 I will punish you, as I punished your ancestors in the wilderness near Egypt.
\v 37 I will make you submit to me; I will force you to obey the covenant that I made with you.
\v 38 I will destroy the people among you who rebel against me. Although I will bring them out of Babylonia, where they are now living, they will not enter Israel. Then you will know that it is I, Yahweh, who have the power to do what I say that I will do.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 36 As I judged your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so also I will judge you!—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration. 
\v 37 I will cause you to pass under my rod, and I will bring you into the bonds of the covenant;
\v 38 I will purge from among you the rebellious ones and the ones transgressing against me. I will send them out from out from the land where they are staying as foreigners, but they will not enter the land of Israel. So you will know that I am Yahweh!
