\v 30 Therefore, say this to the Israelite people: "This is what Yahweh the Lord says: Why do you imitate your ancestors in acting in ways that make me unable to accept you? You act like prostitutes, leaving their husbands for other men. In the same way, you have left me to worship dusgusting idols.
\v 31 When you sacrifice your children in the fire, you  make me unable to accept you. It is the same as when you bow down to your idols. You Israelite people, should I allow you to ask me to direct you in any matter? I, Yahweh the Lord, say that as surely as I am alive, I will not answer if you ask me.
\p
\v 32 You say, 'We want to be like the the other people groups in the world. We want to worship idols made of wood and stone like they do.' But what you want will never happen.

\v 30 Therefore say to the house of Israel, 'The Lord Yahweh says this: "Why do you make yourselves unclean with the ways of your fathers? And why do you act like prostitutes, searching for disgusting things?
\v 31 For when you offer up your gifts and cause your sons to pass through the fire, you make yourselves unclean with all your idols to this present day. So 
should I be inquired of by you, house of Israel? As I live"'"x97this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration, "'"I will not be inquired of by you!
\v 32 The thought that is forming in your mind will come true. You say, 'Let us be like the other nations, like the clans in the other lands who worship wood and stone!'
