\v 30 Wherefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Do you pollute yourselves after the manner of your fathers? and play you the harlot after their abominations?
\v 31 and when you offer your gifts, when you make your sons to pass through the fire, do you pollute yourselves with all your idols to this day? and shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, says the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you;
\v 32 and that which comes into your mind shall not be at all, in that you say, We will be as the nations, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.
