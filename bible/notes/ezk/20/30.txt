\v 31 When you sacrifice your children in the fire, you are still continuing to make yourselves unacceptable to me by \add worshiping\add* your many idols. You Israelite people, should I allow you to inquire \add what I want you to do\add*? I, Yahweh the Lord, say that as surely as I am alive, \add I will not answer\add* if you inquire'.

\v 30 Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Why do you make yourselves unclean with the ways of your fathers? And whore 
about after detestable things?
\v 31 For when you lift up your gifts and cause your sons to pass through the fire, you make yourselves unclean will all your idols unto this day. So 
should I be inquired of by you, house of Israel? As I live,’—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—‘I will not be inquired of by you!
\v 32 The thing going up into your spirit will not be real, as you say, “Let us be as the nations, as the families of the lands to serve wood and stone!”
