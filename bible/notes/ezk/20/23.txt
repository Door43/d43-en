===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 23 So I swore to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among many people groups,
\v 24 because they had rejected and disobeyed all my laws, and because they were treating the Sabbath days like any other day—and because they were eager to worship the idols that their parents had worshiped.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 23 I myself also raised my hand to them in the wilderness, in order to swear that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them among the lands.
\v 24 I decided to do this since they had not obeyed my decrees, and since they had rejected my statutes and profaned my Sabbaths. Their eyes were longing after their fathers’ idols.
