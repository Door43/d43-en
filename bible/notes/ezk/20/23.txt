====== Ezekiel 20:23-24 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 23 I lifted up my hand and solemnly declared to them in the desert that I would cause them to be scattered among many nations \f + \ft doublet \f*,
\v 24 because they had rejected and disobeyed all my laws \f + \ft doublet \f* and desecrated the Sabbath days, and they had eagerly desired \add to worship\add* the idols that their parents \add had worshiped\add*.
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 23 So I swore to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among many people groups,
\v 24 because they had rejected and disobeyed all my laws, and because they were treating the Sabbath days like any other day—and because they were eager to worship the idols that their parents had worshiped.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 23 I myself also lifted up my hand to swear to them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them among the lands.
\v 24 I decided to do this since they had not obeyed my decrees, and since they had rejected my statutes and profaned my Sabbaths. Their eyes were longing after their fathers' idols.
</usfm>
