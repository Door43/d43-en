\v 21 But their children also rebelled against me. They did not carefully obey my laws \f + \ft doublet \f*, even though the people who obey them will live for a long time; and they profaned the Sabbath days. So again I said that by getting rid of them in the desert, I would show that I was very angry with them.
\v 22 But I did not do that [IDI]. Again, for the sake of my own reputation, I decided to do something in order that I would not be dishonored\f + \ft Or: despised \f* by the people of the nations who had seen it when I brought my people out of Egypt.

\v 21 But their children also rebelled against me. They did not take care to obey my laws, even though anyone who obeys them will live for a long time; and they also treated the Sabbath days like any other day. So again I said that I would kill them all in the wilderness, and in this way I would stop being angry.
\v 22 But I did not do that. I decided once more to do something so that the other people groups, those that had seen me bring your people out of Egypt, would not laugh and say that I had lost my power.

\v 21 But their sons and daughters rebelled against me. They did not walk in my statutes or keep my decrees, by which a man might live if he obeys them. They profaned my Sabbaths, so I determined to pour out my fury upon them to satisfy my wrath against them in the wilderness.
\v 22 But I turned my hand away and acted for my name's sake, so it would not be profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought out the Israelites.

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the elders of Israel.

  * **to pour out my fury upon them** - Yahweh speaks of expressing his fury by punishing them as if his fury were a liquid that he poured out on them.

  * **I turned my hand away** - Here the word "hand" represents Yahweh and turning his hand away means that he does not do what he was going to do. AT: "But I did not do that" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
