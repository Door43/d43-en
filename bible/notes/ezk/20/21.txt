\v 21 But the children rebelled against me; they walked not in my statutes, neither kept mine ordinances to do them, which if a
man do, he shall live in them; they profaned my sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them, to accomplish my
anger against them in the wilderness.
\v 22 Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the
nations, in whose sight I brought them forth.
