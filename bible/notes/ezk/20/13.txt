\v 13 But the Israelite people rebelled against me in the desert. They did not obey my commands \f + \ft doublet \f*; they rejected them, even though they tell people who obey them that they will live for a long time, and they profaned the Sabbath days. So I said that by getting rid of them in the desert I would show that I was very angry with them.
\v 14 But again, for the sake of my own reputation, I decided to do something in order that I would not be dishonored\f + \ft Or: despised \f* by the people of the nations who had seen it when I brought my people out of Egypt.

\v 13 But the Israelite people rebelled against me in the wilderness also. They did not obey my commands; they rejected them, even though they would have lived a long time if they had obeyed them, and they treated the Sabbath days like any other day. So I said that I would destroy them in the wilderness, because that would show that I was very angry with them.
\v 14 But again, so that the other people groups would not laugh at me, I decided to do something in order to show  those people groups that I was still as powerful as when they had seen me bring my people out of Egypt.

\v 13 But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness. They did not walk in my statutes; instead, they rejected my decrees, by which a man will live if he obeys them. They greatly profaned my Sabbaths, so I said I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness 
in order to end them.
\v 14 But I acted for my name's sake so it would not be profaned in the eyes of the nations, in whose sight I had brought them out of Egypt.
