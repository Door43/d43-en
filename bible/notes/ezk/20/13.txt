\v 13 But the Israelite people rebelled against me in the desert. They did not obey my commands ; they rejected them, even though they tell people who obey them that they will live for a long time, and they profaned the Sabbath days. So I said that by getting rid of them in the desert I would show that I was very angry with them.

\v 13 But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they rejected mine
ordinances, which if a man keep, he shall live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly profaned. Then I said I would pour out my
wrath upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.
\v 14 But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought
them out.
