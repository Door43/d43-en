\v 45 Then the word of Yahweh came to me and said,
\v 46 "Son of man, set your face toward the southern lands, and speak against the south; prophesy against the forest of the Negev.
\v 47 Say to the forest of the Negev, 'Hear the declaration of Yahweh! The Lord Yahweh says this: See, I will set a fire among you.  It will devour every fresh tree and every dried tree among you. The fiery flame will not be quenched; every face from the south to the north will be burned.
