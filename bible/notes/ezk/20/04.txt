===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Will you judge them? Will you judge, Son of man** - Yahweh uses these questions to command Ezekiel to tell the elders of Israel about their guilt. Yahweh is so frustrated with the elders that he would rather have Ezekiel tell them about their guilt than give them a new message from himself. AT: "You judge them, Son of man." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **judge them** - The word "them" refers to the elders of Israel, who are the representatives of the people of Israel.
  * **Son of man** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01|2:3]].
  * **raised my hand to swear an oath** - A person raised his hand to make an oath, when the oath was very serious and the person was completely committed to fulfilling the oath. AT: "I made a solemn oath." 
  * **made myself known to them** - "I let them know who I am"
  * **It was flowing with milk and honey**  - "A land where plenty of milk and honey flowed." This means that the land will be rich and productive, so there will be enough food for everyone. AT: "It was very fertile land" or "It was land where animals and plants grew very well." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **it was the most beautiful ornament among all the lands** - "it was the most beautiful of all the lands"
