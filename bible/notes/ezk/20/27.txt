\v 27 Therefore, you human, speak to the Israelite people, and say this to them: 'This is what Yahweh the Lord says to you: This is one way that your ancestors dishonored me by turning away from me:
\v 28 After I brought them into the land that I had solemnly promised to give to them, every time that they saw a high hill or a big green tree, they offered sacrifices \add to idols\add* there. They made offerings to them, and that caused me to become angry. They presented to those idols their fragrant burning incense, and poured out wine offerings to them.
\v 29 Then I asked them, "Who \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add told you to worship at\add* a shrine like this, here on this hilltop?" So they are still called 'hilltop shrines'.'~"

\v 27 Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: In this moreover
have your fathers blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.
\v 28 For when I had brought them into the land, which I sware to give to them, then they saw every high hill, and every
thick tree, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering; there also
they made their sweet savor, and they poured out there their drink-offerings.
\v 29 Then I said to them, What meaneth the high place whereto you go? So the name thereof is called Bamah to this day.
