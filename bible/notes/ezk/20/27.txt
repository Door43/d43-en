\v 27 Therefore, you human, speak to the Israelite people, and say this to them: 'This is what Yahweh the Lord says to you: This is one way that your ancestors dishonored me by turning away from me:
\v 28 After I brought them into the land that I had solemnly promised to give to them, every time that they saw a high hill or a big green tree, they offered sacrifices \add to idols\add* there. They made offerings to them, and that caused me to become angry. They presented to those idols their fragrant burning incense, and poured out wine offerings to them.
\v 29 Then I asked them, "Who \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add told you to worship at\add* a shrine like this, here on this hilltop?" So they are still called 'hilltop shrines'.'~"

\v 27 Therefore, son of man, speak to the Israelite people. Say this to them, 'This is what Yahweh the Lord says to you: This is one way that your ancestors dishonored me by turning away from me.
\v 28 After I brought them into the land that I had sworn to give them, every time that they saw a high hill or a big green tree, they offered sacrifices to idols there. They made offerings to them, and that caused me to become angry. They presented to those idols their fragrant incense, and they poured out wine offerings to them.
\v 29 Then I asked them, "What is this hilltop place where you go to worship idols?" So they are still called Bamah, which means 'hilltop'.'"

\v 27 Therefore, son of man, announce this to the house of Israel; say to them, 'The Lord Yahweh says this: Your fathers blasphemed me by betraying me against me. They did it in this way:
\v 28 when I brought them into the land that I lifted my hand to give to them, and when they saw all the high hills and leafy trees, then they offered their sacrifices there and provoked me by their offerings there. There they also burned fragrant incense and poured out drink offerings.
\v 29 Then I said to them, "What is this high place where you bring offerings there?" So the name is called Bamah to this day.'
