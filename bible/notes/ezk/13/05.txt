\v 5 Because you were listening to them, you haven't repaired breeches or strengthened your walls. That needs to be done so that the walls will be strong when I, Yahweh, send your enemies to attack you.
\v 6 The visions and prophecies of those prophets are false. They say, 'Yahweh told me this.' I have not sent them to you to be my prophets, but you expect that what they prophesy will truly happen!
\v 7 They say that they have seen visions, but those visions are false, and the things that they prophesy are lies. They say, 'Yahweh told me this,' but I have told them nothing!

\v 5 You have not gone to the breaks in the wall around the house of Israel in order to repair it, in order to resist in battle on the day of Yahweh.
\v 6 The people have false visions and make false predictions, those who say, 'Such and such is Yahweh's declaration.'" Yahweh has not sent them, but they nevertheless have made
people hope that their messages would come true.
\v 7 Have you not had false visions and made false predictions, you who say, "Such and such is Yahweh's declaration" when I myself have not spoken?
