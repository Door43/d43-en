\v 13 Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this: 'I will bring a windstorm in my rage, and there will be floods of rain in my wrath! 
Hailstones in my rage will completely destroy it!
\v 14 For I will tear down the wall that you have covered with whitewash, and I will demolish it to the ground and lay bare its foundations. So it 
will fall, and you will be annihilated in the middle of it all. Then you will know that I am Yahweh!
