\v 13 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: I will bring about a stormy wind in my rage, and there will be floods of rain in my wrath! 
Hailstones in my rage to completely destroy it!
\v 14 For I will tear down the wall that you have plastered with whitewash, and I will strike it to the ground and make its foundations bare. So it 
will fall and you will be annihilated in its midst. Then you will know that I am Yahweh!
