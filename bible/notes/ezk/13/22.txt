===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 You have discouraged righteous people by telling them lies when I did not do things to cause them to be sad. And you have encouraged wicked people to not turn away from their wicked behavior; if they had done that, they would have continued to remain alive.
\v 23 Therefore, you will no longer falsely say that you have seen visions or tell people what will happen in the future in order to please them. I will rescue my people from being deceived by you. And then you will know that I, Yahweh, \add have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*.'~"

\v 22 You have discouraged righteous people by telling them lies when I did not do things to cause them to be sad. And you have encouraged wicked people to keep on doing their wicked behavior; if they had turned away from it, they would have continued to live.
\v 23 Therefore, you will no longer falsely say that you have seen visions or tell people what will happen in the future in order to please them. I will rescue my people from being deceived by you. And then you will know that I, Yahweh, have the power to do what I say that I will do.'"

<usfm>
\v 22 Because you discourage the heart of the righteous with lies, though I did not desire his discouragement, and instead encourage
the acts of the wicked so the wicked one will not turn from his way to save his life.
\v 23 Therefore you will no longer see deceitful visions or continue to make predictions, for I will deliver my people out of your hand and
you will know that I am Yahweh!'"
