\v 10 Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there is no peace; and when one builds up a wall,
behold, they daub it with untempered mortar:
\v 11 say to them that daub it with untempered mortar, that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower;
and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it.
\v 12 Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said to you, Where is the daubing wherewith you have daubed it?
