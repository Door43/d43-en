\v 15 For I will annihilate in my fury the wall and those who whitewashed it. I will say to you, "The wall exists no more, nor do the people who whitewashed it—
\v 16 the prophets of Israel who prophesied about Jerusalem and who had visions of peace for her. But there is no peace!—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration."'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to speak of the false security that the prophets have given to the people by speaking of peace as if the prophets had build a poorly-constructed wall and covered it over with white paint in order to make it look good. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **I will annihilate in my fury** - "Because I am very angry, I will annihilate"
  * **whitewashed it** - The word "whitewash" refers to a white liquid mixture or paint used to cover up impurities and make surfaces white. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:13:10|13:10]]).
  * **the prophets of Israel who prophesied about Jerusalem and who had visions of peace for her** - This phrase defines who "the people who whitewashed it" are.
  * **visions of peace for her** - The word "her" refers to Jerusalem.
  * **this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration** - Translate this phrase in the same way you did in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]].
