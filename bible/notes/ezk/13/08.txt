\v 8 Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this, 'Because you have had false visions and have told lies—therefore this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration against you:
\v 9 My hand will be against the prophets who have lying visions and who make false predictions. They will not be in the assembly of my people, or enrolled in the record of the house of Israel; they must not go to the land of Israel. For you will know that I am the Lord Yahweh!

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]]. AT: "this is what the Lord Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **My hand will be against the prophets** - Here the word "hand" represents Yahweh's power. That his hand will be against them is a metaphor that means that he will punish them with his power. AT: "I will punish the prophets" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **They will not be in the assembly of my people** - This means that Yahweh will not consider these false prophets to be part of the people of Israel.
  * **or enrolled in the record of the house of Israel** - This probably refers to an official record of the citizens of Israel. This can be stated in active form. AT: "nor will anyone enroll their names in the record of the house of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the house of Israel** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:16|3:1]]. AT: "the Israelite people group" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **know that I am the Lord Yahweh** - When Yahweh says that people will know that he is Yahweh, he is implying that they will know that he is the one true God who has supreme authority and power. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:06:06|6:7]]. AT: "understand that I am the Lord Yahweh, the one true God" or "realize that I, the Lord Yahweh, have supreme power and authority" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
