\v 12 And you, son of man, say to the children of your people, ‘The righteousness of the righteous will not deliver him in the day of his transgression! But the wickedness of the wicked will not cause him to stumble in the day of his repentance from his transgression. For the righteous will not be able to live by his righteousness in the day that he sins.
\v 13 When I say to the righteous, “He will surely live!” so he trusts in his righteousness and commits injustice, I will not remember any of his righteousness and he will die in his injustice that he committed.
