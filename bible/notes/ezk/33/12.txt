\v 12 Therefore, you human, say to your fellow Israelites, 'If righteous people start to disobey me, their being righteous previously will not save them \add from being punished\add*. And if wicked people turn away from their wicked behavior, they will not die because of the sins that they committed \add previously\add*. IAnd if righteous people start to sin, they will not be allowed to remain alive because of their formerly being righteous.
\v 13 If I tell righteous people that they will surely remain alive, but then they trust\f + \ft Or: think \f* that because they have been righteous previously, they can start to do evil \add and not be punished\add*, I will not think about the righteous things that they did previously; they will die because of the evil things that they are doing.

\v 12 And thou, son of man, say to the children of your people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in
the day of his transgression; and as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turns
from his wickedness; neither shall he that is righteous be able to live thereby in the day that he sinneth.
\v 13 When I say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his righteousness, and commit iniquity, none of
his righteous deeds shall be remembered; but in his iniquity that he has committed, therein shall he die.
