\v 12 Therefore, you human, say to your fellow Israelites, 'If righteous people start to disobey me, their being righteous previously will not save them \add from being punished\add*. And if wicked people turn away from their wicked behavior, they will not die because of the sins that they committed \add previously\add*. IAnd if righteous people start to sin, they will not be allowed to remain alive because of their formerly being righteous.
\v 13 If I tell righteous people that they will surely remain alive, but then they trust\f + \ft Or: think \f* that because they have been righteous previously, they can start to do evil \add and not be punished\add*, I will not think about the righteous things that they did previously; they will die because of the evil things that they are doing.

\v 12 Therefore, Son of man, say to your fellow Israelites that if good people start to disobey me, the fact that they were previously righteous will not keep me from punishing them. Similarly, if wicked people turn away from their wicked behavior, they will not die because of those sins. And if good people start to sin, I will not allow the fact that they had been good to keep me from punishing them now.
\v 13 Tell them that If I tell good people that they will surely remain alive, but if they then think that they can now do evil without me punishing them—in that case, I will ignore the good things that they previously did. I will make sure that they die because of the evil things that they are now doing.

\v 12 And you, Son of man, say to your people, ‘The righteousness of a righteous person will not save him if he sins! And the wickedness of a wicked person will not cause him to perish if he repents from his sin. For the righteous person will not be able to live because of his righteousness if he sins.
\v 13 If I say to the righteous, “He will surely live!” and if he trusts in his righteousness and then commits injustice, I will not call to mind any of his righteousness; he will die in the wickedness that he has committed.
