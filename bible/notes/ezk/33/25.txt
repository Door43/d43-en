Yahweh continues speaking to Ezekiel about the people who were living in the ruins of Israel.

  * **Thus says the Lord Yahweh** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:10|3:11]].

  * **you lift up your eyes toward your idols**  - "you look to your idols." This means "you worship your idols" (UDB). (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]). 
  * **you pour out peoples blood** - AT: "you pour out blood." This means "you murder people."
  * **Should you really possess the land?** - Yahweh used this question to rebuke the people. AT: "You should not possess this land" or "You do not deserve this land." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **you have depended on your swords**  - AT: "you have used your swords to get what you want."
