\v 21 It happened in the twelfth year, on the fifth day of the tenth month of our captivity, that a fugitive came to me from Jerusalem and said, "The city has been captured!"
\v 22 The hand of Yahweh had been on me in the evening before the fugitive came, and my mouth was opened by the time that he came to me in the dawn. So my mouth was open; I was no longer mute!

  * **It happened** - This phrase is used here to mark the beginning of a new part of the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **the twelfth year ... fifth day ... tenth month** - "the 12th year ... 5th day ... 10th month" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **on the fifth day of the tenth month** - This is the tenth month of the Hebrew calendar. The fifth day is near the beginning of January on Western calendars. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_hebrewmonths]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **of our captivity** - Here "our" refers to Ezekiel and the Israelites who have been in Babylon since the time the Babylonians forced King Jehoiachin to leave Jerusalem.

  * **The hand of Yahweh had been on me** - The word "hand" is often used to refer to someone's power or action. A person with his hand on another person has power over that person.

AT: "I was able to speak" or "Yahweh enabled me to speak" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **dawn** - The word "dawn" refers to the time early in the morning when the light of the sun first appears.
  * **I was no longer mute** - "I was no longer forced to be silent" or "I was no longer unable to speak" Ezekiel had been unable to speak anything except prophetic words since [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:26|3:26]].
