\v 21 It happened in the twelfth year, on the fifth day of the tenth month of our captivity, that a fugitive came to me from Jerusalem and said, "The city has been captured!"
\v 22 The hand of Yahweh had been on me in the evening before the fugitive came, and my mouth was opened by the time that he came to me in the dawn. So my mouth was open; I was no longer mute!

  * **of our captivity** - Here "our" refers to Ezekiel and the Israelites who have been in Babylon since the time the Babylonians forced King Jehoiachin to leave Jerusalem. AT: "after we became captives" or "after the Babylonians took us as captives to Babylon." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **a fugitive came to me from Jerusalem** - "someone escaped from Jerusalem and came to me." The Babylonians had destroyed Jerusalem and killed the people of Jerusalem, but a few people escaped.
