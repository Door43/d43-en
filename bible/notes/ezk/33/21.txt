\v 21 And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth
month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came to me, saying, The
city is smitten.
\v 22 Now the hand of Jehovah had been upon me in the evening, before he that was escaped came; and he had opened my mouth,
until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb.
