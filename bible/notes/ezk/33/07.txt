====== Ezekiel 33:7-9 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 So, you human, I have appointed you to be a watchman for the Israelite people \f + \ft metonymy \f*. So always listen to what I say, and warn the people for me.
\v 8 When I say to some wicked person, 'You wicked person, you will surely die \add because of your sins\add*,' \add you must tell him that\add*. If you do not speak to that person to warn him that he should turn away from his sins, that wicked person will die because of his sins, but I will say that you are responsible for his death \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 9 But if you warn that wicked person that he should turn away from his sins, and he does not do that, he will die because of his sins, but you will have saved your life.'

<usfm>
\v 7 Son of man, this parable has a meaning for you. I have appointed you to be a watchman for the Israelites. So always listen to what I say, and warn the people for me.
\v 8 When I say to some wicked person, 'You wicked person, you will surely die because of your sins,' you must tell him what I said. If you do not speak to that person to warn him to turn away from his sins, that wicked person will die because of his sins, but I will make you responsible for his death.
\v 9 But if you warn that wicked person that he should turn away from his sins, but if he does not do so, then he will die because of his sins, but you will have saved your own life.

\p
\v 7 Now you yourself, Son of man! I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; you will hear the words from my mouth and warn them on my behalf.
\v 8 If I say to a wicked person, 'Wicked one, you will certainly die!' but if you do not announce this so as to warn the wicked about his way, then he who is wicked will die in his sin, but I will require his blood from your hand!
\v 9 But you, if you warn the wicked about his way, so that he might turn back from it, and if he does not turn back from his way, then he will die in his sin, but you yourself will have saved your own life.
