\v 15 For example, he may return what he took from another person to guarantee \add that that person would pay back what he owes\add*, or he may return things that he has stolen, and he may obey the laws that will enable \add those who obey them\add* to remain alive, and he will not continue to do evil things. If that happens, he will surely remain alive; he will not die \add because of the sins that he committed previously\add*.

\v 14 And when I say to the wicked, “You will surely die!” but he repents from his sins and does what is just and right--
\v 15 he restores the pledge of wickedness; he ceases from plunder! He walks in the statutes of the living and no longer commits iniquity!—he will surely live and not die!
\v 16 None of the sins that he has sinned will be remembered concerning him. He has done justly and right and will surely live!
