\v 15 For example, he may return what he took from another person to guarantee \add that that person would pay back what he owes\add*, or he may return things that he has stolen, and he may obey the laws that will enable \add those who obey them\add* to remain alive, and he will not continue to do evil things. If that happens, he will surely remain alive; he will not die \add because of the sins that he committed previously\add*.
\v 16 I will not think about the sins that he has committed; he will surely remain alive.'

\v 14 Again, when I say to the wicked, You shall surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;
\v 15 if the wicked restore the pledge, give again that which he had taken by robbery, walk in the statutes of life, committing
no iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die.
\v 16 None of his sins that he has committed shall be remembered against him: he has done that which is lawful and right; he
shall surely live.
