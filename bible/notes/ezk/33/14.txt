====== Ezekiel 33:14-16 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 And if I say to some wicked person, 'You will surely die \add because of your sins\add*,' that person may turn away from his sinful behavior and do what is just and right \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\v 15 For example, he may return what he took from another person to guarantee \add that that person would pay back what he owes\add*, or he may return things that he has stolen, and he may obey the laws that will enable \add those who obey them\add* to remain alive, and he will not continue to do evil things. If that happens, he will surely remain alive; he will not die \add because of the sins that he committed previously\add*.
\v 16 I will not think about the sins that he has committed; he will surely remain alive.'

\v 14 Continue to tell the people these things: If I say to some wicked person, 'You will surely die because of your sins,' perhaps that person will stop doing evil and start doing what is just and right.
\v 15 For example, he might return what he took from another person to guarantee that that person would pay back what he owes, or he might return things that he has stolen, or he might obey the laws that will enable those who obey them to remain alive. If this happens, he will surely remain alive; he will not die because of the sins that he committed previously.
\v 16 I will ignore the sins that he previously committed; he will surely remain alive.

\v 14 So if I say to the wicked, "You will surely die," but if he then repents from his sins and does what is just and right—
\v 15 if he restores the loan guarantee that he wickedly demanded, or if he makes restitution for what he has stolen, and if he walks in the statutes that give life and no longer commits sin—then he will surely live. He will not die.
\v 16 None of the sins that he has committed will be called to mind for him. He has acted justly and rightly, and so, he will surely live!
