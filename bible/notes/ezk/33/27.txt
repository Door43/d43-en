\v 27 Send this message to them: 'This is what Yahweh the Lord says: As surely as I am alive, those who are left in the ruins \add in Jerusalem\add* will also be killed by \add their enemies'\add* swords, and those who are living in the countryside will be killed by wild animals, and those who are living in forts and caves will die from a plague.
\v 28 I will cause your country to become a desolate wasteland. You will no longer be proud of being a strong country. The mountains of Israel will become very desolate, with the result that no one will walk across them.
\v 29 Then, when I have caused your country to become a desolate wasteland because of all the detestable things that you have done, you will know that I, Yahweh, \add have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*.'

\v 27 Send this message to them and tell them that this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, say to them: 'As surely as I am alive, those who are left in the ruins in Jerusalem—their enemies will also kill them. And those who are living in the countryside—wild animals will kill them. Those who are living in forts and caves will die from disease.
\v 28 I will cause your country to become a desolate wasteland. You will no longer be proud of being a strong country. The mountains of Israel will become very desolate, with the result that no one will walk across them.'
\v 29 Then, when I have caused their country to become a desolate wasteland because of all the disgusting things that you have done, they will know that I, Yahweh, have the power to do what I say that I will do."

<usfm>
\v 27 You will say this to them, 'The Lord Yahweh says this: As I live, surely the ones in the ruins will fall by the sword, and I will give those in the fields to the living creatures as food, and those in fortresses and in caves will die of plagues.
\v 28 Then I will turn the land into a desolation and a horror, and the pride of its might will end, for the mountains of Israel will be deserted, and there will be no one to pass through them.'
\v 29 So they will know that I am Yahweh, when I make the land a desolation and a horror because of all the abominations that they have done.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to Ezekiel about the people who were living in the ruins of Israel.

  * **As I live** - "As surely as I am alive." Yahweh uses this expression to show that what he says next is certainly true. This is a way of making a solemn promise. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]]. AT: "I solemnly swear" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **the ones in the ruins will fall by the sword** - The phrase "fall by the sword" is an idiom. AT: "enemies will kill the ones living in the ruins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **those in fortresses and in caves will die of plagues** - "plagues will kill the people who live in fortresses and caves"
  * **fortresses** - A fortress is a building that people build to protect themselves from enemies who attack them.
  * **caves** - Caves are natural holes in the side of a mountain or down in the ground. They are usually made of rock.
  * **a horror** - A "horror" is an abstract noun. It is something that makes people very afraid when they see it. AT: "people will be afraid because of it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **the pride of its might will end** - The word "it" refers to the land, which refers to the people of the land. AT: "the people of the land will not be proud anymore that they are strong" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the mountains of Israel will be deserted** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "no one will live in the mountains of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **there will be no one to pass through them** - "there will be no one left to travel through the land or over the mountains"
  * **know that I am Yahweh** - When Yahweh says that people will know that he is Yahweh, he is implying that they will know that he is the one true God who has supreme authority and power. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:06:06|6:7]]. AT: "understand that I am Yahweh, the one true God" or "realize that I, Yahweh, have supreme power and authority" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **all the abominations that they have done** - The abstract noun "abominations" can be stated as "things I hate." AT: "all the things they have done that I hate" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **they have done** - "the people have done"
