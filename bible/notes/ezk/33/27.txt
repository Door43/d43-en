\v 27 Send this message to them: 'This is what Yahweh the Lord says: As surely as I am alive, those who are left in the ruins \add in Jerusalem\add* will also be killed by \add their enemies'\add* swords, and those who are living in the countryside will be killed by wild animals, and those who are living in forts and caves will die from a plague.
\v 28 I will cause your country to become a desolate wasteland. You will no longer be proud of being a strong country. The mountains of Israel will become very desolate, with the result that no one will walk across them.
\v 29 Then, when I have caused your country to become a desolate wasteland because of all the detestable things that you have done, you will know that I, Yahweh, \add have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*.'

\v 27 Thus you will say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: As I live, surely the ones in the ruins will fall by the sword, and I will give those in the field to the living creatures as food, and those in fortresses and in caves will die of a plague.
\v 28 Then I will make the land into a desolation and a horror, and the pride of its might will end, for the mountains of Israel will be deserted and there will be no one to pass through.
\v 29 So they will know that I am Yahweh when I make the land a desolation and a horror because of all their abominations that they have committed!’
