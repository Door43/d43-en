===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 30 As for you, you human, your fellow Israelites \add here in Babylon\add* are talking about you along the city walls and at the doors of their houses. They are saying to each other, 'Come and listen to the message that has come from Yahweh.'
\v 31 My people come to you as they often have done, and they sit in front of you to listen to what you say. But they do not do what you tell them that they must do. With their mouths they say that they love me, but in their inner beings they are eager to acquire things by doing what is unjust.

\v 30 As for you, Son of man, your fellow Israelites here in Babylon stand beside the city wall or at the doors of their houses and are talking with each other. They are saying, 'Come and listen to the message that has come from Yahweh.'
\v 31 My people come to you as they often have done, and they sit in front of you to listen to what you say. But they do not do what you tell them that they must do. With their mouths they say that they love me, but in their inner beings they are eager to acquire things by doing what is unjust.

\v 30 And you, Son of man—your people are saying things about you beside the walls and the gates of the houses, and each says to one another—each man to his brother, ‘Let us go and listen to the prophet's word that comes out from Yahweh!’
\v 31 So my people will come to you, as they often do, and will sit in front of you and listen to your words, but they will not obey them. Right words are in their mouths, but their hearts are going after unjust profit.
