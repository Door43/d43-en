\v 10 So you, son of man, say to the house of Israel, ‘Thus you have said when you say: Our transgressions and our sins are upon us and we are decaying in them! How can we live?’
\v 11 Say to them, ‘As I live—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—I do not delight in the death of the wicked, for if the wicked will repent from his way then he will live! Repent! Repent from your wicked ways! For why should you die, house of Israel?’
