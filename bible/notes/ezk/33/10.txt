\v 10 So you, son of man, say to the house of Israel, 'You are saying this, "Our transgressions and our sins are on us, and we are decaying in them! How can we live?"'
\v 11 Say to them, 'As I live—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration—I do not delight in the death of the wicked, for if the wicked repents from his way, then he will live! Repent! Repent from your wicked ways! For why should you die, house of Israel?'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the Israelites.

  * **the house of Israel** - Here "house" represents people. AT: "the people of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **You are saying this** - "This is what you have said"
  * **Our transgressions and our sins are on us** - Possible meanings are 1) "on us" is a metaphor that means they feel guilty for their transgressions and sins or 2) "on us" is a metaphor that means they realize that Yahweh is punishing them for their transgressions and sins. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **we are decaying in them** - "we are rotting away because of them." Being destroyed because of sin is spoken of as if the person's flesh were rotting. AT: "they are destroying us" or "they are killing us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in them** - "because of them"
  * **How can we live?** - The people ask this question to emphasize that they have no hope of living. AT: "We have no hope of living." or "We will certainly die." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **As I live** - "As surely as I am alive." Yahweh uses this expression to show that what he says next is certainly true. This is a way of making a solemn promise. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]]. AT: "I solemnly swear" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]]. AT: "this is what the Lord Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **I do not delight in the death of the wicked** - The abstract noun "death" can be stated as "die." And the nominal adjective "the wicked" can be stated as "wicked people." AT: "It does not make me happy with wicked people die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]])
  * **if the wicked repents from his way** - Here "way" represents how a person behaves. AT: "if the wicked person stops doing bad things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For why should you die, house of Israel?** - Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that he does not want the people of Israel to die. AT: "Do not choose to die, house of Israel!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
