Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the Israelites.

  * **You are saying this** - AT: "This is what you have said"
  * **our transgressions and sins are on us** - Possible meanings are that they feel guilty for their transgressions and sins or 2) they realize that Yahweh is punishing them for their transgressions and sins. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **we are decaying in them**  - "we are rotting away because of them." This phrase compares the way that sin destroys people to the way that flesh rots. TA: "they are destroying us" or "they are killing us." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **How can we live?** - The people ask this question to emphasize that they have no hope of living. AT: "We have no hope of living" or "We will certainly die." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **As I live** - See how you translated this phrase in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]].

  * **if the wicked repents of his way** - "if the wicked person stops doing bad things"
  * **For why should you die** - Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that he does not want the people of Israel to day. AT: "Do not choose to die."
