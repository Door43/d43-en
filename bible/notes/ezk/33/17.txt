===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 Your fellow Israelites say, 'What Yahweh does is not fair.' But it is your behavior that is not fair.
\v 18 If a righteous person turns away from doing what is righteous and starts to do what is evil, \add it is fair that\add* he die because of his sins.
\v 19 And if a wicked person turns away from his wicked behavior and does what is right and fair \f + \ft doublet \f*, \add it is fair\add* for him to remain alive because of doing that.
\v 20 But you Israelite people still say, 'What Yahweh does is not fair.' But I will judge each of you for what you do."

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 Tell the people this: that they say that what I do is not fair, but that it is really what they do that is not fair. Then tell them these things, also:
\v 18 If a good person stops doing what is good and starts to do what is evil, it is fair that he should die because of his sins.
\v 19 And if a wicked person turns away from his wicked behavior and does what is right and fair, it is fair for him to remain alive because of doing that.
\v 20 Remind the people that they are still saying that what I do is not fair. They can talk all they want, but I will punish each of them for what they do. Tell them this."

\v 17 But your people say, “The way of the Lord is not fair!” but it is your ways that are not fair!
\v 18 When the righteous person turns away from his righteousness and commits sin, then he will die in it!
\v 19 And when the wicked turns away from his wickedness and does what is just and righteous, he will live because of those things!
\v 20 But you people say, “The way of the Lord is not fair!” I will judge each of you according to his way, house of Israel!’”
