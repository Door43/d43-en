====== Ezekiel 33:5-6 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 If he had heeded the warning, he would have saved his life\f + \ft Or: still be alive \f*. But because he heard the sound of the trumpet and did not heed that warning, his death will be his own fault.
\v 6 But if the watchman sees the enemy army \f + \ft metonymy \f* coming and does not blow the trumpet to warn the people, and one of his people is killed by an enemy sword, that person will die because of his sin, but I will consider that the watchman is responsible for that man's death.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 If he had paid attention, he would have saved his own life. But as it is, he will die, and it will be his own fault.
\p
\v 6 Now suppose that the watchman sees the enemy army coming and does not blow the trumpet to warn the people. Then suppose that one of his people dies because of the enemy. That person will die because of his own mistake, but I will hold the watchman responsible for it.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 If someone hears the sound of the horn and pays no attention, his blood is on him; but if he pays attention, he will save his own life.
\p
\v 6 However, if the watchman sees the sword as it is coming, but if he does not blow the horn, with the result that the people are not warned, and if the sword comes and takes anyone's life, then that person dies in his own sin, but I will require his blood from the watchman.’
