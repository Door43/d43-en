====== Ezekiel 33:1-4 ======

<usfm>
\v 1 Yahweh gave me another message. He said,
\v 2 "You human, speak to your fellow Israelites and say this to them: 'When I bring an enemy army \f + \ft metonymy \f* to attack a country, and the people of that country choose one of their men and appoint him to be a watchman,
\v 3 if he sees the enemy army \f + \ft metonymy \f* coming to attack his country, and he blows a trumpet to warn the people,
\v 4 if anyone hears the trumpet and does not heed the warning, and as a result he is killed by the sword \add of one of his enemies\add*, he will be responsible for his own death \f + \ft metonymy \f*.

\v 1 Yahweh gave me another message. He said,
\v 2 "Son of man, speak to your fellow Israelites and say this to them: 'Suppose that I bring an enemy army to attack a country, and the people of that country choose one of their own people to be a watchman.
\v 3 And suppose that he sees the enemy army come into view, and that he blows a trumpet to warn everyone.
\v 4 If anyone hears the trumpet but pays no attention, and if that person then dies because of the enemy, that person is responsible for his own death.

\c 33
\p
\v 1 Then the word of Yahweh came to me and said,
\v 2 "Son of man, declare this to your people; say to them, 'When I bring a sword against any land, then the people of that land take one man from among themselves and make him a watchman for them.
\v 3 He looks for the sword as it comes on the land, and he blows his horn to warn the people!
\v 4 If the people hear the sound of the horn but do not pay attention, and if the sword comes and kills them, then each one's blood is on his own head.
