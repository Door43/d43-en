\c 33
\p
\v 1 Then the word of Yahweh came to me and said,
\v 2 “Son of man, declare to the children of your people, and say to them, ‘When I bring a sword upon the land, then the people of the land will take one man from among them and establish him as a watchman for them.
\v 3 And he will look for the sword as it comes upon the land and blow the horn and warn the people!
\v 4 And if the ones listening hear the sound of the horn, but do not take warning and the sword comes and takes them; then each one’s blood will be on his own head.
