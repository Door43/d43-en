\v 27 When that happens, you will be able to speak again without constraint. You two will talk together. You will be a warning to the people; and they will know that I, Yahweh, have the power to do what I say that I will do."

\v 25 "But you, Son of man, on the day that I capture their temple, which is their joy, their pride, and what they see and desire—and when I take away their sons and daughters— 
\v 26 on that day, a refugee will come to you to give you the news!
\v 27 On that day your mouth will be opened up to that refugee and you will speak—you will no longer be silent. You will be a sign for them so that they will know that I am Yahweh!”

===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **refugee** - someone who has been forced to leave their country because of war or another disaster.
  * **your mouth will be opened up** - "Yahweh will open your mouth" This describes someone being given understanding and the ability to speak about something. AT: "you will know what to say" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **will speak—you will no longer be silent** - Both of these mean the people Israel will speak.  It is said again as a negative to emphasis the positive. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **will be a sign**  - This refers to the people of Israel as a sign because they will help the refugees to understand why Jerusalem was destroyed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
