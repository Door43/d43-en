\v 25 But you, Son of man, will I not take in that day their refuges? The joy of their pride? The lusts of their eyes? And whatever their souls lift up? Their sons and daughters?
\v 26 In that day, the refugee will come to you to hear a report!
\v 27 In that day your mouth will be opened up to the refugee and you will declare and no longer be mute, and you will be a sign for them so they will know that I am Yahweh!’”
