\v 15 \add One day\add* Yahweh gave me this message:
\v 16 "You human, I am going to suddenly take from you \add your wife\add*, whom you love very much. But \add when she dies\add*, do not \add show that you are\add* sad or lament or cry.
\v 17 Groan quietly; do not cry openly for her. Keep your turban wrapped around your head, and \add instead of being barefoot\add*, keep your sandals on your feet. Do not cover the lower part of your face \add to show that you are sad\add*. And do not eat the kind of food that people who are mourning usually eat."

\v 15 One day Yahweh gave me this message:
\v 16 "Son of man, I am going to suddenly take from you your wife by means of a disease, your wife, whom you love very much. But when she dies, do not show that you are sad or lament or cry.
\v 17 Groan quietly; do not cry openly for her. Keep your turban wrapped around your head, and instead of being barefoot, keep your sandals on your feet. Do not cover the lower part of your face to show that you are sad. And do not eat the kind of food that people who are mourning usually eat."

\v 15 Then the word of Yahweh came to me and said, 
\v 16 “Son of man, behold! I am taking the desire of your eyes from you with a plague, but you must not mourn nor weep, and your tears must not flow.
\v 17 You must groan silently. Do not conduct a funeral for the dead. Tie your turban on you and place your sandals on your feet, but do not veil your facial hair or eat the bread of men who mourn for having lost their wives.”

===== Translation Notes: =====

 
  * **the desire of your eyes** - This refers to Ezekiel's wife.  Yahweh refers to Ezekiel by the part of his body he uses to see his wife. (See [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]]).
  * **mourn nor weep, and your tears must not flow** - AT: "express your grief" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **turban** - a head covering made of a long cloth wrapped around the head.
  * **sandals**  - a simple shoe held onto the foot with straps around the ankles.
  * **do not veil your facial hair** - In Israel, men would shave their beards to express sorrow, then cover their faces until their facial hair grew back.  Yahweh told Ezekiel to not cover his facial hair to show that he had not shaved his face to express his sorrow.
