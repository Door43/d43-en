\v 15 \add One day\add* Yahweh gave me this message:
\v 16 "You human, I am going to suddenly take from you \add your wife\add*, whom you love very much. But \add when she dies\add*, do not \add show that you are\add* sad or lament or cry.
\v 17 Groan quietly; do not cry openly for her. Keep your turban wrapped around your head, and \add instead of being barefoot\add*, keep your sandals on your feet. Do not cover the lower part of your face \add to show that you are sad\add*. And do not eat the kind of food that people who are mourning usually eat."

\v 15 Then the word of Yahweh came to me and said, 
\v 16 “Son of man, behold! I am taking the desire of your eyes from you with a plague, but you will not mourn nor weep, and your tears will not flow;
\v 17 groan silently. Do not funerals for the dead. Bind your turban upon you and place your sandals on your feet, but do not veil your facial hair or eat the bread of men.”
