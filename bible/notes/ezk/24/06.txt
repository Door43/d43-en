  * [[:en:obe:kt:woe]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:blood]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:lots]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **a cooking pot** - Yahweh uses compares Jerusalem to a cooking pot. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **rust** - the red material that forms on metal. Rust eats away at metal and eventually destroys it
  * **Take** - Yahweh does not give this command to a specific person, instead he is commanding some imaginary person who is part of the metaphor.
  * **but do not cast lots for it** - Casting lots was a way of choosing which pieces of meat to take out, but because Yahweh wants to take out all of the pieces of meat, there is no need to cast lots.
