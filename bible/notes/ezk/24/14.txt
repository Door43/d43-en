===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues telling a parable to Ezekiel about a cooking pot that represents Jerusalem. This parable continues through the end of this verse. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]])

  * **nor will I rest from it** - "nor will I rest from punishing you." The word "it" refers to Yahweh punishing the people. 
  * **As your ways were, and as your activities, they will judge you** - This speaks of Yahweh judging the people for their ways as if their "ways" were actually judging them. AT: "I will judge you by your activities and your ways" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]]) 
  * **this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]]. AT: "this is what the Lord Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
