===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to compare Jerusalem with a cooking pot.

  * **I will enlarge the pile of wood** - It is implied that the pile of wood is under the cooking pot, which represents Jerusalem. AT: "I will make the pile of wood under you even bigger." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Increase...Light...Cook...let the bones be well burned** - Yahweh gives these commands to imaginary people who are part of the metaphor. 
  * **Increase the wood** - "Use a lot of wood"
  * **And let the bones be well burned** - AT: "And burn the bones." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
