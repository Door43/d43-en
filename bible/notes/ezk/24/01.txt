  * **The word of Yahweh came** - This is an idiom that is used to introduce something that God told his prophets or his people. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:16|3:16]]. AT: "Yahweh spoke this message" or "Yahweh spoke these words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **in the ninth year** - "in the 9th year." This refers to how long they had been in exile under King Jehoiachin. AT: "in the ninth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the tenth month, and on the tenth day of the month** - "the tenth day of the tenth month" or "the 10th day of the 10th month." This is the tenth month of the Hebrew calendar.
