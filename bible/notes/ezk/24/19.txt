===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The people of Israel question Ezekiel, and Ezekiel tells them what Yahweh has said to them.

  * **The word of Yahweh came** - This is an idiom that is used to introduce something that God told his prophets or his people. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:16|3:16]]. AT: "Yahweh spoke this message" or "Yahweh spoke these words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **the house of Israel** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:01|3:1]]. AT: "the Israelites" or "the Israelite people group" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Behold** - The word "behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.
  * **I will desecrate my sanctuary—the pride of ... of your soul, and your sons** - "I will desecrate my sanctuary which is the pride ... of your soul. Your sons" 
  * **desecrate** - "defile"
  * **the pride of your power** - This describes the temple as the building that the people are proud of. This speaks of it as being their "pride" instead of the source of their pride. AT: "the building that you are proud of" or "the source of your strong pride" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the delight of your eyes** - Here Yahweh refers to the people by their "eyes." AT: "the building that you delight to look at" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **the yearning of your soul** - Here Yahweh refers to the people by their "soul" to emphasize their inner feelings. AT: "the building that you truly love" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **your sons and your daughters ... will fall by the sword** - This refers to their enemies by their swords. AT: "your sons and daughters ... will be killed in war" or "your enemies will kill your sons and your daughters ... with their swords" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
