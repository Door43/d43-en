===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Behold** - "Listen!" The word "behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.
  * **I will bring them against you from every side** - "I will cause them to attack you from all directions" 
  * **the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them** - This does not refers to all of the people who live in these places, but rather to soldiers from there. AT: "soldiers from the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Pekod, Shoa, and Koa** - These are the names places in Babylonia. These places represent the soldiers from these places. AT: "those from Pekod, Shoa, and Koa" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **strong, handsome men, governors and commanders ... all of them riding on horses** - This is the description of the men of Assyria that Oholah had slept with who are now turning against her. This is similar to the description given in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:23:05|23:6]].
