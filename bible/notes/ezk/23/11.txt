\v 11 And her sister Oholibah saw this, yet was she more corrupt in her doting than she, and in her whoredoms which were more
than the whoredoms of her sister.
\v 12 She doted upon the Assyrians, governors and rulers, her neighbors, clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding
upon horses, all of them desirable young men.
\v 13 And I saw that she was defiled; they both took one way.
