\v 11 Her sister Oholibah saw this, but lusted more passionately and whored about more than her sister!
\v 12 She lusted for the Assyrians, the governors and encroaching officials who dressed impressively, horsemen riding stallions! All of them were 
vigorous men of beauty!
\v 13 So I saw that she had made herself unclean: one way for both of them!
