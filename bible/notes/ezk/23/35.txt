  * **and thrown me away behind your back** - Yahweh is saying Oholibah does not care about him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you will lift high and reveal** - Both of these phrases describe one action. Possible meanings are "you will bear the punishment for" or "you will put on display." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
