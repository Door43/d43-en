  * **horror and devastation** - Both of these words are used to describe the land of Samaria after it has been destroyed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Your sister Samaria’s cup** - Oholibah's sister Oholah has represented Samaria.  Samaria is called by it's name but still referred to as a sister.  The cup is a symbol for the punishment that she received. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]].
