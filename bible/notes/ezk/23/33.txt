\v 34 You will drink all the liquid that is in that cup;
\q2 then you will break that cup into pieces
\q2 and use those pieces to cut your breasts because you will be very sad.

\v 33 You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow,

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the cup of horror and devastation!** - "the cup that causes horror and devastation." The words "horror" and "devastation" share similar meanings here and emphasize how terrible her punishment will be. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **the cup of your sister Samaria** - Oholibah's sister Oholah has represented Samaria. Samaria is called by it's name but still referred to as a sister. The cup is a symbol for the punishment that she received. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]].
