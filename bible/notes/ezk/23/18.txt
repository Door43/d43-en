\q
\v 18 She displayed her acts of prostitution and she showed her unclothed body,
\q so my soul turned away from her, just as my soul turned away from her sister!
\q
\v 19 Then she committed many more acts of prostitution, as she brought to mind and imitated the days of her youth, 
\q when she behaved as a prostitute in the land of Egypt!
