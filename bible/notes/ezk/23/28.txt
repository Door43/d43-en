\v 28 This is what I, Yahweh the Lord say: Those whom you hate, those with whom you became disgusted and from whom you turned away—I am about to allow them to capture you.

\v 28 For the Lord Yahweh says this: 'Behold! I will give you into the hand of the ones you hate, into the hand of the ones your soul turned away from!
\v 29 They will deal with you hatefully; they will take all your possessions and abandon you naked and bare. The naked shame of your prostitution will be 
revealed, your shameful behavior and your promiscuousness!

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Behold **-  The word “behold” here adds emphasis to what follows. AT: “Indeed”
  * **naked and bare** - Both of these words have the same meaning.  Both are used to emphasize that she will have nothing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **prostitution...shameful behavior...promiscuousness** - These all describe the same actions in different ways.  This is done to emphasize what Oholibah did was wrong. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
