\v 28 For the Lord Yahweh says this, 'Behold! I will give you into the hand of the ones you hate, back into the hand of the ones from whom you had turned away!

  * **Behold** - The word "behold" here adds emphasis to what follows. AT: "Indeed"
  * **unclothed and bare** - These two words mean the same thing and emphasize that she will be completely naked. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **your shameful behavior and your promiscuousness** - These phrases both describe her prostitution and emphasize how bad this behavior was. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
