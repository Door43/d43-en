\v 28 This is what I, Yahweh the Lord say: Those whom you hate, those with whom you became disgusted and from whom you turned away—I am about to allow them to capture you.
\v 29 They will be cruel; they will take away everything that you own. They will leave you completely naked, and everyone will see that you truly are a prostitute.

<usfm>
\v 28 For the Lord Yahweh says this, 'Behold! I will give you into the hand of the ones you hate,  back into the hand of the ones from whom you had turned away!
\v 29 They will deal with you hatefully; they will take all your possessions and abandon you unclothed and bare. The naked shame of your prostitution will be revealed, your shameful behavior and your promiscuousness!

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Behold!** - The word "behold" here adds emphasis to what follows."Indeed!"
  * **unclothed and bare.** - Both of these words have the same meaning.  Both are used to emphasize that she will have nothing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **prostitution...shameful behavior...promiscuousness** - These all describe the same actions in different ways.  This is done to emphasize what Oholibah did was wrong. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
