\v 1 The word of Yahweh came to me and said, 
\v 2 "Son of man, there were two women, daughters of the same mother.
\v 3 They acted as prostitutes in Egypt in the time of their youth. They acted as prostitutes there. Their breasts were squeezed and their virgin nipples were fondled there.
\v 4 Their names were Oholah—the older sister—and Oholibah—her younger sister. Then they became mine and bore sons and daughters. Their names mean this: Oholah means Samaria, and Oholibah means Jerusalem.

===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh tells Ezekiel a story about two young women in Egypt to express how he views the behavior of the people of Israel.

  * **They acted as prostitutes in Egypt...They acted as prostitutes there. Their breasts were squeezed and their virgin nipples were fondled there** - All three of these phrases are saying the same thing in a slightly different way. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Their virgin breasts were squeezed and fondled there** - AT: "There men squeezed and fondled their virgin breasts" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **fondled** - to be touched lovingly or softly
  * **Oholah**  - This is a female name that means "her tent." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Oholibah**  - This is a female name that means "my tent is in her." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
