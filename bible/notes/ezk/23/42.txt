  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to refer to the cities of Jerusalem and Samaria as if they were two prostitutes. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **So the sound of a noisy crowd was around her** - The sound of the crowd is used to refer to the crowd of people. AT: "So there was a noisy crowd around her" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **was around her ... on their hands** - "was around her ... on her and her sister's hands."

In the second part of the verse it switches back to referring to both sisters with the word "their." 
  * **Sabeans were brought** - This can be stated in active form. The word "Sabeans" refers to people from Sheba. AT: "Sabeans had come" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
