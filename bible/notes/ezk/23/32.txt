===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **You will drink your sister's cup** - Drinking the from the same cup is another way to say they will experience the same thing.  AT: "You will experience the same punishment as your sister" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **which is deep and large**- This refers to the amount of punishment received. AT: "which is severe" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **a laughingstock...a subject for derision** - Both of these phrases refer to a person who is laughed at and criticized because of their foolish behavior. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **this cup contains a great amount** - This sentence doesn't say what is in the cup because it is understood by reading [[en:bible:notes:ezk:23:30|23:31]]. AT: "this cup contains a great amount of punishment" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
