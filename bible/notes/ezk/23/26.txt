===== translationNotes: =====

  * **You will not lift up your eyes** - This is a way to refer to a person turning their head to look at something. AT: "You will not look" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **you will think of Egypt no longer** - The phrase "think of Egypt" refers to the acts of prostitution she learned in Egypt. She will no longer think about them because she has learned they will not give her the nice things that the Egyptians, Babylonians, and Assyrians have. Instead, the acts of prostitution have caused her to be punished and she will not want to think about doing them again. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
