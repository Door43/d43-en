===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh speaks about how the people of Jerusalem and Samaria have been unfaithful to him.

  * **unclean** - A person or thing God considers spiritually unacceptable or defiled is spoken of as if it were physically unclean. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:23:05|23:7]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **on the same day they defile my Sabbaths** - The phrase "same day" refers to the previous phrase "make my sanctuary unclean." AT: "on the same day on which they make my sanctuary unclean, they defile my Sabbaths" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **behold!** - "indeed!" The word "behold" here adds emphasis to what follows. 
  * **in the middle of my house** - This refers to the house in general. The reference to the "middle" emphasizes that what was done happened openly in the temple and defiled the whole place. AT: "in my own house" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
