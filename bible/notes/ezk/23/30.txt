===== Translation Notes: =====

 * 
  * **acting like a prostitute, lusting after nations** - The reason this phrase says Oholibah acts like a prostitute with the nations is because the men she has had sex with are symbols of the wealth and power of these nations. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I will put her cup** - The word "cup" refers to Oholibah's punishment.  It represents the thing she has received. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
