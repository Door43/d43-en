<usfm>
\v 30 It is because of what you have done that you will be punished in that way; you have been an immoral prostitute; you have slept with men of other nations, and you have made it impossible for me to accept you, because you have worshiped their idols.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **acting like a prostitute, lusting after nations** - The reason this phrase says Oholibah acts like a prostitute with the nations is because the men she has slept with are symbols of the wealth and power of these nations. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I will put her cup** - The word "cup" refers to Oholibah's punishment. It represents the thing she has received. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
