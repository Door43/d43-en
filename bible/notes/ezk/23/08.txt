\v 9 So I allowed the Assyrian soldiers, whom she wanted to have sex with, to capture her.

\v 8 Neither has she left her whoredoms since the days of Egypt; for in her youth they lay with her, and they
handled the bosom of her virginity; and they poured out their whoredom upon her.
\v 9 Wherefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.
\v 10 These uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters; and her they killed with the sword: and she became a
byword among women; for they executed judgments upon her.
