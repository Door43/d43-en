\v 8 When she was a young woman in Egypt, she started being a prostitute, and young men caressed her breasts and had sex with her; and when she became older, she did not quit acting like a prostitute.
\p
\v 9 So I allowed the Assyrian soldiers, whom she wanted to have sex with, to capture her.
\v 10 They stripped all her clothes off her. They took away her sons and daughters. And then they killed her with a sword. Other women started talking about what had happened to her, about how she had been punished.

\v 8 For she had not left her prostitute behavior behind in Egypt, when they had slept with her when she had been a young girl, when they first began to fondle her virgin nipples, when they first began to pour out their promiscuous behavior on her. 
\v 9 Therefore I gave her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians for whom she lusted!
\v 10 They stripped her naked. They took her sons and daughters, and they killed her with the sword, and she became shameful to other women, so they passed judgment on her.

  * **slept with her...fondle her virgin breasts...pour out their promiscuous behavior** - All of these phrases are different ways to refer to her behavior as a prostitute in Egypt.  It is repeated in different ways to express how shockingly sinful her behavior was. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **had slept with her** - This is a mild way to say they had sexual relations with her. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])

  * **into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians**  - The word "hand" refers to what someone has control over. This phrase is repeated to emphasize that the Assyrians were her lovers.
