\v 8 When she was a young woman in Egypt, she started being a prostitute, and young men caressed her breasts and had sex with her; and when she became older, she did not quit acting like a prostitute.
\p
\v 9 So I allowed the Assyrian soldiers, whom she wanted to have sex with, to capture her.
\v 10 They stripped all her clothes off her. They took away her sons and daughters. And then they killed her with a sword. Other women started talking about what had happened to her, about how she had been punished.

\v 8 For she had not left behind her whoredom from Egypt, since they laid with her from the time of her youth. They fondled the nipples of her 
virginity and poured out their whoredom upon her.
\v 9 Therefore I gave her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians for whom she lusted!
\v 10 They uncovered her nakedness. They took her sons and daughters and slew her with the sword, so she became shameful to women 
when they made judgment against her.
