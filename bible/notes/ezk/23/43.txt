<usfm>
\v 43 Then I said about the woman who had become exhausted by her having sex with many men, 'Now allow those men to act toward her as though she is a prostitute, because that is all that she is.'
\v 44 So they had sex \f + \ft euphemism \f* with those two women, Oholah and Oholibah, like men have sex with prostitutes.
\v 45 But righteous men will condemn them to be punished, like women who commit adultery and who murder others are punished, because those women commit adultery and they murder \f + \ft metonymy \f* others.

\v 44 So they slept with those two women, Oholah and Oholibah, as men sleep with prostitutes.
\v 45 But righteous men will condemn them to be punished, as women who commit adultery and who murder others are punished, because those women commit adultery and they murder others.

\v 43 Then I said about the one worn out by acts of adultery, 'Now they will be sexually immoral with her, and she will be sexually immoral with them.'
\v 44 Then they went and slept her as they would any prostitute; in the same way they slept with Oholah and Oholibah, women guilty of prostitution!
\v 45 But righteous men will condemn them to punishment for adultery and to punishment for one who pours out blood, since they have committed adultery and have blood on their hands."
