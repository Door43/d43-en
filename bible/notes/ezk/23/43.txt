\v 43 Then I said about the one worn out by acts of adultery, ‘Now they will fornicate with her, and she will fornicate with them.’
\v 44 Then they went and penetrated her as they would any prostitute; in the same way they penetrated Oholah and Oholibah, women guilty of prostitution!
\v 45 But righteous men will condemn them to punishment for adultery and to punishment for one who pours out blood, since they have committed adultery and have blood on their hands."
