<usfm>
\v 24 Their huge army will attack you with weapons, riding in chariots and pulling wagons that will carry the army supplies. They will surround you, carrying large and small shields, and wearing helmets. I will allow them to capture you and punish you in the way that they always punish \add their enemies\add*.
\v 25 Because I am very angry with you, I will cause them to act very furiously toward you. They will cut off your noses and your ears. Then, those who are still alive, they will kill with their swords. They will take away your sons and daughters, and a fire will burn up those who remain alive.

\v 24 They will come against you with weapons, and with chariots and wagons, and with a great crowd of people!
\q They will set large shields, small shields, and helmets against you all around!
\q I will give them the opportunity to punish you, and they will punish you with their actions!
\v 25 For I will set my anger on you, and they will deal with you in fury! They will cut off your nose and your ears, and your remnant will fall by the sword! 
They will take your sons and your daughters, so that your descendants will be devoured by fire!
