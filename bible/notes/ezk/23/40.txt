===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh again refers to the cities of Jerusalem and Samaria as if they were two prostitutes. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **You sent out for men who came from far away ... to whom messengers had been sent** - These two phrases have the same meaning. This means that they sent messengers to men far away requesting for them to come to them. AT: "You sent messengers to men who came to you from far away" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **you bathed ... you sat** - Here the word "you" switches to singular and refers to only one sister, but is likely the case for both sisters. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **behold** - "listen." The word "behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.
  * **you bathed, painted your eyes, and adorned yourself with jewelry** - These are things done by a woman to make her appear more beautiful to a man.
  * **my incense and my oil** - These are items used in worship to Yahweh.
