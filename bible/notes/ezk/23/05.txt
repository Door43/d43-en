===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Oholah acted like a prostitute while she was still my wife. She desired to have sex with those she loved—soldiers from Assyria.
\v 6 Some of them were army officers and commanders. They wore beautiful blue uniforms. They were all handsome young men. Some of them rode horses.
\v 7 She acted like a prostitute toward all the important Assyrian officials, and became unacceptable to me by worshiping all the idols of the men she wanted to have sex with.

\v 5 But Oholah whored about when she was mine, and lusted for her lovers, for the encroaching Assyrians:
\v 6 the governor who wears violet and officials vigorous in beauty, all of them horsemen riding on stallions!
\v 7 So she gave her whorishness to them, all the best of Assyria’s men! And she defiled herself with everyone who she lusted after with all 
their idols!
