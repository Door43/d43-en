\v 21 The gate posts of the holy place were square. Their appearance was like the appearance of
\v 22 the wooden altar in front of the holy place, which was three cubits high and two cubits in length on each side. Its corner posts, base, and frame were made of wood. Then the man said to me, "This is the table that stands before Yahweh."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Their appearance was like the appearance of the wooden altar** - The abstract noun "appearance" can be translated as a verb. AT: "They appeared the same way the wooden altar appeared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]]) 
  * **three cubits ... two cubits** - Each long cubit was about 54 centimeters. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:40:05|40:5]]. AT: "about 1.6 meters ... about 1.1 meters" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bdistance]])
  * **There were double doors for the holy place and the most holy place** - "The holy place and the most holy place both had two doors"
  * **These doors had two hinged door panels each** - "Each door had two parts that were on hinges." Hinges connect doors to the wall and allow the doors to swing.
  * **two panels for one door and two panels for the other** - "both of the doors for both the holy place and the most holy place had two parts"
