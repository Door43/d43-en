\v 5 Then he measured the wall of the temple: it was 10.5 ft.\f + \ft Or: 3.2 meters \f* thick. Each of the rooms around the outside of the temple were 7 ft.\f + \ft Or: 2.1 meters \f* wide.
\v 6 Those rooms had three levels, one above the other. There were thirty rooms on each level. There were ledges all around the wall of the temple that were supports for those side rooms; so those supports were not built into the wall of the temple.
\v 7 Each of those side rooms was wider than the one below it. The most narrow rooms were built first, at the bottom. Then a wider set of rooms was built over it, and the widest set was at the top. A set of stairs was built from the lowest level through the middle level to the highest level.

\v 5 Then he measured the wall of the temple: it was about two meters thick. There was a row of rooms along the outside wall of the temple. Each of those rooms was about two meters wide.
\v 6 Those rooms had three levels, one above the other. There were thirty rooms on each level. There were ledges all around the wall of the temple that were supports for those side rooms, so those supports were not built into the wall of the temple.
\v 7 Each of those side rooms was wider than the one below it. The most narrow rooms were built first, at the bottom. Then a wider set of rooms was built over it, and the widest set was at the top. A set of stairs was built from the lowest level through the middle level to the highest level.

\v 5 Then he measured the wall of the house – six cubits. And the width of the side chambers – four cubits all around the house.
\v 6 There were three levels of side-chambers, chamber over chamber; thirty on each level. And they went in the wall that went around the house for the side chambers all around to be a support, for there was no support in the house wall.
\v 7 So the side-chambers widened and went around going up and up, for the house went around higher and higher  all around the house, so that the house widened as it went up and so the lowest level went up to the highest through a middle level.
