====== Ezekiel 41:5-7 ======

<usfm>
\v 5 Then he measured the wall of the temple: it was 10.5 ft.\f + \ft Or: 3.2 meters \f* thick. Each of the rooms around the outside of the temple were 7 ft.\f + \ft Or: 2.1 meters \f* wide.
\v 6 Those rooms had three levels, one above the other. There were thirty rooms on each level. There were ledges all around the wall of the temple that were supports for those side rooms; so those supports were not built into the wall of the temple.
\v 7 Each of those side rooms was wider than the one below it. The most narrow rooms were built first, at the bottom. Then a wider set of rooms was built over it, and the widest set was at the top. A set of stairs was built from the lowest level through the middle level to the highest level.

\v 5 Then he measured the wall of the temple; it was about 3.2 meters thick. There was a row of rooms along the outside wall of the temple. Each of those rooms was about two meters wide.
\v 6 There were three storys of rooms, with thirty rooms on each story. There were ledges all around the wall of the temple that were supports for the side rooms above. There were no extra supports built into the sanctuary wall.
\v 7 Each of the side rooms was wider than the one below it. The most narrow rooms were built first, at the bottom. Then a wider set of rooms was built over it, and the widest set was at the top. A set of stairs was built from the lowest level through the middle level to the highest level.

\v 5 Then the man measured the wall of the house—it was six cubits thick. The width of the side rooms all around the house was four cubits.
\v 6 There were three levels of side rooms, for there were rooms over rooms, thirty on each level. And ledges were in the wall around the house for the side rooms all around, to be a support for the rooms above, for there was no support put in the house wall.
\v 7 So the side rooms widened and went around going up, for the house went around higher and higher all around; the rooms widened as the house went up. And a stairway went up to the highest level, through the middle level.
