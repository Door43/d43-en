====== Ezekiel 41:5-7 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Then he measured the wall of the temple: it was 10.5 ft.\f + \ft Or: 3.2 meters \f* thick. Each of the rooms around the outside of the temple were 7 ft.\f + \ft Or: 2.1 meters \f* wide.
\v 6 Those rooms had three levels, one above the other. There were thirty rooms on each level. There were ledges all around the wall of the temple that were supports for those side rooms; so those supports were not built into the wall of the temple.
\v 7 Each of those side rooms was wider than the one below it. The most narrow rooms were built first, at the bottom. Then a wider set of rooms was built over it, and the widest set was at the top. A set of stairs was built from the lowest level through the middle level to the highest level.

\v 5 Then he measured the wall of the temple; it was three and one-tenth meters thick. There was a row of rooms along the outside wall of the temple. Each of those rooms was two meters wide.
\v 6 There were three stories of rooms, with thirty rooms on each story. There were ledges all around the wall of the temple that were supports for the side rooms above. There were no extra supports built into the sanctuary wall.
\v 7 Each of the side rooms was wider than the one below it. The most narrow rooms were built first, at the bottom. Then a wider set of rooms was built over it, and the widest set was at the top. A set of stairs was built from the lowest level through the middle level to the highest level.

\v 5 Then the man measured the wall of the house—it was six cubits thick. The width of each side room around the house was four cubits in width.
\v 6 There were side rooms on three levels, one room above another, thirty rooms on each level. There were ledges around the wall of the house, to support all of the side rooms, for there was no support put in the wall of the house.
\v 7 So the side rooms widened and went around going up, for the house went around higher and higher all around; the rooms widened as the house went up, and a stairway went up to the highest level, through the middle level.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the house** – the temple
  * **six cubits** - about 3.2 meters (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bdistance]])
  * **cubits** - Each long cubit was about 54 centimeters. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:40:05|40:05]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bdistance]])
  * **four cubits** - about 2 meters
  * **three levels** - "three stories"
  * **There were ledges around the wall of the house** - "The house had ledges all around for the side rooms all around." This way the side rooms could rest on the ledge of the wall.
  * **to support** - "so that the ledges could support"
  * **for there was no support put in the wall of the house** - "for there were no supports in the wall of the house." The people who built the temple did not want stones or wood that would support the side rooms to be sticking out from the wall of the sanctuary.
