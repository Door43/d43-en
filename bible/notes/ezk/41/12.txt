===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The building that faced the courtyard on the west side was seventy cubits in width** - This can be stated as a separate sentence. AT: "There was a building on the west side of the temple area, and its entrance was towards the courtyard. It was seventy cubits in width" 
  * **seventy cubits ... five cubits ... ninety cubits ... one hundred cubits** - Each long cubit was about 54 centimeters. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:40:05|40:5]]. "70 cubits ... 5 cubits ... 90 cubits ... 100 cubits" or "about 38 meters ... about 2.7 meters ... about 49 meters ... about 54 meters" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bdistance]])
