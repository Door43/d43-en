===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 But \add Yahweh\add* became very angry,
\q2 so he pulled up the vine by its roots
\q1 and threw it on the ground,
\q2 where the very hot winds from the desert dried up all its fruit.
\q1 The strong branches wilted and were burned in a fire.
\q2
\v 13 Now that vine has been planted in a hot, dry desert.
