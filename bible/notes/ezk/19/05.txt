\v 5 Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young
lion.
\v 6 And he went up and down among the lions; he became a young lion, and he learned to catch the prey; he devoured men.
\v 7 And he knew their palaces, and laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, because of the
noise of his roaring.
