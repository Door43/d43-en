\q
\v 5 Then she saw that although she had waited for his return, her hopes were now gone, so she took another of her cubs and raised him to become a young lion.
\q
\v 6 This young lion roamed about in the midst of lions. He was a young lion and learned to tear his victims; he devoured men.
\q
\v 7 Then he raped their widows and ruined their cities. 
\q the land and its fullness were abandoned because of the sound of his roaring!

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to describe the nation of Israel as a lioness and the kings of the kingdom of Judah as her cubs.

  * **so she took another of her cubs** - Yahweh now compares Jehoiachin with a young lion cub. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **and its fullness** - "and everything in it"
