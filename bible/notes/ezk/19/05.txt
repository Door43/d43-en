\q
\v 5 Then she saw that although she had waited for his return, her expectation was now gone, so she took another of her cubs and raised him to become a young lion.
\q
\v 6 This young lion roamed about in the midst of lions. He was a young lion and learned to tear his victims; he devoured men.
\q
\v 7 He seized their widows and ruined their cities.
\q The land and its fullness were abandoned because of the sound of his roaring.
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa He seized their widows \fqa* , some ancient copies and many modern versions have \fqa He destroyed their fortresses \fqa* . \f*
