\f + \ft Some versions have \fqa Diphath \fqb instead of \fqa Riphath \fqb . However, \fqa Diphath \fqb was probably a mispelling. Many ancient copies correct it to \fqa Riphath \fqb in order to make it agree with the same name in Gen. 10:2. \f*
\v 7 The sons of Javan were Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
