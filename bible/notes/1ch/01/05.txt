===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras**  - Translate these names of people however you would translate names in your language. They are all names of men. We do not know which son is oldest, but if you have to specify that in your language, put them in the order they are listed in: Gomer (1), Magog (2), Madai (3), Javan (4), Tubal (5), Meshech (6), Tiras (7).
