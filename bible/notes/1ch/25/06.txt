\v 6 All these were under the direction of their fathers. They were musicians in Yahweh's house, with cymbals and stringed instruments as they served in God's house. Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman were under the king's supervision.
\v 7 They and their brothers who were skilled and trained to make music to Yahweh numbered 288.
\v 8 They cast lots for their duties, all alike, the same for the young as well as the old, the teacher as well as the student.
