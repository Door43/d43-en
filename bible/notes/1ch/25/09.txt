===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This begins the list of 24 lots that were cast to choose the order in which families would serve. This list ends in [[:en:bible:notes:1ch:25:29|1 Chronicles 25:31]].

  * **the first ... the second ... the third ... the fourth ... the fifth** - "the 1st ... the 2nd ... the 3rd ... the 4th ... the fifth" or "number 1 ... number 2 ... number 3 ... number 4 ... number 5." This shows the order in which the families were chosen by lots. If this is unnatural in your language you may use "the initial" for "the first" and "the next" for all of the following ones. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **the first lot fell to Joseph's family** - For all of the other people in the list, the text specifies that there were "twelve persons in number." Since this is implied, you may want to add this the statement about Joseph, as the UDB does. AT: "the first lot fell to Joseph's family, twelve persons in number" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Joseph ... Zaccur ... Nethaniah** - See how you translated the names of these men in [[:en:bible:notes:1ch:25:01|25:2]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **the second fell to** - This refers to the second lot. The word "lot" may be added here and to the phrases concerning the rest of the lots. AT: "the second lot fell to" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **Gedaliah** - See how you translated this man's name in [[:en:bible:notes:1ch:25:01|25:3]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **twelve persons** - "12 people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **Izri** - This name is spelled Zeri in [[:en:bible:notes:1ch:25:01|25:3]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
