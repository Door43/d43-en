\v 4 David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus). Now the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, were there.
\v 5 The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, "You will not come in here." But David took the stronghold of Zion, that is, the City of David.
\v 6 David had said, "Whoever attacks the Jebusites first will become a commander." So Joab son of Zeruiah attacked first, so he was made a commander.
