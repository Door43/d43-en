===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He fortified the city around ... Joab fortified the rest of the city** - The word "He" refers to David. The reader should understand that David and Joab were probably in charge of other men who made the fortifications.
  * **the Millo** - This likely refers to a terraced structure that consisted of retaining walls with dirt filled in behind them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
