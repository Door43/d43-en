\v 19 He said, "Yahweh, it would certainly not be right for me to drink this water! That would be like \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* drinking the blood of these men who were willing\f + \ft Or: ready \f* to die for me!" So he refused to drink it.

\v 18 So these three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, the well at the gate. They took the water and brought it to David, but he refused to drink it. Instead, he poured it out to Yahweh.
\v 19 Then he said, "Far be it far from me, Yahweh, that I should drink this. Should I drink the blood of men who have risked their lives?" Because they had put their lives at risk, he refused to drink it. These are things the three mighty men did.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * Verse 18-well of Bethlehem, well at the gate - These two expressions say the same thing and reinforce one another.(See: Doublet)
  * Verse 19 - This verse contains a rhetorical question. David says by his question that the water is precious because of the sacrifice made to obtain it. He feels unworthy to drink it and gives it in sacrifice to the Lord.(See: Rhetorical question)
  * **drink the blood - This is  saying, "they risked their lives to do this."(Metaphor)**
  * ** these three**  - (See: Numbers) "these 3"
