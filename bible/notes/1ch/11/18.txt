\v 18 So the three greatest warriors forced through the camp of Philistia soldiers and drew some water from the well, and brought it to David. But he would not drink it. Instead, he poured it out \add on the ground to be an offering\add* to Yahweh.
\v 19 He said, "Yahweh, it would certainly not be right for me to drink this water! That would be like \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* drinking the blood of these men who were willing\f + \ft Or: ready \f* to die for me!" So he refused to drink it.
\p That was one of the things that David's three greatest warriors did.

\v 18 So these three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, the well at the gate. They took the water and brought it to David, but he refused to drink it. Instead, he poured it out to Yahweh.
\v 19 Then he said, "Far be it far from me, Yahweh, that I should drink this. Should I drink the blood of men who have risked their lives?" Because they had put their lives at risk, he refused to drink it. These are things the three mighty men did.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **three mighty men** - "3 mighty men" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **well of Bethlehem, the well at the gate** - These two phrases mean the same thing and are repeated for clarification.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Far be it from me, that before my God I should do this** - AT: "God, please never allow me to drink such a sacrifice at the costs of my men!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **Should I drink the blood of men who have risked their lives?** - David is saying with this question that the water is precious because of the sacrifice made by those who obtained it.  AT: "I would not drink the blood of men who are willing to die for me" or "I will not drink water that men have risked their lives to get" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
