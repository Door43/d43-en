\v 19 He said, "Yahweh, it would certainly not be right for me to drink this water! That would be like \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* drinking the blood of these men who were willing\f + \ft Or: ready \f* to die for me!" So he refused to drink it.
\p That was one of the things that David's three greatest warriors did.

\v 18 So these three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, the well at the gate. They took the water and brought it to David, but he refused to drink it. Instead, he poured it out to Yahweh.
\v 19 Then he said, "May it be that I should never do this! Should I drink the blood of these men who have risked their lives?" Because they had put their lives at risk, David refused to drink it. These were the deeds of the three mighty men.

  * **three mighty men** - "3 mighty men" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **broke through the army of the Philistines** - "fought their way through the army of the Philistines"
  * **the well of Bethlehem, the well at the gate** - These two phrases refer to the same well. The second specifies which well in Bethlehem. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:1ch:11:15|11:17]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **he poured it out to Yahweh** - This means that he poured out the water as an offering to Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **May it be that I should never do this!** - This phrase is an idiom that means that this is something that David would never do because Yahweh has forbidden him to do so. AT: "Yahweh forbid that I do this!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Should I drink the blood of these men who have risked their lives?** - David speaks of the water as if it were blood because the men risked their lives to bring the water to him. He uses a question to emphasize this. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "I should not drink this water, which would be like drinking the blood of these men who have risked their lives to bring it to me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
