\v 1 Then all Israel came to David at Hebron and said, "Look, we are your flesh and bone.
\v 2 In the recent past, when Saul was king over us, it was you who led the Israelite army. Yahweh your God said to you, 'You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become ruler over my people Israel.'"
\v 3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and David made a covenant with them before Yahweh. They anointed David king over Israel. In this way came true the word of Yahweh that had been declared by Samuel.
