===== Translation Notes: =====

David continues his prayer of praise to Yahweh.

  * **In your hand is power and might**  - These two words "might" and "power" mean the same thing and are used together here to emphasize that Yahweh controls everything and no one is more powerful than Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
