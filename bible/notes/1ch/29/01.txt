\v 1 King David said to the whole assembly, "Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is still young and inexperienced, and
the task is great. For the palace is not for people but for Yahweh God.
\v 2 So I have done my best to provide for the temple of my God. I am giving the gold for the things to be made of gold, the silver for the things to be made of silver, the bronze for the things to be made of bronze, the iron for the things to be made of iron, the wood for the things to be made of wood. I am also giving onyx stones, stones to be set, stones for inlaid work of various colors—all kinds of precious stones, and marble stone in abundance.
