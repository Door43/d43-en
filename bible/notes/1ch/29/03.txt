\v 3 Now, because of my delight in the house of my God, I am donating my personal treasure of gold and silver for it. I am doing this in addition to all that I have prepared for this holy temple: 
\v 4 three thousand talents of gold from Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, in order to overlay the walls of the buildings.
\v 5 I am donating gold for the things to be made of gold, and silver for the things to be made of silver, and things for all kinds of work to done by craftsmen. Who else wants to make a contribution to Yahweh today and give himself to him?"
