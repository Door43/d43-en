<usfm>
\v 14 But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly these things? Indeed,  all things come from you, and we have simply given back to you what is yours.
\v 15 For we are strangers and travelers before you, as all our ancestors were. Our days on the earth are like a shadow, and
there is no hope of remaining on earth.
