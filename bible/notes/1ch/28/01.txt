  * **scheduled work** - Work that needs to be repeated, for example every day or every month.

AT: "the commanders of 1,000 soldiers and the commanders of 100 soldiers" or 2) the words translated as "thousands" and "hundreds" do not represent exact numbers, but are the names of larger and smaller military divisions. AT: "the commanders of large military divisions and the commanders of smaller military divisions" See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:1ch:13:01|13:1]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
