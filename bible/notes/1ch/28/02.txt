===== translationNotes: =====

  * **rose to his feet** - This is an idiom. AT: "stood up" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **my brothers and my people** - These two phrases share similar meanings and emphasize that David and the people of Israel are family. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **the ark of the covenant of Yahweh; a footstool for our God** - The second phrase defines the first phrase. The "ark of the covenant" is spoke of as Yahweh's footstool to picture God on his throne, with his feet resting on his footstool, which represents all that is in submission to him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a temple for my name** - Here God refers to himself by his "name." AT: "a temple for me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **a man of war and have shed blood** - "a man accustomed to war and have shed blood." Both descriptions emphasize the same thing, namely that David had killed people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **have shed blood** - This refers to killing people. AT: "have killed people" (See:[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
