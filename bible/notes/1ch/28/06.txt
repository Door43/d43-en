===== Translation Notes: =====

David continues to speak to the Israelites.

  * **He said to me** - AT: "God said to me"
  * **my house** - The word "house" refers to the temple of Yahweh.
  * **I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father** - This does not mean that Solomon becomes an actual son of God, but it describes the personal relationship that he and God will have. AT: "I have chosen to treat him like a son, and I will be like a father to him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **my commandments and decrees** - These two words basically mean the same thing and are used together to emphasize the importance of doing what God says. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **as you are this day** - The word "you" here refers to David. AT: "just as you are committed this day" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
