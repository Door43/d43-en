\v 9 As for you, Solomon my son, obey the God of your father, and serve him with your whole heart and a willing spirit. Do this because Yahweh searches all hearts and understands every motivation of everyone's thoughts. If you seek him, he will be found by
you, but if you abandon him, he will reject you permanently.
\v 10 Realize that  Yahweh has chosen you to build this temple as his sanctuary. Be strong and do it."

===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **serve him with your whole heart and a willing spirit** - These two phrases refer to a similar attitude of service. AT: "serve him completely and wholeheartedly". (See: Parallelism)
  * **Be strong and do it** - The word "strong" does not refer only to physical strength, but more importantly to strength of character as a leader who is committed to the task at hand and does it.  David hopes his son, Solomon, has that type of strength to oversee the building of the temple.
