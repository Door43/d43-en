You must do that because he knows what everyone is thinking and he understands the reasons that people do what they do. If you seek \add to know\add* him, he will heed your prayers. But if you abandon\f + \ft Or: reject \f* him, he will abandon\f + \ft Or: reject \f* you forever.

\v 9 As for you, Solomon my son, obey the God of your father, and serve him with your whole heart and a willing spirit. Do this because Yahweh searches all hearts and understands every motivation of everyone's thoughts. If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you abandon him, he will reject you permanently.
\v 10 Realize that Yahweh has chosen you to build this temple as his sanctuary. Be strong and do it."
