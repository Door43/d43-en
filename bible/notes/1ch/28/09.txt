\v 9 And you, my son Solomon, must know God like I know him, and you must serve him faithfully and because you want to. You must do that because he knows what everyone is thinking and he understands the reasons that people do what they do. If you seek \add to know\add* him, he will heed your prayers. But if you abandon\f + \ft Or: reject \f* him, he will abandon\f + \ft Or: reject \f* you forever.
\v 10 Yahweh has chosen you to \add arrange to\add* build a temple for him. So think about \add what I have said\add*, and be strong and do what \add he is wanting you to do\add*."

\v 9 As for you, Solomon my son, obey the God of your father, and serve him with your whole heart and a willing spirit. Do this because Yahweh searches all hearts and understands every motivation of everyone's thoughts. If you seek him, he will be found by
you, but if you abandon him, he will reject you permanently.
\v 10 Realize that  Yahweh has chosen you to build this temple as his sanctuary. Be strong and do it."

===== Translation Notes: =====

David now changes who he is speaking to. He is speaking to Solomon in these verses. But, he is speaking so that all the Israelites will hear what he tells Solomon.  Verse 10 concludes David's speech to the people of Israel.

  * **with your whole heart and a willing spirit **  - Solomon would need to love and fear Yahweh (the heart is symbolic of love) and seek Yahweh's guidance (willingly listen to Yahweh's directions). (see: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Be strong and do it.**  - This is not a physical strength, but strength as a leader to oversee the building of the temple. (see: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
