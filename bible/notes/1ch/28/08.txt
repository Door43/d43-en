===== Translation Notes: =====

David continues to speak to the Israelites.

  * **Now then** - This indicates that David starts a new phase in his speech.
  * **keep and try to carry out** - These two words basically mean the same thing and are used together to emphasize the importance of doing what God commands. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **your children after you** - AT: "your children who will take your place after you die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
