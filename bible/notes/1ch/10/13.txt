\v 13 Saul died because he did not faithfully obey what Yahweh told him to do. He even went to a woman who talks to the spirits of dead people and asked her what he should do,
\v 14 instead of asking Yahweh what he should do. So Yahweh caused him to die, and he appointed David, the son of Jesse, to be the king \add of Israel\add*.

\v 13 So Saul died because he was unfaithful to Yahweh. He did not obey Yahweh's instructions,
but asked for advice from someone who talked with the dead.

\v 14 He did not seek guidance from Yahweh, so Yahweh killed him and handed over the kingdom to David son of Jesse.
