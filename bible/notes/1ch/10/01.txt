===== translationNotes: =====


  * **Every man of Israel fled from before the Philistines and fell down dead on Mount Gilboa** - It is implied that these men were Israelite soldiers. AT: "The whole army of Israel ran away from the Philistines" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **and fell down dead** - This is probably a generalization. It seems that while all the soldiers did run away, not all of them died. AT: "and most of them died" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **Abinadab ... Malki-Shua** - See how you translated these men's names in [[:en:bible:notes:1ch:08:32|8:33]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **because of the archers** - Saul was in pain because the archers had shot him. AT: "because the archers had shot him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
