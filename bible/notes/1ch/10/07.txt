===== translationNotes: =====

  * **When every man of Israel** - This is probably a generalization. AT: "When the men of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **they had fled** - "the Israelite soldiers had fled"
  * **the Philistines came and lived in them** - "the Philistines came and lived in the cities from which the Israelites had fled." This probably happened after the events in verses 8-12.
  * **It came about** - This phrase is used here to mark an important event in the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **to strip the dead** - "to take everything of value off of the dead bodies"
  * **Saul and his sons fallen** - Here "fallen" is a polite way to refer to someone who died in battle. AT: "Saul and his sons dead" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
