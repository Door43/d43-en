\v 3  David supplied a large amount of iron for the nails for the doors to go in the gateways, and for braces. He also supplied more bronze than could be weighed,
\v 4 and more cedar trees than could be counted. (The Sidonians and the Tyrians brought too many cedar logs to David to count.)
\v 5 David said, "My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house that is to be built for Yahweh must be especially
magnificent, so that it will be famous and glorious in all other lands. So I will prepare for its building." So David made 
extensive preparations before his death.
