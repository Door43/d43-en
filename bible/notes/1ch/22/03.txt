\v 3 David supplied a large amount of iron for the nails for the doors to go in the gateways, and for braces. He also supplied more bronze than could be weighed,
\v 4 and more cedar trees than could be counted. (The Sidonians and the Tyrians brought too many cedar logs to David to count.)
\v 5 David said, "My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house that is to be built for Yahweh must be especially magnificent, so that it will be famous and glorious in all other lands. So I will prepare for its building." So David made extensive preparations before his death.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **braces** - "clamps" or "hinges." These are items that connect two things together.
  * **more bronze than could be weighed** - This is an exaggeration to show that there was a very large quantity of bronze. This can be stated in active form. AT: "so much bronze that no one could weigh it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **more cedar trees than could be counted** - This is an exaggeration to show that there was a very large number of cedar trees. This can be stated in active form. AT: "so many cedar trees that no one could count them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **The Sidonians and the Tyrians brought too many cedar logs to David to count** - This is background information to explain who provided so many logs. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **the house that is to be built for Yahweh** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the house that he will build for Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **so that it will be famous and glorious in all other lands** - Here the word "lands" refers to the people who lived there. AT: "so that people in every other land will know about it and think that it is glorious" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **prepare for its building** - "prepare to build it"
