===== Translation Notes: =====
David continues telling Solomon what Yahweh said to him.

    * **on every side**  - This means in every place surrounding Israel.
    * **in his days** - "while he rules over Israel"
    * **a house for my name** - AT: "a temple to honor me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **He will be my son, and I will be his father** - God will treat Solomon as if he were God's own son. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever** - Here "throne" refers to the authority to rule as king. AT: "I will make his descendants rule over Israel forever"
