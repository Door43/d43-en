\v 16 Then David the king went in and sat before Yahweh; he said, "Who am I, Yahweh God, and what is my family that you have brought me to this point?
\v 17 And this was a small thing in your sight, God. You have spoken of your servantâ€™s family for a great while to come, and have shown me future generations,  Yahweh God.
\v 18 What more can I, David, say to you? You have honored your servant. You have given your servant special recognition.

  * **he said** - "David said"
  * **Who am I, Yahweh God, and what is my family that you have brought me to this point?** - David asks this question to express his gratitude that God has chosen to bless him even though he does not deserve it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **And this was a small thing** - Something that is not important is described as being small. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **in your sight** - Yahweh's sight is used to refer to his understanding. AT: "to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **What more can I, David, say to you?** - David uses this question to express that he cannot fully express his thankfulness to God. AT: "If I could say more to express my gratitude then I would but I do not know what else to say. " (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **your servant** - David refers to himself as Yahweh's servant.
  * **You have honored your servant. You have given your servant special recognition** - Both of these phrases have the same meaning.  If your language only has one way to express "honor" and "recognition" then this can be translated as one phrase. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
