\v 3 But that same night the word of God came to Nathan, saying,
\v 4 "Go and tell David my servant, 'This is what Yahweh says: You will not build me a house in which to live.
\v 5 For I have not lived in a house from the day that I brought up Israel to this present day. Instead, I have been living in a tent, a tabernacle, in various places.
\v 6 In all places I have moved among all Israel, did I ever say anything to any of Israel's leaders whom I appointed to shepherd my people, saying, "Why have you not built me a house of cedar?"'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the word of God came to Nathan, saying,** - The idiom "the word of God came to" is used to introduce a special message from God. AT: "God gave a message to Nathan. He said," or "God spoke this message to Nathan:" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **saying, "Go and tell David my servant, 'This is what Yahweh says: You will not build me a house in which to live.** - This has quotations within quotations. It may be necessary to translate them as indirect quotations. AT: "saying, "Go and tell David my servant that he will not be the one to build a house in which I will live." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotesinquotes]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **build me a house** - Here "house" means a temple. In [[:en:bible:notes:1ch:17:09|17:10]] Yahweh will say that he will build a house for David. There "house" means a family. If your language has a word that can express both ideas, use it here and in 17:10.
  * **that I brought up Israel** - The implied information is that this refers to God bringing up Israel out of the land of Egypt. AT: "that I brought the Israelites to the promised land from the land of Egypt" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **a tent, a tabernacle** - Both the words "tent" and "tabernacle" describe the same thing and emphasize that he had lived in a place that was not a permanent building. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **did I ever say anything to any of Israel's leaders whom I appointed to shepherd my people, saying, "Why have you not built me a house of cedar"** - This has a quotation within a quotation. The direct quotation can be stated as an indirect quotation. AT: "did I ever ask any of Israel's leaders, whom I appointed to shepherd my people, why they had not built me a house of cedar" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotesinquotes]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **did I ever say anything to any of Israel's leaders** - Yahweh uses a question to emphasize that he never asked any of Israel's leaders to build him a house. AT: "I never said anything to any of Israel's leaders" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **whom I appointed to shepherd my people** - Those who are leaders of the people of Israel are spoken of as if they were shepherds and the people were sheep. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Why have you not built me a house of cedar?** - If Yahweh had asked the leaders this question, he would have been using a question to scold them for not building him a house of cedar. But, Yahweh said previously that he did not ask them this question. AT: "You should have built me a house of cedar." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
