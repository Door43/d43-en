\v 3 But that same night the word of God came to Nathan and said,
\v 4 "Go and tell David my servant, 'This is what  Yahweh says: You will not build me a house in which to live.
\v 5 For I have not lived in a house from the day that I brought up Israel, to this present day. Instead, I have been living in a tent, a tabernacle,  in various places.

\v 6 In all places I have moved among all Israel, did I ever say anything to any of Israel's leaders whom I appointed to shepherd my people, saying, "Why have you not built me a house of cedar?"'"
