<usfm>
\v 9 I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them there, so that they may live in their own place and be troubled no more. No longer will wicked people oppress them, as they did before,
\v 10 as they were doing from the days that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. And I will subdue all your enemies.
Moreover I tell you that I, Yahweh, will build you a house.
