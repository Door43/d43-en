===== Translation Notes: =====

This is a continuation of the listing of the names in order of the men chosen by lot which began in [[:en:bible:notes:1ch:24:07|1 Chronicles 24:7]].

  * **ninth ... sixteenth** - This shows the order in which the leaders were chosen by the casting of lots. AT: “number 9…number 10…number 11…number 12…number 13…number 14…number 15…number 16” or substitute “original” for “first” and “next” for each of the others as in UDB. (See: Ordinal Numbers and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **Jeshua ... Immer** - These are names of men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
