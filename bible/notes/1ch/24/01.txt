\v 1 The work groups based on Aaron's descendants were these: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
\v 2 Nadab and Abihu died before their father died. They had no children, so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests.
\v 3 David, together with Zadok, a descendant of Eleazar, and Ahimelech, a descendant of Ithamar, divided them into groups for their work as priests.
