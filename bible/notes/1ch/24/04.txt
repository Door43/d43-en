\v 4 There were more leaders among the descendants of Eleazar than there were among the descendants of Ithamar. So they appointed sixteen leaders from Eleazar's descendants and eight leaders from Ithamar's descendants.
\v 5 There were temple officials and priests who were there, including descendants of both Eleazar and Ithamar, to make sure that the work was divided fairly. So they decided what work each group would do by casting lots\f + \ft Or: throwing marked stones \f*.

\v 4 There were more leading men among Eleazar's descendants than among Ithamar's descendants, so they divided Eleazar's descendants into sixteen groups. They did this by clan heads and by Ithamar's descendants. These divisions were eight in number, corresponding to their clans.
\v 5 They divided them impartially by lot, for there were holy officials and officials of God, from both Eleazar's descendants and Ithamar's descendants.
