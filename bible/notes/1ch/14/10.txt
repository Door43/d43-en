\v 10 Then David asked for help from God. He said, "Should I attack the Philistines? Will you give victory over them?" Yahweh said to him, "Attack, for I will certainly give them to you."
\v 11 So they came up to Baal Perazim, and there he defeated them. He commented, "Yahweh has burst through my enemies by my hand like a bursting flood of water." So the name of that place became Baal Perazim.
\v 12 The Philistines abandoned their gods there, and David gave an order that they should be burned.
