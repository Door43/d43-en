\v 10 Then David inquired of God saying, "Should I go up against the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hand?" Yahweh answered David, "Go up,  for I will deliver them into your hand."
\v 11 So David came up to Baal-perazim, and there David defeated them. He commented. "God has burst through my enemies by my hand, like a bursting flood of waters." 
Therefore the name of that place became "Baal-perazim," Yahweh bursts through.
\v 12 And they abandoned their gods there, and David gave an order that  they be burned.
