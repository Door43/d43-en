\v 1 It came about later that Nahash, king of the people of Ammon, died, and that his son became king in his place.
\v 2  David said, "I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me." So David sent messengers to console him concerning his father. David's servants entered the land of the Ammonites and went to Hanun, in order to console him. 
\v 3 But the leaders of Ammon said to Hanun, "Do you really think that David is honoring your father because he has sent men to comfort you? Do not his servants come to you to explore and examine the land in order to overthrow it."
