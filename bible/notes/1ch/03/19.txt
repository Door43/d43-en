  * **Obadiah** - This man has the same name as the prophet Obadiah but is a different person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **further descendants were Arnan, Obadiah, and Shekaniah** - Different versions put these people into different relationships with each other because the Hebrew is not very clear about them.
