===== Translation Notes: =====

This is the beginning of the list of David's descendants who became king.

  * **Solomon's son was Rehoboam. Rehoboam's son was Abijah** - Solomon had more than one son.  The same is true of other men in the list. AT: "Solomon was the father of Rehoboam. Rehoboam was the father of Abijah"
