\v 25 But  they were unfaithful to the God of their fathers, and worshiped the gods of the peoples of the land instead,
whom God destroyed before them.
\v 26 The God of Israel stirred up Pul king of Assyria, who is also called Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria.
He took into exile the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, and brought them to Halah,
Habor,  Hara, and to the river of Gozan, where they remain to this day.
