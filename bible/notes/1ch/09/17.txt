\v 17 The doorkeeps were Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, and Ahiman, and their descendants. Shallum was their leader.
\v 18 Previously they stood guard at the king’s gate on the east side for the camp of Levi's descendants.
\v 19 Shallum son of Kore, son of Ebiasaph, son of Korah, and his brothers, of his father’s clan, the Korahites, were over the temple work and guards of the thresholds of the tent. This was just as their ancestors had been guards  over the entrance to the place where Yahweh lives.
