\v 9 Jabez was more respected than his brothers. His mother called him Jabez. She said, "Because I bore him in pain."
\v 10 Jabez called out to the God of Israel and said, "If only you would bless me indeed, and extend my territory. May your hand be with me; keep me from harm so that I might not have to endure pain!" And God granted him his prayer.
