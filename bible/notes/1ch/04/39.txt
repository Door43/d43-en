\v 39 They went outside of Gedor \add town\add* on the east side of the valley to look for pastureland for their flocks of sheep.
\v 40 They found good pastureland with plenty of grass. The place was peaceful and quiet.
\p Previously the descendants of \add Noah's son\add* Ham had lived there.
\v 41 But while Hezekiah was the king of Judah, those leaders of the tribe of Simeon came to Gedor and fought against the descendants of Ham and destroyed their tents. They also fought against the descendants of Meun who were living there and they killed all of them. So now there are no descendants of Meun living there. The descendants of Simeon started to live there, because there was good pastureland there for their sheep.
