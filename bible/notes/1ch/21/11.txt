\v 11 So Gad came to David, and said to him, Thus says Jehovah, Take which you wilt:
\v 12 either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtaketh
thee; or else three days the sword of Jehovah, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of Jehovah destroying throughout all
the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him that sent me.
