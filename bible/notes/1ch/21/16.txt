\v 16 David looked up and saw the angel of Yahweh standing between earth and heaven, having a drawn sword in his
hand raised over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, lay facedown on the ground.
\v 17 David said to God, "Is it not I that commanded that the army be numbered? I did this wicked thing.
But these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, Yahweh my God,  punish me and my
family, but do not punish your people with this plague."
