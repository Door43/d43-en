===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **An adversary arose against Israel** - To become higher describes becoming more powerful. AT: "An enemy of Israel became more powerful" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
    * **incited**  - To have caused someone to act.
    * **from Beersheba to Dan**  - The Israelites considered these two cities their most southern and most northern cities. David uses these cities to refer to all of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
    * **a hundred times greater than it is** - Joab expresses the desire for an army the size of 100 armies to say he would like the army to have more soldiers and be more powerful. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
    * ** But my lord king, do they not all serve my lord. Why does my lord want this? Why bring guilt on Israel?"** - AT: But my lord king, they all serve you already. My lord should not request this. You will only bring guilt on the people of Israel by your desire for military power." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
    * **Why does my Lord want this?**  - The word "this" refers to David's plan to count all the men of Israel.
