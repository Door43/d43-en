\v 1 And Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel.
\v 2 And David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring me word,
that I may know the sum of them.
\v 3 And Joab said, Jehovah make his people a hundred times as many as they are: but, my lord the king, are they not all my
lord’s servants? why does my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of guilt to Israel?
