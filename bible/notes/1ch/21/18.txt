  * **as Gad instructed him to do in the name of Yahweh** - Speaking "in the name of Yahweh" means speaking with his power and authority, or as his representative. AT: "as Gad, speaking for Yahweh, instructed David to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **hid themselves** - They were afraid of the angel. This can be made explicit. AT: "hid themselves because they were afraid of the angel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
