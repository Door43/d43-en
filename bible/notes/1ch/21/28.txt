\v 28 And when David saw that Yahweh had answered him there at the place where Ornan threshed grain and had ended the plague, he offered sacrifices there.
\v 29 Yahweh's sacred tent, which Moses had commanded to be set up in the wilderness, and the altar for burning sacrifices completely, were at that time on a hill at the city of Gibeon.
\v 30 But David did not want to go there to request God to tell him what he wanted David to do, because he was afraid that the angel sent from Yahweh might strike him with his sword; he realized that this was the place that Yahweh now wanted sacrifices to be made.

\v 28 When David saw that Yahweh had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he performed the sacrifice there at that same time.
\v 29 Now at that time, Yahweh's tabernacle, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar for burnt offerings, were at the high place at Gibeon.
\v 30 However, David could not go there to ask for God's direction, because he was afraid of the sword of the angel of Yahweh.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Ornan** - Translate his name as in [[:en:bible:notes:1ch:21:13|21:15]].
  * **Now at that time ... the angel of Yahweh** - Verses 29-30 are background information to explain why David offered this sacrifice at the threshing floor instead of on the altar at the tabernacle. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **to ask God's direction** - "to ask God to tell him what he should do" 
  * **afraid of the sword of the angel of Yahweh** - Here "sword" represents being killed by the angel of Yahweh. AT: "afraid he would be killed by the angel of Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
