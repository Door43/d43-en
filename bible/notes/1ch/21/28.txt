\v 28 When David saw that Yahweh had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he performed the sacrifice there at that same time.
\v 29 Now at that time, Yahweh's tabernacle, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar for burnt offerings, were at the shrine at Gibeon.
\v 30 However, David could not go there to ask for God's direction, because he was afraid of the sword of the angel of Yahweh.
