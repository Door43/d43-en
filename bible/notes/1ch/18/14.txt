===== translationNotes: =====

  * **over all Israel** - "over all the Israelites"
  * **he administered justice and righteousness to all his people** - The abstract nouns "justice" and "righteousness" can be stated as an action. AT: "he did what was just and right for all his people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Zeruiah ... Ahilud ... Ahitub ... Abiathar ... Shavsha ... Benaiah ... Jehoiada** - These are the names of men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **recorder** - the person who writes down details of special events
  * **Ahimelech** - This spelling represents a correction of the spelling "Abimelech," which some versions follow. The corrected spelling makes this verse agree with [[:en:bible:notes:2sa:08:15|8:17]].
  * **Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were priests** - Some versions correct this to say that Ahitub and Ahimelech were high priests.
  * **Cherethites ... Pelethites** - These are the names of foreign people groups who became David's bodyguards.
