\v 9 And when Tou king of Hamath heard that David had struck all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah,
\v 10 he sent Hadoram his son to king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadarezer and
struck him (for Hadarezer had wars with Tou); and he had with
him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.
