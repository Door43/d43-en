  * **General Information:** - This continues the list of gatekeepers which started in [[:en:bible:notes:1ch:26:01|26:1]].

  * **Hosah ... Merari ... Shimri ... Hilkiah ... Tabaliah ... Zechariah** - These are the names of men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **the second ... the third ... the fourth** - "the 2nd ... the 3rd ... the 4th" or "number 2 ... number 3 ... number 4." This shows the order in which the sons were born. If it is more natural in your language, you may say "the next" for each son. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **All of Hosah's sons and kinsmen were thirteen in number** - "There were 13 of Hosah's sons and kinsmen." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
