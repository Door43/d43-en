\v 12 These divisions of the gatekeepers, corresponding to their leaders, had responsibilities, like their relatives, to serve in Yahweh's house.
\v 13 They threw lots, both young and old, corresponding to their families, for every gate.
\v 14 When the lot was thrown for the east gate, it fell to Shelemiah. They then threw lots for Zechariah his son, a prudent advisor, and his lot
came out for the north gate.
