\v 38 All those men were soldiers who volunteered to be in David's army. They came to Hebron wanting very much to enable David to be the king of all of the Israelite people.
\v 39 The men spent three days there with David, eating and drinking, because their families had given them food to take with them.
\v 40 Also, their fellow Israelites came from as far away as the area where the tribes of Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali lived, bringing food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen. They brought a lot of flour, fig cakes, raisins, wine, olive oil, cattle and sheep. And throughout Israel, the people were very joyful.

over all Israel. All the rest of Israel were in agreement to make David king also.
\v 39 They were there with David three days, eating and drinking, for their relatives had sent them with provisions.
