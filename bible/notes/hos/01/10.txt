<usfm>
\v 10 But \add some day\add* the people of Israel will be \add as numerous\add* as \f + \ft simile \f* the grains of sand on the seashore; no one will be able to count them. Now I am saying to them, 'You are not my people,' but then people will say to them, 'You are the children of God who is all-powerful.'
\v 11 At that time, the people of Judah and the people of Israel will unite. They will appoint one leader for all of them, and they will return from the countries to which they have been exiled\f + \ft Or: forced to go \f*. That will be a great time; Jezreel \add means\add* '\add God plants\add*', \add and it will be as though God will plant them in this country again\add*."

\v 10 One day in the future, the people of Israel will be as numerous as the grains of sand by the sea. No one will be able to count them. I have said to Israel, 'You are not my people,'—but one day I will say to them, 'You are the people whom I will protect and love.'
\v 11 On that day I, Yahweh, will gather all the people of Judah and bring them together with all the people of Israel. They will choose from among themselves a single leader, and they will go out of that land in which they were held as exiles. On that day they will say, 'Great is the day of Jezreel!' (Jezreel means, 'God plants his people in his land.')

\v 10 Yet the number of the people of Israel
\q will be like the sand of the seashore,
\q which cannot be measured or counted.
\q It will be that where it was said to them,
\q 'You are not my people,'
\q it will be said to them,
\q 'You are people of the living God.'
\q
\v 11 The people of Judah and the people of Israel
\q2 will be gathered together.
\q They will appoint one leader for themselves,
\q and they will go up from the land,
\q for great will be the day of Jezreel.
