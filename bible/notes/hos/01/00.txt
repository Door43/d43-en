====== Hosea 01 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 1:2-11, which is a series of quotation. Chapter 1 and 2 is a single series forming one narrative.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Hosea's marriage ==
God does not approve of prostitution, but he told Hosea to marry a prostitute so that the message of Israel's unfaithfulness would be shown to the people. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:unfaithful]])

Hosea's marriage to Gomer is a metaphor for the kingdom of Israel's relationship to Yahweh. Israel was unfaithful to Yahweh and broke the covenant with him. Gomer was a woman who was unfaithful to her husband and broke her marriage agreement with him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:obe:kt:covenant]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphor ==

Hosea 1-4 is controlled by a metaphor that Hosea lived out. He was personifying the relationship between Israel and Yahweh. Hosea played the part of Yahweh, and Gomer played the part of Israel.
