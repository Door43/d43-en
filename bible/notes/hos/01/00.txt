====== Hosea 01 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 1:2-11 which is a series of quotation. Chapter 1 and 2 is a single series forming one narrative.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Hosea's marriage ==
God does not condone prostitution but he told Hosea to marry a prostitute so the message of Israel's [[:en:obe:kt:unfaithful|unfaithfulness]] would be shown to the people. 

Hosea's marriage to Gomer is a type of [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] for the kingdom of Israel's relationship to Yahweh. Israel was unfaithful to Yahweh and broke the [[:en:obe:kt:covenant|covenant]] with him. Gomer was a woman who was unfaithful to her husband and breaks her marriage agreement with him.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphor ==
Chapter 1 through 4 of Hosea is controlled by a metaphor that Hosea lived out! He was personifying the relationship between Israel and Yahweh. Hosea played the part of Yahweh and Gomer played the part of Israel.
