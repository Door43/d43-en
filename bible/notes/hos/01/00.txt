====== Hosea 01 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Hosea is written in the form of poetry and God instructs him to preach his message through the marriage with a prostitute. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Metaphor ==
God does not condone prostitution but he told Hosea to marry one so that the message of Israel's unfaithfulness would be preached to the people. 

Hosea's marriage to the prostitute Gomer is a type of [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] for the kingdom of Israel's relationship to Yahweh. Israel was [[:en:obe:kt:unfaithful|unfaithful]] to Yahweh and broke the [[:en:obe:kt:covenant|covenant]] with him, as a woman who is unfaithful to her husband and breaks her marriage agreement with him.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

Metaphor.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Names ==
Each of the three children have been given names that have meaning in Hebrew and so should be left to sound as close to the sound and spelling of the names in the text (i.e. Jezreel, Lo Ruhamah, Lo Ammi). Each of these children's names tell something that Hosea preached.
