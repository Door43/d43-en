<usfm>
\v 6 \add Later\add* Gomer became pregnant again, and she gave birth to a daughter. Yahweh said to me "Give her the name Lo-ruhamah, \add which means\add* '\add not loved\add*', because I will no longer show that I love the people \f + \ft metaphor \f* of Israel, and I will not forgive them \add for the sins that they have committed\add*.
\v 7 But I will show that I love the people \f + \ft metonymy \f* of Judah \add by saving them from their enemies\add*. However, it will not be by weapons and armies or horses and chariots that I will save them. Instead, it will be by the power that I, Yahweh their God, have."

\v 6 Gomer soon became pregnant again, and this time she gave birth to a daughter. Then Yahweh spoke to him, "Give her the name Lo Ruhamah, which means 'no mercy,' because I will no longer have any mercy for the people of Israel, and I will not forgive them for even one sin they have committed.
\v 7 But I will have mercy on the people of Judah. I will save them—but not by deadly weapons, the bow, the sword, or battle. I will not save them by armies or by strong horses and those who ride on them. Instead, I, Yahweh myself, will save them."

<usfm>
\v 6 Gomer conceived again and bore a daughter. Then Yahweh said to Hosea,
\q "Call her name Lo-Ruhamah,
\q for I will no longer have mercy
\q on the house of Israel,
\q that I should forgive them at all.
\q
\v 7 Yet I will have mercy on the house of Judah,
\q and I will save them by myself, Yahweh their God.
\q I will not save them
\q by bow, sword, battle, horses, or horsemen."
