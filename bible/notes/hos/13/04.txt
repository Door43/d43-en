\v 4 But I am Yahweh, whom you should worship;
\q2 I am the one who brought you out of the land of Egypt.
\q1 You must worship no other God; you must worship only Me.
\q2 There is no one else who can rescue you.

\v 5 I took charge of you in the wilderness,
\q2 in a desert where there was no water to drink. 
\q1
\v 6 When I provided food for you,
\q2 you ate as much as you wanted and were satisfied.
\q1 But when you were no longer hungry, you became proud
\q2 and forgot about me.

\v 4 But I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.
\q You must acknowledge no God but me;
\q you must acknowledge that besides me, there is no other savior.
\q
\v 5 I knew you in the wilderness,
\q in the land of great dryness.
\q
\v 6 When you had pasture, then you became full;
\q and when you were filled, your heart became lifted up;
\q for that reason you forgot me.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh is speaking.

  * **I knew you in the wilderness**  - Yahweh, unlike the gods of the idols, watched over his people and blessed them with water and what they needed to survive in the desert.
  * **your heart became lifted up**  - "Your heart" refers to the relationship of the people of Israel toward God; they became proud, thinking that they did not need Yahweh to be their god any more. (see: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
