<usfm>
\v 1 Previously, when the leaders of Israel spoke,
\q2 the people trembled;
\q2 those leaders were highly respected by the Israelite people.
\q1 But the people sinned greatly by \add worshiping\add* Baal,
\q2 so now they will be killed \add by their enemies\add*.
\q1
\v 2 Now they sin more and more;
\q2 they make idols for themselves
\q2 and \add cover them\add* with their silver.
\q1 Those idols are statues that are very cleverly made,
\q2 but those statues are made by \add mere\add* humans.
\q1 But \add the people are told\add*, "Kiss those idols \add that resemble a\add* calf,
\q2 and offer sacrifices to them!"

<usfm>
\v 1 Yahweh says, "When the leaders of Israel spoke, the people trembled;
\q2 they were respected in Israel.
\q1 But because they all worshiped Baal, they became guilty, 
\q2 and they died. 
\q1
\v 2 Now they sin more and more;
\q2 they make cast metal figures out of silver
\q1 to make them their idols.
\q2 Those idols are statues that are very cleverly made,
\q2 but those statues are made only by craftsmen.
\q1 But other people see 
\q2 that the men of Israel sacrifice to these calf-idols and kiss them to worship them.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh is speaking.

  * **When Ephraim spoke** - Hosea uses the term "Ephraim" to refer to the entire northern kingdom, although it was also the name of one of the ten tribes. Hosea seems to be speaking of a long-past time, when the northern kingdom was strong and honored, unlike at the present time. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **there was trembling** - AT: "there was trembling among the people" The other people in Israel felt humility in front of the Ephraimites. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **He exalted himself in Israel** - "He" refers to the tribe of Ephraim, which became a very influential tribe in the northern kingdom. Here "exalting" means to make oneself important. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **but he became guilty because of Baal worship, and he died** - When the people of Ephraim began worshiping Baal, they grew weak, and their enemies defeated them. Here "died" refers to the nation growing weak. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])  
  * **Now they sin more and more** - Here "they" refers to the tribe of Ephraim and the entire nation of Israel, who followed Ephraim's example.
  * **These men who sacrifice kiss calves** - Part of idol worship was kissing the idol which was an image of a calf. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
