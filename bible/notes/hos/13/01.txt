\v 1 Previously, when the leaders of Israel spoke,

\q1 But the people sinned greatly by \add worshiping\add* Baal,
\q2 so now they will be killed \add by their enemies\add*.
\q1
\v 2 Now they sin more and more;
\q2 they make idols for themselves
\q2 and \add cover them\add* with their silver.
\q1 Those idols are statues that are very cleverly made,
\q2 but those statues are made by \add mere\add* humans.
\q1 But \add the people are told\add*, "Kiss those idols \add that resemble a\add* calf,
\q2 and offer sacrifices to them!"

<usfm>
\v 1 Yahweh says, "When the leaders of Israel spoke, the people trembled;
\q2 they were respected in Israel.
\q1 But because they all worshiped Baal, they became guilty, 
\q2 and they died. 
\q1
\v 2 Now they sin more and more;
\q2 they make cast metal figures out of silver
\q1 to make them their idols.
\q2 Those idols are statues that are very cleverly made,
\q2 but those statues are made only by craftsmen.
\q1 But other people see 
\q2 that the men of Israel sacrifice to these calf-idols and kiss them to worship them.
