===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh is speaking.

  * **like a lion...like a leopard...like a bear...like a lioness** - Each of these wild animals are predators and will attack and kill. In the case of a bear, they will protect their young. Yahweh continues to emphasize how he will deal with his people when they turn away from him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **as a wild beast would tear you** - A lioness is a wild beast and tears apart her prey. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
