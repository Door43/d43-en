===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **So they will be like the morning clouds…like the dew…like the chaff…like smoke out of a chimney** - These four phrases basically mean that Israel is temporary and disappearing and are meant to emphasize that the nation of Israel (Ephraim) will soon disappear if they continue to worship idols instead of following Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
