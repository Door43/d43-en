<usfm>
\v 3 So the people of Israel will disappear
\q2 as quickly as the clouds that form in the morning,
\q1 as quickly as the dew, when the sun dries it up.
\q2 They will disappear as easily as the chaff that the wind blows away from the threshing place.
\q2 They will disappear as easily as the smoke that goes out of the chimney.

\v 3 So they will be like the morning clouds,
\q like the dew that goes away early,
\q like the chaff that is driven by the wind away from a threshing floor,
\q and like smoke out of a chimney.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **So they will be like the morning clouds ... like the dew ... like the chaff ... like smoke out of a chimney** - These phrases emphasize that Israel is temporary and will soon disappear if they continue to worship idols instead of following Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **that is driven by the wind away** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "that the wind blows away" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
