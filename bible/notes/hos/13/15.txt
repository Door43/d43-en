===== Translation Notes: =====

Hosea the prophet is speaking.

  * **an east wind will come; the wind of Yahweh** - This means that the judgment of Yahweh on Israel (Ephraim) is coming soon. (see: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Ephraim's spring will dry up, and his well will have no water** - The northern kingdom is spoken of as if it were a tree or a plant that always needed water to live. AT: "The people of Israel will meet disaster" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **his storehouse** - All of the people's possessions in the northern kingdom are spoken of as if they were kept in a single storehouse. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
