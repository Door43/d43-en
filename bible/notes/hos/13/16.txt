===== Translation Notes: =====

Hosea the prophet is speaking.

  * **Samaria will be guilty, for she has rebelled against her God. **- Samaria can refer to the people in the city. In this verse, the "guilt" refers to the people being guilty not the physical city. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
