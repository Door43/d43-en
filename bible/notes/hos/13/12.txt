===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh is speaking.

  * **Ephraim's iniquity has been stored up; his guilt has been stored up** - These two phrases are very similar and mean nearly the same thing. (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Pains of childbirth will come on him, but he is an unwise son, for when it is time to be born, he does not come out of the womb. **  - This illustration is used here by Yahweh to represent what is going to happen to Ephraim (Israel) because of their great wickedness. (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
