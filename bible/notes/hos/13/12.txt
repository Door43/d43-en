===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Ephraim's iniquity has been stored up; his guilt has been stored up. **- //Ephraim's iniquity has been stored up; his guilt has been stored up//  can be made explicit: "I have kept track of all the wicked deeds that you people of Israel have committed; I have recorded all your guilt. (UDB) (see: Explicit and implicit information)
  * **Pains of childbirth will come on him, but he is an unwise son, for when it is time to be born, he does not come out of the womb. **  - This illustration of what happens when a child is going to be born is used here by Yahweh to represent what is going to happen to Ephraim (Israel) because of their great wickedness.  The nation of Israel is compared to an "unwise son" - the nation could choose to "come out of the womb" (possibly symbolic of having a new, right relationship with Yahweh), but they refuse to do so.
