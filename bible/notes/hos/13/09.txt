===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh is speaking.

  * **Where now is your king, that he may save you in all your cities? Where are your rulers, about whom you said to me,'Give me a king and princes'?**  - Yahweh uses these questions to emphasize to Israel that when they rebel against him, no king or ruler can help them. Only Yahweh can save them from destruction. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
