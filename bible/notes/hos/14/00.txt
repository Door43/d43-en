====== Hosea 14 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This last chapter of Hosea ends with hope. In this chapter, Hosea calls for Israel to confess and repent to Yahweh. This chapter continues to be written in poetic form using metaphors and other devices to communicate God's love for His wayward people. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

Why is confession and repentance even suggested here for a people that Yahweh has already condemned to elimination? Because this is teaching that Yahweh is a merciful God who loves His people. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

Notice the use of first and second person in this chapter. This often signifies a change in speaker. This chapter is Hosea speaking to the Northern Kingdom and reported Yahweh love for them.

== Who is speaking? ==
There are several times in this chapter where the writer switches from the third person to the second and/or first person. This may cause some confusion as to who is speaking.
