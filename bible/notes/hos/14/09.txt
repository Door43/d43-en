===== Translation Notes: =====

The prophet Hosea is speaking.

  * **Who is wise that he may understand these things? Who understands these things so that he may know them?** - The prophet uses these questions to emphasize that a wise person (or nation) will understand and follow what has been said to them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **For the ways of Yahweh are right** - This means that the things that Yahweh says and does show the right way to live. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
