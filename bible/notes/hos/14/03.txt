===== Translation Notes: =====

Hosea is speaking 

  * **the work of our hands** - This is referring to idols of false gods they are making. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **for in you the fatherless person finds compassion**  - This means that the people of Israel are admitting that they have turned away from Yahweh and are like an orphan without a father to provide for them.
