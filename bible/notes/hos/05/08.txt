  * **Blow the horn in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah** - Here "horn" and "trumpet" mean the same thing. This command is given to the people of Gibeah and Ramah to emphasize that the enemy is coming. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Sound a battle cry at Beth Aven: 'We will follow you, Benjamin!'** - This could have been a warning to Benjamin or a request for help from Benjamin. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Beth Aven** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:hos:04:15|4:15]].
