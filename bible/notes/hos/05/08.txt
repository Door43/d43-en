===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh is talking about Israel.
  * **Blow the horn in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah**  - Here "horn" and "trumpet" mean the same thing. This command is given to the people of Gibeah and Ramah to emphasize that the enemy is coming. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Sound a battle cry at Beth Aven: 'We will follow you, Benjamin!'**  -  This could have been a warning to Benjamin or a request for help from Benjamin.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Beth Aven** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:hos:04:15|4:15]].
  * **Among the tribes of Israel I have declared what is certain to happen**  - AT: "I will do to the tribes of Israel what I have declared"
