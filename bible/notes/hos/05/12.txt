===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh is talking about Judah and Israel.

  * **I will be like a moth to Ephraim, and like rot to the house of Judah** - A moth on a piece of wool and rot in a piece of wood are both destructive. Yahweh will destroy both nations. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound** - Both Ephraim (the northern kingdom of Israel) and Judah (the southern kingdom of Israel) realized that they in danger. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **then Ephraim went to Assyria, and Judah sent messengers to the great king** - Neither kingdom asked Yahweh for help.
  * **But he was not able to cure you people or heal your wound** - Yahweh was in control, and Yahweh was going to bring judgment on the people of both Ephraim and Judah because they had turned to the worship of idols instead of the worship of Yahweh.
