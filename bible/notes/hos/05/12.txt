===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound **- Both Ephraim (the northern kingdom of Israel) and Judah (the southern kingdom of Israel) realized that they would not be able to defend themselves if and when they were attacked by surrounding nations. (see: synecdoche, metonymy, and metaphor)
  * **then Ephraim went to Assyria, and Judah sent messengers to the great king**. - Ephraim had been paying tribute (money) to Assyria so that Assyria would not attack her. Judah was also in danger, and the king of Judah (King Ahaz) sent messengers to the king of Assyria asking for protection from attacks by other nations. Neither kingdom asked Yahweh for help.
  * **But he was not able to cure you or heal your wound.**  - The king of Assyria could not save either Ephraim or Judah. Yahweh was in control, and Yahweh was going to bring judgment on both Ephraim and Judah because they had turned to the worship of idols instead of the worship of Yahweh.
