===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh is talking about Judah and Israel.

  * **I will be like a moth to Ephraim, and like rot to the house of Judah** - A moth on a piece of wool and rot in a piece of wood are both destructive. Yahweh will destroy both nations. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **moth ... rot** - These two terms are translated in various ways, because the meaning of the Hebrew words is either very broad, it is uncertain.
  * **When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound** - Both Ephraim (the northern kingdom of Israel) and Judah (the southern kingdom of Israel) realized that they were in danger. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **then Ephraim went to Assyria, and Judah sent messengers to the great king** - Ephraim and Judah asked Assyria for help instead of asking Yahweh for help. "Great king" was a title for the king of Assyria.
  * **But he was not able** - Here "he" refers to the king of Assyria.
