===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I, even I,**  - Yahweh is emphasizing that he is the one that is bringing judgment on all his people (Ephraim and Judah). It is not the Assyrians or the Egyptians or anyone else that is doing this - it is Yahweh! (see: Doublet)
  * **will tear **- As a lion tears its prey apart, so Yahweh will tear his people away from their homes and country; they will not escape Yahweh's judgment and punishment. (see: Metaphor)
  * **I will go and return to my place**  - Yahweh will leave his rebellious people; they will suffer the judgment for their idolatry and sin against Yahweh.
  * **until they acknowledge their guilt and seek my face; until they earnestly seek me in their distress.**  - Yahweh will help his people again when they sincerely admit their guilt and sin, when they desire to worship only him, and when they look only to him for help in times of trouble.
