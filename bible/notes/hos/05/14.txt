\q
\v 14 So I will be like a lion to Ephraim,
\q and like a young lion to the house of Judah.
\q I, even I, will tear and go away;
\q I will carry them off,
\q and there will be no one to rescue them. 
\q
\v 15 I will go and return to my place,
\q until they acknowledge their guilt and seek my face,
\q until they earnestly seek me in their distress."
