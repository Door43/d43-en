===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh is talking about Judah and Israel.

  * **The leaders of Judah are like those who move a boundary stone.**  - Moving a boundary stone meant moving the landmark that marked the border of some property (which was a crime under Israelite law).  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **I will pour my wrath on them like water.**  - Yahweh's wrath against Judah will be like a very large stream of water that destroys them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Ephraim is crushed; he is crushed in judgment**  - This statement is made twice for emphasis: Ephraim's punishment will be very harsh; Ephraim's judgment for following idols will be severe. The second statement emphasizes the severity of the judgment.
