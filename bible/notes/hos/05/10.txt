===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **bold words**  - explanation
  * **The leaders of Judah are like those who move a boundary stone.**  - Moving a boundary stone meant moving the landmark that marked the border of a tribe's land (which was a crime under Israelite law).  The leaders of Judah might have been looking to take over some of the Israelite land when Yahweh judged Israel. (see: metaphor/simile)
