===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh is talking about Israel.

  * **I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from me. **- Yahweh knows that Ephraim (Israel) is idolatrous. There is no way that they can worship idols without Yahweh knowing what they are doing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Ephraim, now you have become like a prostitute** - Ephraim are being compared to a prostitute since she is so unfaithful to God (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **for the spirit of adultery is in them**  - the people of Israel are so inbred with their idolatrous practices they are not like the people of God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and they do not know me, Yahweh**. - Israel no longer listens to or follows Yahweh in any way. They do not acknowledge him as their God.
