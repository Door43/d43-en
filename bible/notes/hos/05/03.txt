===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh is talking about Israel.

  * **I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from me** - Here, "Ephraim" and "Israel" both refer to the people who live in the northern kingdom of Israel. This emphasizes that God knows that they are worshiping idols. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Ephraim, now you have become like a prostitute** - Ephraim is compared to a prostitute because the people have become unfaithful to God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **for the spirit of adultery is in them** - This means they have the desire to be unfaithful to God. They want to worship idols.
  * **and they do not know me, Yahweh** - Israel no longer follows or listens to Yahweh in any way. They do not acknowledge Yahweh as their God.
