\v 3 I know \add everything about the people of\add* Israel;

\q2 like \f + \ft metaphor \f* prostitutes \add give themselves to the men they sleep with\add*,
\q1 they have become unacceptable to me.
\b
\q1
\v 4 Because they \add like to do evil\add* deeds,
\q2 they will not return to me, their God.
\q1 Like prostitutes \add who have abandoned their husbands\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, they have [IDI] abandoned \f + \ft metaphor \f* me;
\q2 they do not even know me, Yahweh.

<usfm>
\v 3 You, the people in Ephraim, the center of Israel—I know you.
\q2 I know very well what you are like, you people of Israel.
\q1 You people in Ephraim, you have acted like prostitutes.
\q2 Yes, you people in Israel are polluted.
\q1
\v 4 Ephraim and Israel are not able to ask me to forgive them, because of what they have done.
\q1 They have chosen to be unfaithful and immoral,
\q2 and they do not know me, Yahweh."

\q
\v 3 I know Ephraim,
\q and Israel is not hidden from me.
\q Ephraim, now you have become like a prostitute;
\q Israel is defiled.
\q
\v 4 Their deeds will not allow them to turn to God,
\q for the mind of adultery is in them,
\q and they do not know Yahweh.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh is talking about Israel.

  * **I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from me** - Here, "Ephraim" and "Israel" both refer to the people who live in the northern kingdom of Israel. Here God says that he knows what they are like and what they are doing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Ephraim, now you have become like a prostitute** - Ephraim is presented in terms of a prostitute because the people have become unfaithful to God, as a prostitute is faithful to no man. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **for the mind of adultery is in them** - This means they have the desire to be unfaithful to God. They want to worship idols.
  * **to turn to God ... they do not know Yahweh** - The translator can represent this as "to turn to me ... they do not know me," or "to turn to me ... they do not know me, Yahweh."
  * **they do not know Yahweh** - Israel no longer obeys Yahweh in any way. They do not acknowledge Yahweh as their God.
