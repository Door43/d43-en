===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 When I do these things, this is to show that the people of Israel will live for a long time and not have any king ruling over them. They will have no prince, no sacrifices or sacred pillars set up for worship, ephods or idols in their houses.
\v 5 After some time, the people of Israel will return to Yahweh; they will hope that he will receive them back. They will hope to have a descendant of David for their king again. In the later time, they will come to Yahweh to honor him and tremble before him because of his goodness to them.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 For the people of Israel will live for many days without a king, prince, sacrifice, stone pillar, ephod or household idols.
\v 5 Afterward the people of Israel will return and seek Yahweh their God and David their king. And in the last days, they will come trembling before Yahweh and his goodness.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For the people of Israel will live for many days without a king, prince, sacrifice, stone pillar, ephod or household idols** - Just as Hosea lived without his wife because she committed adultery, Israel will live without a king because they committed idolatry.
  * **David their king** - Here "David" represents all the descendants of David. AT: "a descendant of David to be their king" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **in the last days** - AT: "in the future" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **they will come trembling before Yahweh and his goodness** - "trembling" refers to awe and humility. AT: "they will come back to Yahweh with an attitude of awe and will seek his blessings" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
