===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 When I do these things, this is to show that the people of Israel will live for a long time and not have any king ruling over them. They will have no prince, no sacrifices or sacred pillars set up for worship, ephods or idols in their houses.
\v 5 After some time, the people of Israel will return to Yahweh; they will hope that he will receive them back. They will hope to have a descendant of David for their king again. In the later time, they will come to Yahweh to honor him and tremble before him because of his goodness to them.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 For the people of Israel will live for many days without a king, prince, sacrifice, stone pillar, ephod or household idols.
\v 5 Afterward the people of Israel will return and seek Yahweh their God and David their king. And in the last days, they will come trembling before Yahweh and his goodness.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **For the people of Israel will live for many days**** without a king, prince, sacrifice, stone pillar, ephod or household idols**. - This is a word picture showing that just as Hosea had to live for quite a bit of time without his adulterous wife, Israel would live for a lengthy period of time ("many days") without their own king and religious worship. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **David their king**  - David is symbolic of the lineage of David; in other words, they would seek a descendant of David as their king (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **in the last days**  - in the future (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **they will come trembling before Yahweh and his goodness - **  AT: "They will come back to Yahweh with an attitude of awe, and will seek his blessings."
