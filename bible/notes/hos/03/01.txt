\c 3
\p
\v 1 And Yahweh said to me, "Go again, love a woman loved by
her husband but is an adulteress, even as Yahweh loves the children of Israel, though they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes."
\v 2 So I bought her for myself for fifteen pieces of silver and a homer and a half of barley.
\v 3 I said to her, "You will live with me many days. You will not be a prostitute, and you will not be any man’s wife. So I will also be to you."
