===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Then Yahweh said to me, "Go and show to your wife that you still love her, even though she has been committing adultery with another man who loves her. \add That will show that\add* I still love the people of Israel, even though they worship other gods\f + \ft Or: idols \f* and eat raisin cakes \add in feasts that honor those gods\add*."
\p
\v 2 \add My wife had become a slave\add*, but I bought her for 6 ounces\f + \ft Or: 179 grams \f* of silver and ten bushels of barley.
\v 3 Then I said to her, "You must wait for many days \add before we sleep together\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f*. During that time, you must not be a prostitute, and you must not have sex with any other man; but I will live with you."

\v 1 Then Yahweh said to me, "Go and love a women, even though she is loved by another man, and she is also unfaithful to her husband. You will be like me, because I love the people of Israel, even though they worship other gods and eat raisin cakes in their honor."
\p
\v 2 Even though she was a slave, owned by another person, I bought her 170 grams of silver, and 330 liters of barley grain.
\v 3 Then I said to her, "You will live with me from now on. You will no longer be a prostitute who sleeps with various men. You will not belong to any other man, only to me, and I will be faithful to you and live with you for the rest of my life."

\c 3
\p
\v 1 Yahweh said to me, "Go again, love a woman, loved by her husband, but who is an adulteress. Love her just as I, Yahweh, love the people of Israel, although they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes."
\v 2 So I bought her for myself for fifteen pieces of silver and a homer and a lethek of barley.
\v 3 I said to her, "You must live with me many days. You will not be a prostitute or belong to any other man. In the same way, I will be with you."
