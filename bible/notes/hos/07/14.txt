===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 14 They have not cried to me with all their heart,
\q but they wail on their beds.
\q They gather together for grain and new wine,
\q and they turn away from me.
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa They gather together \fqa* , which the Hebrew text has, some ancient copies and many modern versions have \fqa They cut themselves \fqa* , an allusion to the pagan custom of idol worshipers wounding themselves in the frenzy of prayer. \f*
\q
\v 15 Though I trained them and strengthened their arms,
\q they are now plotting evil against me.
