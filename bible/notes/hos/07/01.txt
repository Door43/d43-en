\q
\v 1 When I would heal Israel,
\q then the iniquity of Ephraim is uncovered,
\q and the wickedness of Samaria.
\q For they commit deceit,
\q the thief enters in,
\q and bandits rob outside.
\q
\v 2 They do not consider in their hearts
\q that I remember all their wickedness.
\q Now their own deeds surround them,
\q they are before my face.
