<usfm>
\v 1 When I decide to heal Israel, 
\q2 that will be the time I will make known how great is the wickedness of Ephraim (the other name for Israel), 
\q1 and the evil deeds done in Samaria, they will also be healed.
\q2 They lie and cheat in their buying and selling, 
\q1 they are like lawless men who beat up people only because they were walking in the streets. 
\q1
\v 2 But they do not take a moment to think that I, Yahweh, remember everything they have done. 
\q2 What they have done now surrounds them, as if they were shouting and accusing about the evil deeds they have done,
\q1 their sins are right in front of me, I see them all.

\q
\v 1 When I would heal Israel,
\q the corruption of Ephraim is revealed,
\q and the evil deeds of Samaria.
\q For they practice deceit.
\q A thief comes in,
\q and a marauding band attacks in the street.
\q
\v 2 They do not consider in their hearts
\q that I remember all their evil.
\q Now their deeds surround them,
\q they are before my face.
