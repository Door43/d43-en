Yahweh is speaking.

  * **The pride of Israel testifies against him** - Israel was unduly proud of being the people of God.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **in spite of all this** - "this" refers to all that Hosea is referring to in the previous chapters. 
  * **Ephraim is like a dove, gullible and without sense,** - At that time, doves were thought to be gullible animals. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Egypt** and **Assyria** - These were other powerful nations that Israel could go to for help.
