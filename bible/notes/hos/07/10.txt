===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh is speaking.

  * **The pride of Israel testifies against him** - This describes "pride" as a person who testifies against the people of Israel in court. This means their prideful attitude and behavior show that they are guilty of no longer obeying Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **nor have they sought him** - Israel's lack of interest in Yahweh is spoken of as if he was lost and they were not trying to find him. AT: "nor have they tried to get him to pay attention to them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in spite of all this** - Here "this" refers God allowing foreigners to defeat them and make them weak.
  * **Ephraim is like a dove, gullible and without sense** - Doves were thought to be foolish birds. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Egypt ... Assyria** - These were powerful nations that Israel could ask for help.
