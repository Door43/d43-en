===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh is speaking.

  * **The pride of Israel testifies against him**  - This describes "pride" as a person who testifies against the people of Israel in court. This means their prideful attitude and behavior show that they are guilty of no longer obeying Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **in spite of all this** - Here "this" refers God allowing foreigners to defeat them and make them weak.
  * **Ephraim is like a dove, gullible and without sense** - Doves were thought to be foolish birds. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Egypt...Assyria** - These were powerful nations that Israel could ask for help.
