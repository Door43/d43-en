===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh is speaking.

  * **Ephraim is a flat cake that has not been turned over** - Here "Ephraim" refers to the people of the northern kingdom of Israel. This means that the people of Israel are worthless just like a cake that a person cooked only on one side worthless since no can eat it. AT: "The people of Ephraim are like a cake that no one has turned over" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Gray hairs are sprinkled on him**  - Here "gray hairs" represent old age. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
