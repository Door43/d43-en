===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh is speaking.

  * **Ephraim is a flat cake that has not been turned over** - This is an idiomatic way of saying that Ephraim is worthless since flat cakes cooked on one side are uneatable. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Gray hairs are sprinkled on him**  - Gray hair represents older people. (see: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
