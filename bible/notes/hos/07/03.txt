\q2 and the king's officials are happy when they tell lies.
\q1
\v 4 They are all sexually immoral;

\q1 once he lights the fire, he does not need to put any more wood on it, 
\q1 until he is ready to bake the bread.

<usfm>
\q
\v 3 With their evil they make the king glad, 
\q and by their lies the officials.
\q
\v 4 They are all adulterers,
\q like an oven heated by the baker,
\q who ceases to stir the fire
\q from the kneading of the dough until it is leavened.
\q
\v 5 On the day of our king the officials made themselves sick with the heat of wine.
\q He reaches out with his hand to those who mock.
