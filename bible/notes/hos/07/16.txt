\q1 Their leaders boast \add that they are very strong\add*,
\q2 but they will be killed by \add their enemies'\add* swords.
\q1 As a result, \add the people of\add* Egypt will laugh at them."

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 They go this way and that, but never to me, God Most High. 
\q2 They are like a bow that breaks when someone pulls it.
\q1 Their officers will be killed by their enemies' swords;
they will die because they have insulted me. 
\q1 This is why the people in Egypt will insult them."
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

\q
\v 16 They return,
\q but they do not return to me, the Most High.
\q They are like a faulty bow.
\q Their officials will fall by the sword
\q because of the insolence of their tongues.
\q This will become their mockery in the land of Egypt.
</usfm>
