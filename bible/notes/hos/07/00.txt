====== Hosea 07 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter continues using poetic forms to show Yahweh's anger about the [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]] of the people. The people are not seeking Yahweh; they are seeking other [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod|gods]] and looking for [[:en:obe:kt:save|salvation]] from other nations like Egypt and Assyria. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Baking ==

Baking of bread is an extended metaphor in this chapter. Yahweh uses various aspects of this activity to show His displeasure with their sins (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]). 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

This chapter begins by using two different names for the same group of people: Israel and Ephraim. It also mentions Samaria which was the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel.
