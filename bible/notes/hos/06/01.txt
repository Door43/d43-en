<usfm>
\v 1 The people say, "Come, let us return to Yahweh.
\q1 He has torn our flesh to pieces as a lion tears up his victim.
\q2 He did this, but he will heal our wounds.  
\q1 He has hurt us and made us fall down,
\q2 but he will treat our wounds and bind them up so they will heal.
\q1
\v 2 After the second day he will restore our strength;
\q2 and on the third day he will raise us up,
\q2 so we will live close to him.
\q1
\v 3 Try to know Yahweh;
\q2 do all you can so you might know him.
\q1 It is as certain as tomorrow's sunrise
\q2 that he will come to us; he will come to us like the rain,
\q1 like the rain comes in the spring on our fields."

===== Translation Notes: =====

The people of Israel confess their need to repent.

  * **For he has torn us to pieces **  and** he has injured us**  - God has disciplined the people of Israel for their disobedience and idolatry. This is a parallelism to emphasize God's judgment, (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]])
  * **but he will heal us **  and** he will bandage our wounds **- Israel believes that God will be merciful to them when they repent, and he will deliver them out of their troubles. (See:[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]])
  * **After two days he will revive us; he will raise us up on the third day **- This represents a short period of time. Israel believed God would quickly come to their aid and deliver them from their enemies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom|Idiom]])
  * **Let us know Yahweh **- This is an encouragement to be enthusiatic about knowing Yahweh. Knowing him will help the Israelites avoid sin and punishment for it.
  * **His going out is as sure as the dawn**  - Yahweh will come to the help of his people just as surely as the sun rises each morning. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
