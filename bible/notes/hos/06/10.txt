<usfm>
\v 10 Among the people of Israel, I have seen a horrible thing—  
\q2 the people of Ephraim worship idols everywhere.
\q1 The people of Israel have become filthy by what they have done.
\b
\q1
\v 11 And for you also, you people of Judah,
\q2 I have set for you a time when I will separate out your good people from your bad people. 
\q1 Just as in the harvest when you take all the crops in, 
\q2 and you keep the good and throw away the bad, 
\q1 that is what is coming for you, people of Judah. 
\b
\q1 That will be the day when I bring back the blessings and riches of my people once more."
</usfm>
