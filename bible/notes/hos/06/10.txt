\v 10 I have seen horrible things being done in Israel \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\q2 The people have abandoned me \add like prostitutes who have abandoned their husbands\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*;
\q1 \add so the people of\add* Israel have become unacceptable to me.
\b
\q1
\v 11 And you \add people of\add* Judah,
\q2 I have appointed a time when I will punish \f + \ft metaphor \f* you, too.
\b
\q1 Whenever I wanted to enable my people to prosper again,"

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 Among the people of Israel, I have seen a horrible thing— 
\q2 the people of Ephraim worship idols everywhere.
\q1 The people of Israel have become filthy by what they have done.
\b
\q1
\v 11 And for you also, you people of Judah,
\q2 I have set for you a time when I will separate out your good people from your bad people. 
\q1 Just as in the harvest when you take all the crops in, 
\q2 and you keep the good and throw away the bad, 
\q1 that is what is coming for you, people of Judah. 
\b
\q1 That will be the day when I bring back the blessings and riches of my people once more."
</usfm>

\q
\v 11 For you also, Judah, a harvest has been appointed,
\q when I will restore the fortunes of my people.
