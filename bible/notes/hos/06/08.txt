===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh is speaking.

  * **Gilead is a city ... with footprints of blood** - "Footprints of blood" probably represents the evildoers and their acts of murder. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the priests band together to commit murder on the way to Shechem** - We do not know what this refers to. Were priests actually guilty of attacking people on their way to Shechem, which was an important religious and political center? Or is the prophet saying that the priests have "killed" true knowledge and worship of Yahweh? It is best to translate this expression as plainly as possible.
