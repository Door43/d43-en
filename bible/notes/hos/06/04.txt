\v 4 But Yahweh says, "What can I do with you, you people of Ephraim?
\q2 What can I do with you, you people of the tribe of Judah?
\q1 You love me for just as long as the clouds come in the morning before they disappear again.
\q2 You love me for just as long as the dew stays before the warm sun shines on it.
\q1
\v 5 I sent my prophets to you, 
\q2 and it was as though I had cut you into pieces when they spoke the messages I gave them.   
\q1 You were devastated by what they said to you. 
\q2 It was as though I had killed you with the words I spoke to you.
\q1 I spoke about how I would punish you.
\q2 I told you by the prophets that I was angry with you, and they told you this."
\q1 "Yahweh, you will punish them by commanding that it happen;
\q2 your words are like lightning bolts."

\v 4 Ephraim, what will I do with you?
\q Judah, what will I do with you?
\q Your faithfulness is like a morning cloud,

\q I have killed them with the words of my mouth.
\q Your decrees are like the light that shines out.
