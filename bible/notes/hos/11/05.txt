===== Translation Notes: =====

God is speaking about Israel.

  * **Will they not return to the land of Egypt?**  - This question means that the nation of Israel will once again be slaves as they were in Egypt. (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **Will Assyria not rule over them because they refuse to return to me?**  - The nation of Israel will be captives of Assyria as a result of their refusal to remain faithful to Yahweh. (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **the sword will fall on their cities**  - The sword represents the enemies of Israel and they will destroy their cities (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche|Synecdoche]])
  * **but no one will help them **- No one will be allowed to help Israel at this point, because the people have turned away from Yahweh.
