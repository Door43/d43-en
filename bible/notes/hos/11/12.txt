===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh is talking about Israel and Judah.

  * **Ephraim surrounds me with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit** - Lies and deceitful acts are spoken of as if they were objects that the people of the northern kingdom surrounded Yahweh with. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **But Judah is still going about with me** - Here "Judah" refers to the people who live there. This speaks of being loyal to God as "going about" with him. However, many versions have different interpretations of this difficult passage. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
