===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh is talking about Israel and Judah.

  * **Ephraim surrounds me with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit** - Lies and deceitful acts are spoken of as if they were objects that the people of the northern kingdom surrounded Yahweh with. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **But Judah is still going about with me** - The people of the southern kingdom are still loyal to God. Here "going about with me" represents being together with God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) However, many versions have different interpretations of this difficult passage.
