===== Translation Notes: =====

God is talking about Israel and Judah.

  * **Ephraim surrounds me with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit** - This means that Ephraim (the house of Israel) has continually lied and been dishonest with Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Ephraim surrounds me with falsehood** - AT: "Ephraim has constantly told lies to me" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **But Judah is still going about with me, God, and is faithful to me, the Holy One** - Even though Judah has rebelled at times, they are still following Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
