\v 8 How can I give you up, Ephraim?
\q How can I hand you over, Israel?
\q How can I make you like Admah?

\q My heart has changed within me;
\q all my compassions have been stirred up.
\q
\v 9 I will not execute my fierce anger;
\q I will not again destroy Ephraim.
\q For I am God
\q and not a man;
\q I am the Holy One among you,
\q and I will not come in wrath.
