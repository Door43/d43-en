\v 8 But you people of Israel—dear Israel—I cannot abandon you.
\q2 I cannot give you over to your enemies.
\q1 I do not want to act toward you as I acted toward Admah or make you like Zeboyim—
\q2 cities that I destroyed along with Sodom.
\q1 I have changed my mind about punishing you;
\q2 I earnestly long to have mercy on you.
\q1
\v 9 I have decided not to punish you severely.
\q1 I do not want to destroy you, the people of my Israel, whom I love.

\q
\v 8 How can I give you up, Ephraim?
\q How can I hand you over, Israel?
\q How can I make you like Admah?
\q How can I make you like Zeboyim?
\q My heart has changed within me;
\q all my compassions have been stirred up.
\q
\v 9 I will not execute my fierce anger;
\q I will not again destroy Ephraim.
\q For I am God
\q and not a man;
\q I am the Holy One among you,
\q and I will not come in wrath.
