\v 8 But you people of Israel—dear Israel—I cannot abandon you.
\q2 I cannot give you over to your enemies.
\q1 I do not want to act toward you as I acted toward Admah or make you like Zeboiim—

\v 9 I have decided not to punish you severely.
\q1 I do not want to destroy you, the people of my Israel, whom I love.

\v 8 How can I give you up, Ephraim?
\q How can I hand you over, Israel?
\q How can I make you like Admah?
\q How can I make you like Zeboiim?
\q My heart has changed within me;
\q all my compassions have been stirred up.
\q
\v 9 I will not execute my fierce anger;
\q I will not again destroy Ephraim.
\q For I am God
\q and not a man;
\q I am the Holy One among you,
\q and I will not come in wrath.

===== Translation Notes: =====

God is speaking about Israel.

  * **How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel?** - Yahweh loves his people so much that he will not totally destroy them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **How can I make you like Admah? How can I make you like Zeboiim?** - AT: "I do not want to act toward you as I acted toward Admah or make you like Zeboiim—cities that I destroyed along with Sodom." (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **My heart has changed within me** - The "heart" often represents the will/decisions a person makes. So the "heart" here represents the whole person of God. (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
