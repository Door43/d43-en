\v 3 But it was I who taught them to do everything good, as a father teaches his son to walk.
\q2 I was like a father, holding them by their little arms.
\q1 But they did not understand that I was the one who was taking care of them.
\q1
\v 4 With kindness I guided them, with the tender cords of human kindness I led them. 
\q2  I loved them so much that I guided them and led by my own hand.
\q1 They worked very hard, like a yoke of oxen pulling a plow, but I made their yoke light and loosened its weight on their jaws, so they did not suffer pain.
