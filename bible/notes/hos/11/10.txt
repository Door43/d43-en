<usfm>
\v 10 They will live their lives following my commands.
\q2 I will roar like a lion.
\q1 And when I roar, my people will hear and will come trembling.
\q2 They will come back to me from far away—
\q1 from the west they will come back to me.
\q1
\v 11 They will come fluttering into the land
\q2 like a flock of birds coming up from Egypt.
\q2 And some will be like pigeons that fly in from Assyria.
\q1 I will let them live in their own homes once more, in the land of Israel.
\q2 I, Yahweh, have promised this."
