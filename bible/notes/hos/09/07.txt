===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 It is now the time for God to punish you;
\q2 the time has come in which God will pay you back for every sin you have committed.
\q2 And all you people of Israel must realize that these things will happen.
\q1 So your false prophets are fools,
\q2 and those who you thought were inspired by God are actually insane.
\q1 This is because you have sinned so much
\q2 and because you have become Yahweh's enemies.


\q1
</usfm>

\q because of your great iniquity
\q and great hostility.

  * **The prophet is a fool, and the inspired man is insane** - These phrases mean basically the same thing. Possible meanings are 1) that the people regarded the prophets as madmen or 2) that the prophets had become crazy because of the sins that the people had committed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **The prophet is a fool, and the inspired man is insane** - This expression refers to false prophets and to men who falsely claim to be inspired by Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
