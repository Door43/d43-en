===== Translation Notes: =====

Hosea, the prophet, is speaking.

  * **The days for punishment are coming; the days for retribution are coming. **- "retribution" means "deserved punishment" - The prophet Hosea uses these two ways of emphasizing that Israel would soon be judged by Yahweh for their evil deeds. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **"The prophet is a fool, and the inspired man is insane" ** - Hosea is using two different ways to say similar things to create emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **because of your great iniquity and great hostility** - Hosea is emphasizing how much sin and wrongdoing is being done. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
