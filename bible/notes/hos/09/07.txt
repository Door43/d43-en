<usfm>
\v 7 It is now the time for God to punish you;
\q2 the time has come in which God will pay you back for every sin you have committed.
\q2 And all you people of Israel must realize that these things will happen.
\q1 So your false prophets are fools,
\q2 and those who you thought were inspired by God are actually insane.
\q1 This is because you have sinned so much
\q2 and because you have become Yahweh's enemies.


\q1

===== Translation Notes: =====

Hosea, the prophet, is speaking.

  * **The days for punishment are coming; the days for retribution are coming. **- "retribution" means "deserved punishment" - The prophet Hosea uses these two ways of emphasizing that Israel would soon be judged by Yahweh for their evil deeds. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]])
  * **The prophet is a fool, and the inspired man is insane **- Hosea is using two different ways to say similar things to create emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]])
  * **because of your great iniquity and great hostility**  - Hosea is emphasizing how much sin and wrongdoing is being done. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet|Doublet]])
