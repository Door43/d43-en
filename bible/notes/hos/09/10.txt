===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh is speaking.

  * **it was like finding grapes in the wilderness...Like the first fruit of the season on the fig tree** - God is using parallel expressions to show the initial spiritual state of the nation of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **it was like finding grapes in the wilderness**  - God first compares the people of Israel to grapes. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Like the first fruit of the season on the fig tree** - And again God compares the nation of Israel to new fresh figs. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **But they went to Baal Peor**  - Baal Peor was a mountain in the land of Moab on which Baal was worshiped.
