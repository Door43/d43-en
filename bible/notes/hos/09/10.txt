\q1 When I saw your ancestors, they were like the very first figs that appear in the year, figs growing on a young fig tree.
\q1 But when they came to Mount Peor,
\q2 they gave themselves completely to that disgusting idol Baal,
\q2 and they became as detestable as the idol they loved.

\q They became as detestable as the idol they loved.
