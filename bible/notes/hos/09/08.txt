\v 9 The sins that the Israelite people have committed are as awful as \add what the men of\add* Gibeah did long ago;

\v 9 The people have polluted themselves by sinning

\q
\v 8 The prophet who is with my God is the watchman for Ephraim,
\q but a bird’s snare is in  all of his paths,
\q and hostility toward him is in the house of his God.
\q
\v 9 They have deeply corrupted themselves
\q as in the days of Gibeah.
\q God will call to mind their iniquity,
\q and he will punish their sins.
