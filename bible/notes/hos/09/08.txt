\v 8 My God appointed \add me and the other\add* prophets
\q2 to be like \f + \ft metaphor \f* watchmen \add to warn\add* you people of Israel,
\q1 but everywhere that we go, \add it is as though\add* people set traps for us
\q2 and people are hostile to us, \add even\add* in the temple of our God.
\q1
\v 9 The sins that the Israelite people have committed are as awful as \add what the men of\add* Gibeah did long ago;
\q1 so I will not forget the wicked things that they have done;
\q2 I will punish them for all those sins.

<usfm>
\v 8 True prophets are watchmen for the people of Israel, and my God is with them.
\q2 But everywhere they go, others set traps for them;
\q2 even in the temple of their God, others hate them.
\q1
\v 9 The people have polluted themselves by sinning
\q2 as the Israelites did at Gibeah long ago.
\q1 God will not forget the wicked things they did;
\q2 he will certainly punish them.

<usfm>
\q
\v 8 The prophet who is with my God is the watchman for Ephraim,
\q but a bird snare is on all of his paths,
\q and hostility toward him is in the house of his God.
\q
\v 9 They have deeply corrupted themselves
\q as in the days of Gibeah.
\q God will call to mind their iniquity,
\q and he will punish their sins.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Hosea the prophet is speaking.

  * **is the watchman for Ephraim** - A "watchman" watches outside his city to see if danger is coming. Here the prophet warns the people when they are sinning and are in danger of having God punish them. AT: "is like a watchman for Ephraim" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Ephraim** - This refers to the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **a bird snare is on all of his paths** - A "bird snare" is a trap used to catch a bird. This means the people of Israel do whatever they can to stop God's prophet. AT: "the people set a trap for him wherever he goes" or "the people do all they can to harm him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **They have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of Gibeah** - AT: "The people of Israel have sinned and become very corrupt as they did at Gibeah long ago"
