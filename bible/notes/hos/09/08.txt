\q1
\v 9 The sins that the Israelite people have committed are as awful as \add what the men of\add* Gibeah did long ago;

<usfm>
\v 8 True prophets are watchmen for the people of Israel, and my God is with them.
\q2 But everywhere they go, others set traps for them;
\q2 even in the temple of their God, others hate them.
\q1
\v 9 The people have polluted themselves by sinning
\q2 as the Israelites did at Gibeah long ago.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Hosea the prophet is speaking.

  * **is the watchman for Ephraim**  - A "watchman" watches outside his city to see if danger is coming. Here the prophet warns the people when they are sinning and are in danger of having God punish them. AT: "is like a watchman for Ephraim"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Ephraim** - This refers to the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **but a bird's snare is on all of his paths** - A "bird's snare" is a trap used to catch a bird. This means the people of Israel do whatever they can to stop God's prophet. AT: "but the people set a trap for him wherever he goes" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **They have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of Gibeah** - AT: "The people of Israel have sinned and become very corrupt as they did at Gibeah long ago"
  * **call to mind**  - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:hos:08:13|8:13]].
