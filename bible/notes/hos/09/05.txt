===== Translation Notes: =====

Hosea, the prophet, is speaking.

  * **What will you do on the day of an appointed festival, on the day of a festival for Yahweh?** - Hosea uses this question to state that when the feast day of Yahweh comes, the people will not be able to observe it as they would normally have done if they had been in their own land. (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **For, look, if they escape from destruction, Egypt will gather them, and Memphis will bury them. **- "Look! If you escape and the Assyrians do not kill you, the army of Egypt will capture you. You will die there, and the people in the city of Memphis will bury you." (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Memphis**  - Memphis was the capital of Egypt at this time in history.
