===== Translation Notes: =====

Hosea the prophet is speaking.

  * **What will you do on the day of an appointed festival, on the day of a festival for Yahweh?** - Hosea uses this question to emphasize that the people will no longer be able to observe their festivals when their enemies defeat them and take them captive. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **if they escape** - Here "they" still refers to the people of Israel. AT: "if you escape."
  * **Egypt will gather them, and Memphis will bury them**  - AT: "the army of Egypt will capture you. You will die there, and the people in the city of Memphis will bury you" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
