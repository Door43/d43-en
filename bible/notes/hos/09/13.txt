  * **but Ephraim will bring out his children** - "children" are the people from that nation. AT: "but the people of Israel will bring out their children" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Give them, Yahweh—what will you give them?** - Hosea uses a question to emphasize that he wants Yahweh to give the people of Israel what they deserve. AT: "This is what I ask you, Yahweh, to give them:" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **a miscarrying womb** - To "miscarry" means that a pregnancy ends too early and the baby dies.
