<usfm>
\v 3 And you people will not remain in the land that I, Yahweh, \add gave to your ancestors\add*.
\q2 You will be \add captured and taken to\add* Assyria,
\q2 \add where you will become slaves like your ancestors were\add* in Egypt;
\q1 and in Assyria you will be forced to eat food that I have forbidden you to eat.
\q1
\v 4 You Israelites will not \add be able to\add* give wine offerings to me,
\q2 or bring sacrifices to me.
\q1 None of your other sacrifices will please me;
\q2 they will be unacceptable to me, like \f + \ft simile \f* food that is touched by people at funerals,
\q1 and everyone who eats that food will become unacceptable to me.
\q1 They will be permitted to eat that food themselves,
\q2 but they will not be permitted to bring it into my temple.
\q1

<usfm>
\v 3 The people of Israel will not continue to live in the land that Yahweh has chosen as his own.
\q2 Instead, they will go back to Egypt one day.
\q1 And in Assyria they will have to eat the kind of food that God had forbidden them to eat.
\q1
\v 4 No longer will they pour out wine to offer it to Yahweh;
\q2 their sacrifices will not please him at all.
\q2 Their sacrifices will be as unacceptable to God as the food that people eat at funerals;
\q1 and everyone who eats that food becomes unacceptable to God.
\q1 That food will be all they eat;
\q2 they will not be able to bring it into Yahweh's house to offer it to him.


\q1

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 3 They will not continue to live in Yahweh's land;
\q instead, Ephraim will return to Egypt,
\q and one day they will eat unclean food in Assyria.
\q
\v 4 They will pour out no wine offerings to Yahweh,
\q neither will they be pleasing to him.
\q Their sacrifices will be to them like mourners' food:
\q all who eat it will be defiled.
\q For their food will be for themselves only;
\q it will not be able to come into the house of Yahweh.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Hosea the prophet is speaking.


  * **Their sacrifices will be to them like mourners' food**  - Here "mourners' food" refers to what people would eat while they mourning because they were defiled and not acceptable to God. This means Yahweh will consider the people's sacrifices to be defiled and he will not accept them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **For their food will be for themselves only; it will not be able to come into the house of Yahweh**  - The people of Israel will have food to eat, but Yahweh will not accept it as a sacrifice.
