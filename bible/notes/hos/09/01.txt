\v 1 Hosea says this: Do not be happy, O Israel; do not celebrate like other people groups!
\q2 You have been unfaithful to your God. You have refused to do what he told you.
\q1 At every place where people thresh their grain,
\q2 you give your offerings and sacrifices to idols.
\q1 You are just like men who pay money to sleep with women.
\q1
\v 2 Now you will not have enough grain or wine to feed your people.
\q2 You will have no hope for any new wine, for the vines will fail you.

Hosea, the prophet, is speaking.

  * **But the threshing floor and the winepress will not feed them**  - This means that the harvest would not yield enough grain and grapes (wine) to feed the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
