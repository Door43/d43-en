===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh is speaking in verse 16. Hosea begins speaking in verse 17.

  * **Ephraim is diseased, and their root is dried up; they bear no fruit** - Yahweh speaks of the people of Israel as if they were a diseased tree that does not produce fruit and is ready to be cut down. This is a statement that the people have become weak, and that soon their enemies will come and defeat them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
