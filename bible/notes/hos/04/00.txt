====== Hosea 04 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

The author stops using the metaphor of a husband wife relationship and begins using a new illustration using lawsuits. God is suing the people of Israel because of all the wrong they have done. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs|metaphor]]).

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Lawsuits ==

Lawsuits are special cases where people go to court when they have a legal issue to resolve between them. Normally, one party is accusing another party of a wrong doing. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metonymy ==
Metonymy is used in the first few verses of this chapter. Metonymy is a figure of speech in which a thing or idea is called not by its own name, but by the name of something closely associated with it. Bloodshed is associated with murder. Stumbling represents sinning. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]). 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

The reason for the lawsuit is Israel's pursuit of other gods or what we call idolatry.
