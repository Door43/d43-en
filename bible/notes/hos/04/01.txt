<usfm>
\v 1 Listen to the message Yahweh has for you.
\q2 "You people of Israel, Yahweh is accusing you, you who live in this place." 
\q1 He says, "I cannot find anyone here who tells the truth. 
\q2 I cannot see anyone who loves me. 
\q1 None of you can honestly say that he knows me.
\q1
\v 2 You curse and lie, you kill and steal, and you commit adultery.
\q1 You have broken every law,
\q2 and you commit one murder after another.

\q
\v 1 Hear the word of Yahweh, you people of Israel.
\q Yahweh has a lawsuit against the inhabitants of the land,
\q because there is no truthfulness or covenantal faithfulness, no knowledge of God in the land.
\q
\v 2 There is cursing, lying, killing, stealing and adultery.
\q The people have broken all bounds, and bloodshed comes after bloodshed.
