  * **Do not go to Gilgal, you people; do not go up to Beth Aven. **- The people of Judah are being warned not to go to Gilgal or Beth Aven to worship idols in those two places. Gilgal was once a holy place, but now it had become a place of idol worship. Beth-el ("house of God") had become a place where the people of Israel could worship the golden calf.
