<usfm>
\v 15 You Israelite people have abandoned me

\q2 Do not go to Gilgal or go up to Beth-Aven \add towns\add*
\q2 \add to worship idols there\add*.
\q1 Do not make solemn promises there, saying 'Just \add as surely\add* as Yahweh lives, \add I will do what I am promising\add*.'
\q1
\v 16 The people of Israel are as stubborn as \f + \ft simile \f* a young cow.
\q2 So there is no way \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* that I, Yahweh, will \add provide food for them\add*
\q1 \add like a shepherd provides food\add* for his lambs
\q2 \add by leading them\add* to a nice meadow.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 Israel, you have left me and gone to idols.

\q1 But I hope that Judah will not do the same thing.
\q2 You people of Judah, do not go to Gilgal. Do not go up to Beth Aven to worship idols there.
\q1 Do not make solemn oaths, calling on me to make good on your promises, adding to your vows the words,  'As Yahweh lives!"
\v 16 Israel is as stubborn as a young cow.
\q2 Can I now feed them as if they were little lambs in a meadow?

\q
\v 15 Though you, Israel, have committed adultery,
\q may Judah not become guilty.
\q Do not go to Gilgal, you people;
\q do not go up to Beth Aven.
\q And do not swear, "As Yahweh lives."
\q
\v 16 For Israel has behaved stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer.
\q How can Yahweh bring them to pasture like lambs in a meadow?

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh is talking about Judah and Israel.

  * **may Judah not become guilty** - God is recognizing how sinful Israel has become and doesn't want Judah to do the same thing. (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Do not go to Gilgal, you people; do not go up to Beth Aven. **- The people of Judah are being warned not to go to Gilgal or Beth Aven to worship idols in those two places. Gilgal was once a holy place, but now it had become a place of idol worship. 
  * **like a stubborn heifer** - Israel is compared to a young cow that kicks and has to be tied up, rather than be let free to graze in the pasture. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **How can Yahweh bring them to pasture like lambs in a meadow?** - When Yahweh allows Israel to be free, they turn to the worship of idols. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
