===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh is talking about Israel.

  * **Sexual promiscuity, wine, and new wine have taken away their understanding** - Yahweh describes these things as persons who can take something away. He means that since the Israelites are sleeping with many people and drinking too much wine they are not able to understand Yahweh's commands. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **their walking sticks give them prophecies** - Idol worshipers used walking sticks to help them predict the future. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **spirit of promiscuity has misled them** - Worshiping the idols and sleeping with the temple prostitutes has caused the people of Israel to sin greatly against Yahweh.
