====== Hosea 04:6-7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 It is because my people do not know \add about me\add* that they will be destroyed.
\q1 And their not knowing about me is because you have refused \add to teach them about me\add*;
\q2 so I will no longer allow you to be my priests.
\q1 You have forgotten the things that I taught you,
\q2 so I will forget \add to bless\add* your children.
\q1
\v 7 As there are more and more priests,
\q2 they have sinned against me more and more.
\q1 So I will no longer allow them to be honored;
\q2 instead, I will cause them to be disgraced.

\v 6 My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.
\q Because you have rejected knowledge,
\q I will also reject you as priest to me.
\q Because you have forgotten the law of your God,
\q I also will forget your children.
\v 7 As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me: I will change their glory into shame.
