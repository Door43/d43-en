====== Hosea 04:6-7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 It is because my people do not know \add about me\add* that they will be destroyed.
\q1 And their not knowing about me is because you have refused \add to teach them about me\add*;
\q2 so I will no longer allow you to be my priests.
\q1 You have forgotten the things that I taught you,
\q2 so I will forget \add to bless\add* your children.
\q1
\v 7 As there are more and more priests,
\q2 they have sinned against me more and more.
\q1 So I will no longer allow them to be honored;
\q2 instead, I will cause them to be disgraced.
\q1
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 My people are perishing because you priests have refused to understand me.
\q1 And why do you understand me so little? Because you have rejected the things I have instructed you to do.
\q2 So I am rejecting you from being priests to me. 
\q1 Look at what you have forgotten: You have forgotten the instructions that I, your God, gave to you.
\q2 Because you forgot me, I will forget your children.
\q1
\v 7 The more numerous you priests become,
\q2 the more you do the things that I have forbidden.
\q2 
\q1 Everyone respects you now, but I will make them dishonor you.


\q1

\q
\v 6 My people are being destroyed because of the lack of knowledge.
\q Because you priests have rejected knowledge,
\q I will also reject you as priests to me.
\q Because you have forgotten my law, although I am your God,
\q I also will forget your children.
\q
\v 7 The more the priests multiplied,
\q the more they sinned against me.
\q I will change their honor into shame.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In 4:6, Yahweh is talking to the priests about the people of Israel. But in 4:7, he is talking about the priests, not to them. It is possible for the translator to follow the example of the UDB, which portrays Yahweh as talking to the priests also in 4:7.

  * **My people are being destroyed because of the lack of knowledge** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "I will destroy my people because you, the priests, have not properly taught them about me so that they will obey me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **multiplied** - "became more numerous"
  * **I will change their honor into shame** - Because of the priests' bad example and great sin, Yahweh will reject and shame the priests.
