\v 13 you have abandoned \add me\add* their God, and you are chasing after \add other gods\add* on the tops of hills and mountains;

\q2 \add whom I will punish\add* for having become prostitutes,
\q1 and it is not \add only\add* your daughters-in-law
\q2 whom I will punish for committing adultery,
\q1 because the men also are having sex with prostitutes,

<usfm>
\v 13 They are chasing after other gods, at the places of idol worship that are set up on the tops of the mountains. They burn offerings to the idols up on those hills—
\q1 in all the places where they worship those idols—under the oak trees, poplar trees, and the terebinth trees—
\q2 because these trees give good shade.
\q1 Following your example, your daughters decided to become prostitutes,
\q2 and your daughters-in-law committed adultery.
\b
\q1
\v 14 But I will not punish the women for turning to prostitution,
\q1 or your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery.
\q2 It is the men who are doing the very same thing! 
\q1 They sleep with prostitutes,
\q2 and they offer sacrifices in the houses of idols where there are prostitutes in the shrine for the men who come to worship the idols. 
\q2 I will destroy this people because you do not understand what you are doing!

<usfm>
\q
\v 13 They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains
\q and burn incense on the hills,
\q under oaks, poplars and terebinths,
\q because the shade is good.
\q So your daughters commit sexual immorality,
\q and your daughters-in-law commit adultery.
\q
\v 14 I will not punish your daughters when they choose to commit sexual immorality,
\q nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery.
\q For the men also give themselves to the prostitutes,
\q and they offer sacrifices so they can commit immoral acts with shrine prostitutes.
\q So this people who do not understand will come to ruin.
