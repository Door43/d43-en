<usfm>
\v 11 Although \add the people of\add* Israel built many altars to present offerings \add to their idols\add* to take away \add their guilt for\add* sinning,
\q2 those altars have become places where they commit \add more\add* sins.
\q1
\v 12 I wrote many laws for them,
\q2 but they disregarded them, saying that \add they did not have to obey them because\add* they were different from laws that they had known previously.

\v 11 The people of Ephraim have built many altars on which to offer sacrifices for their sins;
\q2 however, these altars have become places where the people commit terrible sins against me. 
\q1
\v 12 Even if I wrote out for the people of Israel my laws ten thousand times,
\q2 they would refuse to obey them.
\q1 They would say they had never heard of them.
