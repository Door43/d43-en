====== Hosea 08:11-12 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 Although \add the people of\add* Israel built many altars to present offerings \add to their idols\add* to take away \add their guilt for\add* sinning,
\q2 those altars have become places where they commit \add more\add* sins.
\q1
\v 12 I wrote many laws for them,
\q2 but they disregarded them, saying that \add they did not have to obey them because\add* they were different from laws that they had known previously.
\q1

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 The people of Ephraim have built many altars on which to offer sacrifices for their sins;
\q2 however, these altars have become places where the people commit terrible sins against me.
\q1
\v 12 Even if I wrote out for the people of Israel my laws ten thousand times,
\q2 they would refuse to obey them.
\q1 They would say they had never heard of them.


\q1

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 11 For Ephraim has multiplied altars for sin offerings,
\q but they have become altars for committing sins instead.
\q
\v 12 I could write down my law for them ten thousand times,
\q but they would view it as something strange to them.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh is speaking.

  * **I could write down my law for them ten thousand times, but they would** - Yahweh is describing a hypothetical situation. Here "ten thousand times" is an exaggeration that means no matter how many times he gave the people the law, they would still refuse to obey him. AT: "Even if I wrote down my law for them very many times, they would" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **ten thousand** - "10,000" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
