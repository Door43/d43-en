===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Israel has been taken possession of by more powerful nations,
\q2 they are a possession no one wants to own—worthless among the nations, having no value,
\q1 like an old, broken jar lying among the possessions of a home.  
\q1
\v 9 They have gone up to Assyria, 
\q2 like a wild donkey wandering by itself, alone. 
\q1 Ephraim has sought to hire the protection of other nations in order to keep themselves safe. 
\q1
\v 10 But although they pay other armies from the among all the nations to keep them safe,
\q2 I will soon gather them up,
\q2 and they will twist and turn with agony because of the heavy taxes and high costs of government their king will impose on them.

\q
\v 8 Israel is swallowed up;
\q now they lie among the nations like something useless.
\q
\v 9 For they went up to Assyria
\q like a wild donkey all alone.
\q Ephraim has hired lovers for herself.
\q
\v 10 Even though they have hired lovers among the nations,
\q I will now gather them together.
\q They will begin to waste away
\q because of the oppression of the king of princes.
