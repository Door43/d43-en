\v 8 Other nations have destroyed Israel's power.
\q2 Now Israel is like an old, broken pot that no one wants.

\v 9 They asked the king of Assyria for help; 
\q2 they were like a wild donkey wandering off by itself.
\q1 The people of Israel have tried to pay other nations to protect them.
\q1
\v 10 Although they do this,
\q2 I will soon gather them up to destroy them.
\q2 They will begin to become poor because they will have to pay money to Assyria's king.

\q
\v 8 Israel is swallowed up;
\q now they lie among the nations like something useless.
\q
\v 9 For they went up to Assyria
\q like a wild donkey all alone.
\q Ephraim has hired lovers for herself.
\q
\v 10 Even though they have hired lovers among the nations,
\q I will now gather them together.
\q They will begin to waste away
\q because of the oppression of the king of princes.
