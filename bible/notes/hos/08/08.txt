\v 8 Israel is swallowed up,
\q now they are among the nations
\q like a vessel that no one wants.
\q
\v 9 For they went up to Assyria,
\q like a wild donkey all alone.
\q Ephraim has hired lovers.
\q
\v 10 Even though they hired among the nations,
\q now I will gather them,
\q and they will begin to be diminished,
\q because of the oppression of the king of princes.
