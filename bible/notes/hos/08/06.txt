===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 \add Someone in\add* Israel made that idol for you;
\q1 \add but I am\add* God and it is not.
\q2 So that idol of a calf in Samaria must be smashed to pieces.
\b
\q1
\v 7 \add The foolish thing that the people of Israel have done is like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* trying to plant wind;
\q2 but what they harvest will be like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a whirlwind.
\q1 So the grain that they planted will have no heads \add on the stalks\add*
\q2 and as a result \add there will be no grain\add* from which to make flour.
\q1 And if it did produce good grain,
\q2 foreigners would \add come and\add* steal it.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 The shame of it is that this idol came from Israel! A craftsman made it. 
\q1 It is only an idol; it cannot be the true and living God! 
\q2 I will ensure that someone will smash it to bits.
\b
\q1
\v 7 This is because these people do useless things, so something terrible will destroy them.
\q2 Their grain standing in the fields will give no harvest.
\q1 And even if it does, foreign soldiers will eat everything it produces.


\q1

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 6 For this idol came from Israel;
\q a workman made it;
\q it is not God!
\q The calf of Samaria will be broken to pieces.
\q
\v 7 For the people sow the wind
\q and reap the whirlwind.
\q The standing grain has no heads;
\q it yields no flour.
\q If it does come to maturity,
\q foreigners will devour it.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh is speaking.

  * **For the people sow the wind and reap the whirlwind** - To sow or plant the wind is to act in useless or destructive ways. To reap the whirlwind is to suffer disaster from one's own actions. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **The standing grain has no heads** - Here "head" refers to the part of the plant where the grain is. A stalk with no head has nothing to give to the farmer. In the same way, Israel's actions will result in nothing good.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **If it does come to maturity, foreigners will devour it** - If any of Israel's actions do happen to result in something good, Israel's enemies will come and take it from them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
