<usfm>
\v 6 \add Someone in\add* Israel made that idol for you;
\q1 \add but I am\add* God and it is not.
\q2 So that idol of a calf in Samaria must be smashed to pieces.
\b
\q1
\v 7 \add The foolish thing that the people of Israel have done is like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* trying to plant wind;
\q2 but what they harvest will be like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a whirlwind.
\q1 So the grain that they planted will have no heads \add on the stalks\add*
\q2 and as a result \add there will be no grain\add* from which to make flour.
\q1 And if it did produce good grain,
\q2 foreigners would \add come and\add* steal it.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 The shame of it is that this idol came from Israel! A craftsman made it. 
\q1 It is only an idol; it cannot be the true and living God! 
\q2 I will ensure that some will smash it to bits.
\b
\q1
\v 7 This is because they people do useless things, so something terrible will destroy them.
\q2 Their grain standing in the fields will give no harvest.
\q1 And even if it does, foreign soldiers will eat everything it produces.

\q1

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 6 For this thing came from Israel;
\q a workman made it;
\q it is not God!
\q The calf of Samaria will be broken to pieces.
\q
\v 7 For the people sow the wind
\q and reap the whirlwind.
\q The standing grain has no heads;
\q it yields no flour.
\q If it does come to maturity,
\q foreigners will devour it.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh is speaking.

  * **For the people sow the wind and reap the whirlwind. **- This is figurative language showing cause and effect of Israel's actions: they have "planted" (or committed) evil actions and as a consequence will "reap" (or experience) the destructive results of Yahweh's wrath. (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
