\q2 But I, Yahweh, am not pleased with those sacrifices.
\q1 I remember the evil things that they have done,
\q2 and I will punish them for the sins that they have committed:
\q1 I will force them to \add go to other countries\add*
\q2 \add and become slaves like they were\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* in Egypt.
\q1
\v 14 \add The people of\add* Israel have abandoned\f + \ft Or: forgotten \f* me, the one who created their \add nation\add*;
\q2 they have built palaces,
\q2 and \add the people of\add* Judah have built walls around many towns.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 Let us consider the sacrifices that you give to me. 
\q2 They sacrifice the meat and then they eat it;
\q1 but Yahweh is not pleased with those sacrifices.
\q2 Now he will remember their sins and he will punish their sins.
\q1 He will force them to return to Egypt.

\q1
\v 14 And why has this happened? 
\q2 Israel has forgotten the God who created him and has spent their wealth building huge palaces. 
\q1 And instead of worshiping Yahweh, Judah has built fortified cities for protection. 
\q2 And this is what I, Yahweh, will do: 
\q1 I will send a fire that will destroy all their palaces and all their fortified cities."
