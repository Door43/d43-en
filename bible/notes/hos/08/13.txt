====== Hosea 08:13-14 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 They offer sacrifices to me,
\q2 and they eat \add some of\add* the meat of those sacrifices, \add which is what I permitted them to do\add*.
\q2 But I, Yahweh, am not pleased with those sacrifices.
\q1 I remember the evil things that they have done,
\q2 and I will punish them for the sins that they have committed:
\q1 I will force them to \add go to other countries\add*
\q2 \add and become slaves like they were\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* in Egypt.
\q1
\v 14 \add The people of\add* Israel have abandoned\f + \ft Or: forgotten \f* me, the one who created their \add nation\add*;
\q2 they have built palaces,
\q2 and \add the people of\add* Judah have built walls around many towns.
\q1 But I will send a fire
\q2 that will destroy all their cities and their fortresses."

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 Let us think about the sacrifices that they give to me. 
\q2 They sacrifice the meat and then they eat it;
\q1 but I, Yahweh, am not pleased with those sacrifices.
\q2 I will think about their sins and will punish the people for them.
\q1 I will make them go back to Egypt.

\q1
\v 14 And why has this happened? 
\q2 The people of Israel have forgotten me, the God who made them a nation. Instead of honoring me, they have built huge homes to live in.
\q1 And instead of worshiping Yahweh, the people of Judah have built walls around their cities for protection. 
\q2 So this is what I, Yahweh, will do: 
\q1 I will send a fire that will destroy all their palaces and all their fortified cities."

<usfm>
\q
\v 13 As for the sacrifices of my offerings,
\q they sacrifice meat and eat it,
\q but I, Yahweh, do not accept them.
\q Now I will call to mind their iniquity
\q and punish their sins.
\q They will return to Egypt.
\q
\v 14 Israel has forgotten me, his Maker,
\q and has built palaces.
\q Judah has fortified many cities,
\q but I will send fire on his cities;
\q it will destroy his fortresses.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh is speaking.

  * **call to mind** - AT: "remember" or "think about"
  * **They will return to Egypt.**  - Now, because of their sin, they will go into exile and once again be slaves of a powerful nation. (see: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
