===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh is speaking.

  * **but it was only so they might be cut off** - This was the result, not the purpose. AT: "but as a result of making idols, the people will be cut off"
  * **they might be cut off** - Possible meanings are 1) "they will perish" or 2) "they will be sent away." This can be expressed with an active verb: I will cut them off" or "I will send them away"
  * **He has rejected your calf** -  It appears that the Hosea is saying this. This can be made clear as it is in the UDB. Or it can be translated as if God is still speaking. AT: "I have rejected your calf" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **your calf** - It can be made clear that this was an idol. AT "your idol that you made to look like a calf" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **My anger burns against them** - AT: "I am very angry with them"
  * **For how long will they stay impure?**  - Yahweh uses this question to express his anger about his people being impure. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
