<usfm>
\v 1 Yahweh says, "Get a trumpet and blow it.
\q2 There are enemies swooping down over my people,
\q1 as an eagle swoops down over a victim.
\q2 This is because my people have left my covenant with them
\q1 and have violated the law I gave them.
\q1
\v 2 My people Israel cry out to me and say,
\q2 'Our God, we are loyal to you!'
\q1
\v 3 But the people of Israel have thrown away what is good,
\q2 so their enemies will chase after them.
