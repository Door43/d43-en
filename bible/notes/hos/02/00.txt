====== Hosea 02 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this which is a series of quotation. Hosea 1-2 is a single series forming one narrative.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphor ==
Many relationships are used in this chapter that are metaphors for the relationship between Israel and her God (i.e. brother, sister, husband, wife, mother and children). (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]).

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

This chapter creates an abrupt change of address. The prophet is now addressing the children directly in the first few verses, but the whole chapter is written against Gomer as an illustration of Israel as an adulteress people. God has used Gomer as an illustration to teach the people of Israel about how they should be faithful to him.
