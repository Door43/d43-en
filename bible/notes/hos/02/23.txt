===== Translation Notes: =====

God is speaking to Hosea about what he will do for Israel.

  * **I will plant her for myself in the land** - AT: "I will take care of the Israelite people as a farmer plants his own land and takes care of his crops." (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Lo Ruhamah** - The name itself means 'not loved,' 'not having obtained mercy', 'without compassion.'
  * **I will say to Lo Ammi** - "Lo Ammi" refers to those who were not Yahweh's people
  * **You are Ammi Attah** - This means, "You are my people."
