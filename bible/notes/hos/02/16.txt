  * **you will no longer call me, 'My Baal.'** -"Baal" means "master" and also refers to the name of a Canaanite deity. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For I will remove the names of the Baals from her mouth** - Baal and the idols would never be mentioned again by the Israelites if they continue to worship Yahweh. (see: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
