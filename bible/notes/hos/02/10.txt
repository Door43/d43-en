God is speaking to Hosea.

  * **Then I will strip her naked in the sight of her lovers** - God will treat Israel in a very humiliating way. (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]; also see how this was translated in __2:3__).
  * **no one will rescue her out of my hand **- No one will try to help Israel. God's hand here is referring to his control over the people of Israel. (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
