  * **General Information:** - Yahweh is speaking to Hosea.

  * **Then I will strip her naked in the sight of her lovers** - This means God will humiliate the people of Israel in front of the other nations nearby. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:hos:02:02|2:3]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **no one will rescue her out of my hand** - No one will try to help Israel. Here "hand" refers to God's power to punish. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
