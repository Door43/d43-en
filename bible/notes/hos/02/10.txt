===== Translation Notes: =====

God is speaking to Hosea.

  * **Then I will strip her naked in the sight of her lovers** - God will treat Israel in a very humiliating way. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:hos:02:02|2:3]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **no one will rescue her out of my hand ** - No one will try to help Israel. God's hand here is referring to his protection of the people of Israel. (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
