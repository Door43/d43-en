\v 2 Yahweh said to me, "I want you to accuse Israel, who is like a mother to you, of being like an unfaithful wife to me.
\q1 This nation is no longer like a wife to me,
\q2 and I am no longer like a husband to her.
\q1 Tell Israel that they must stop acting like a prostitute; she must stop worshiping idols.
\q2 Israel must stop worshiping idols. She must stop acting like a woman who leaves her husband and goes to other men.
\q1
\v 3 If she does not stop, 
\q1 I will take her clothes off her and make her naked like she was when she was born.
\q2 I will make her like the barren wilderness—dry and lifeless;
I will make her like a woman dying from thirst in the desert.

\v 2 Bring a lawsuit against your mother, bring a lawsuit,
\q2 for she is not my wife,
\q2 and neither am I her husband.
\q Let her put away her prostitution from before herself,
\q and her acts of adultery from between her breasts.
\q
\v 3 If not, I will strip her naked
\q and show her nakedness as on the day that she was born.
\q I will make her like the wilderness,
\q like a parched land,
\q and I will make her die from thirst.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh is speaking to Hosea.

  * **lawsuit** - a complaint by one person against another person in a court of law
  * **your mother** - Here "mother" refers to the nation of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **for she is not my wife** - Yahweh is stating that Israel (she) is no longer acting like a wife to Yahweh. Instead Israel has turned away from following and worshiping Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and neither am I her husband** - Yahweh can no longer be in relationship with the nation of Israel as a husband would be to his wife. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and her acts of adultery** - A wife who is adulterous leaves her husband to sleep with another man. This is how Israel was acting toward Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **from between her breasts** - This imagery shows that Israel is relying on the idols and not Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will strip her naked and show her nakedness as on the day that she was born** - This means Yahweh will no longer protect and provide for Israel because Israel has turned away from Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will make her like the wilderness** - Yahweh will change Israel to resemble the wilderness. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **and I will make her die from thirst** - Here "thirst" refers to the need to worship and rely on Yahweh, not idols, or Israel will not be able to survive as a nation. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
