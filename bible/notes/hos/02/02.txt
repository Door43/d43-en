\v 2 Yahweh said to me, "I want you to accuse Israel, who is like a mother to you, of being like an unfaithful wife to me.
\q1 This nation is no longer like a wife to me,
\q2 and I am no longer like a husband to her.
\q1 Tell Israel that they must stop acting like a prostitute; she must stop worshiping idols.
\q2 Israel must stop worshiping idols. She must stop acting like a woman who leaves her husband and goes to other men.
\q1
\v 3 If she does not stop, 
\q1 I will take her clothes off her and make her naked like she was when she was born.
\q2 I will make her like the barren wilderness—dry and lifeless;
I will make her like a woman dying from thirst in the desert.

Yahweh is speaking to Hosea.

  * **lawsuit**  - a complaint by one person against another in a court of law
  * **your mother **- Here this refers to Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]).
  * **for she is not my wife** - Yahweh is stating that Israel (she) is no longer acting like a wife to Yahweh. Instead Israel has turned away from following and worshiping Yahweh. (See:[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **and her acts of adultery** - A wife who is adulterous leaves her husband to have a sexual relationship with another man. This shows how Israel was acting with Yahweh. (UDB)
  * **I will strip her naked and show her nakedness as on the day that she was born** - Israel has turned away from Yahweh, they will no longer have Yahweh's protection around them and his provision for them. (see: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **I will make her like the wilderness** - Yahweh will change Israel to resemble the wilderness. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **and I will make her die from thirst** - "thirst" refers to the need to worship and rely on Yahweh (not idols), or Israel will not be able to survive as a nation. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
