===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 I will destroy all of Israel's grapevines and fig trees.
\q2 This is because Israel is like a woman who says, 'These were the things that my lovers gave me in payment.'
\q1 I, Yahweh, will turn those places into a forest, a thicket in which no vines can grow, 
\q2 and where wild animals will devour any fruit that grows there.' 
\q1
\v 13 I will punish this woman named Israel for all the times that she burned incense to worship the Baal idols.
\q1 She decorated herself with rings and jewelry, as a prostitute would adorn herself for her lovers.
\q2 She used to follow her lovers—like Israel has gone after the Baals—those false gods that she worshiped.
\q2 And she forgot about me." This is what Yahweh says.
\b


\q1

\q
\v 12 "I will destroy her vines and her fig trees,
\q of which she has said,
\q "These are my wages that my lovers gave me."
\q I will make them a forest,
\q and the animals of the field will eat them.
\q
\v 13 I will punish her for the feast days of the Baals,
\q when she burned incense to them,
\q when she adorned herself with her rings and jewelry,
\q and she went after her lovers and forgot me."
\q This is the declaration of Yahweh.
