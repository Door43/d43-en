===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 I will destroy all of  Israel's grapevines and fig trees.
\q2 This is because Israel is like a woman who says, 'These were the things that my lovers gave me in payment.'
\q1 I, Yahweh, will turn those places into a forest, a thicket in which no vines can grow, 
\q2 and where wild animals will devour any fruit that grows there.' 
\q1
\v 13 I will punish this woman named Israel for all the times that she burned incense to worship the Baal idols.
\q1 She decorated herself with rings and jewelry, as a prostitute would adorn herself for her lovers.
\q2 She used to follow her lovers—like Israel has gone after the Baals—those false gods that she worshiped.
\q2 And she forgot about me." This is what Yahweh says.
