  * **will I make a covenant for them** - the objects of this covenant are the animal kingdom. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will drive away the bow, the sword, and the battle from the land, and I will make you lie down in safety**. - Yahweh will keep Israel's enemies away from them; there will be no more war; the people will live in safety. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
