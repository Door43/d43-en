===== Translation Notes =====

God is speaking to Hosea.

  * **for they are children of prostitution** - The Israelites are acting like they do not belong to Yahweh. They are acting like they are children of an idol who is not a real god. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For their mother has been a prostitute** - The idols that Israel has been worshiping are not real gods. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will go after my lovers, for they give me my bread and water, my wool and flax, my oil and drink** - Here "my lovers" refers to Baal and other false gods, whom Israel has chosen to worship instead of Yahweh. The list of things are essential items for the people to live. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
