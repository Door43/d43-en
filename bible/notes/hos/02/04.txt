===== Translation Notes =====

God is speaking to Hosea.

  * **for they are children of prostitution** - The Israelites are acting like they do not belong to Yahweh. They are acting like they are children from another idol who is not a real god. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For their mother has been a prostitute** - The idols that Israel has been worshipping are not real gods. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **She said, "I will go after my lovers, for they give me my bread and water, my wool and flax, my oil and drink." **- Instead of seeking and worshiping Yahweh, Israel has chosen to worship Baal and other false gods ("my lovers"). The list of things in this verse are essential needs for the people to live. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
