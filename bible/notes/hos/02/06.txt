\q2 but she will not find them.
\q1 She will search for her false gods,

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh is talking to Hosea.

  * **Therefore I will build up a hedge to block her way with thorns. I will build up a wall against her so she cannot find her way** - This passage indicates that Yahweh will prevent his people from finding success and prosperity, becuase they continue to worship idols. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Then she will say, "I will return to my first husband, for it was better for me then than it is now."** - Israel will return to Yahweh not because of their love for him, but because they are disappointed by their worship of Baal. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
