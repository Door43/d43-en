===== Translation Notes: =====

God is talking to Hosea about what he will do to Israel.

  * **Therefore I will build up a hedge to block her way with thorns. I will build up a wall against her so she cannot find her way. **- The second sentence is further explaining the first. It tells the reason why Yahweh is doing this to Israel. This is a picture of what Yahweh will do to Israel when she continues to worship idols. The "hedge of thorns" and the "wall" symbolize Yahweh and how he prevents the Israelites from totally going their own "way," and instead tries to redirect Israel back to following him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Then she will say, "I will return to my first husband, for it was better for me then than it is now."** - Israel will return to Yahweh not because of their love for him, but because they are disappointed by their worship of Baal. (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
