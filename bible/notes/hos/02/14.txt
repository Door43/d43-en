===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **So I am going to win her back. **- AT: "I, Yahweh, will bring her (Israel) back to me."
  * **and the Valley of Achor as a door of hope **- The Valley of Achor (literally "trouble") is near Jericho, the first city defeated by Joshua and the Israelites when they entered Canaan.  Achan, one of the soldiers, stole some of the things from Jericho.  His sin caused defeat and death of Israelites at the battle of Ai. Achan confessed; Yahweh brought judgment on him; and then the "trouble" became a "door of hope" - Israel won the next battle against Ai and went on to conquer the land of Canaan.
  * **She will answer me there as she did in the days of her youth, as in the days that she came out of the land of Egypt.**
