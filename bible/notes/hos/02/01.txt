\v 1 Say you to your brothers, "My people,"
\q and to your sisters, "Mercy."

\v 2 Contend with your mother, contend,
\q2 for she is not my wife,
\q2 neither am I her husband.
\q Let her put away her prostitution from her face,
\q and her adulteries from between her breasts,
\q
\v 3 lest I strip her naked
\q and expose her as in the day that she was born,
\q make her as a wilderness,
\q make her like a dry land,
\q and kill her with thirst.
