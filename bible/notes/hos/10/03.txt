====== Hosea 10:3-4 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Then they will say, 'It is because we did not revere Yahweh
\q2 that we no longer have a king.
\q1 But \add even if we had\add* a king,
\q2 he certainly could not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* do anything to help us.'
\q1
\v 4 They falsely promise \add that they will do many things\add*;
\q2 they solemnly promise and make agreements
\q2 but they do not do what they promise.
\q1 So people accuse and sue each other in the courts;
\q2 they are like \f + \ft simile \f* poisonous weeds that grow in a plowed field.
\q1

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 They say, "We have no king now because we did not honor or respect Yahweh.
\q2 But even if we had a king,
\q2 how could a king help us?"
\q1
\v 4 The people of Israel make lying promises and false covenants; 
\q2 and because their promises are not kept, 
\q1 their sort of justice kills people, as poisonous weeds in a field would do.



\q1

\q
\v 3 For now they will say,
\q "We have no king,
\q for we do not fear Yahweh.
\q And a king—what could he do for us?"
\p
\q
\v 4 They speak empty words
\q and make covenants by swearing falsely. 
\q So justice springs up 
\q like poisonous weeds in the furrows of a field.
