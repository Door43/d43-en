\v 3 Then they will say, 'It is because we did not revere Yahweh
\q2 that we no longer have a king.
\q1 But \add even if we had\add* a king,
\q2 he certainly could not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* do anything to help us.'
\q1
\v 4 They falsely promise \add that they will do many things\add*;
\q2 they solemnly promise and make agreements
\q2 but they do not do what they promise.
\q1 So people accuse and sue each other in the courts;
\q2 they are like \f + \ft simile \f* poisonous weeds that grow in a plowed field.

\v 3 They say, "We have no king now because we did not give honor or respect Yahweh.
\q2 But even if we had a king,
\q2 how could a king help us?"
\q1
\v 4 The people of Israel make lying promises and false agreements; 
\q2 and because their promises are not kept, 
\q1 lawsuits spring up everywhere like poisonous weeds that grow in the furrow of a farmer's field.
\q2 The weeds grow and there is no room for his crop to grow, 
\q1 and the weeds leave him with nothing.

\v 4 They make empty promises,
\q and with lies they make binding agreements. 
\q Therefore, judgment springs up 
\q like poisonous weeds in a plowed field.
