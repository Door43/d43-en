====== Hosea 10 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter is written in poetic form and continues the theme of Israel's many [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sins]] against Yahweh. Even though Israel prospered for a time as they multiplied their sins, Yahweh was leading them toward destruction. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

Yahweh's relationship to [[:en:obe:kt:peopleofgod|his people]] was not based on His people's actions. Even though they rebelled, Yahweh was still moved to rescue them. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Jacob ==
The repeated use of different names for the two kingdoms can be confusing. In verse 11, Ephraim references the northern kingdom of Israel, and Judah references the southern kingdom of Judah. However, Jacob is also mentioned. This use of Jacob conjures up the earlier unified nation and may also reference a future unified nation (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]).
