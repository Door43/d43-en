\q2 and they will cause the Israelite people to become their slaves.
\q1
\v 11 Israel is like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a well-trained heifer\f + \ft Or: young cow \f*
\q2 that likes to thresh grain.
\q1 So \add now you will become slaves\add*.

\q2 \add You people of\add* Israel and Judah \add will be forced to go to Assyria\add*;
\q2 there you \f + \ft doublet \f* will pull plows to break up the ground \add for planting seeds\add*.

<usfm>
\v 10 Yahweh says, "When I decide to act, I will punish them.
\q2 People groups will gather to fight against them;
\q1 those people groups will capture them and put them in chains
\q2 because of their many sins.
\q1
\v 11 Ephraim is like a trained calf
\q2 that loves to thresh grain, separating out the grain from the chaff,
\q1 and I did not put a heavy yoke on her tender neck.
\q2 But now I will put Ephraim under that yoke,
\q1 and Judah must plow.
\q2 and Jacob must break up the ground with the harrow.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh is speaking.

  * **double iniquity** - This refers to the many sins of Israel.
  * **Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh** - A heifer loves to thresh because they can walk around freely without a yoke. Yahweh means that he has allowed the people of Israel to be free and have a pleasant life. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will put a yoke on her fair neck. I will put a yoke on Ephraim** - Here "yoke" refers to suffering and slavery. Yahweh has been kind to the people of Israel, but the people have been unfaithful to him. So he will punish them and send them away as slaves. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Judah will plow; Jacob will pull the harrow by himself** - Here "Judah" refers to the people of the southern kingdom and "Jacob" is the people of the southern kingdom. This means God will cause difficult times for both kingdoms. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **harrow** - a tool used to smooth the land and cover the seeds after plowing
