\v 10 When it is my desire, I will chastise them; and the peoples shall be gathered against them, when they are bound to their two transgressions.
\v 11 And Ephraim is a heifer that is taught, that loves to tread out the grain; but I have passed over upon her fair neck: I will set a rider on Ephraim; Judah shall plow, Jacob shall break his clods.
