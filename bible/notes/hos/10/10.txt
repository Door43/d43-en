\v 10 Yahweh says, "When I decide to act, I will punish them.
\q2 People groups will gather to fight against them;
\q1 those people groups will capture them and put them in chains
\q2 because of their many sins.
\q1
\v 11 Ephraim is like a trained calf 
\q2 that loves to thresh grain, separating out the grain from the chaff,
\q1 and I did not put a heavy yoke on her tender neck.
\q2 But now I will put Ephraim under that yoke, 
\q1 and Judah must plow.
\q2 and Jacob must break up the ground with the harrow.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh is speaking.

  * **double iniquity** - This refers to the many sins of Ephraim (Israel); it includes their worship of idols and their turning away from Yahweh.
  * **Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh** - The nation of Ephraim is compared to a trained heifer - symbolic of God's training of his people, and his kindness to them by not putting them under a heavy yoke. (see: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **so I will put a yoke on her fair neck. I will put a yoke on Ephraim;** - The yoke symbolizes God's punishment. (See:[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Judah will plow; Jacob will pull the harrow by himself.** - Jacob and Judah make up the nation of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **harrow**  - a term used in connection with plowing - probably branches pulled behind an animal to smooth the land and cover seed.
