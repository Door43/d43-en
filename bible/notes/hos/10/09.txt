===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh is speaking.

  * **days of Gibeah** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:hos:09:08|9:9]]. This is probably a reference to the shocking actions of the tribe of Benjamin recounted in Judges 19-21.
  * **there you have remained** - This passage probably means that the people of the present time continue to act in the same ways that their ancestors did at Gibeah. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Will not war overtake the sons of wrong in Gibeah?** - "War will certainly come on those who do wrong in Gibeah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
