Yahweh is speaking.

  * **days of Gibeah** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:hos:09:08|9:9]].
  * **Did not war overtake the evildoers in Gibeah?** - Yahweh uses a question to remind the people he allowed enemy armies to destroy the sinners in Gibeah, and he will do the same again to the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
