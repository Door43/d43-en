===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh is speaking.

  * **Sow righteousness for yourselves,** - Using the language of farming, strive for a good relationship with God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and reap the fruit of covenant faithfulness** - The result will be a great relationship with God. (see: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Break up your unplowed ground** - Unplowed ground symbolizes what their lives were like - full of sins. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **You have plowed wickedness** - This is the other side. But in reality you have planted wrongdoing (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]).
  * **you reaped injustice. You have eaten the fruit of deception** - These two phrase are saying the same thing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
