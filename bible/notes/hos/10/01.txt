\v 1 Israel is like a vine
\q2 that produces many bundles of grapes.
\q1 But the more their fruit increased, the richer they became.
\q2 With that money they made more stone columns in honor of their idols.

\v 2 They are deceitful and cannot be trusted;
\q2 but the time has come that they must pay for their sins. 
\q1 Yahweh will break their altars into pieces—

\q2 and he promises to destroy those sacred pillars beside which they worshiped their false gods.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Hosea is speaking about Israel.

  * **Israel is a luxuriant vine that produces his fruit** - Israel is compared to a vine that is very fruitful. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:hos:09:13|9:13]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a luxuriant vine** - This vine produces more fruit than normal.
  * **As his land produced more, he improved his sacred pillars** - AT: "With that money they made more stone columns in honor of their idols" (UDB)
  * **Their heart is deceitful** - This means that Israel is being dishonest toward Yahweh by their worship of idols. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **now they must bear their guilt** - AT: "but the time has come that they must pay for their sins" (UDB)
