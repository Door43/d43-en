Hosea is speaking about Israel.

  * **Israel is a luxuriant vine that produces his fruit** - Israel is compared to a vine that is very fruitful. (See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:hos:09:13|9:13]].). (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a luxuriant vine** - This vine is producing more fruit than normal.
  * **As his land produced more, he improved his sacred pillars** - AT: "With that money they made more stone columns in honor of their idols" (UDB)
  * **Their heart is deceitful** - This means that Israel is being dishonest toward Yahweh by their worship of idols. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **now they must bear their guilt** - AT: "but the time has come that they must pay for their sins." (UDB)
