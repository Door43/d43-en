<usfm>
\v 1 Israel is like a vine
\q2 that produces many bundles of grapes.
\q1 But the more their fruit increased, the richer they became.
\q2 With that money they made more stone columns in honor of their idols.
\q1
\v 2 They are deceitful and cannot be trusted;
\q2 but the time has come that they must pay for their sins.
\q1 Yahweh will break their altars into pieces—
\q2 the places where they gave sacrifices to their idols,
\q2 and he promises to destroy those pillars beside which they worshiped their false gods.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Hosea is speaking about Israel.

  * **Israel is a luxuriant vine that produces his fruit** - Israel is spoken of as a vine that was very fruitful. For a while the people prospered and were strong. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a luxuriant vine** - This vine produces more fruit than normal.
  * **As his fruit increased ... As his land produced more** - Both of these mean as the people prospered and grew stronger and richer.
  * **Their heart is deceitful** - "heart" refers to the inner person. "They are deceitful" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **now they must bear their guilt** - Here "guilt" is a metonym for the punishment that is associated with it. This punishment is spoken of as if it was a heavy load for them to carry. AT: "now is the time that Yahweh will punish them for their sins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
