===== Translation Notes: =====

Hosea is speaking about Israel.

  * **Beth Aven** - It means 'house of evil'. Hosea is showing them a contrast with Bethel 'house of God'. 
  * **Ephraim will be disgraced, and Israel will be ashamed for following the advice of idols** - This emphasizes that Israel (Ephraim) will face great shame because they have followed idols.
