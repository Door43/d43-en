\v 5 Those people of Samaria tremble with fear because of what happened to the calf idols at Beth Aven. 
\q2 Those people mourn over what happened to those idols,
\q1 as did the priests who served them;
\q2 they rejoiced over them and praised their splendor,
\q1 but now those idols have been taken away from them.
\q1
\v 6 Their idols will be carried to Assyria
\q2 to be a gift for the great king.
\q1 The people of Israel will be disgraced;
\q2 they will be ashamed
\q2 for having trusted in the advice they received by consulting idols.
