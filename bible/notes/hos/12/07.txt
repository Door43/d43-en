===== Translation Notes: =====

Hosea the prophet is speaking about Israel.

  * **false scales ** - They used scales to measure the weight of the money or products they were selling/buying. These scales were not accurate. 
  * **they love to defraud** - These merchants are eager to cheat their customers by lying to them. 
  * **I have certainly become very rich; I have found wealth for myself** - These two phrases mean essentially the same thing (UDB). (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
