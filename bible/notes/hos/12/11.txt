===== Translation Notes: =====

The prophet Hosea is speaking.

  * **their altars will be like heaps of stone in the furrows of the fields** - Many times altars were built out of stones. In this case, their piles of stones won't be altars but more of a hinderance for plowing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Jacob fled to the land of Aram; Israel worked in order to get a wife** - In this case, "Jacob" and "Israel" are referring to a person and the same person. Jacob received a name change later in his life.
