===== Part 1: General Introduction =====

=== Outline of the Book of 1 John ===

=== What is the Book of 1 John about? ===

John wrote this letter to all Christians at a time when the church was having trouble from a group of people called “Gnostics.”  These people believed that Jesus was completely God but that he was not really a human with a body of flesh and blood while on earth.  For this reason John writes about being an eyewitness to the life of Jesus and that his own hands touched Jesus (1:1-3).  John’s purpose in writing this letter was to make his joy complete (1 John 1:4), to prevent believers from sinning (1 John 2:1), to protect believers from false teaching (1 John 2:26), and to assure believers that they are saved (5:13).

=== Who wrote the Book of 1 John? ===

The letter of 1 John was written by the Apostle John between 50 and 100 years after the birth of Christ.  John does not identify himself as the author, but the first chapter shows that he is an eyewitness to the life and resurrection of Jesus (1:1-3).  The writing style in 1 John also closely resembles the writing style found in The Gospel according to John.  It is believed that John wrote The Gospel according to John and the three letters 1 John, 2 John, and 3 John while living in Ephesus.
