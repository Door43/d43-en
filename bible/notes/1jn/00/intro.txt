=== What is the Book of 1 John about? ===

John wrote this letter to Christians at a time when the church was having trouble with people who denied the basic doctrines of the Christian faith. John's purpose in writing this letter was to prevent believers from sinning, to protect believers from false teaching, and to assure believers that they are saved. This, John explains, would "make his joy complete." (See: [[:en:obe:kt:faith]])

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "1 John" or "First John." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as "The First Letter from John," or "The First Letter John wrote." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])

=== Who wrote the Book of 1 John? ===

The letter of 1 John was written by the Apostle John, probably near the end of his life. John does not identify himself as the author, but the first chapter shows that he was an eyewitness to the life and resurrection of Jesus. 

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== Who were the people that John spoke against? ===

It is possible that the people John spoke against were those who would eventually become known as Gnostics. These people believed that Jesus was God, but that he was not really a human with a physical body on earth. The reason for their belief was was their view that the physical world was evil. John writes this letter to assure his readers that he was a true eyewitness to the life of Jesus. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:evil]])

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== Why are the many references in 1 John to "remaining" and "reside" important? ===

This language often expresses the idea of people residing somewhere, or often of something existing in a certain place. Jesus' words are said to "remain" in Christians; Christians are said to "remain" in Christ and in God, and also in Jesus' love. The Father is said to "remain" in the Son, and the Son is said to remain in the Father and also in the believers. The Holy Spirit is also said to "remain" in the believers. 

Many translators will find it impossible to represent these ideas in their languages in exactly the same way. For example, John intends to express the idea of the Christian being spiritually together with Jesus. See, for example, "He who says he remains in God" (1 John 2:6) often must be expressed in a different manner. The UDB says, "If we say that we are in union with God," but translators will often have to find other expressions that communicate well. 

In the passage, "the word of God remains in you" (1 John 2:13), the UDB expresses this idea as, "you continue to obey what God commands." Many translators will find it possible to use this translation as a model.

=== What are the major issues in the text of the Book of 1 John? ===

The following are the most significant textual issues in the Book of 1 John:

  * "And we are writing these things so that our joy may be complete." (1:4) The ULB, UDB, and most modern versions have this reading. Some older versions have, "And we are writing these things to you so that your joy may be complete."
  * "And you all know the truth." (2:20) The ULB, UDB, and most modern versions have either this reading or the following reading: "And you all have knowledge." Some older versions have, "and you know all things."
  * "and this is what we are!" (3:1). The ULB, UDB, and most modern versions have this reading. Some older manuscripts omit this phrase.
  * "and every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not of God." (4:3) The ULB, UDB, and most modern versions have this reading. Some older manuscripts read, "and every spirit that does not acknowledge that Jesus has come in the flesh is not of God."
  * "For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one. And there are three that bear witness on earth: the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three are as one." (5:7-8). The ULB, UDB, and most other versions do not have this reading. Translators are advised not to translate this material. However, if older Bible versions exist in their region have it, it is not wrong to translate it. If it is translated, it should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that it is not original to the Book of 1 John.
