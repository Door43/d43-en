  * **that which we have seen and heard we declare to you also** - "We declare to you also what we have seen and heard"
  * **we...us...our** - These pronouns refer to John and those who saw Jesus' alive and are now teaching people about it. (See [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **you** - The word "you" is plural and refers to the people John was writing to. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father**- The word fellowship here is referring to a close friendship. These clauses could be translated "be our close friends and we are friends with God the Father"
  * **our fellowship** - It is not clear if John is including or excluding his readers. You may translate this either way.
  * **Christ** - The word Christ is a title, not a name and it means "the chosen one". Here it is referring to God choosing Jesus to be our savior.
  * **our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ** - To fellowship with God the Father we must come to him through the Son of God, Jesus Christ. Keep the words"Father""Son" in your language in the translation to accurately translate God's words.
