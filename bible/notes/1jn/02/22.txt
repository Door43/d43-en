\v 23 Those who refuse to acknowledge\f + \ft Or: admit \f* that \add Jesus is God's\add* Son do not have a relationship with the Father.

\v 22 The worst liars are the ones who deny that Jesus is the Christ. All who do this are against Christ, because they refuse to believe in the Father and the Son.
\v 23 Those who refuse to acknowledge that Jesus is God's Son are in no way joined with the Father, but those who acknowledge that Christ is the Son of God are also joined with Father.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This person is the antichrist, since he denies the Father and the Son.
\v 23 Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father; he who acknowledges the Son has the Father also.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ?**  - John used a rhetorical question to emphasize who the liars are. It could be translated as a question with an answer: "Who is the liar? It is anyone who denies that Jesus is the Christ." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **denies that Jesus is the Christ** - "refuses to say that Jesus is the Christ" or "says that Jesus is not the Christ"
  * **denies the Father and the Son** - This can be translated as "refuses to say the truth about the Father and the Son" or "rejects the Father and the Son."
  * **does not have the Father** - "does not belong to the Father"
  * **confesses the Son** - "speaks the truth about the Son"
  * **has the Father** - "belongs to the Father"
