===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 22 The worst liars are the ones who deny that Jesus is the Christ. All who do this are against Christ, because they refuse to believe in the Father and the Son. \v 23 Those who refuse to acknowledge that Jesus is God's Son are in no way joined with the Father, but those who acknowledge that Christ is the Son of God are also joined to with Father. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 22 Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This person is the antichrist, since he denies the Father and the Son. \v 23 Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father; he who confesses the Son has the Father also. </usfm>
