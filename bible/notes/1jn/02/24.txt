===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **As for you**  - In 2:24-26 the word "you" is plural and refers to the people John is writing to. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **let that which you have heard from the beginning remain in you**  - "remember and believe what you have heard from the beginning." How they heard it, what they heard, and what "the beginning" means can be made explicit: "continue to trust what we have taught you about Jesus just as you have trusted since you first became believers." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]])
  * **that which you have heard from the beginning**  - This can be translated as "what we taught you about Jesus when you first became believers."
  * **If that which you heard from the beginning remains in you**  - "If you continue to trust what we taught you"
  * **also remain in the Son and in the Father**  - See how this was translated in [[:en:bible:notes:1jn:02:04|2:5-6]]
  * **And this is the promise which he promised us; eternal life**  - "And this is what he promised to give us; eternal life" or "And he has promised to cause us to live forever."
  * **he promised us**  - Here the word "he" is emphatic and refers to Christ. The word "us" refers to John and all believers, including those he was writing to. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive|Inclusive]])
  * **would lead you astray**  - "would try to make you believe a lie" or "want to draw you away from God and His truth"
