  * **As for you**  - In 2:24-26 the word "you" is plural and refers to the people John is writing to.  (See: [[en:ta:translate:formsofyou-plural]])
  * **let that which you have heard from the beginning remain in you** - "remember and believe what you have heard from the beginning." How they heard it, what they heard, and what "the beginning" means can be made explicit: “continue to trust what we have taught you about Jesus just as you have trusted since you first became believers.”  (See: [[en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit]])
  * **that which you have heard from the beginning** - This can be translated as "what we taught you about Jesus when you first became believers."
  * **If that which you heard from the beginning remains in you** - "If you continue to trust what we taught you"
  * **also remain in the Son and in the Father** - See how this was translated in [[en:bible:notes:1jn:02:04|2:5-6]]
  * **And this is the promise which he promised us; eternal life** - "And this is what he promised to give us; eternal life" or "And he has promised to cause us to live forever."
  * **he promised us** - Here the word "he" is emphatic and refers to Christ. The word "us" refers to John and all believers, including those he was writing to. (See: [[en:ta:translate:inclusive]])
