===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - John reminds believers to continue in what they had first heard.
  * **General Information:** - Here the word "you" is plural and refers to the people to whom John wrote as well as all believers. The word "he" is emphatic and refers to Christ. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **As for you** - This marks John's telling them how they should live as followers of Jesus instead of how those against Christ live. 
  * **let what you have heard from the beginning remain in you** - "remember and believe what you have heard from the beginning." How they heard it, what they heard, and what "the beginning" means can be made explicit: AT: "continue to trust what we have taught you about Jesus just as you have trusted since you first became believers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **what you have heard from the beginning** - "what we taught you about Jesus when you first became believers"
  * **If what you heard from the beginning remains in you** - The word "remains is talking about relationship, not salvation. "If you continue to trust what we first taught you"
  * **also remain in the Son and in the Father** - "also have a relationship with the Son and with the Father." See how this was translated in [[:en:bible:notes:1jn:02:04|2:5-6]].
  * **This is the promise he gave to us: eternal life** - "This is what he promised to give us - eternal life" or "He has promised to cause us to live forever"
  * **life** - The word "life" throughout this letter refers to more than physical life. It stands here for Jesus, the eternal life. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:1jn:01:01|1:1-2]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **would lead you astray** - "want to draw you away."  There are those who would try to draw believers away from God.  AT: "want to draw you away from God and His truth" "would try to make you believe a lie" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **lead you astray** - Persuading someone to disobey God is spoken of as if it were leading someone off the right path to follow. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
