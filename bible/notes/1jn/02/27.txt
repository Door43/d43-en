\v 27 As for you, God's Spirit, whom you received from Christ, remains in you. So you do not need anyone else to be your teacher. God's Spirit is teaching you everything that you need to know. He always teaches the truth and never says anything that is false. So continue to live in the way that he has taught you, and remain joined with him.



\p
\v 28 Now, my dear ones, I urge you to continue to remain joined with Christ. We need to do that in order that we may be confident that he will accept us when he comes back again. If we do that, we will not be ashamed when we stand before him when he comes.
\v 29 Since you know that Christ always does what is right, you know that all those who continue doing what is right are the ones who have become God's children.

\v 27 And as for you, the anointing that you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, remain in him.
\p
\v 28 And now, little children, remain in him, so that when he appears, we may have boldness and not be ashamed before him at his coming.
\v 29 If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who practices righteousness is born of him.
