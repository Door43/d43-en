\v 15 Do not desire \add to conduct you lives in the evil manner in which\add* godless \add people in\add* the world \f + \ft metonymy \f* conduct their \add lives\add*, and do not love anything that \add the evil people\add* in the world \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add consider to be good\add*. Those who desire\add to conduct their lives in the evil manner in which other people of\add* the world \f + \ft metonymy \f* conduct their \add lives\add* do not \add really\add* love \add God\add*, their Father, \add at all\add*.
\v 16 Keep in mind that all \add the evil human desires\add* in the world \add are actions\f + \ft Or: things \f* such as these\add*: \add People\add* desire to do \add what\add* their self-directed nature \add strongly desires\add*. \add People\add* desire \add to possess\add* whatever appeals to their senses\f + \ft Or: they see or hear about \f*. \add People\add* boast about the material things that they possess. \add Such evil ways of living\add* do not originate\f + \ft Or: come \f* from the Father! Instead they originate, Or: come from \add the godless people in\add* the world\f + \ft Or: people in the world who conduct their lives in a manner that displeases God \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f*!
\v 17 The \add godless people in\add* the world \f + \ft metonymy \f*, along with what they desire, will disappear, but those who do what God wants \add them to do\add* will live forever!

\v 15 Do not behave like the people in the world who do not honor God. Do not desire the things they want to have. If anyone lives like they live, they are proving they do not love God our Father.
\v 16 I am writing this, because all the wrong things that people do, all the things that people see and try to obtain for themselves, and all the things that they boast about—all these things have nothing to do with our Father in heaven. They belong to the world.
\v 17 The people in the world who do not honor God, along with everything that they desire, will disappear. But those who do what God wants them to do will live forever!

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 Do not love the world nor the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
\v 16 For everything that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the arrogance of life—is not from the Father but is from the world.
\v 17 The world and its desire are passing away. But whoever does the will of God will remain forever.
