===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **But you have an anointing from the Holy One**  - "But the Holy One has anointed you." In the Old Testament "anointing" refers to pouring oil on a person to set him apart to serve God. Here "anointing" refers to Jesus giving the Holy Spirit to believers to set them apart to serve God. This could be translated as "But Jesus Christ, the Holy One, has given you his Spirit." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
  * **you know all things**  - The phrase "all things" is a hyperbole which could be translated as "and he has taught you what is the truth and what is a lie." ([[en:ta:translate:hyperbole]])
  * **no lie is of the truth** - "no lie comes from the truth." The phrase "the truth" may refer to God, the one who is full of truth. This could also be translated as "No lie comes from the true one."
