<usfm>
\v 9 Those who claim that they are \add pure in every way, like people\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* living in the light, but hate any of their fellow believers, are still \add behaving in an impure manner, like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add people who are continually living\add* in darkness.
\v 10 But those who love their fellow believers \add are continuing to conduct their lives like people\add* who are living in the light. They are people who please \add God\add* \f + \ft litotes \f*\add . So you should love your fellow believers\add*.
\v 11 But those who hate any of their fellow believers are still \add conducting their lives in an impure way, like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add people who are living\add* in darkness. They do not know that they will eventually destroy themselves \add eternally\add*. They have become \add spiritually\add* blind \f + \ft personification, metaphor \f*, \add unaware of spiritual truth\add*.

\v 9 Those who claim that they are like people who live in the light, but who hate any of their fellow believers, are still like people who live in darkness.
\v 10 But those who love their fellow believers behave  like people who are living in the light; they have no reason to sin.
\v 11 Those who hate any of their fellow believers are still like people who are living in darkness, unaware of what is true about God.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 He who says he is in the light and hates his brother is in the darkness even now.
\v 10 He who loves his brother remains in the light and there is no occasion for stumbling in him.
\v 11 But he who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness; he does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **He who says** - "Anyone who says" or "Those who claim" (UDB). This does not refer to a specific person.
  * **he is in the light** -  This is a way of speaking about living right. When people do what is right, they can do it in the light, and not hide in the dark. This can be translated "he does what is is right" or "he is in the light doing what is right." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **is in the darkness** - This is a way of speaking about living sinfully. When people do what is wrong, they like to hide in the dark. This can be translated as "is in the darkness, doing what is evil."
  * **there is no occasion for stumbling in him** - "nothing will cause him to stumble." The word "stumbling" is a metaphor that means to fail spiritually or morally. This could be translated as  "nothing will cause him to sin" or "he will never fail to do what is pleasing to God."
  * **is in the darkness and walks in the darkness** - This same idea is said twice to bring attention to how evil it is to hate a fellow believer. AT: "is living in darkness" or "is living in the darkness of sin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **he does not know where he is going** - This is a metaphor that can be translated as "he does not even know he is doing what is evil."
  * **the darkness has blinded his eyes**  - "the darkness has made him unable to see."  This could be translated as "sin has made it impossible for him to understand the truth."
