\v 18 \add You who are very dear to me\add*, it is \add now\add* the final part \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add of this age\f + \ft Or:  \f*\add*the final \add period of time before Jesus returns\add*. Just like you heard \add from us apostles\add* that a person who opposes Christ will come\f + \ft Or: appear \f*, even now there are many people who oppose Christ. That is why we know that it is the final part \add of this age\add* \f + \ft Or: \add before Jesus returns\add* \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 19 The \add people who oppose Christ\add* refused to remain in our congregations, but they never \add really\add* belonged with us\f + \ft Or: were fellow believers \f*. If they had belonged with us\f + \ft Or: been fellow believers \f*, they would have remained with us. But because \add they left, everyone\add* can clearly know that none of them belongs with us\f + \ft Or: is a fellow believer \f*.

\v 18 You who are very dear to me, it is now just before Jesus returns to earth. You have already heard that the person who will pretend to be Christ is coming; actually, many such persons have already arrivedâ€”but they are all against Christ. Because of this, we know that Christ will return very soon.
\v 19 These  people refused to remain in our congregations, but they never really belonged with us in the first place. When they left us, we clearly saw that they had never joined with us.

\v 18 Little children, it is the last hour. Just as you heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come, by which we know that it is the last hour.
\v 19 They went out from us, but they were not of us. For if they had been of us, they would have continued with us; but they went out in order that they might be shown that they are not of us.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Little children**  - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:1jn:02:01|2:1]].
  * **it is the last hour**  - The phrase "the last hour" refers to the time just before Jesus returns to the earth and judges all people. This can be translated as "Jesus will return soon." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **by which we know** - This can be translated as "and because of this we know" or "and because many antichrists have come, we know."
  * **many antichrists have come** - "there are many people who are against Christ."
  * **They went out from us** - "They left us" 
  * **but they were not of us** - "But they did not really belong to us anyway" or "they were not really part of our group in the first place." The reason they were not really part of the group is that they were not believers in Jesus.
  * **For if they had been of us, they would have continued with us** - This could be translated as "Because, if they were really believers they would not have left us."
  * **they went out in order that they might be shown that they are not of us** - This can be stated with an active clause: "they left us so that God could show us they were never really believers." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
