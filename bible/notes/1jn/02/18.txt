\v 18 \add You who are very dear to me\add*, it is \add now\add* the final part \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add of this age\f + \ft Or:  \f*\add*the final \add period of time before Jesus returns\add*. Just like you heard \add from us apostles\add* that a person who opposes Christ will come\f + \ft Or: appear \f*, even now there are many people who oppose Christ. That is why we know that it is the final part \add of this age\add* \f + \ft Or: \add before Jesus returns\add* \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 19 The \add people who oppose Christ\add* refused to remain in our congregations, but they never \add really\add* belonged with us\f + \ft Or: were fellow believers \f*. If they had belonged with us\f + \ft Or: been fellow believers \f*, they would have remained with us. But because \add they left, everyone\add* can clearly know that none of them belongs with us\f + \ft Or: is a fellow believer \f*.

\v 19 They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they all are not of us.
