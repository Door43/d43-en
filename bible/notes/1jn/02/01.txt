\v 1 Children, I am writing these things to you so that you will not sin. But if anyone sins, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, the one who is righteous.
\v 2 He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.
\v 3 By this we know that we know him: if we keep his commandments.
