<usfm> \v 4 Those who say, "We know God," and do not obey what God commands us to do, are liars. They are not conducting their lives according to God's true message. \v 5 But those who obey what God commands them to do are the people who love God in every way. This is how we can be sure that we are joined with God. \v 6 If we say that we are living as God wants us to, we should conduct our lives as Christ did.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 4 He who says, "I know God," but does not keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. \v 5 But whoever keeps his word, truly in that person the love of God has been perfected. By this we know that we are in him. \v 6 He who says he remains in God ought himself also to walk even as Jesus Christ walked. </usfm>
