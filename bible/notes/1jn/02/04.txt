\v 4 Those who say, "We know\f + \ft Or: I have a close relationship with \f* God," and do not obey what \add God\add* commands \add us to do\add*, are liars. They are not conducting their lives according to \add God's\add* true message.
\v 5 But those who obey what \add God\add* commands them to do are the people who love God in the manner in which he wants us to. \add I will tell you\add* how we can be sure that we have a close relationship with God:
\v 6 If we say that we are living as God wants us to, we should \add conduct our lives\add* as Christ \add did\add*.

\v 4 Those who say, "We know God," and do not obey what God commands us to do, are liars. They are not conducting their lives according to God's true message.
\v 5 But those who obey what God commands them to do are the people who love God in every way. This is how we can be sure that we are joined with God.
\v 6 If we say that we are in union with God, we should conduct our lives as Christ did.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 The one who says, "I know God," but does not keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
\v 5 But whoever keeps his word, truly, in him truly the love of God has been perfected. By this we know that we are in him:
\v 6 whoever says that he remains in God should himself also walk just as he walked.
