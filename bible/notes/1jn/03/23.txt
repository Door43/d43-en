===== translationNotes: =====

  * **This is his commandment: That we should believe ... just as he gave us this commandment** - The abstract noun "commandment" can be stated as "command." AT: "This is what God commands us to do: Believe ... just as he commanded us to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Son** - This is an important title for Jesus, the Son of God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **remains in him, and God remains in him** - The close union of believers is expressed by the terms "remains in him." See how "remains in God" was translated in [[:en:bible:notes:1jn:02:04|2:5-6]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
