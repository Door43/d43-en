===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **this is his commandment**  - This could be translated "this is what God wants us to do."
  * **remains in him, and God in him**  - See how this was translated in [[:en:bible:notes:1jn:02:04|2:5-6]].
  * **for love is of God** - “ This can be translated “because God causes us to love each other”
  * ** born of God ** - This is a metaphor which means has a relationship to God like a child to his father (See:  [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * ** and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God.** - This can be translated  “because those who love their fellow believers have become God's children and know him.” (UDB)
  * **He who loves not knows not God, for God is love** - This can be translated “God's nature is to love all people. Those who do not love their fellow believers do not know God because the character of God is to love people.”
