\v 19 By this we know that we are of the truth and assure our heart before him.
\v 20 Because if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.
\v 21 Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence toward God.
\v 22 And whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight.
