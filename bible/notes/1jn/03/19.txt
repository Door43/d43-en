\v 19 If we truly love our fellow believers, we can be sure that we are living according to the true message about Christ. As a result, we will not feel guilty in the presence of God.
\v 20 We can pray confidently, because although we might feel guilty because we have done wrong, God deserves for us to trust him. He knows everything about us.
\v 21 Dear friends, if our minds do not accuse us of having sinned, then we can pray confidently to God.
\v 22 When we confidently pray to him and request something from him, we receive it because we do what he commands us to do, and because we do what pleases him.

\v 19 It is by this we know that we are from the truth, and we assure our hearts before him.
\v 20 For if our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our hearts, and he knows all things.
\v 21 Beloved, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence toward God.
\v 22 Whatever we ask we will receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing before him.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Here John probably means that believers' ability to love God and each other sincerely (See: [[:en:bible:notes:1jn:03:16|verse 18]]) is a sign that their new life has indeed originated from the truth about Christ.

  * **we are from the truth** - "we belong to the truth" or AT: "we are living according the way Jesus taught us"
  * **we assure our hearts** - The word "heart" here refers to feelings. AT: "we do not feel guilty" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **if our hearts condemn us** - This is a metaphor. AT: "if we know that we have sinned and as a result feel guilty" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **God is greater than our hearts** - God knows more than a person and judges better. The effect of this truth is probably that God is more merciful than our consciences would suppose. This quality of God is expressed by the term "greater." AT: "God knows more than we do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **Beloved** - "You people whom I love" or "Dear friends." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:1jn:02:07|2:7]].
  * **do the things that are pleasing before him** - God's opinion is spoken of as if it depends on what he sees happen in front of himself. AT: "we do what pleases him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
