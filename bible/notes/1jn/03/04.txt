\v 5 You know that Christ came in order to completely remove \add the guilt of\add* our sins. You know also that he never sinned.
\v 6 Those who continue \add doing what\add* Christ wants them to, do not continue sinning repeatedly. But those who repeatedly sin have not understood \add who Christ is\add*, nor have they had a close relationship with him.

<usfm>
\v 4 Everyone who commits sin does lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness.
\v 5 You know that Christ was revealed in order to take away sins, and in him there is no sin.
\v 6 Whoever remains in him does not sin. Whoever sins has neither seen him nor known him.

  * **commits sin**  - "continues to sin" (UDB)
  * **does lawlessness**  - "is refusing to obey God's law" (UDB)
  * **You**  - Here "you" is plural and refers to the people John is writing to. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **Christ was revealed**  - This can be translated with an active verb: "Christ appeared" or "the Father revealed Christ." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **remains in him**  - See how this was translated in [[:en:bible:notes:1jn:02:04|2:5-6]]
  * **has neither seen him or known him** - John uses the words "seen" and "known" to emphasize that the person who keeps on sinning has never met Christ in a spiritual sense. AT: "has never truly believed in him" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
