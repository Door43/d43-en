====== 1 John 03:4-6 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 But everyone who continues sinning is refusing to obey \add God's\add* laws, because that is what sin is, refusing to obey \add God's\add* laws.
\v 5 You know that Christ came in order to completely remove \add the guilt of\add* our sins. You know also that he never sinned.
\v 6 Those who continue \add doing what\add* Christ wants them to, do not continue sinning repeatedly. But those who repeatedly sin have not understood \add who Christ is\add*, nor have they had a close relationship with him.

<usfm>
\v 4 Everyone who sins is committing acts of lawlessness, for sin is lawlessness.
\v 5 You know that Christ was revealed in order to take away sins, and in him there is no sin.
\v 6 No one who remains in him will keep on sinning. No one who continues to sin has seen him or known him.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Christ was revealed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Christ appeared" or "the Father revealed Christ" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **remains in him** - "has a relationship with God." See how this was translated in [[:en:bible:notes:1jn:02:04|2:5-6]].
  * **No one ... has seen him or known him** - John uses the words "seen" and "known" to say that the person who sins has never met Christ in a spiritual sense. A person behaving according to his sinful nature cannot know Christ. AT: "No one ... has ever truly believed in him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
