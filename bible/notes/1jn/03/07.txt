\v 8 But if anyone continues to sin repeatedly, he is like the devil, because the devil has always been sinning since the world  began. And the reason why God's Son became a human being was to destroy what the devil has done.

\v 7 Little children, let no one lead you astray. He who does righteousness is righteous, just as Christ is righteous.
\v 8 He who does sin is of the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this reason the Son of God was revealed, so that he might destroy the works of the devil.
