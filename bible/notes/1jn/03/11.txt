===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 11 The message that you heard when you first believed in Christ is that we should love each other. \v 12 We should not hate others as did Adam's son, Cain, who belonged to Satan, the evil one. Because Cain hated his younger brother, he murdered him. I will tell you about why he murdered his brother. It was because Cain habitually behaved in an evil way, and he hated his younger brother because his younger brother behaved in the right way. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 11 For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another, \v 12 not as Cain who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he kill him? Because his works were evil, and his brother’s righteous. </usfm>
