\v 16 The way that we now know \add how to truly\add* love \add our fellow believers is by remembering\add* that Christ voluntarily died\f + \ft Or: gave his life \f* for us. So, \add when any of\add* our fellow believers \add need something, we should be willing to help them. We should even be willing to\add* die for them.
\v 17 Many \add of us\add* have the things that are necessary for us to live in this world. If we become aware that any of our fellow believers do not have what they need and \add if we\add* refuse to \add provide for them\f + \ft Or: give to them what they need\add* \f*, it is clear that we do not love God \add as we claim, Or: say that we do\add*.
\v 18 \add I say to\add* you whom I love dearly, let us not merely say \f + \ft metonymy \f* that \add we love our fellow believers!\add* Let us genuinely\f + \ft Or: really \f* love them by doing things \add to help them!\add*

\v 16 The way that we now know how to truly love our fellow believers is by remembering that Christ died for us of his own free will. So in the same way, we should do anything for our fellow believers, even die for them.
\v 17 Many of us have the things that are necessary for us to live in this world. If we become aware that any of our fellow believers do not have what they need and if we refuse to provide for them, it is clear that we do not love God as we claim to do.
\v 18 I say to you whom I love dearly, let us not merely say we love each other; let us love each other by helping each other!

\v 16 By this we know love, because Christ laid down his life for us. We also ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.
\v 17 But whoever has the world’s goods, sees his brother in need, and shuts up his heart of compassion from him, how does the love of God remain in him?
\v 18 My dear children, let us not love in word nor in tongue, but in deed and truth.
