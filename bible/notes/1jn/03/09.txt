\v 9 People do not continue sinning repeatedly if they have become children of God. They cannot continually sin because God has made them his children, and he has put into them what he himself is like.
\v 10 Those who are God's children are clearly different from those who are the devil's children. The way that we can know who are Satan's children is this: Those who do not do what is right are not God's children. And those who do not love their fellow believers are not God's children.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 Whoever has been born from God does not continue to sin because God's seed remains in him. He cannot continue to sin because he has been born of God.
\v 10 In this the children of God and children of the devil are revealed: whoever does not do what is righteous is not from God, neither is the one who does not love his brother.

  * **God's seed** - This speaks of the Holy Spirit, whom God gives to believers and who makes them able to resist sin and do what pleases God as if he were a physical seed that is planted in the earth and grows. This is sometimes referred to as the new nature. AT: "the Holy Spirit" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he has been born of God** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God has given him new spiritual life" or "he is a child of God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])

AT: "whoever does not do what is righteous is not from God; whoever does not love his brother is also not from God" or "those who do what is righteous are from God, and those who love their brothers are from God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **his brother** - Here "brother" means fellow Christians.
