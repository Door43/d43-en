\v 9 People do not continue sinning repeatedly if they have become children of God. They cannot continually sin because God has made them his children, and he has put into them what he himself is like.
\v 10 Those who are God's children are clearly different from those who are the devil's children. The way that we can know who are Satan's children is this: Those who do not do what is right are not God's children. And those who do not love their fellow believers are not God's children.

<usfm>
\v 9 Whoever has been born of God does not sin, because God's seed remains in him, and he cannot sin, because he has been born of God.
\v 10 In this the children of God and children of the devil are revealed. Whoever does not do righteousness is not of God, neither is he who does not love his brother.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Whoever has been born of God** - This can be translated with an active clause: "Whoever God has made his child." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **does not sin** - "cannot continually sin" (UDB)
  * **God's seed** - This compares a physical seed that is planted in the earth and grows to the Holy Spirit that God puts in believers which gives them power to resist sin and do what pleases God. This could be translated as "the Holy Spirit." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he has been born of God** - This can be translated as an active clause: "God has given him new spiritual life" or "he is a child of God."
  * **In this the children of God and children of the devil are revealed.** - This can be translated with an active sentence: "This is how we know the children of God and the children of the devil."
  * **Whoever does not do righteousness is not of God, neither is he who does not love his brother** - Here brother means fellow Christians. "Only those who do righteousness are of God, and only those who love their brothers are of God" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
