\v 9 People do not continue sinning repeatedly if they have become children of God. They cannot continually sin because God has made them his children, and he has put into them what he himself is like.
\v 10 Those who are God's children are clearly different from those who are the devil's children. The way that we can know who are Satan's children is this: Those who do not do what is right are not God's children. And those who do not love their fellow believers are not God's children.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 Whoever has been born from God does not sin because God's seed remains in him. He cannot continue to sin because he has been born from God.
\v 10 In this the children of God and children of the devil are revealed. Whoever does not do what is righteous is not from God; neither is the one who does not love his brother.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - For now John ends this section on the new birth and the new nature which cannot sin.

  * **Whoever has been born from God** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Whoever God has made his child" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **God's seed** - This speaks of the Holy Spirit, whom God gives to believers and who makes them able to resist sin and do what pleases God as if he were a physical seed that is planted in the earth and grows. This is sometimes referred to as the new nature. AT: "the Holy Spirit" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he has been born from God** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God has given him new spiritual life" or "he is a child of God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **In this the children of God and children of the devil are revealed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "This is how we know the children of God and the children of the devil" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Whoever does not do what is righteous is not from God; neither is the one who does not love his brother** - Here "brother" means fellow Christians. "Only those who do righteousness are from God, and only those who love their brothers are from God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
