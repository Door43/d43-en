<usfm>
\v 9 People do not continue sinning repeatedly if they have become children of God. They cannot continually sin because God has made them his children, and he has put into what he himself is like.
\v 10 Those who are God's children are clearly different from those who are the devil's children. The way that we can know who are Satan's children is this: Those who do not do what is right are not God's children. And those who do not love their fellow believers are not God's children.

\v 9 Whoever has been born of God does not sin, because God's seed remains in him, and he cannot sin, because he has been born of God.
\v 10 In this the children of God and children of the devil are revealed. Whoever does not do righteousness is not of God, neither is he who does not love his brother.
