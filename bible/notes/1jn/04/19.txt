\v 19 We love, because God first loved us.
\v 20 If someone says, "I love God" but hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen.
\v 21 And we have this commandment from him, that he who loves God must love his brother also.
