<usfm>
\v 19 We love \add God and our fellow believers\add* because God loved us first.
\v 20 \add So\add* those who say "I love God" but hate a fellow believer are lying. Those who do not love one of their fellow believers, whom they have seen, certainly cannot be loving God, whom they have not seen.
\v 21 Keep in mind that this is what God has commanded us: If we love him, we must also love our fellow believers.

\v 19 We love because God first loved us.
\v 20 If anyone says, "I love God" but hates his brother, he is a liar. For the one who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen.
\v 21 Also, this is the commandment we have from him: Whoever loves God must also love his own brother.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **hates his brother** - "hates a fellow believer" 
  * **the one who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen** - If two negative statements in a row are confusing, this can be translated differently. AT: "only he who loves his brother, whom he has seen, loves God, whom he has not seen" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
