<usfm>
\v 19 We love \add God and our fellow believers\add* because God loved us first.
\v 20 \add So\add* those who say "I love God" but hate a fellow believer are lying. Those who do not love one of their fellow believers, whom they have seen, certainly cannot be loving God, whom they have not seen.
\v 21 Keep in mind that this is what God has commanded us: If we love him, we must also love our fellow believers.

\v 19 We love, because God first loved us.
\v 20 If someone says, "I love God" but hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen.
\v 21 And we have this commandment from him, that he who loves God must love his brother also.
