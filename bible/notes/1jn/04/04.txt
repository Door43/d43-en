\v 4 As for you who are very dear to me, you belong to God, and you have refused \add the false messages\add* that those people \add teach\add*, because \add God\add*, who enables you \add to do what he wants\add*, is greater\f + \ft Or: more powerful \f* than \add Satan\f + \ft Or: the devil\add* \f*, who enables godless people\f + \ft Or: people who conduct their lives in a way that displeases God \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 5 As for \add those who are teaching what is false\add*, they are godless people\f + \ft Or: people whose lives are displeasing to God \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. Because of that, they teach what godless people\f + \ft Or: people whose lives are displeasing to God \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f* want to hear. That is why the godless people\f + \ft Or: people whose lives displease God \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f* listen to them.
\v 6 As for us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add*, \add because\add* we belong to God, whoever knows\f + \ft Or: has a close relationship with \f* God listens to us. \add But\add* those who do not belong to God do not listen to us. That is how we can know whether \add the things that people are teaching\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* are true or whether they are false, and deceiving \add people\add*.

\v 4 As for you who are very dear to me, you belong to God, and you have refused to believe what those people teach, because God, who enables you to do what he wants, is greater.
\v 5 As for those who are teaching what is false, they belong with all the people in the world who refuse to honor God. That is why what they say comes from those same people, and those same people listen to them.
\v 6 As for us, we belong to God. Whoever knows God listens to what we teach, but whoever does not belong to God does not listen to what we teach. This is how we can distinguish between people who teach truth about God, and those who deceive others.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 You are from God, dear children, and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.
\v 5 They are from the world; therefore what they say is from the world, and the world listens to them.
\v 6 We are from God. Anyone who knows God listens to us. He who is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **dear children** - John was an elderly man and their leader. He used this expression to show his love for them. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:1jn:02:01|2:1]]. AT: "my dear children in Christ" or "you who are as dear to me as my own children" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **have overcome them** - "have not believed the false teachers"
  * **the one who is in you** - "God, who is in you"
  * **the one who is in the world** - Two possible meanings are that this refers to 1) Satan AT: "Satan, who is in the world" or "Satan, who works through those who do not obey God" or 2) worldly teachers ("They," verse 5). AT: "worldly teachers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metonym]])
  * **They are from the world** - The words "are from" are a metaphor for "receive their power and authority." "The world" is a metonym ultimately for "the one who is in the world," Satan, though it is also a metonym for sinful people who gladly listen to them and so also give them authority. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **therefore what they say is from the world** - "The world" is a metonym ultimately for "the one who is in the world," Satan, though it is also a metonym for sinful people who gladly listen to them and so also give them authority. AT: "therefore they teach what they have learned from sinful people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **and the world listens to them** - The words "the world" are a metonym for people who do not obey God. AT: "so the people who do not obey God listen to them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
