<usfm> \v 11 Dear friends, since God loves us like that, we certainly ought to love each other!

\p \v 12 No one has ever seen God. Nevertheless, if we love each other, it is clear that God lives within us and that we love others just like he intends us to do. \v 13 I will tell you how we can be sure that we are joined with God and that God is joined with us: He has put his Spirit within us. \v 14 We apostles have seen God's Son, and we solemnly tell others that the Father sent him to save the people in the world from suffering eternally for their sins. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. \v 12 No one has ever seen God. If we love one another, God remains in us, and his love is perfected in us. \v 13 By this we know that we remain in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit. \v 14 And we have seen and have borne witness that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world. </usfm>
