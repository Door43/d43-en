\v 1 Dear friends, many people \add who have a false message\add* are teaching it to people \f + \ft metonymy \f*. So do not trust every \add message that someone claims\f + \ft Or: says \f* that God's\add* Spirit \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add gave to him\add*. Instead, test\f + \ft Or: think carefully about \f* the teachings that \add you hear\add* in order to know whether they are from God or not.
\v 2 \add I will tell\add* you how to recognize \add teachings that come from\add* the Spirit of God: Those who affirm\f + \ft Or: say \f* that Jesus Christ came \add from God\add* to become a human \add like us\add* are \add teaching a message\add* that is from God.
\v 3 But those who do not affirm\f + \ft Or: say \f* \add that about\add* Jesus are not \add teaching a message\add* from God. \add They are teachers who\add* oppose Christ. You have heard that people like that are coming \add to be among us\add*. Even now they are already here!

\v 1 Dear friends, many people who have a false message are teaching it to people. But you must think carefully about what you hear them teach, so that you may know whether they are teaching the truth that comes from God or not.
\v 2 I will tell you how to know whether someone is teaching truth that comes from the Spirit of God. Those who affirm that Jesus Christ came from God to become a human like us are teaching a message that is from God.
\v 3 But those who do not affirm that truth about Jesus are not teaching a message from God. They are teachers who oppose Christ. You have heard that people like that are coming among us. Even now they are already here!

\v 1 Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are of God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
\v 2 By this you will know the Spirit of God—every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God,
\v 3 and every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not of God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming, and now is already in the world.
