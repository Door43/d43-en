<usfm>
\v 17 We \add should\add* love others completely. And if we do that, when the time comes for \add him to\add* judge us, we will be confident \add that he will not condemn us\add* (OR\add , that we have a close relationship with him\add*). \add We will be confident of that\add* because of our \add conducting our lives\add* in this world as Christ did.
\v 18 We will not be afraid \add of God\add* if we \add truly\add* love \add him\add*, because those who love \add God\add* completely cannot possibly be afraid \add of him\add*. \add We would be\add* afraid only \add if we thought that he would\add* punish us. So those who are afraid \add of God certainly\add* are not loving \add God\add* completely.

\v 17 We should love others completely. And if we do that, when the time comes for God to judge us, we will be confident that he will not condemn us. We will be confident of that because we are living in this world joined to God, as Christ himself is joined to God.
\v 18 We will not be afraid of God if we truly love him, because those who love God completely cannot possibly be afraid of him. We would be afraid only if we thought that he would punish us. So those who are afraid of God certainly are not loving God completely.

<usfm>
\v 17 Because of this, this love has been made perfect among us, so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment, because as he is, just so are we in this world.
\v 18 There is no fear in love. Instead, perfect love throws fear out, because fear has to do with punishment. But the one who fears has not been made perfect in love.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Because of this, this love has been made perfect among us, so that we will have confidence** - This can be stated in active form. Possible meanings are 1) "Because of this" refers back to [[:en:bible:notes:1jn:04:15|4:16]]. AT: "Because whoever lives in love is in God and God is in him, God has made his love for us complete, and so we may have complete confidence" or 2) "Because of this" refers to "we may have confidence." AT: "We are confident that God will accept us on the day he judges everyone, so we know he has made his love for us complete" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **love has been made perfect among us** - "this is how God has made his love for us complete"
  * **because as he is, just so are we in this world** - "because the relationship that Jesus has with God is the same relationship we have with God in this world"
  * **perfect love throws fear out** - Here "love" is described as a person with the power to remove fear. God's love is perfect. AT: "But when our love is complete, we are no longer afraid" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **because fear has to do with punishment** - "because we are afraid if we think God will punish us when he comes to judge everyone"
  * **But the one who fears has not been made perfect in love** - "When a person is afraid that God will punish him, that means his love is not complete"
