===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Whoever acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God** - "Those who say the truth about Jesus, that he is the Son of God." It is very important to acknowledge "that Jesus is the Son of God" by translating "Son of God" as clearly and literally as your language will allow.
  * **God remains in him, and he in God** - See how this was translated in [[:en:bible:notes:1jn:02:04|2:5-6]].
  * **God is love** - This is a metaphor which means "The character of God is love." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * ** and he who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him** - This can be translated "those who continue to love others have a close relationship with God, and God has a close relationship with them.")
