\v 9 I will tell you how God has shown us that he loves us: He sent his only Son to live on the earth to enable us to live eternally because of him.
\v 10 And God has shown us what it means to truly love another person: It does not mean that we loved God, but that God loved us. So he sent his Son to sacrifice himself, in order that he—God—may forgive us when we sin.

\v 9 In this the love of God was revealed among us, that God has sent his only begotten Son into the world that we might live through him.
\v 10 In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.
