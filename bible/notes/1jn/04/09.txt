\v 9 I will tell you how God has shown us that he loves us: He sent his only Son to live on the earth to enable us to live eternally because of him.
\v 10 And God has shown us what it means to truly love another person: It does not mean that we loved God, but it means that God loved us and sent his Son to sacrifice himself. Because of him, God forgives for sinning.
