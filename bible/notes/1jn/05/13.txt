\v 13 I have written this letter to you who believe that Jesus is the Son of God, in order that you may know that you will live forever.
\v 14 Because we are joined with him, we are very confident that he hears us when we ask him to do anything he approves of.

\v 13 These things I have written to you, that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe on the name of the Son of God.
\v 14 And this is the confidence which we have before him, that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.
\v 15 And if we know that he hears us concerning whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **These things** - "This letter"
  * **to you who believe on the name of the Son of God** - The word "name" refers to the Son of God. The name "Son of God" is the only name that gives a believer eternal life and forgiveness. The name "Son of God" must be translated clearly as it is found in the original language. AT: "to you who trust in the Son of God." (See [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **And this is the confidence which we have before him** - "And because we trust in the Son of God we can be sure of this"
  * **if we ask anything according to his will** - "if we ask for the things that the Son of God desires"
  * **we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him** - "we know that we will receive what we asked from him"
