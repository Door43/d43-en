===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **This is he who came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ** - "Jesus Christ is the one who came by water and blood."Here "water" refers to the baptism of Jesus. Also "blood" refers to Jesus' death on the cross. Alternate translation: "God showed that Jesus Christ is his son at Jesus' baptism and his death on the cross." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **not only by water, but by water and by blood** - This can be translated as a new sentence: "He came not by water only, but by water and by blood." Alternate translation: "God did not just show us Jesus was his son through his baptism, but through his baptism and his death on the cross."
