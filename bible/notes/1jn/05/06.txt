\v 6  Think about Jesus Christ. He is the one who came  to earth from God. God showed that he had truly sent Jesus when John baptized Jesus in water, but also when Jesus' blood flowed from his body when he died. And God's Spirit declares  truthfully that Jesus Christ came from God.
\v 7 These three things are like three people who are witnesses:
\v 8  God's Spirit, the water when John baptized Jesus, and  Jesus' blood that flowed from his body when he died on the cross. These three things all tell us the same thing, that Jesus came from God.

\v 6 This is he who came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ, not only by water, but by water and by blood.
\v 7- \v 8 \f + \ft Almost every ancient Greek manuscript does not include these verses. For this reason this section is not included in the text. \fqa For there are three who bear witness, the Spirit and the water and the blood, and the three agree in one." \f*

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **This is he who came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ** - "Jesus Christ is the one who came by water and blood."Here "water" refers to the baptism of Jesus. Also "blood" refers to Jesus' death on the cross. Alternate translation: "God showed that Jesus Christ is his son at Jesus' baptism and his death on the cross." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **not only by water, but by water and by blood** - This can be translated as a new sentence: "He came not by water only, but by water and by blood." Alternate translation: "God did not just show us Jesus was his son through his baptism, but through his baptism and his death on the cross."
  * **For there are three who bear witness** - "For there are three who testify about Jesus" 
  * **and the Spirit and the water and the blood** - Here, "water" and "blood" are described as a person who stands up in court and tells the people what he saw and heard. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **and the three agree in one** - "and the three agree with each other"
