\v 6  Think about Jesus Christ. He is the one who came  to earth from God. God showed that he had truly sent Jesus when John baptized Jesus in water, but also when Jesus' blood flowed from his body when he died. And God's Spirit declares  truthfully that Jesus Christ came from God.
\v 7 These three things are like three people who are witnesss--
\v 8  God's Spirit, the water when John baptized Jesus, and  Jesus' blood that flowed from his body when he died on the cross. These three things all tell us the same thing, that Jesus came from God.

\v 6 This is he who came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ, not only by water, but by water and by blood.
\v 7 For there are three who bear witness,  
\v 8 the Spirit and the water and the blood, and the three agree in one.

  * **For there are three who bear witness** - "For there are three who testify about Jesus" 
  * **and the Spirit and the water and the blood** - Here, "water" and "blood" are described as a person who stands up in court and tells the people what he saw and heard. (See: [[en:ta:translate:Personification]])
