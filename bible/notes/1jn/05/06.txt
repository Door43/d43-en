\v 6 Think about Jesus Christ. He is the one who came to earth from God. God showed that he had truly sent Jesus when John baptized Jesus in water, but also when Jesus' blood flowed from his body when he died. And God's Spirit declares truthfully that Jesus Christ came from God.
\v 7 These three are like three witnesses who give testimony:
\v 8 God's Spirit, the water and the blood. These three all tell us the same thing.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 This is the one who came by water and blood: Jesus Christ. He came not only by water, but by water and blood.
\v 7 For there are three who bear witness:
\v 8 the Spirit, the water, and the blood. These three are in agreement.
\f + \ft Some older versions read, \fqa For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit. These three are one; and there are three that bear witness on earth: the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three are as one. \fqa* However, the best copies do not have this reading. \f*

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - John teaches about Jesus Christ and what God said about him.

  * **This is the one who came by water and blood: Jesus Christ** - "Jesus Christ is the one who came by water and blood." Here "water" is probably a metonym for the baptism of Jesus, and "blood" stands for Jesus' death on the cross. AT: "God showed that Jesus Christ is his son at Jesus' baptism and his death on the cross" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **He came not only by water, but by water and blood** - Here "water" is probably a metonym for the baptism of Jesus, and "blood" stands for Jesus' death on the cross. AT: "God did not show us Jesus was his son just through his baptism, but through his baptism and his death on the cross" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
