\v 6  Think about Jesus Christ. He is the one who came  to earth from God. God showed that he had truly sent Jesus when John baptized Jesus in water, but also when Jesus' blood flowed from his body when he died. And God's Spirit declares  truthfully that Jesus Christ came from God.
\v 7 These three things are like three people who are witnesss--
\v 8  God's Spirit, the water when John baptized Jesus, and  Jesus' blood that flowed from his body when he died on the cross. These three things all tell us the same thing, that Jesus came from God.

\v 6 This is he who came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ, not only by water, but by water and by blood.
\v 7 For there are three who bear witness,  
\v 8 the Spirit and the water and the blood, and the three agree in one.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **This is he**  - "He" is a pronoun which refers to Jesus. (See: [[en:ta:translate:Pronoun]])
  * **came by water **- "Water" is a metonymy which refers to the baptism of Jesus. (See: [[en:ta:translate:Metonymy]])
  * **and the blood**- "Blood" is a metonymy which refers to the blood that Jesus shed on the cross. (See: [[en:ta:translate:Metonymy]])
  * **This is he who came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ** - This is a difficult verse to understand. John is saying that Jesus was the Christ, God’s son, both when he was baptized and when he died on the cross. This can be translated “Jesus Christ was sent from God and was the Christ when he was baptized and when he died on the cross.” 
  * **not only by water, but by water and by blood** - This can be translated “He was the Christ when he was baptized but also when he died.”
  * **three who bear witness…the three agree in one**  - "Water" and "blood" are personifications when  referring to the Spirit, water and blood. (See: [[en:ta:translate:Personification]])
