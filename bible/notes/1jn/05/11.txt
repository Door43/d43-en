===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **And the witness is this** - "This is what God says."  (UDB)
  * **this life is in his Son** - "We will live forever if we are joined with his Son" (UDB), or "We will live forever if we are united with his Son."
  * **He who has the Son has life** - This could be translated, "He who believes in Jesus has eternal life." Life and eternal life are tied to the Son of God and to the accurate translation of that title of Jesus.
