====== 1 John 05 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Christian living ==
There is a close connection in this chapter between a Christian's confession of faith in Jesus and the way they live their lives. Believing in Jesus requires one to live a godly life. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:faith|Faith]], [[:en:obe:kt:believe|believing]] and [[:en:obe:kt:godly|godly]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Death ==
John's usage of death in this chapter always references physical death. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:death|Death]])

== "The whole world lies under the control of the evil one" ==
Satan, the evil one, is the  ruler of this world but ultimately God is in control over everything. Scripture describes Satan as the "prince" of this world and God as the "king" of all of creation. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:satan|Satan]])
