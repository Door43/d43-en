\v 4 All of us whom God has caused to become his children have been able to refuse to do what unbelievers want us to do; we are stronger than everything that is against God. We are able to refuse to do wrong, because we trust in Christ.
\v 5 Who is the person who is stronger than everything that is against God? It is anyone who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.
