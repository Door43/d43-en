====== 1 John 05:16-17 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 Those who see one of their fellow believers sinning in a way that does not result in eternal separation from God should ask  \add God to help that fellow believer\add*; and  \add as a result God\add* will help that fellow believer and enable him or her to live  \add eternally. But some people\add* sin  \add in a manner that causes them\add* to be separated from God eternally. I am not saying that  \add you should\add* ask  \add God to help\add* people who sin like that.
\v 17 Everyone who does what is wrong is sinning, but there are some sins that do not cause a person to be separated from God eternally.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 Suppose you see one of our fellow believers sinning in a way that would not separate them from God,and when you see sinning, you should ask God and pray that God will give that person lifeâ€”that is, to that person who is not commiting a sin that would separate him from God. But there are some people who sin in a way that causes them to be separated from God forever. I am not saying you should ask God to help people who sin in that way.
\v 17 Everything that is wrong is a sin against God, but not every bad thing we do can separate us from God forever.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 If anyone sees his brother commit a sin that does not result in death, he must pray, and God will give him life. I refer to those whose sin does not result in death. There is a sin that results in death; I am not saying that he should pray about that.
\v 17 All unrighteousness is sin, but there is sin that does not result in death.
