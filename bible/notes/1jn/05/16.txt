\v 16 Those who see one of their fellow believers sinning in a way that does not result in eternal separation from God should ask  \add God to help that fellow believer\add*; and  \add as a result God\add* will help that fellow believer and enable him or her to live  \add eternally. But some people\add* sin  \add in a manner that causes them\add* to be separated from God eternally. I am not saying that  \add you should\add* ask  \add God to help\add* people who sin like that.
\v 17 Everyone who does what is wrong is sinning, but there are some sins that do not cause a person to be separated from God eternally.
