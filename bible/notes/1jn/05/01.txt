<usfm>
\v 1 All those who believe that Jesus is the Messiah\f + \ft Or: person God sent  \add to rescue us\add* \f* are ones who  \add have truly\add* become children of God. And everyone who loves  \add a man who is\add* someone's father will  \add be expected to\add* love that man's children as well. \add Similarly, those who love God, who has caused them to become his children\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add should love their fellow believers, whom God has also caused to become his children\add*.
\v 2 The way we can be sure that we  \add truly\add* love God's children is this: We are loving them when we love God and do what he commands  \add us to do\add*.
\v 3  \add I say this\add* because our obeying what God commands  \add us to do\add* is\add the same as\add* loving him. And it is not burdensome\f + \ft Or: difficult \f* for  \add us to do\add* what God commands  \add us to do\add*.

\v 1 All those who believe that Jesus is the Christ are  children of God, born from God. And whoever loves the Father certainly also loves the Father's children, our fellow believers.
\v 2 The way we can be sure that we truly love God's children is when we love God and do what he commands us to do.
\v 3  I say this because what loving God really means is that we do what he commands. And it is not difficult to do what he commands.

\v 1 Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God. And whoever loves him who became the father also loves him who was born of him.
\v 2 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and do his commandments.
\v 3 For this is love for God, that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome.
