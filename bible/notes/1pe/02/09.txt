\v 9 But you are people whom God has chosen to belong to him. You are a group that worship God like priests, and you rule with God like kings. You are a people group that belongs to God, so that you might proclaim the wonderful things he has done. He has called you from your former ways, when you were ignorant of his truth, and he has made you understand the marvelous true things about him.
\v 10 What the Scriptures say is true about you:
\q "Formerly, you were no people group at all,
\q But now you are God's people group.
\q At one time God had not acted mercifully toward you,
\q But now he has acted mercifully toward you."
