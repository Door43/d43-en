\v 24 He himself endured the punishment for our sins in his body when he died on the cross, in order that we would stop sinning and start living rightly.

  * **carried our sins in his body to the tree** - Here "carried our sins" means that he suffered the punishment for sins. AT: "suffered the punishment for our sins in his body on the tree" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the tree** - This is a reference to the cross on which Jesus died, which was made of wood. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
