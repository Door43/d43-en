===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Scripture says this** - This refers to the words that a person reads in Scripture. AT: "This is what a prophet wrote in the Scriptures long ago" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Behold** - The word "behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows. 
  * **a corner stone, chief and chosen and precious** - The words "chief" and "precious" describe the value of the "cornerstone." God is the one who chose the stone. AT: "a most important corner stone, which I have chosen" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **a corner stone** - The prophet speaks of the Messiah as the most important stone in a building. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
