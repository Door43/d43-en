===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Scripture says this** - AT: "This is what a prophet wrote in the Scriptures long ago" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Behold** - "I am telling you something important" or "Listen!" The word "behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows. Your language may have a way of doing this.  
  * **a corner stone, chief and chosen and precious** - The words "chief" and "precious" describe the value of the "cornerstone." AT: "a most important corner stone which I have chosen"
  * **a corner stone** - The prophet was writing about the Messiah who is Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
