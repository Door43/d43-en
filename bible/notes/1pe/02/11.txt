====== 1 Peter 02:11-12 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 You people whom I love, I urge you to consider that you are like foreigners \f + \ft metaphor, doublet \f* \add whose real home is in heaven\add*. As a result, avoid doing the things that your self-directed nature desires, because those desires fight against\f + \ft Or: always oppose \f* your souls.
\v 12 Keep conducting your lives in a good way among those who do not know God. \add If you do that\add*, although they may accuse you, saying that you are people who do what is evil, they will see your good behavior, and at the time when God comes \add to judge people\add*, they will give honor to him\f + \ft Or: say that what he does is right \f*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 You people whom I love, I urge you to think about this: You are like foreigners whose real home is in heaven. So you should not do the sinful things you used to want to do, because if you do them, you will not be able to live well with God.
\v 12 Keep behaving in a good way among those who do not know God. If you do that, although they may say that you do what is evil, they will see that you are doing good things, and at the time when God comes to judge everyone, they will honor him.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 11 Beloved, I call on you as foreigners and exiles to abstain from fleshly desires, which make war against your soul.
\v 12 You should have good behavior among the Gentiles, so that, if they speak about you as having done evil things, they may observe your good works and praise God on the day of his coming.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Peter begins to talk about how to live Christian lives.

  * **foreigners and exiles** - These two words mean basically the same thing. Peter speaks of his readers as people who are living in foreign lands away from their home.

  * **make war against your soul** - Here the word "soul" refers to a person's spiritual life. Peter speaks of sinful desires as soldiers that are trying to destroy the spiritual life of believers. AT: "seek to destroy your spiritual life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **You should have good behavior** - The abstract noun "behavior" can be translated with a verb. AT: "You should behave well" or "You should behave in a good way" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
