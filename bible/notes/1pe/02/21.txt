\v 21 For hereunto were you called: because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow his steps:
\v 22 who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:
\v 23 who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, threatened not; but committed himself to him that judges righteously:
