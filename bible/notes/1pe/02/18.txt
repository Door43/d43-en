\v 18 Servants, obey your masters with all respect, not only the good and gentle masters, but also to the mean ones
\v 19 because it is acceptable for a man to endure grief and suffering because of his conscience toward God.
\v 20 If you sin and are punished for it, it is no honor to receive your punishment with patience. But if you do good and are punished for it and you take the punishment with patience, this is the grace of God.
