\v 18 You slaves \add who are believers\add*, submit yourselves to your masters and completely respect them. Submit yourselves not only to those who \add act in a\add* good and kind \f + \ft doublet \f* way towards you, but also submit yourselves to those who \add act in a\add* harsh way \add towards you\add*.
\v 19 You should do that because God is pleased with those who, knowing that he is aware of what is happening to them, endure the pain that they suffer \add because of being treated unjustly by their masters\add* \f + \ft Or:\add their masters have treated them unjustly\add* \f*.
\v 20 God will certainly not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* be pleased with you if you do something that is wrong and as a result you are beaten \f + \ft Or:someone beats you \f*! But if, instead of doing wrong, you do what is good, and as a result of that, you suffer for doing what is good, and you endure that suffering, God will commend\f + \ft Or: be pleased with \f* you.

\v 18 You slaves who are believers, submit yourselves to your masters and completely respect them. Submit yourselves not only to those who act in a good and kind way toward you, but also submit yourselves to those who act in a harsh way toward you.
\v 19 You should do that because God is pleased with those who know what he wants and obey him, and who, for this reason, accept to suffer pain because their masters treat them unjustly.
\v 20 God will certainly not be pleased with you if you do something that is wrong and then they beat you for that. But if you do what is good and still suffer harm, you are suffering for doing what is good. If you endure that, God will praise you.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 18 Servants, be subject to your masters with all respect. Be subject not only to the good and gentle masters, but also to the malicious ones.
\v 19 For it is praiseworthy if anyone endures pain while suffering injustice because of his awareness of God.
\v 20 For how much credit is there if you sin and then endure while being punished? But if you have done good and then you suffer while being punished, this is worthy of praise from God.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Peter begins to speak specifically to people who are servants in people's houses. 

  * **the good and gentle masters** - Here the words "good" and "gentle" share similar meanings and emphasize that such masters treat their servants kindly. AT: "the very kind masters" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **the malicious ones** - "the cruel ones" or "the mean ones"
  * **it is praiseworthy** - "it is deserving of praise" or "it is pleasing to God"
  * **endures pain ... because of his awareness of God** - Possible meanings of the original passage are 1) that this person accepts suffering because he knows he is obeying God or 2) that this person is able to endure unjust punishment because he knows that God knows how he is suffering.
  * **For how much credit is there ... while being punished?** - Peter asks this question to emphasize that there is nothing praiseworthy about suffering for doing something wrong. AT: "For there is no credit ... while being punished." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **while being punished** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "while someone punishes you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
