\v 18 You slaves \add who are believers\add*, submit yourselves to your masters and completely respect them.

\v 18 You slaves who are believers, submit yourselves to your masters and completely respect them. Submit yourselves not only to those who act in a good and kind way towards you, but also submit yourselves to those who act in a harsh way towards you.
\v 19 You should do that because God is pleased with those who, knowing that he is aware of what is happening to them, endure the pain that they suffer because their masters have treated them unjustly.
\v 20 God will certainly not be pleased with you if you do something that is wrong and then they beat you for that. But ifou do what is good and still suffer harm, you are suffering for doing what is good. If you endure that, God will praise you.

<usfm>
\p
\v 18 Servants, be subject to your masters with all respect, not only the good and gentle masters, but also the malicious ones.
\v 19 For it is praiseworthy if anyone endures pain while suffering injustice because of his conscience toward God.
\v 20 For how much credit is there if you sin and then endure while being punished? But if you have done good and then you suffer being punished, this is praiseworthy with God.
