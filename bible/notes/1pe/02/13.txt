<usfm>
\v 13 Because you wish to honor the Lord Jesus, obey everyone who has proper authority. This includes the king, who has the greatest power,
\v 14 and governors, whom he sends to punish those who do what is wrong and to praise those who do what is right.
\v 15 What God wants is for you to do good. If you do that, you will cause foolish people who do not know God to be unable to say that you have done wrong.
\v 16 Behave as though you were free from having to obey any master, but do not think that you can do evil because of that. Instead, behave as servants of God should.
\v 17 Act respectfully toward everyone. Love all your fellow believers. Honor God, and honor the king.

\v 13 Obey every human authority for the Lord’s sake, whether the king as supreme,
\v 14 whether the governors who are sent to punish evil-doers and to praise those who do good.
\v 15 For such is God s will, that in doing good you silence the ignorant talk of foolish people.
\v 16 As free people, do not possess your freedom as a covering for wickedness, but be as servants of  God.
\v 17 Honor all people. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.
