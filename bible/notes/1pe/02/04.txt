\v 4 Come to the Lord Jesus. He is like the most  important stone in the foundation of a building, but he is living, not lifeless like a stone. Many people rejected him, but God chose him and considers him to be very valuable.
\v 5 And like men build houses with stones, God is joining you together like a building in which his Spirit lives. He is doing this in order that you—like the priests who offer sacrifices at the altar, might do things that please God because Jesus Christ has died for you.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 Come to him who is a living stone that has been rejected by people, but that has been chosen by God and is valuable to him.
\v 5 You also are like living stones that are being built up to be a spiritual house, in order to be a holy priesthood that offers the spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
