\v 7 Therefore, God will honor you who believe in Jesus. But those who refuse to believe in him are like the builders that the Scriptures talk about:
 "The stone that the builders rejected has become the most important stone in the building."
\p
\v 8 It is also written in the Scriptures: 
\q "He will be like a stone that causes people to stumble,
\q and like a rock that people trip over.
\p Just as people are injured when they stumble over a rock,
\q people who disobey God's message injure themselves;
\q that is what God determined would happen to them."

\p
\v 7 The honor then is for you who believe. But,
\q "the stone that was rejected by the builders,
\q this has become the head of the corner"—

\p
\v 8 and,
\q "a stone of stumbling
\q and a rock of stumbling."
\m
They stumble, disobeying the word, for which they were also appointed.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the stone that was rejected by the builders** - Peter is telling what a prophet wrote in the Scriptures long ago. The "stone" is the cornerstone which is the most important stone in the building. This refers to Jesus whom many people rejected. AT: "the stone that the builders rejected" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a stone of stumbling and a rock of stumbling.** - Peter is again telling what a prophet wrote long ago. These two phrases share similar meanings. Together they emphasize that people will take offense at this "stone" which refers to Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **disobeying the word** - AT: "disobeying God's commands" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **for which they were also appointed** - AT: "for which God appointed them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
