\q \add He will be like\add* a stone that causes people to stumble,

\v 7 Therefore, God will honor you who believe in Jesus. But those who refuse to believe in him are like the builders that the scriptures talk about:
 "The stone that the builders rejected has become the most important stone in the building."
\p
\v 8 It is also written in the scriptures: 
\q "He will be like a stone that causes people to stumble,
\q and like a rock that people trip over.
\p Just as people are injured when they stumble over a rock,
\q people who disobey God's message injure themselves;
\q that is what God determined would happen to them."

\p
\v 7 The honor then is for you who believe. But,
\q "the stone that was rejected by the builders,
\q this has become the head of the corner"—

\p
\v 8 and,
\q "a stone of stumbling
\q and a rock of stumbling."
\m
They stumble, disobeying the word, for which they were also destined.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Peter continues quoting from the scriptures.

  * **the stone that was rejected ... has become the head of the corner** - This is a metaphor that means people, like builders, rejected Jesus, but God has made him the most important stone in a building. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the stone that was rejected by the builders** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the stone that the builders rejected" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the head of the corner** - This refers to the most important stone in a building and means basically the same thing as "cornerstone" in [[:en:bible:notes:1pe:02:06|2:6]].
  * **a stone of stumbling and a rock of stumbling** - These two phrases share similar meanings. Together they emphasize that people will take offense at this "stone," which refers to Jesus. AT: "a stone or a rock over which people will stumble" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **disobeying the word** - Here "the word" refers to the gospel message. To disobey means that they do not believe. AT: "because they do not believe the message about Jesus" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **for which they were also destined** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "for which God also destined them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
