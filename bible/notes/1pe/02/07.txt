\v 7 Therefore, God will honor you who believe in Jesus. But those who refuse to believe in him are like the builders that this Scripture talks about,
\q The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.
\p
\v 8 And it is also written  in the Scriptures:
\q He will be like a stone that causes people to stumble,
\q and like a rock that people trip over.
\p Just as people are injured when they stumble over a rock,
\q people who disobey the message about Jesus are injured spiritually,
\q and that is what God determined would happen to them.

\p
\v 7 You who believe know the worth of this stone, but the builders who do not believe have rejected this same stone.  It has become both the head of the corner
\p
\v 8 and is also a stone of stumbling. It is a rock of offence to those who stumble at the word, to those who are disobedient. They were appointed to this.
