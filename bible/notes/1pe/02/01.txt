\v 1 Therefore, do not act maliciously in any way or deceive others. Do not be hypocrites, and do not envy others. Do not ever speak evil about anyone untruthfully.
\v 2 Just as newborn babies long for their mothers' pure milk, you should desire to learn true things from God, so that by learning it you may become like adults in trusting him. You must do this until the time when God sets you completely free from all the evil in this world.
\v 3 Also, you must do this because you have experienced that the Lord acts very kindly toward you.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Therefore put aside** - "So stop doing"
  * **As newborn infants, long for pure spiritual milk** - As new born babies long for their mother's breast milk, so newly spiritually born believers should yearn for God's word. God's word is also referred to as pure spiritual milk. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **As newborn infants** - When one is spiritually born, they need to read God's word to live and grow just like a new born baby need to drink milk to live and grow. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **long for** - "desire intensely" or "yearn for"
  * **you may grow in salvation** - "you may grow spiritually." The word "you" refers to the believers mentioned in chapter 1.
  * **if you have tasted that the Lord is kind** - "because you have experienced that the Lord acts very kindly toward you" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
