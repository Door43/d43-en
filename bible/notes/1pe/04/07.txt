===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The end of all things is coming** - "Soon God will change everything on earth."
  * **be of sound mind, and be sober in your thinking** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Peter uses them to emphasize the need to think clearly about life since the end is near. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **your thinking** - The word "your" refers to all believers
