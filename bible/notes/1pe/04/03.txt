\v 3  \add I say that to you\add* because \f + \ft sarcasm \f* you have already spent too much of your time  \add here on earth\add* doing what the people who do not know God like to do. In the past you committed all kinds of sexually immoral acts \f + \ft doublet \f*, you got drunk and then participated in orgies\f + \ft Or: wild parties \f* and carousing, Or: revelry, and you  \add worshipped\add* idols, which is very displeasing to God.
\v 4  \add Because you used to do those things\add*, \add your friends\add* are surprised that you do not join with them anymore when they participate in that kind of wild behavior  \add that\add* \add is rushing to\f + \ft Or: will quickly\add* \f* \add destroy them like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a flood. As a result, they speak evil about you.
\v 5 But  \add God\add* is ready to judge the people who are living  \add now\add* and the people who have died, and he is the one who will decide whether he approves of what they have done.
\v 6 That is the reason why the message  \add about Christ\add* was preached \f + \ft Or:\add people\add* preached the message  \add about Christ\add* \f* to believers who have now died. \add That message was preached to them\add* in order that even though  \add sinful\add* people might judge them  \add and say that they are guilty\add*, God's Spirit would  \add enable them to\add* live  \add eternally\add*.

\v 3 I say that to you because you have already spent too much of your time here on earth doing what the people who do not know God like to do. In the past you committed all kinds of sexually immoral acts, you got drunk and then participated in orgies and carousing, and you worshiped idols, which is disgusting to God.
\v 4 Now your friends are surprised that you do not join with them anymore when they do these things. As a result, they say bad things about you.
\v 5 But one day they will have to admit to God everything they have done. He is the one who will judge them.
\v 6 That is the reason why Christ preached the good news to the dead. He did that so that, although God had judged them when they were alive, they might by the power of the Holy Spirit live forever as God lives.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 You have spent enough time doing what the Gentiles want to do, living in sensuality, passion, drunkenness, drunken celebrations, having wild parties, and committing disgusting acts of idolatry.
\v 4 They think it is strange that you do not join with them in these floods of reckless behavior, so they speak evil about you.
\v 5 They will give an account to the one who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
\v 6 For this purpose the gospel was preached also to the dead, so that, although they have been judged in the flesh as humans, they may live in the spirit the way God does.
