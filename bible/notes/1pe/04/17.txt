\v 17 I say that, because it is now time for God to begin judging people, and first he will judge those who belong \f + \ft metonymy \f* to him. Since he will judge us believers first, think about the terrible things that will happen to \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* those who do not obey the good message that comes from him!
\v 18  \add That will be as it\add* is written in the Scriptures,
\q  \add Many\add* righteous people  \add will have to suffer\add* many  \add difficult trials before going to heaven\add*. 
\q So ungodly and sinful people will surely have to suffer  \add much severe punishment from God\add*!
\p
\v 19 Therefore, those who suffer because of its being God's will that they suffer  \add because of being Christians\add* should commit themselves to God, the one who created them and the one who always does what he promises to do. And they should continue to do what is right.

\v 17 I say this, because it is now time for God to begin judging people, and first he will judge those who belong to him. Since he will judge us believers first, think about the terrible things that will happen to those who do not obey the good news that comes from him!
\v 18  That will be as it is written in the Scriptures:
\q  "Many righteous people will have to suffer many difficult trials before going to heaven. 
\q So ungodly and sinful people will surely have to suffer much severe punishment from God!"
\p
\v 19 Therefore, those who suffer because God wishes it should trust God to keep them, God, the one who created them and the one who always does what he promises to do. And they should continue to do what is right.

<usfm>
\v 17 For it is time for judgment to begin with the household of God. And if it begins with us, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey God's gospel?
\v 18 And if 
\q the righteous man is saved through difficulties, 
\q what will become of the ungodly person and the sinner?
\m
\v 19 Therefore let those who suffer according to the will of God entrust their souls to the faithful Creator while they do good.
