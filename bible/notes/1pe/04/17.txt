\v 17 I say that, because it is now time for God to begin judging people, and first he will judge those who belong \f + \ft metonymy \f* to him. Since he will judge us believers first, think about the terrible things that will happen to \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* those who do not obey the good message that comes from him!
\v 18  \add That will be as it\add* is written in the Scriptures,
\q  \add Many\add* righteous people  \add will have to suffer\add* many  \add difficult trials before going to heaven\add*. 
\q So ungodly and sinful people will surely have to suffer  \add much severe punishment from God\add*!
\p
\v 19 Therefore, those who suffer because of its being God's will that they suffer  \add because of being Christians\add* should commit themselves to God, the one who created them and the one who always does what he promises to do. And they should continue to do what is right.

\v 17 I say this, because it is now time for God to begin judging people, and first he will judge those who belong to him. Since he will judge us believers first, think about the terrible things that will happen to those who do not obey the good news that comes from him!
\v 18 That will be as it is written in the scriptures:
\q "Many righteous people will have to suffer many difficult trials before going to heaven.
\q So ungodly and sinful people will surely have to suffer much severe punishment from God!"
\p
\v 19 Therefore, those who suffer because God wishes it should trust God to keep them, God, the one who created them and the one who always does what he promises to do. And they should continue to do what is right.

<usfm>
\v 17 For it is time for judgment to begin with the household of God. If it begins with us, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey God's gospel?
\v 18 And if
\q "the righteous man is scarcely saved,
\q how will the ungodly person and the sinner appear?"
\m
\v 19 Therefore let those who suffer because of God's will entrust their souls to the faithful Creator in well-doing.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **household of God** - This phrase refers to believers, whom Peter speaks of as God's family. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **If it begins with us, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey God's gospel?** - Peter use this question to emphasize that God's judgment will be more severe for people who reject the gospel than for believers. AT: "If it begins with us, the outcome for those who do not obey God's gospel will be much worse." (See [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **those who do not obey God's gospel** - "those who do not believe God's gospel." Here the word "obey" means to believe.
  * **the righteous man ... how will the ungodly person and the sinner appear?** - Peter use this question to emphasize that sinners will suffer much more than believers do. AT: "the righteous man ... the outcome will be much worse for those who do not obey God's gospel." (See [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the righteous man is scarcely saved** - Here the word "saved" refers to final salvation when Christ returns. The word "scarcely" refers to the difficulties associated with his salvation.

  * **the ungodly person and the sinner** - The words "ungodly person" and "sinner" mean basically the same thing and emphasize the wickedness of these people. AT: "ungodly sinners" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **entrust their souls** - Here the word "souls" refers to the whole person. AT: "entrust themselves" or "entrust their lives" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **in well-doing** - while they are habitually doing good things (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
