\v 2 As a result, during their remaining time here on earth, they do not do the things that sinful people desire to do, but instead they do the things that God wants them to do.

  * **in the flesh** - "in his body"
  * **arm yourselves with the same intention** - The phrase "arm yourselves" refer to soldiers who get their weapons and prepare for battle. Here it means for believers to be determined in their mind to suffer as Jesus did. AT: "prepare yourselves to do the same thing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **yourselves** - This refers to the believers in chapter one. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_rpronouns]])
