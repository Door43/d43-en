<usfm>
\v 1 Therefore, because Christ suffered in his body, you also must think the way that he did  \add when he was willing to suffer\add*, because those who suffer in their bodies  \add because of belonging to Jesus\add* have stopped sinning  \add the way they used to sin\add*.
\v 2 As a result, during their remaining time here on earth, they do not do the things that sinful people desire to do, but instead they do the things that God wants them to do.
