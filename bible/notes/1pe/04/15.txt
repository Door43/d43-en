====== 1 Peter 04:15-16 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 If you suffer, do not let that suffering be the result of your being a murderer or a thief or as a result of doing some other evil deed, or as a result of interfering in someone else's affairs.
\v 16 But if you suffer because of being a Christian, do not be ashamed about it. Instead, praise God that you are suffering because of belonging to Christ \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 If you suffer, do not let it be because you murdered anyone, or stole anything or did some other kind of evil thing, or because you interfered in someone else's affairs.
\v 16 But if you suffer because you are a Christian, do not be ashamed about it. Instead, praise God that you are suffering because you belong to Christ.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, a thief, an evildoer, or a meddler.
\v 16 Yet, if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in that name.
