\v 12 Beloved, do not regard the fiery trial that comes to test you as something strange, as though a strange thing is happening to you.
\v 13 But in so far as you share Christ’s sufferings--rejoice--that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed.
\v 14 If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed because the Spirit of glory and the Spirit of God rests upon you.
