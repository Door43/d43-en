\v 13 Instead, rejoice that you are suffering the same kinds of things that Christ endured. Rejoice when you suffer, in order that you may also be very glad when Christ returns and shows everyone how glorious he is.
\v 14 If others insult you because you believe in Christ, God is pleased with you, because it shows that the Spirit of God, the Spirit who  reveals how great God is, lives within you.

\v 12 Beloved, do not regard the fiery trial that comes to test you as something strange, as though a strange thing were happening to you.
\v 13 But as much as you experience the sufferings of Christ, rejoice, so that you may also rejoice and be glad at the revelation of his glory.
\v 14 If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and the Spirit of God is resting on you.
