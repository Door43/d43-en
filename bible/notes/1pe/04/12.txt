\p
\v 12 Beloved, do not regard the fiery trial that comes to test you as something strange, as though a strange thing were happening to you.
\v 13 But as much as you experience the sufferings of Christ, rejoice, so that you may also rejoice and be glad at the revelation of his glory.
\v 14 If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and the Spirit of God is resting on you.
