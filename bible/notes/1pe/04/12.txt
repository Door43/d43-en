\v 12 You whom I love, do not be surprised about the painful things that you are suffering because you belong to Christ. Those things are testing you as people test metal by putting it into a fire. Do not think that something strange is happening to you.
\v 13 Instead, rejoice that you are suffering the same kinds of things that Christ endured. Rejoice when you suffer, in order that you may also be very glad when Christ returns and shows everyone how glorious he is.
\v 14 If others insult you because you believe in Christ, God is pleased with you, because it shows that the Spirit of God, the Spirit who reveals how great God is, lives within you.

\p
\v 12 Beloved, do not regard as strange the testing in the fire that has happened to you, as though something strange were happening to you.
\v 13 But however much you experience the sufferings of Christ, rejoice, so that you may also rejoice and be glad at the revealing of his glory.
\v 14 If you are insulted for Christ's name, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and the Spirit of God is resting on you.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the testing in the fire that has happened to you** - In the same way that fire refines gold, trials test and refine a person's faith. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **rejoice and be glad** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize the intensity of joy. AT: "rejoice even more" or "be very glad" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **at the revealing of his glory** - You can translate this with a verbal phrase. AT: "when God reveals Christ's glory" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **If you are insulted for Christ's name** - Here the word "name" refers to Christ himself. This can be stated in active form. AT: "If people insult you because you believe in Christ" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the Spirit of glory and the Spirit of God** - Both of these refer to the Holy Spirit. AT: "the Spirit of glory, who is the Spirit of God" or "the glorious Spirit of God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
