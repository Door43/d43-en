\v 10 As each one of you has received a gift, use it to serve one another, faithfully administering God's grace in its various forms. 
\v 11 If anyone speaks, let it be with God's words. If anyone serves, let it be from the strength that God supplies. Do these things so that in all ways God would be glorified through Jesus Christ. May there be to Jesus Christ glory and power forever and ever. Amen.
