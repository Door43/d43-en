\v 10 As each one of you has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of God's many free gifts.
\v 11 If someone speaks, let it be as the oracles of God; if someone serves, as from the strength that God supplies, so that in all things, God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. Glory and power belong to him for ever and ever. Amen.
