\v 10 As each one of you has received a gift, use it to serve one another. Do this as good stewards of God's many free gifts.
\v 11 If anyone speaks, let it be like the oracles of God. If anyone serves, let it be from the strength that God supplies. Do these things so that in all ways God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. May there be to Jesus Christ glory and power forever and ever. Amen.
