\v 1  \add Now I will say this to those among\add* you who are elders in the congregations: I also am an elder. I am one  \add of those\add* who saw Christ when he suffered, and I am also one who will share some of the glory\f + \ft Or: greatness \f* that Christ has in heaven.
\v 2  \add I appeal to you elders\add* to take care of the people who are in your  \add congregations\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* as shepherds  \add take care of their\add* flocks of sheep. Do this, not because you must do it, but instead do it willingly, as God desires. Do not be greedy to get a lot  \add of money for doing it\add*, but instead do it enthusiastically\f + \ft Or: wholeheartedly \f*.
\v 3 Do not act like domineering  \add bosses over\add* the people \f + \ft metaphor \f* whom God has assigned\f + \ft Or: entrusted \f* to you, but instead be examples to them by the way in which you conduct your lives.
\v 4  \add If you do that\add*, when Jesus, who is  \add like\add* our chief shepherd \f + \ft metaphor \f*, appears, he will give each of you a  \add glorious\f + \ft Or: wonderful \f* reward\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add That reward will be like\add* the wreaths  \add that are given to victorious athletes\add*, but your reward will never wither  \add like wreaths do\add*.

\v 2  I appeal to you elders to take care of the people who are in your  congregations  as shepherds take care of their flocks of sheep. Do this, not because you must do it, but instead do it willingly, as God desires. Do not be greedy to get a lot of money for doing it, but instead do it enthusiastically.
\v 3 Do not act like domineering bosses over the people whom God has assigned to you, but instead be examples to them by the way in which you conduct your lives.
\v 4  If you do that, when Jesus, who is  like our chief shepherd, appears, he will give each of you a glorious reward. That reward will be like the wreaths  that are given to victorious athletes, but your reward will never wither  like wreaths do.

\v 1 I exhort the elders among you. I am a fellow-elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ. I am also a partaker of the glory that will be revealed.
\v 2 Therefore, I exhort you, elders, to tend the flock of God that is among you. Look  after them, not because you must, but because you can, according to God.* Look after them not for dishonest money, but willingy.
\v 3 Do not act as a lord over the portion of God's people who are in your care, but become an example to the flock.
\v 4 When the Chief Shepherd is revealed, you will receive an unfading glorious crown.
