\v 1  \add Now I will say this to those among\add* you who are elders in the congregations: I also am an elder. I am one  \add of those\add* who saw Christ when he suffered, and I am also one who will share some of the glory\f + \ft Or: greatness \f* that Christ has in heaven.
\v 2  \add I appeal to you elders\add* to take care of the people who are in your  \add congregations\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* as shepherds  \add take care of their\add* flocks of sheep. Do this, not because you must do it, but instead do it willingly, as God desires. Do not be greedy to get a lot  \add of money for doing it\add*, but instead do it enthusiastically\f + \ft Or: wholeheartedly \f*.
\v 3 Do not act like domineering  \add bosses over\add* the people \f + \ft metaphor \f* whom God has assigned\f + \ft Or: entrusted \f* to you, but instead be examples to them by the way in which you conduct your lives.
\v 4  \add If you do that\add*, when Jesus, who is  \add like\add* our chief shepherd \f + \ft metaphor \f*, appears, he will give each of you a  \add glorious\f + \ft Or: wonderful \f* reward\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add That reward will be like\add* the wreaths  \add that are given to victorious athletes\add*, but your reward will never wither  \add like wreaths do\add*.

\v 1  Now I will say this to those among you elders, you who lead the assemblies of believers: I also am an elder. I am one  of those who saw Christ suffer, and I am alsowill share some of the glory that Christ has in heaven.
\v 2  I appeal to you elders to take care of the people who are in your  assemblies. Do this as if you were sheperds who take care of their flocks of sheep. Do this, not because you must do it, but instead do it willingly, as God desires. Do not be greedy to get money for doing it, but instead do it enthusiastically.
\v 3 Do not act like domineering bosses over the people whom God has assigned to you, but instead be examples to them by the way in which you conduct your lives.
\v 4  If you do that, when Jesus, who is like our chief shepherd, appears, he will give each of you a glorious reward. That reward will be like the wreaths that are given to athletes who win races, but your reward will never wither like those wreaths do.

\v 1 I exhort the elders among you, I, who am a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and who am also a participant in the glory that will be revealed.
\v 2 Therefore, I exhort you, elders, tend the flock of God that is among you. Look after them, not because you must, but because you wish to, according to God. Look after them, not for dishonest money, but willingly.
\v 3 Do not act as a master over the people who are in your care, but be an example to the flock.
\v 4 When the Chief Shepherd is revealed, you will receive an unfading glorious crown.
