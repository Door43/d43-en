\v 10 God is the one who kindly helps us in every  situation, and he is the one who chose us to share his eternal glory in heaven because we are joined to Christ. And after you have suffered for a while because of things that people do to harm you, he will remove your spiritual defects, he will strengthen you to trust him more, and he will support you in every way.
\v 11  I pray that he will rule powerfully forever. May it be so!
