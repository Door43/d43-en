====== 1 Peter 05 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Verses 12-14 form a closing salutation for the letter. This was typical for a letter in the ancient Near East.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Elders ==
There is some disagreement over the titles used for church leaders. Some titles include; overseer, elder, pastor, deacons and bishop.

== Crowns ==
Crowns are a significant image used in Scripture. There are several Greek words translated as crowns in English. The crown referenced here is a type of [[:en:obe:kt:reward|reward]].

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Lion ==
God is pictured as a lion in Scripture. Jesus is the lion of the tribe of Judah. In this chapter, Satan is described as "like a lion." It is possible that this phrase is used because he is an imitator of God but its meaning is that Satan seeks to destroy the testimony or witness of Christians.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Babylon ==
Babylon was the epitome of [[:en:obe:kt:evil|evil]]. Babylon is a [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|metaphor]] for an evil place. In this chapter, it is probably Rome.
