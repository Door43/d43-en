=== What is the Book of 1 Peter about? ===

Peter states that he wrote this letter for the purpose of “encouraging you and testifying that this is the true grace of God” (5:12).  There are several similarities between 1 Peter 2:11–3:7, Ephesians 5:18–6:9, and Colossians 3:18–4:6. All three of these sections give instruction about family relationships and obeying authorities.  He also encourages Christians to persevere when there is suffering because the end is near (4:1).

=== Who wrote the Book of 1 Peter? ===

The letter of 1 Peter was written by the Apostle Peter.  Peter began his letter by saying who he was and to whom he was writing.  He addressed the letter to all Christians who he called “strangers” (1:1, 1:17, and 2:11).  He referred to his readers like this several times because they were scattered in different countries.  Because this letter resembles Paul’s letter to the Ephesians in some ways, many believe that 1 Peter was written after Ephesians around 65 years after the birth of Christ.  Peter wrote this letter from Rome which he called Babylon (5:13).
