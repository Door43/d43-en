<usfm>
\v 10 Consider what the Psalmist wrote about the proper way of conducting our lives:
\q "As for those who want to enjoy life and for good things to happen to them, 
\q they must not say what is evil or speak words that deceive others. 
\q
\v 11 They must continually stop doing evil, and do what is good instead. 
\q They must try to help people act peacefully toward each other; 
\q they must earnestly urge people to act in a peaceful way, 
\q
\v 12 because the Lord accepts what righteous people do. 
\q He listens to righteous people when they pray, and he answers them. 
\q But he rejects those who do evil."

\q
\v 10 "The one who wants to love life and to see good days should stop his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit.
\q
\v 11 Let him turn away from what is bad and do what is good. Let him seek peace and pursue it.
\q
\v 12 The eyes of the Lord see the righteous, and his ears hear their requests. But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil."
