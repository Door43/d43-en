<usfm>
\v 10 For,
\q He that would love life,
\q And see good days,
\q Let him refrain his tongue from evil,
\q And his lips that they speak no guile:
\q
\v 11 And let him turn away from evil, and do good;
\q Let him seek peace, and pursue it.
\q
\v 12 For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous,
\q And his ears to their supplication:
\q But the face of the Lord is upon them that do evil.
