\v 18 Christ also suffered once for sins. He who is righteous suffered for us, who were unrighteous, so that he would bring us to God. He was put to death in the flesh, but he was made alive by the Spirit.
\v 19 By the Spirit, he went and preached to the spirits who are now in prison.
\v 20 They were disobedient when the patience of God was waiting in the days of Noah, in the days of the building of an ark, and God saved a few people—eight souls—through the water.

  * **He was put to death in the flesh** - Here "flesh" refers to Christ's body; Christ was physically put to death. This can be stated in active form. AT: "People put Christ to death physically" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
