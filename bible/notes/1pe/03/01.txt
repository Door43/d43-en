\v 1 In this way, you who are wives should submit to your own husbands. Do this so even if some men are disobedient to the word, they may be won without a word, through their wives' behavior.
\v 2 For they will have seen your sincere behavior with respect.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Peter begins to speak specifically to women who are wives.

  * **In this way, you who are wives should submit to your own husbands** - Just as believers are to "Obey every human authority" ([[:en:bible:notes:1pe:02:13|2:13]]) and servants are to "be subject" to their masters ([[:en:bible:notes:1pe:02:18|2:18]]), wives are to submit to their husbands. The words "Obey," "be subject," and "submit" translate the same word. 
  * **some men are disobedient to the word** - Here "the word" refers to the gospel message. To disobey means that they do not believe. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:1pe:02:07|2:8]]. AT: "some men do not believe the message about Jesus" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **they may be won** - "they may be persuaded to believe in Christ." This means that the unbelieving husbands will become believers. This can be stated in active form. AT: "they may become believers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **without a word** - "without the wife saying a word." Here "a word" refers to words that the wife speaks.
  * **they will have seen your sincere behavior with respect** - Peter speaks of behavior as if it were an object that could be seen, rather than the actions that people carry out. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **your sincere behavior with respect** - Possible meanings are 1) "your sincere behavior toward them and the way that you honor them" or 2) "your pure behavior toward them and the way that you honor God."
