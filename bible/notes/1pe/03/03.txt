\v 3 Do not try to do this by decorating the outside of your bodies, such as having fancy hair arrangements or wearing gold jewelry and fine clothes.
\v 4 Instead, make your inner beings beautiful in a way that will not fade. I mean, have a humble and quiet attitude, which is something that God considers to be very valuable.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Let it not be done with outward ornaments—braided hair, jewels of gold, or fashionable clothing.
\v 4 But instead the inner person of the heart in incorruption of the gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in the sight of God.

  * **instead the inner person** - "instead let it be done with the inner person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
