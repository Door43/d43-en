===== Translation Notes: =====

Peter has just instructed husbands and wives on how to treat each other so that their prayers will not be hindered.

  * **all of you** - The previous three sections addressed slaves, wives, and husbands. This section addresses all these groups plus all other believers.
  * **insult** - Rude words or actions.
  * **on the contrary** - "in the opposite way"
  * **you were called** - "God called you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **that you might inherit a blessing** - "so that God will bless you"
