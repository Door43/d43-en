\v 21 That water, by means of which eight people were saved when God punished the other people , represents  the water in which we are baptized  to show that God has saved us  from God punishing us. The water in which we are baptized does not remove dirt from our bodies. Instead, it shows that we are requesting  God to assure us that he has removed our guilt  for having sinned. And because Jesus Christ became alive again after he died, we know that God accepted his sacrifice for us and because of that was able to remove our guilt.
\v 22 Christ has gone into heaven and is ruling  to be made subject to him.

\v 21 which also after a true likeness does now save you, even
baptism, not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the interrogation of a good conscience toward God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ;
\v 22 who is on the right hand of God, having gone into heaven; angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him.
