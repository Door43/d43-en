\v 21 That water represents the water in which we are baptized, by which God saves us. This water, of course, removes no dirt from our bodies. Instead, it shows that we are requesting  God to assure us that he has removed our guilt  for having sinnedâ€”that he has removed our guilt because he raised Jesus Christ from the dead.
\v 22 Christ has gone into heaven and is ruling in the place of highest honor next to God, after God caused all the evil and powerful spirit beings to be made obedient to him.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 21 This is a symbol of the baptism that saves you now, not as a washing away of dirt from the body, but as the appeal of a good conscience to God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
\v 22 He is at the right hand of God. He went into heaven. Angels, authorities, and powers must submit to him.
