<usfm>
\v 5 The women who honored God, who lived long ago, made themselves beautiful in this way. They trusted in God and obeyed their husbands.
\v 6 Sarah, for example, obeyed her husband Abraham and called him master. God will consider you to be her daughters if you do what is right and are not afraid of what your husbands or anyone else may do to you because you are believers.

<usfm>
\v 5 For this is how holy women long ago who hoped in God adorned themselves, by submitting to their husbands.
\v 6 In this way Sarah obeyed Abraham and called him her lord. You are now her children if you do what is good and if you are not afraid of trouble.
