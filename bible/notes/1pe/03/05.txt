<usfm>
\v 5 For holy women once adorned themselves in this way. They had confidence in God and they submitted to their own husbands.
\v 6 In this way Sarah obeyed Abraham and called him lord. You are now her children if you do what is good and if you are not afraid of trouble.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Peter has just instructed the wives to show their gentle and quiet spirits.

  * **You are now her children** - This means Christian wives are like Sarah's spiritual children if they act like her. See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
