\v 7 You men who are believers, just as your wives should respect you, you should conduct your lives in an appropriate way with them. Treat them respectfully, realizing that they are usually weaker than you are. But also realize that God is making them to live forever, just like you. Do this so that nothing will hinder you from praying.

\v 7 In the same way, you husbands should live with your wives according to understanding, as with a weaker container, a woman. You should give them honor as fellow heirs of the gift of life. Do this so that your prayers will not be hindered.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Peter begins to speak specifically to men who are husbands.

  * **In the same way** - This refers back to how Sarah and other godly women obeyed their husbands in [[:en:bible:notes:1pe:03:05|3:5-6]]. 
  * **wives according to understanding, as with a weaker container, a woman** - Peter speaks of women as if they were containers, as men are sometimes also spoken as. AT: "wives, understanding that the woman is the weaker partner" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **give them honor as fellow heirs of the gift of life** - You can translate this using verbal phrases. AT: "honor them because they will also receive the eternal life that God gives" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **heirs of the gift of life** - Eternal life is often spoken of as if it were something that people inherited.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Do this** - Here "this" refers to the ways husbands should treat their wives. AT: "Live with your wives in this way" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **so that your prayers will not be hindered** - To "hinder" is to prevent something from happening. This can be stated in active form. AT: "so that nothing will hinder your prayers" or "so that nothing will keep you from praying as you should" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
