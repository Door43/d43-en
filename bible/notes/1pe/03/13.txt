===== Translation Notes: =====

Peter has been instructing believers on how to live.
 
  * **Who is he who will harm you, if you desire what is good?** - The word "you" refers to believers. AT: "No one will harm you if you do good things." (See:[[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **Do not fear what they fear. Do not be troubled.** - These two phrases share similar meanings and emphasize that believers should not be afraid of those who persecute them. AT: "Do not be afraid of what people might do to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
