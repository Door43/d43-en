<usfm>
\v 13 Therefore, prepare your minds to obey God. What I mean is that you should discipline your minds. Be confident that you will receive the good things that God will kindly do for you when Jesus Christ returns from heaven.
\v 14 And because you should obey your heavenly Father, just as children ought to obey their fathers here on earth, do not do the evil deeds that you previously wished to do, when you did not know the truth about God.

\v 13 So gird up the loins of your mind. Be sober in your thinking. Have complete confidence in the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
\v 14 As obedient children, do not conform yourselves to the desires that you followed when you had no knowledge.
