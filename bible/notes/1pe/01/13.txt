<usfm>
\v 13 Therefore, prepare your minds to obey God. What I mean is that you should discipline your minds. Be confident that you will receive the good things that God will kindly do for you when Jesus Christ returns from heaven.
\v 14 And because you should obey your heavenly Father, just as children ought to obey their fathers here on earth, do not do the evil deeds that you previously wished to do, when you did not know the truth about God.

\v 13 So gird up the loins of your mind. Be sober. Put your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you when Jesus Christ is revealed. 
\v 14 As obedient children, do not conform yourselves to the desires that you followed when you were ignorant.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **So gird** - "Because of this, gird." Peter uses the word "So" here to refer back to everything he has said about salvation, their faith, and the Spirit of Christ giving revelations to the prophets.
  * **gird up the loins of your mind** - Girding up the loins refers to preparing to work hard. It comes from the custom of tucking the bottom of one's robe into a belt around the waist in order to move with ease. AT: "get your minds ready" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Be sober** - Here the word "sober" refers to mental clarity and alertness. AT: "Control your thoughts" or "Be careful about what you think" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **the grace that will be brought to you** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the grace that God will bring to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the grace that will be brought to you** - Here God's way of dealing kindly with believers is spoken of as if it were an object that he will bring to them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **at the revealing of Jesus Christ** - "when Jesus Christ is revealed." This refers to the return of Christ. This can also be expressed with an active form. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:1pe:01:06|1:7]]. AT: "when Jesus Christ appears to all people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **do not conform yourselves to the desires** - "do not desire the same things" AT: "do not live to gratify the desires" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
