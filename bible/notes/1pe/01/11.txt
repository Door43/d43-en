\v 11 They wanted to know whom the Spirit of Christ that was in them was referring to. They also wanted to know what time he was talking about. This was because the Spirit was telling them beforehand that the Christ would suffer and die, and that glorious things would happen to him afterwards.
\v 12 God told them that it was not for their own sake that he was revealing these things to them, but that it was for your sake. They proclaimed them to you because the Holy Spirit whom God sent from heaven enabled them to do that. And even angels would like to know more about these truths about how God saves us.

\v 11 They searched to know what kind of salvation was coming. They also searched to know what time the Spirit of Christ in them was talking to them about. This was happening as he was telling them in advance about the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow him.
\v 12 It was revealed to the prophets that they were serving these things, not for themselves, but for you—the telling of these things through those bringing the gospel to you by the Spirit sent from heaven, things that even angels desire to be revealed.
