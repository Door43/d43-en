\v 17 God is the one who impartially\f + \ft Or: without favoritism \f* judges what each one does. Since you call him 'Father,' conduct yourselves reverently\f + \ft Or: with great respect for him \f* during the time that you are living here on earth. \add While you are living here, you are\add* like exiles, Or: foreigners \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add because you are away from heaven, which is your true home\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 Instead, just like God, the one who chose you to belong to him, is holy, you also must be holy in everything that you do.
\v 16 Be holy, because it is written in the Scriptures that God said, "You must be holy because I am holy."
\p
\v 17 God is the one who judges what each one does, and he does this very fairly. Since you call him 'Father,' behave in a right way while you are living here on earth. You are like people whom others have driven from their homes, because you are living away from heaven, your true home.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 But as the one who called you is holy, you, too,  be holy in all your behavior in life.
\v 16 For it is written, "Be holy, because I am holy."
\v 17 And if you call as  "Father" the one who judges impartially according to each person's work, spend the time of your journey in reverence.
