===== translationNotes: =====

  * **unspeakable, glorious joy** - "wonderful joy that words cannot describe"
  * **the salvation of your souls** - Here the word "souls" refers to the whole person. You may translate this using a verb. AT: "your salvation" or "God saving you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **salvation ... grace** - These words present two ideas as if they were things or objects. In reality, "salvation" refers to the action of God saving us, or to what happens as a result. Similarly, "grace" refers to the kind way in which God deals with believers. 
  * **searched and inquired carefully** - The words "inquired carefully" mean basically the same thing as "searched." Together these words emphasize how hard the prophets tried to understand this salvation. AT: "examined very carefully" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
