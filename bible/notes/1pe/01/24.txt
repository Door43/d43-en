\v 24 We know that this is true because, as the prophet Isaiah wrote,
\q "All people will perish like grass perishes. And all the greatness that people have will not last forever,
\q like the flowers in the grass do not last long.
\q The grass withers and the flowers die,
\q
\v 25 but God's message endures forever."
\m
This message that endures is the message about Christ that we proclaimed to you.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 24 For, "All flesh is like grass, 
\q and all its glory is like the wild flower of the grass.
\q The grass dries up, and the flower falls off,
\q
\v 25 but the word of the Lord remains forever."
\m
This is the good news that was announced to you.
