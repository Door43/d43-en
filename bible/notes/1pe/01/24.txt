\v 24 We know that this is true because, as the prophet Isaiah wrote,
\q "All people will perish like grass perishes. And all the greatness that people have will not last forever,
\q like the flowers in the grass do not last long.
\q The grass withers and the flowers die,
\q
\v 25 but God's message endures forever."
\m
This message that endures is the message about Christ that we proclaimed to you.
