\v 3 May the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ be blessed. In his great mercy, he gave us a new birth for the confidence of an inheritance. This inheritance is by means of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead ones.
\v 4 This is for an inheritance that will not perish, will not become stained, and will not fade away. It is reserved in heaven for you.
\v 5 You are protected by God's power through faith, for the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last times.
