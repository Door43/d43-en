====== 1 Peter 01 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 1:24-25, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Work of God in salvation ==
This chapter emphasizes the work of God in salvation. It reminds Christians of the great things only God could have done in order to bring them to a right relationship with himself. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:works]] and [[:en:obe:kt:salvation]])

== Eternity ==
This chapter contrasts living for things of this world, which will not last, with living for things that will matter eternally. It is also important to live with the expectation that Jesus will return soon. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:eternity]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== The use of paradox ==

This is a seemingly absurd statement that appears to contradict itself. A paradox occurs in this chapter: "You rejoice in this, even though now it is necessary for you to feel sorrow in many different trials."

== "You are now" ==
Even though the statement, "You are now receiving for yourselves the result of your faith, the salvation of your souls," is in the present tense, it refers to an action that has already happened. Therefore, it can be translated as a completed action. Some English translations do this and use a slightly different construction.
