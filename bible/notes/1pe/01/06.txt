\v 6 You rejoice because of what will happen then, but now you are grieving for a short time while you suffer many different hardships.
God is allowing you to be tested, as precious metals are tested to see if they are pure. These trials that you are experiencing are necessary.
\v 7 These hardships happen in order to prove that you really do trust in Jesus. This means more to God than all the gold in the world, which fire can destroy. Because you trust in Jesus, God will honor you very highly when Jesus Christ comes again.

\v 6 You rejoice in this, even though now it is necessary for you to feel sorrow in many different trials.
\v 7 This is so that your faith may be tested, faith that is much more precious than gold, which perishes in the fire that tests your faith. This occurs so that your faith will be found to result in praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
