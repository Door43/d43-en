<usfm>
\v 6 You rejoice because of what will happen then, but now you are grieving for a short time while you suffer many different hardships.
God is allowing you to be tested, as precious metals are tested to see if they are pure. These trials that you are experiencing are necessary.
\v 7 These hardships happen in order to prove that you really do trust in Jesus. This means more to God than all the gold in the world, which fire can destroy. Because you trust in Jesus, God will honor you very highly when Jesus Christ comes again.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 You rejoice in this, even though now it is necessary for you to feel sorrow in many different trials.
\v 7 This is so that your faith may be tested, faith that is much more precious than gold, which perishes in the fire that tests your faith. This occurs so that your faith will be found to result in praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **You rejoice in this** - The word "this" refers to all the blessings that Peter mentions in the previous verses.
  * **This is so that your faith may be tested...which perishes in the fire** - In the same way in which fire refines gold, hardships test and refine a person's faith. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **your faith may be tested** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God may test your faith" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **faith that is much more precious than gold, which perishes in the fire** - Faith is more valuable than gold, because although gold may be destroyed, genuine faith does not lose anything from the fire of trials.
  * **your faith will be found to result in praise, glory, and honor** - Possible meanings are 1) that "God will honor you very highly" because of your faith (UDB) or 2) that your faith will bring "praise, glory, and honor" to God.
  * **your faith will be found to result** - "your faith will prove genuine and result"
  * **at the revelation of Jesus Christ** - This refers to the return of Christ. AT: "when Jesus Christ appears" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
