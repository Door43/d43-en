\v 6 This makes you glad, even though now it is necessary for you to feel sorrow because of many different trials.
\v 7 Trials test your faith, but your faith is much more precious than gold that is lost through fire. Fire tests your faith, but because of your faith, God will praise you, glorify you, and honor you when Jesus Christ returns.
