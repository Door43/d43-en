\v 1 My fellow believers, I love you and I long for you. You give me joy; you will be the reason for which God will reward me. Dear friends, continue to believe firmly in the Lord, as I have described to you in this letter.


\p
\v 2 I urge you, Euodia, and I urge you, Syntyche, to again have a peaceful relationship with each other, because you are both joined to the Lord Jesus.
\v 3 And I also urge you, my faithful partner, please help these women. They have faithfully proclaimed the Good News and worked with me, together with Clement and the rest of my fellow laborers, whose names are in the book of life, the book in which God has written the names of all those people who will live forever.
