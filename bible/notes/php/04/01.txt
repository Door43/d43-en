===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Therefore, my beloved brothers whom I long for** - AT: "My fellow believers, I love you and I greatly desire to see you"
  * **my joy and crown** - Paul uses the word "joy" to mean that the Philippian church is the cause of his happiness. A "crown" was made of leaves and a man wore it on his head as a sign of honor after he won an important game. Here the word "crown" means the Philippian church brought honor to Paul before God. AT: "You give me joy because you have believed in Jesus, and you are my reward and honor for my work" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **in this way stand firm in the Lord, beloved friends** - AT: "So continue living for the Lord in the way that I have taught you, dear friends"
  * **I am pleading with Euodia, and I am pleading with Syntyche** - These are women who were believers and helped Paul in the church at Philippi. AT: "I beg Euodia, and I beg Syntyche" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **be of the same mind in the Lord** - The phrase "be of the same mind" means to have the same attitude or opinion. AT: "agree with each other because you both believe in the same Lord" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Indeed, I am entreating you too, my true yokefellow** - Here the word "you" is singular. Paul does not say the name of the person. He just calls him "my true yokefellow," which refers to someone who has worked with Paul to spread the gospel. AT: "Yes, I ask you too, my true fellow worker" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **along with Clement** - Clement was a man who was a believer and worker in the church at Philippi. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **whose names are in the book of life** - AT: "whose names God has written in the book of life"
