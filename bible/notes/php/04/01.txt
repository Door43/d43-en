===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Therefore, my beloved brothers whom I long for**  - "My fellow believers, I love you and I greatly desire to see you"
  * **my joy and crown,**  - Paul uses the word "joy" to mean that the Philippian church is the cause of his happiness. A "crown" was made of leaves and a person wore it on their heads as a sign of honor after they won an important game. Here the word "crown" means the Philippian church brought honor to Paul before God. This can be translated as a new sentence: "You give me joy because you have believed in Jesus and you are my reward and honor for my work." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metonymy|Metonymy]])
  * **in this way stand firm in the Lord, beloved friends.**  - This can be translated as a new sentence: "So continue living for the Lord in the way that I have taught you, dear friends."
  * **I am pleading with Euodia, and I am pleading with Syntyche,** - these are women who were believers and helped Paul in the church at Philippi. This can be translated as "I beg Euodia and I beg Syntyche." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:translatenames|How to Translate Names]])
  * **be of the same mind in the Lord.**  - The phrase "be of the same mind" means to have the same attitude or opinion. This can be translated as "agree with each other because you both believe in the same Lord."
  * **Indeed, I am entreating you too, my true yoke-fellow,**  - Here the word "you" is singular. Paul does not tell the name of the person. He just calls him "my true yoke-fellow" which refers to someone who has worked with Paul to spread the Gospel. This could be translated as "Yes, I ask you too, my true fellow-worker." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:formsofyou]])
  * **along with Clement**  - A man who was a believer and worker in the church at Philippi.
  * **whose names are in the book of life.**  - "whose names are written in the Book of Life."
