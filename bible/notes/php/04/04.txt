\v 4 Always rejoice for the Lord Jesus! I say again, rejoice!
\v 5 All people must see that you are gentle because the Lord is near.
\v 6 Do not worry about anything. Instead, in every situation pray to God, tell him exactly what you need, and ask him to help you. And thank God for all he does for you.
\v 7 Then God's peace, which is much greater than we can understand, will be like a soldier that is guarding how you feel and how you think, as we are joined to Christ Jesus.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice.**  - Paul is talking to all the Philippian believers. He repeats the command to rejoice to emphasize how important it is. This can be translated as: "Be glad because of what the Lord has done! Again I tell you be glad!"
    * **Your gentleness needs to be known to all people.**  - "All people need to see how kind you are."
    * **The Lord is near**  - Possible meanings are 1) The Lord Jesus is near to the believers in spirit or 2) the day the Lord Jesus will return to the earth is near.
    * **in everything by prayer in requests tell God what you need and thank him** - "ask God for everything you need with prayer and thanks."
    * **which exceeds all understanding** - "which is more than we can understand"
    * **will guard your hearts and your thoughts** - This presents God's peace as a soldier that protects our emotions and thoughts from worrying. This full meaning could be made explicit: "will be like a soldier and guard your emotions and thoughts from worrying about the troubles of this life.
