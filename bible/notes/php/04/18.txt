<usfm>
\v 18 I have plenty of things now. I have so many things that you sent me through Epaphroditus. These things are like when priests burn an animal sacrifice to God and it smells good to him.
\v 19 God, whom I serve, will supply everything you need because you belong to Jesus Christ, who owns the splendor and wealth of heaven.
\v 20 So people should praise God our Father, who will rule forever and ever in brilliant light! Amen!

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 I have received everything in full, and even more. I have been well-supplied now that I have received from Epaphroditus the things you sent. They are a sweet-smelling aroma, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God.
\v 19 My God will meet all your needs according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
\v 20 Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever. Amen.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I have received everything in full** - Possible meanings are 1) Paul has received everything that the Philippians sent or 2) Paul is using humor to continue the business metaphor from [[:en:bible:notes:php:03:08|3:8]] and saying that this part of the letter is a receipt for commercial goods that Epaphroditus delivered.
  * **even more** - Paul means plenty of the things that he needs for himself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **They are a sweet-smelling aroma, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God** - Paul speaks of the gift from the Philippian church as if it were a sacrifice offered to God on an altar. Paul implies that the church's gift is very pleasing to God, like the sacrifices that the priests burned, which had a smell that pleased God. AT: "I assure you these gifts are very pleasing to God, like an acceptable sacrifice" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **will meet all your needs** - This is the same word translated "have been well-supplied" in verse 18. It is an idiom meaning "will provide everything you need" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus** - "from his glorious riches that he gives through Christ Jesus"
  * **Now to our God** - The word "Now" marks the closing prayer and the end of this section of the letter.
