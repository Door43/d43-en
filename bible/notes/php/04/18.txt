\v 18 I have plenty of things now. I have so many things that you sent me through Epaphroditus. These things are like when priests burn an animal sacrifice to God and it smells good to him.
\v 19 God, whom I serve, will supply everything you need because you belong to Jesus Christ, who owns the splendor and wealth of heaven.
\v 20 So praise God our Father who will rule forever and ever in brilliant light! Amen!

    * **I have all things in abundance. I am filled.**  - "I have everything I need and more."
    * **They are a sweet smelling aroma, an acceptable sacrifice that pleases God**  - Paul is comparing the gift from the Philippian church to the sacrifices in the Old Testament. The priests would burn the sacrifice and it had a pleasing smell to God. Paul is emphasizing that the church's gift is of great value to God. This could be translated as "I assure you these gifts are very pleasing to God." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])

    * **according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus**  - This could be translated as "from his glorious riches that he gives through Christ Jesus."
