\v 14 Nevertheless, you did very well in that you \add helped me\add* \f + \ft Or: \add gave me money\add* \f* \f + \ft euphemism \f* while I have been suffering hardship.


\p
\v 15 \add My friends there at Philippi\add*, you yourselves know that during the time I first \add proclaimed\add* the message about Christ \add to you\add*, when I left there to go to Macedonia \add province\add*, you were the only group of believers \f + \ft litotes \f* who \add sent me\add* gifts \f + \ft euphemism \f* in order that I might \add proclaim that message\add* to others just like I did for you.
\v 16 Even \add when I was\add* in Thessalonica \add city\add*, you sent \add money\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f* to me two different times \f + \ft idiom \f* in order to \add supply\add* what I needed.
\v 17 I say this, not because I desire that you give me money now. Instead, I desire that \add God\add* will abundantly bless \f + \ft metaphor \f* you as a result of \add your helping me\add*.

\v 14 Nevertheless, you did the right thing to share with me in my hardship.


\p
\v 15 My friends there at Philippi, you yourselves know that during the time I first proclaimed the good news to you, when I left there to go away from the province of Macedonia, no assembly of believers sent me funds or helped me in any way except you only!
\v 16 Even when I was in the city of Thessalonica, you sent money more than once to supply what I needed
\v 17 I say this, not because I desire that you give me money now. Instead, I want to see you do even more things that God will praise you for.

\v 14 However, you did well to share with me in my difficulties.
\v 15 And you know, you Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church supported me in the matter of giving and receiving except you only.
\v 16 Even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent help for my needs more than once.
\v 17 It is not that I seek the gift. Instead, I seek the fruit that increases to your credit.

  * **the beginning of the gospel** - Paul refers to the gospel in order to mean his preaching of the gospel. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **no church supported me in the matter of giving and receiving except you only** - AT: "you were the only church that sent me money or helped me"
  * **I seek the fruit that increases to your credit** - Paul is comparing the church's gift to a person's bank account that increases more and more.
