\v 15 \add My friends there at Philippi\add*, you yourselves know that during the time I first \add proclaimed\add* the message about Christ \add to you\add*, when I left there to go to Macedonia \add province\add*, you were the only group of believers \f + \ft litotes \f* who \add sent me\add* gifts \f + \ft euphemism \f* in order that I might \add proclaim that message\add* to others just like I did for you.
\v 16 Even \add when I was\add* in Thessalonica \add city\add*, you sent \add money\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f* to me two different times \f + \ft idiom \f* in order to \add supply\add* what I needed.
\v 17 I say this, not because I desire that you give me money now. Instead, I desire that \add God\add* will abundantly bless \f + \ft metaphor \f* you as a result of \add your helping me\add*.

\v 14 Nevertheless, you did the right thing to share with me in my hardship.


\p
\v 15 My friends there at Philippi, you yourselves know that during the time I first proclaimed the good news to you, when I left there to go away from the province of Macedonia, no assembly of believers sent me funds or helped me in any way except you only!
\v 16 Even when I was in the city of Thessalonica, you sent money more than once to supply what I needed
\v 17 I say this, not because I desire that you give me money now. Instead, I want to see you do even more things that God will praise you for.

\v 14 However, you did well to share with me in my difficulties.
\v 15 You Philippians know that in the beginning of the gospel mission, when I left from Macedonia, no church had supported me in the matter of giving and receiving except you only.
\v 16 Even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent help for my needs more than once.
\v 17 Not that I seek the gift, but I do seek the fruit that increases to your account.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **in my difficulties** - "when things became difficult"
    * **gospel mission** - This refers to when Paul would travel to different cities to tell people about Jesus.
    * **no church had supported me in the matter of giving and receiving except you only** - "you were the only church that sent me money or helped me." 
    * **I do seek the fruit that increases to your account**  - Paul is comparing the church's gift to a person's wealth that increases more and more. Paul wants to see the Philippians to give gifts so they can receive spiritual blessings. Alternate translation: "I do want to see God give you more and more spiritual blessings." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
