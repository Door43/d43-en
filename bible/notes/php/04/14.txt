\v 14 Nevertheless, you did the right thing to share with me in my hardship.


\p
\v 15 My friends there at Philippi, you yourselves know that during the time I first proclaimed the good news to you, when I left there to go away from the province of Macedonia, no assembly of believers sent me funds or helped me in any way except you only!
\v 16 Even when I was in the city of Thessalonica, you sent money more than once to supply what I needed
\v 17 I say this, not because I desire that you give me money now. Instead, I want to see you do even more things that God will praise you for.

\v 14 However, you did well to share with me in my difficulties.
\v 15 You Philippians know that in the beginning of the gospel mission, when I left from Macedonia, no church had supported me in the matter of giving and receiving except you only.
\v 16 Even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent help for my needs more than once.
\v 17 Not that I seek the gift, but I do seek the fruit that increases to your account.
