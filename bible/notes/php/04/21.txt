===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Greet every person belonging to Christ Jesus**  - "Greet every person there who belongs to Christ Jesus"
  * **The brothers**  - These are those who were either ministering with Paul or ministering to Paul. Alternate translation "The fellow believers."
  * **especially those of Caesar’s household**  - These are servants who worked in Caesar's palace. This could be translated as "especially the fellow believers who work in the palace of Caesar" (UDB).
  * **with your spirit**  - Paul refers to the believers by using the word "spirit" which is what enables humans to relate to God. This can be translated as "with you." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
