\v 9 I am praying for you, that you might love each other more and more, and that you might know and understand why God wants you to do so.
\v 10 I also pray that God will enable you to know what you should believe and the best ways in which you should act. I pray for this, so that you might be honest and blameless at the time when Christ returns.
\v 11 I also pray that you will always do the things that you can do because God has declared you good in his sight because of Jesus Christ. Then other people will see how you honor God.

\v 10 I do this so that you may test and choose the things that are excellent in order that you may be sincere and without offense in the day of Christ.
\v 11 Also, that you will be filled with the fruits of righteousness that come through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **may abound**  - "may overflow"
  * **in knowledge and complete understanding**  - AT: "as you learn and understand more clearly what pleases God" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **I do this**  - "I pray this"
  * **the things that are excellent**  - AT: "what is most pleasing to God"
  * **sincere and without offense** - The words "sincere" and "without offense" mean basically the same thing. Paul combines them to emphasize moral purity. AT: "completely blameless" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **in the day of Christ** - "in the day of the Lord" or "on the day of judgement"
  * **Also**  - "I also pray"
  * **you will be filled**  - AT: "Jesus Christ may cause you to obey God more and more" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **filled with the fruits of righteousness** - This compares fruit growing on a tree to a believer obeying God more and more. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **to the glory and praise of God**  - This can be translated as a separate sentence. AT: "Then people will praise and give honor to God because of the good things they see you do"
