===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I**  - The pronoun "I" in verses 9-10 refers to Paul. (See: [[en:ta:translate:singularpronoun]])
  * **your, you**  - These pronouns in verses 9-11 refer to the Philippian believers. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:formsofyou-plural|Forms of 'You' - Dual/Plural]])
  * **may abound**  - "may overflow"
  * **in knowledge and complete understanding**  - What they are to know and understand can be made explicit: "as you learn and understand more clearly what pleases God". (See: [[:en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]])
  * **I do**  - "I pray"
  * **the things that are excellent**  - "what is most pleasing to God"
  * **you may be sincere and without offense in the day of Christ.**  - The phrase "sincere and without offense" is a doublet that emphasizes a person's moral purity. This may be translated as "you are completely blameless when Jesus returns." (See: [[en:ta:translate:doublet]])
  * **Also**  - "I also pray"
  * **you will be filled with the fruits of righteousness that come through Jesus Christ**  - "you will be filled" can be translated as an active clause: "Jesus Christ may cause you to obey God more and more." The phrase "filled with the fruits of righteousness" is a metaphor. It compares fruit growing on a tree to a believer obeying God more and more.  (See: [[en:ta:translate:active]] and [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
  * **to the glory and praise of God**  - You could make this a separate sentence: "Then people will praise and give honor to God because of the good things they see you do."
