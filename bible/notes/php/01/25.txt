\v 25 Since I am convinced of this, I know that I will remain \add alive\add* and that I will \add go\f + \ft Or: come \f* to\add* be with you all. \add As a result\add*, you will believe \add in Christ\add* more firmly, and \add as a result of that\add*, you will rejoice.
\v 26 \add That is\add*, you will be able to rejoice very greatly because of Christ Jesus \add bringing\add* me \add to be with you again\add*.


\p
\v 27 Most importantly, as fellow \add believers in Christ\add*, conduct yourselves just like \add you learned you should do when you heard\add* the message about Christ. Do that in order that whether I come and see you, or whether \add I am away from you and\add* people tell me about you, \add what I hear or see will make me happy\add*. They will tell me that you are unitedly and cooperatively resisting \add those who oppose the message about Christ\add* \f + \ft Or: \add oppose you\add* \f*. I \add will know\add* that you are not allowing others to influence you to believe a message that is different from the good message \add about Christ\add*.

<usfm>
\v 25 Since I am convinced of this, I know that I will remain alive with you all to help you rejoice and trust Christ more.
\v 26 So you should be happy about me because of Christ Jesus when I am once again with you.
\p
\v 27 Most importantly, behave in front of the people who live around you in a way that shows that you honor the good news about Christ. Do this so that whether or not I come and see you, how you live will make me happy. They should tell me that you together are doing your best to believe and live as the good news teaches us.

<usfm>
\v 25 Since I am confident about this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith.
\v 26 As a result, your glorying in Christ Jesus because of me will abound because of my presence again with you.
\v 27 Only conduct your lives in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Do this so that, whether I come to see you or I am absent, I may hear about how you are standing firmly in one spirit. I wish to hear that you are with one soul striving together for the faith of the gospel.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Since I am confident about this** - "Since I am sure that it is better for you that I stay alive"
  * **I know that I will remain** - "I know that I will continue to live" or "I know that I will keep on living"
  * **As a result, your glorying in Christ Jesus because of me will abound because of my presence again with you** - Paul speaks of "glorying" or pride as if they were objects that people could obtain more of. AT: "may increase" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) Possible meanings are 1) "So, when I come to you again, you will be even more proud of me because of what I have done for Christ Jesus" or 2) "So, when I come to you again, you will be even more proud of Christ Jesus because of what he has done for me."
  * **you are standing firmly in one spirit ... you are with one soul striving together** - These two clauses share similar meanings and emphasize the importance of unity. The words "spirit" and "soul" refer to the mind and emotions. AT: "all have the same determined purpose and are working together with the same desire" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **for the faith of the gospel** - "to spread the faith that is based on the gospel" or "to believe and live as the good news teaches us" (UDB)
