<usfm>
\v 7 It is right for me to feel this way about you because I love you from my heart. You have been partners with me in carrying out the work that God kindly gave me to do, whether now as I am in prison, or when I speak in public about the good news and show people that it is true.
\v 8 God sees how deeply I desire to be with you, just as I deeply love you all, just as Christ Jesus tenderly loves us all.
