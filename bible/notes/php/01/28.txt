\v 28 Do not let any of those people who are against you frighten you! When you are courageous and resist them, this will show them that God will destroy them but will save you.
\v 29 God is kind to you: He is allowing you to suffer for Christ as well as to trust in him.
\v 30 You are having to resist those who oppose the good news, just like you saw that I had to resist such people there in Philippi, and just like you hear that I still have to resist such people here now.

<usfm>
\v 28 Do not be frightened in any respect by those who are your opponents. This is a sign to them of their destruction, but of your salvation—and this from God.
\v 29 For it has been granted to you, for the sake of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for his sake,
\v 30 having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now you hear in me.
