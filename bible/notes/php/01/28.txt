\v 28 Do not let any of those people who are against you frighten you! When you are courageous and resist them, this will show them that God will destroy them but will save you.
\v 29 God is kind to you: he is allowing you to suffer for Christ as well as to trust in him.
\v 30 You are having to resist those who oppose the good news, just like you saw that I had to resist such people there in Philippi, and just like you hear that I still have to resist such people here now.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 And do not be frightened by anything from those opposing you, which is for them a sign of their destruction but of your salvation, salvation that is from God.
\v 29 Because to you it has been granted, for the sake of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for him,
\v 30 since you have to suffer the same conflict you saw in me, and now you have heard that it is in me.
