\v 20 I \add know that this will happen\add* because I very confidently expect \f + \ft doublet \f* that in no way I will be reluctant \add to honor Christ\add*.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **It is my confident expectation and hope that I will not be ashamed.**  - The phrase "confident expectation and hope" is saying the same thing in two different ways to emphasize how sure Paul is that he is living in a way that honors Christ. This can be translated as "I definitely expect and trust that I will not have regrets." (See: [[en:ta:translate:doublet]])
    * **my...I...me**  - These pronouns in verses 20-21 refer to Paul.
    * **But with all courage, as always and especially right now**  - "But I will have enough courage right now, as I have always had"
    * **I will bring glory to Christ in my body,**  - Paul uses the physical "body" as a metonym for his life or the way he lives. This can be translated as: "so that I will honor Christ with all that I do," (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]]) 
   * ** whether by life or by death.**  - "if I go on living or if I die."
   * **For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.**  - "Because if I go on living, I will live for Christ, and if I die, that is even better."
