====== Philippians 01:20-21 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 I \add know that this will happen\add* because I very confidently expect \f + \ft doublet \f* that in no way I will be reluctant \add to honor Christ\add*. Instead, just like I always \add have done\add*, Christ will be greatly honored \f + \ft Or:I will continue now also to very boldly honor Christ \f* by means of all that I do \f + \ft synecdoche, metonymy \f*, whether by \add the way I\add* live or \add by the way I\add* die.
\p
\v 21 As for me, I live \add in order to honor\add* Christ. But if I die, it will be better \add for me than if I continue to live, because then I will be completely united with him\add*.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 I eagerly and confidently expect that in no way will I fail to do what I should do. Instead, I will have courage now, just as in the past. I will honor Christ with my body, whether I live or die.

\p
\v 21 As for me, I live to honor Christ. But if I die, it will be even better for me.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 It is my confident expectation and certainty that I will not be ashamed. But with all courage, as always and especially right now, I will bring glory to Christ in my body, whether by life or by death.
\v 21 For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
</usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **It is my confident expectation and certainty** - Here the words "confident expectation" and "certainty" mean basically the same thing. Paul uses them together to emphasize how strong his expectation is. AT: "I am completely convinced" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **But with all courage, as always and especially right now**  - AT: "But I will have enough courage right now, as I have always had"
  * **I will bring glory to Christ in my body**  - Paul uses the physical "body" to represent his life or the way he lives. AT: "so that I will honor Christ with all that I do" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **whether by life or by death**  - AT: "if I go on living or if I die"
  * **For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain**  - AT: "Because if I go on living, I will live for Christ, and if I die, that is even better"
