===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The author gives greetings to the people of the church at Philippi.
  * **General Information:** - Because Paul writes later in the letter saying "I," it is generally assumed that he is the author and that Timothy, who is with him, writes as Paul speaks. All instances of "you" and "your" in the letter refer to the believers in the Philippian church and are plural. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]]) The word "our" probably refers to all believers in Christ, including Paul, Timothy, and the Philippian believers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])

  * **Paul and Timothy** - If your language has a particular way of introducing the authors of a letter, use it here. 
  * **Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus** - "Timothy. We are servants of Christ Jesus" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **to all those set apart in Christ Jesus** - "to all the believers in Christ Jesus"
  * **the overseers and deacons** - "the leaders of the church"
