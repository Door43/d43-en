====== Philippians 01:22-24 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 On the other hand, if I continue to live, that will enable me to continue to serve \add Christ\add* effectively. As a result, I do not know whether I prefer \add to live or to die\add*.
\v 23 That is, I am not sure which of those two I \add prefer\add*. I long to leave \add this world\add* and \add go to\add* be with Christ, because that will be very much better \add for me\add*.
\v 24 Nevertheless, it is more important that I remain alive \add than that I go to be with Christ because\add* you still need \add me to help you\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 On the other hand, if I continue to live here in my body in this world, I will be able to serve Christ here. So I do not know whether I prefer to live or to die.
\v 23 I cannot choose which I prefer, living or dying. I long to die and leave this world and go to be with Christ, because to be with Christ would be very much better for anyone.
\v 24 But it is more necessary that I remain alive here on earth because you still need me to help you.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 But if I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which to choose? I do not know. 
\v 23 For I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, which is far better,
\v 24 yet to remain in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But if I am to live in the flesh** - The word "flesh" here is a metonym for the body, and "living in the flesh" is a metonym for being alive. AT: "But if I am to remain alive in my body" or "But if I continue to live" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Yet which to choose?** - "But which should I choose?"
  * **that means fruitful labor for me** - The word "fruit" here refers to the good results of Paul's work. AT: "that means I will be able to work and my work will produce good results" or "then I will have more chances to encourage people to believe in Christ" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **For I am hard pressed between the two** - Paul speaks of how hard it is for him to choose between living and dying as if two heavy objects, like rocks or logs, were pushing on him from opposite sides at the same time. Your language might prefer the objects to pull rather than push. AT: "I am under tension. I do not know if I should choose to live or to die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **My desire is to depart and be with Christ** - Paul uses a euphemism here to show that he is not afraid of dying. AT: "I would like to die because I will go to be with Christ" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
