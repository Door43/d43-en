====== Philippians 01:22-24 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 On the other hand, if I continue to live, that will enable me to continue to serve \add Christ\add* effectively. As a result, I do not know whether I prefer \add to live or to die\add*.
\v 23 That is, I am not sure which of those two I \add prefer\add*. I long to leave \add this world\add* and \add go to\add* be with Christ, because that will be very much better \add for me\add*.
\v 24 Nevertheless, it is more important that I remain alive \add than that I go to be with Christ because\add* you still need \add me to help you\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 On the other hand, if I continue to live here in my body in this world, I will be able to serve Christ here. So I do not know whether I prefer to live or to die.
\v 23 I cannot choose which I prefer, living or dying. I long to die and leave this world and go to be with Christ, because to be with Christ would be very much better for anyone.
\v 24 But it is more necessary that I remain alive here on earth because you still need me to help you.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 But if to live in the flesh produces fruit from my labor, then I do not know which to choose. 
\v 23 For I am pulled by both of these choices. I have the desire to depart and be with Christ, which is much, much better!
\v 24 Yet to remain in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.
