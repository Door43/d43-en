\v 12 My fellow believers, I want you to know that the \add troubles\add* I have experienced \add have not prevented me from proclaiming the good message to people. Instead\add*, \add these things that I have experienced\add* have enabled even more people to hear the good message \add about Christ\add*.
\v 13 \add Specifically\add*, all the military guards who are stationed \add here in Rome\add* and many other \f + \ft hyperbole \f* \add people in this city\add* \f + \ft hyperbole \f* now know that I am a prisoner \f + \ft metonymy \f* because I \add proclaim the good news\add* about Christ.
\v 14 Also, most of the believers \add here now\add* proclaim the message from God more courageously and fearlessly \add because\add* they trust the Lord \add more firmly to help them. They trust the Lord more\add* because \add they have seen how the Lord has helped me\add* while I have been a prisoner \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add here\add*.

\v 12 My fellow believers, I want you to know that the hard things I have suffered have not prevented me from proclaiming the good news to people. Instead, my hardships have enabled even more people to hear the good news about Christ.
\v 13 In particular, all the military guards here in Rome and many other people in this city now know that I am a prisoner because I proclaim the good news about Christ.
\v 14 Also, most of the believers here now proclaim the good news about Jesus more courageously and fearlessly because they trust the Lord more firmly to help them. They speak about Jesus more confidently because they have seen the Lord help me in prison to speak the good news.

\v 12 Now I want you to know, brothers, that the things that happened to me have advanced the progress of the gospel very much.
\v 13 As a result, my chains in Christ became known throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else,
\v 14 and most of the brothers in the Lord have been more persuaded because of my chains to dare to speak the word fearlessly.

  * **Now I want** - Here the word "Now" is used to mark a new part of the letter.
