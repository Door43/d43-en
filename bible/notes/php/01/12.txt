\v 12 My fellow believers, I want you to know that the hard things I have suffered have not prevented me from proclaiming the good news to people. Instead, my hardships have enabled even more people to hear the good news about Christ.
\v 13 In particular, all the military guards here in Rome and many other people in this city now know that I am a prisoner because I proclaim the good news about Christ.
\v 14 Also, most of the believers here now proclaim the good news about Jesus more courageously and fearlessly because they trust the Lord more firmly to help them. They speak about Jesus more confidently because they have seen the Lord help me in prison to speak the good news.

\v 12 Now I want you to know, brothers, that the things which happened to me have advanced the progress of the gospel.
\v 13 This is because my bonds in Christ became known throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else.
\v 14 And also so that most of the brothers in the Lord, becoming confident because of my imprisonment, speak the word of God with more boldness and without fear.

    * **that the things which happened to me**  - Paul is talking about his time in prison. You can make this explicit: "that the things I suffered because I was put into prison for preaching about Jesus" ([[en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit]])
    * **have advanced the progress of the gospel.** - "have helped to spread the gospel to more people."
    * **This is because my bonds in Christ became known throughout the whole palace guard**  - The phrase "became known" can translated as an active clause. Also, "whole" is a hyperbole and refers to "many." This can be translated as "This is because many of the palace guards know I am here because I tell others about Christ." (See: [[en:ta:translate:active]] and [[en:ta:translate:hyperbole]])
    * **palace guards** - This is a group of soldiers that helped protect the Roman emperor.
    * **and to everyone else** - The word "everyone" is a hyperbole and means "many." This could be translated as "Many other people in Rome also know why I am in prison."
    * **And also so that most of the brothers in the Lord, becoming confident because of my imprisonment** - "Also, my example while I am in prison has helped many believers to trust the Lord even more." 
    * **speak the word of God with more boldness and without fear.** - The phrase "more boldness and without fear" is a doublet that emphasizes the believers' courage. This could be translated as a new sentence: "Because the believers trust God more, they speak the word of God with complete confidence."
