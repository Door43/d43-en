\v 12 My fellow believers, I want you to know that the hard things I have suffered have not prevented me from proclaiming the good news to people. Instead, my hardships have enabled even more people to hear the good news about Christ.
\v 13 In particular, all the military guards here in Rome and many other people in this city now know that I am a prisoner because I proclaim the good news about Christ.
\v 14 Also, most of the believers here now proclaim the good news about Jesus more courageously and fearlessly because they trust the Lord more firmly to help them. They speak about Jesus more confidently because they have seen the Lord help me in prison to speak the good news.

\v 12 Now I want you to know, brothers, that the things which happened to me have advanced the progress of the gospel.
\v 13 This is because my bonds in Christ became known throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else.
\v 14 And also so that most of the brothers in the Lord, becoming confident because of my imprisonment, speak the word of God with more boldness and without fear.
