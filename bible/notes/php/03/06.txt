===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 I was \add so\add* zealous \add to make people obey those laws that\add* I caused the people who believe in Christ to suffer \add because I thought they were trying to abolish those laws. Indeed\add*, as far as my obeying those laws is concerned, no \add one could\add* have accused \add me by\add* saying that I had disobeyed any of those laws.


\p
\v 7 Nevertheless, all such things as those, which I used to \add consider to\add* be useful to me, those \add very\add* things I now consider worthless, because I \add want to know\add* Christ \f + \ft Or: in order that I \add may know\add* Christ \f*.

<usfm>
\v 6 I was so passionate to make people obey the Law that I caused believers in Christ to suffer. No one could say that I ever disobeyed the Law.



\p
\v 7 But everything that I then considered to be important I now consider to be worthless, because Christ has changed me.

\v 6 I zealously persecuted the church and was blameless in respect to the righteousness of the law. 
\v 7 But whatever things seemed to count to my credit, I have counted them as worthless because of Christ.
