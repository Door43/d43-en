===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Let us therefore, as many as are mature, think like that** - "I encourage all of us believers who are strong in the faith to think the same way." Paul wants his fellow believers to have the same desires he listed in [[en:bible:notes:php:03:08|3:8-11]].
  * **you** - The pronoun "you" in verse 15 refers to believers who think differently or disagree with Paul. (See: [[en:ta:translate:formsofyou-plural]])
  * **God will also reveal that to you.** - "God will also make it clear to you."
  * **Whatever the case** - Paul is finishing this section of his letter and emphasizing the main point. It could be translated as: "No matter what."
  * **if we have reached this point, we must walk in an orderly fashion according to it.**  - This can be translated as "let us all continue obeying the same truth we have already received."
  * **we** - Here this pronoun refers to Paul and all the believers in the Philippian church. (See: [[en:ta:translate:inclusive]])
