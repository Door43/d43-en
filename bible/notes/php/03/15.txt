\v 15 So all of us who have become strong believers  should think this same way. But if any of you do not think this same way, God will reveal this to you.
\v 16 Whatever is true about us now, however far we have come, let us trust Christ more and more in the same way we have done until now.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Let us therefore, as many as are mature, think like that**  - "I encourage all of us believers who are strong in the faith to think the same way." Paul wants his fellow believers to have the same desires he listed in [[:en:bible:notes:php:03:08|3:8-11]].
  * **If you think**  - The word "you" here refers to believers who may think differently or disagree with Paul. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **God will also reveal that to you.**  - "God will also make it clear to you."
  * **Whatever the case**  - Paul is finishing this section of his letter and emphasizing the main point. It could be translated as: "No matter what."
  * **if we have reached this point, we must walk in an orderly fashion according to it.**  - This can be translated as "let us all continue obeying the same truth we have already received." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive|Inclusive]])
