===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Let us therefore, as many as are mature, think like that** - Paul wants his fellow believers to have the same desires he listed in [[:en:bible:notes:php:03:08|3:8-11]]. AT: "I encourage all of us believers who are strong in the faith to think the same way"
  * **if you think** - Here "you" refers to believers who may think differently or disagree with Paul. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **God will also reveal that to you** - "God will also make it clear to you"
  * **Whatever the case** - Paul is finishing this section of his letter and emphasizing the main point. AT: "No matter what"
  * **whatever standard we have reached, let us walk in an orderly fashion according to it** - AT: "let us all continue obeying the same truth we have already received" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
