\p
\v 2 Beware of those \add people who are dangerous\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add like wild\add* dogs. They are \add dangerous\add* evildoers \f + \ft doublet \f*. Beware of them \add since they are like people who\add* cut \add other people's\add* bodies \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add They will harm you spiritually by insisting that you must let someone circumcise you in order for you to become God's people\add* \f + \ft metonymy, metaphor \f*.
\v 3 \add Those people think that they are God's people because someone has circumcised them\add*. But we, \add not they\add*, are \add truly God's people\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add whether or not someone has\add* circumcised \add us\add*. God's Spirit \add enables us to\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* worship \add God\add*; we praise Christ Jesus \add because he has enabled us to become the people of God\add*. We do not believe \add that God will consider\f + \ft Or: make \f* us his people as a result of what someone has done to our\add* bodies \f + \ft metonymy, synecdoche \f*.

\v 1 Finally, my fellow believers, continue to rejoice because you belong to the Lord. Though I will now write to you about those same matters that I mentioned to you before, this does not make me tired, and it will protect you from those who would like to harm you.
\p
\v 2 Beware of those people who are as dangerous to you as wild dogs. They just mutilate men's bodies so they will become Jews.
\v 3 But as for us—the Spirit of God enables us to truly worship God; we rejoice because we trust in Christ Jesus; and the rituals or ceremonies that people perform mean nothing to us. Therefore we ourselves are what it truly means to be circumcised.

\p
\v 1 Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. For me to write these same things again to you is no trouble for me, and it keeps you safe. 
\v 2 Watch out for the dogs. Watch out for the evil workers. Watch out those who mutilate the flesh.
\v 3 For we are the circumcision. It is we who worship by the Spirit of God. It is we who take pride in Christ Jesus, and who have no confidence in the flesh.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - In order to warn his fellow believers about Jews who would try to get them to follow the old laws, Paul gives his own testimony about when he persecuted believers.

  * **Finally, my brothers** - "Now moving along, my brothers" or "Concerning other matters, my brothers"
  * **brothers** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:php:01:12|1:12]].
  * **rejoice in the Lord** - "be happy because of all the Lord has done"
  * **For me to write these same things again to you is no trouble for me** - "It is no trouble for me to write these things again to you" 
  * **and it keeps you safe** - Here "these things" refers to Paul's teachings. You can add this alternate translation to the end of the previous sentence. AT: "because these teachings will protect you from those who teach what is not true" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Watch out for** - "Beware of" or "Look out for"
  * **the dogs ... the evil workers ... those who mutilate the flesh** - These are three different ways of describing the same group of false teachers. Paul is using strong expressions to convey his feeling about these Jewish Christian teachers.
  * **dogs** - The word "dogs" was used by the Jews to refer to those who were not Jews. They were considered unclean. Paul speaks of the false teachers as though they were dogs, to insult them. If you have a different animal in your culture that is considered unclean or whose name is used as an insult, you could use this animal instead. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **mutilate** - Paul is exaggerating about the act of circumcision to insult the false teachers. The false teachers said God will only save a person who is circumcised, who cuts off the foreskin. This action was required by the law of Moses for all male Israelites. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and  [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **For we are** - Paul uses "we" to refer to himself and all true believers in Christ, including the Philippian believers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
  * **the circumcision** - Paul uses this phrase to refer to believers in Christ who are not physically circumcised but are spiritually circumcised, which means they have received the Holy Spirit through faith. "truly God's people"
  * **have no confidence in the flesh** - "do not trust that only cutting our flesh will please God"
