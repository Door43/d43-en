\v 1 \add Now there are\add* other things \add that I want to write about\add*. My fellow believers, continue to rejoice because \add you belong to\add* the Lord. \add Though\add* I will \add now\add* write to you about those same matters \add that I mentioned to you before, this is\add* not tiresome for me, and it will protect you \add from those who would harm you spiritually\add*.


\p
\v 2 Beware of those \add people who are dangerous\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add like wild\add* dogs. They are \add dangerous\add* evildoers \f + \ft doublet \f*. Beware of them \add since they are like people who\add* cut \add other people's\add* bodies \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add They will harm you spiritually by insisting that you must let someone circumcise you in order for you to become God's people\add* \f + \ft metonymy, metaphor \f*.
\v 3 \add Those people think that they are God's people because someone has circumcised them\add*. But we, \add not they\add*, are \add truly God's people\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add whether or not someone has\add* circumcised \add us\add*. God's Spirit \add enables us to\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* worship \add God\add*; we praise Christ Jesus \add because he has enabled us to become the people of God\add*. We do not believe \add that God will consider\f + \ft Or: make \f* us his people as a result of what someone has done to our\add* bodies \f + \ft metonymy, synecdoche \f*.

\v 1 Finally, my fellow believers, continue to rejoice because you belong to the Lord. Though I will now write to you about those same matters that I mentioned to you before, this does not make me tired, and it will protect you from those who would like to harm you.


\p
\v 2 Beware of those people who are as dangerous to you as wild dogs. They just mutilate mens' bodies so they will become Jews.
\v 3 But as for us—the Spirit of God enables us to truly worship God; we rejoice because we trust in Christ Jesus; and the rituals or ceremonies that people perform mean nothing to us. Therefore we ourselves are what it truly means to be circumcised.

\p
\v 1 Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord.  For me to write these same things to you is not a problem, and they will keep you safe.
\v 2 Watch out for the dogs. Watch out for the evil workers. Watch out for the mutilators.
\v 3 For we are the true circumcision, we who worship in the Spirit of God, glory in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Finally, my brothers**  - "Now moving along, my brothers" or "concerning other matters my brothers"
  * **rejoice in the Lord**  - "Be happy because of all the Lord has done."
  * **For me to write these same things to you is not a problem**  - "I gladly write these same teachings to you"
  * **and they will keep you safe**  - The pronoun "they" refers to Paul's teachings. How they will keep the believers safe can be translated more explicitly "because these teachings will protect you from those who teach what is not true." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]])
  * **Watch out for**  - "Beware of" or "Look out for"
  * **the dogs…the evil workers…the mutilators**  - These are three different ways of describing the same group of false teachers.
  * **for the dogs**  - The word "dogs" was used by the Jews to refer to those who were not Jews. They were considered unclean. Paul compares the false teachers to dogs as an insult. If you have a different animal in your culture that is considered unclean or used as an insult, you could use this animal instead. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **the mutilators**  - To "mutilate" means to butcher or to cut in a violent way. Paul is exaggerating about the act of circumcision to insult the false teachers. The false teachers said God will only save a person who is circumcised or cuts off the foreskin. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole|Hyperbole]])
  * **For we are**  - Paul uses "we" to refer to Himself and all true believers in Christ, including his the Philippian believers. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive|Inclusive]])
  * **the true circumcision**  - Paul uses this phrase to refer to believers in Christ who are not physically circumcised but are spiritually circumcised, which means they have received the Holy Spirit through faith. This can be translated as "truly God's people."
  * **have no confidence in the flesh**  - "do not trust that just cutting our flesh will please God"
