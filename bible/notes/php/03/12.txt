\v 12 I do not claim that I have already become completely like Christ Jesus; that is, I have not already become all that God intends me to be \f + \ft doublet \f*. But I earnestly try to become \add more and more like Christ\add*, because he chose me \add in order that I might become like him\add*.
\v 13 My fellow believers, I certainly do not consider that I have already become completely like Christ. But I \add am like a runner. A runner does not look backward\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Instead, he leans\f + \ft Or: stretches \f* forward as he runs straight toward the goal \add in order that he might win the race and get the prize. Similarly\add*, I do not think about what I have already done.
\v 14 Instead, I concentrate only on \add continuing to become more and more like Christ right up to the end of my life\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. As a result, because of my relationship with Christ Jesus, God will call\f + \ft Or: summon \f* me to receive a reward from him \add in heaven\add*.

\v 12 I have not yet received these things, and I am not already complete. But I continue pressing on that I may possess the maturity for which Christ Jesus possessed me.
\v 13 Brothers, I do not think I have possessed it myself.  But one thing I do is this. I forget what is behind and strive for what is ahead,
\v 14 I continue pressing on toward the goal to win the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
