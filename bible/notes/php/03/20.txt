  * **from where we also wait for a savior, the Lord Jesus Christ**  - "and we are waiting for a savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, to return to earth from heaven"
  * **He will transform our lowly bodies** -  " He will change our weak, earthly bodies"
  * **into bodies formed like His glorious body**  - "into bodies like his glorious body" 
  * **formed by His power to control all things**  - This can be translated as a new sentence and with an active clause: "He will change our bodies with the same power He uses to control all things." (See: [[en:ta:translate:active]])
