\v 17 My fellow believers, \add all of\add* you should unitedly imitate me, and observe those people who act as I do, \add in order that you may imitate them also\add*.
\v 18 \add Keep in mind that\add* there are many people \add who say that they believe in Christ, but\add* who act \add in such a way that shows\add* that they are opposed to \add the teaching about\add* Christ \add dying on\add* the cross \f + \ft metonymy \f*. I have told you about those people many times \add before\add*, and now I am sad, even crying, as I tell you \add about them again\add*.
\v 19 \add God\add* will severely punish them. The things their bodies desire \f + \ft metonymy \f* have become \add like\add* gods to them \f + \ft metaphor \f*. They are proud of the things they should be ashamed of. They think only about what unbelievers \f + \ft metonymy \f* think about.

\v 17 My fellow believers, join with me and imitate me, and observe closely those people who live as I do, and imitate our example.
\v 18 There are many people who say that they believe in Christ, but they really oppose what he did on the cross for us. I have told you about those people many times before, and now I am sad, even crying, as I tell you about them again.
\v 19 God will destroy them in the end because their god is their desire to eat, and they live shamefully and think about things of the earth.

<usfm>
\p
\v 17 Be imitators of me, brothers. Closely watch those who are walking by the example that you have in us.
\v 18 Many are walking—those about whom I have often told you, and now I am telling you with tears—as enemies of the cross of Christ.
\v 19 Their destiny is destruction. For their god is their stomach, and their pride is in their shame. They think about earthly things.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Be imitators of me** - "Do what I do" or "Live as I live"
  * **brothers** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:php:01:12|1:12]].
  * **those who are walking by the example that you have in us** - "those who already are living as I live" or "those who already are doing what I do"
  * **Many are walking ... as enemies of the cross of Christ** - These words are Paul's main thought for this verse.
  * **Many are walking** - "Many are living" or "Many are conducting their lives" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **those about whom I have often told you, and now I am telling you with tears** - Paul interrupts his main thought with these words that describe the "many." You can move them to the beginning or end of the verse if you need to.
  * **I have often told you** - "I have told you many times"
  * **am telling you with tears** - "am telling you with great sadness"
  * **as enemies of the cross of Christ** - Here "the cross of Christ" refers to Christ's suffering and death. The enemies are those who say they believe in Jesus but are not willing to suffer or die like Jesus did. AT: "in a way that shows they are actually against Jesus, who was willing to suffer and die on a cross" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Their destiny is destruction** - "Someday God will destroy them"
  * **their god is their stomach** - Here "stomach" refers to a person's desires for physical pleasure. Calling it their god means that they want these pleasures more than they want to obey God. AT: "they desire food and other physical pleasures more than they desire to obey God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **their pride is in their shame** - Here "shame" stands for the actions that the people should be ashamed about but are not. AT: "they are proud of the things that should cause them shame" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **They think about earthly things** - Here "earthly" refers to everything that gives physical pleasure and does not honor God. AT: "All they think about is what will please themselves rather than what will please God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
