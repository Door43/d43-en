\v 17 My fellow believers, join with me and imitate me, and observe closely those people who live as I do, and imitate our example.
\v 18 There are many people who say that they believe in Christ, but they really oppose what he did on the cross for us. I have told you about those people many times before, and now I am sad, even crying, as I tell you about them again.
\v 19 God will destroy them in the end because their god is their desire to eat, and they live shamefully and think about things of the earth.

\v 18  I have often told you, and tell you now with tears, that many are living as enemies of the cross of Christ.
\v 19 Their destiny is destruction because their god is their belly and their glory is in their shame. They are thinking about earthly things.
