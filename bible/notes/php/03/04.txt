\v 4 \add We do not trust in those rituals to make us acceptable to God\add*, although I could very well do that \add if it would be useful for me\add*.


\p \add In fact\add*, \add if I could benefit from it for my salvation\add*, I could rely upon what I have done and who I am \f + \ft metonymy, synecdoche \f* more than anyone else could. I will tell you why.
\v 5 I \add was circumcised\add* \f + \ft Or:\add Someone\add* circumcised me \f* when I was one week old. I am from the people of Israel. I am from the tribe of Benjamin. I am completely Hebrew in every way. \add While I was\add* a member of the Pharisee \add sect\add*, I \add strictly obeyed\add* the laws \add that God gave Moses\add*.

\v 4 If anyone could have done enough things to please God, it would have been me.
\p
\v 5 They circumcised me seven days after I was born. I was born as one of the people of Israel. I am from the tribe of Benjamin. You cannot find a person more Hebrew than myself! My ancestors were all Hebrews. And it was as a Pharisee that I obeyed all the laws of Moses and what our ancestors taught about them.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 Even so, I myself could have confidence in the flesh. If anyone thinks he has confidence in the flesh, I could have even more.
\v 5 I was circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; with regard to the law, a Pharisee.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Even so** - "Yet" or "However"
  * **I myself could have confidence in the flesh. If anyone thinks he has confidence in the flesh, I could have even more** - This is a hypothetical situation that Paul does not believe is possible. Paul says if it were possible that God would save people based on what they did, then God would certainly have saved him. AT: "No one can do enough things to please God, but if anyone could do enough things to please God, I could do more good things and please God more than anyone" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **I myself** - Paul uses "myself" for emphasis. AT: "certainly I" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_rpronouns]])
  * **I was circumcised** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "A priest circumcised me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the eighth day** - "seven days after I was born" 
  * **a Hebrew of Hebrews** - Possible meanings are 1) "a Hebrew son with Hebrew parents" or 2) "the purest Hebrew."
  * **with regard to the law, a Pharisee** - "as a Pharisee, I was completely devoted to the law"
