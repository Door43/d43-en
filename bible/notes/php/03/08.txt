\v 8 More than that, I consider all things to be worthless, compared to how great it is to know Christ Jesus my Lord. Because I \add want to know\add* him \add better\add* \f + \ft Or: In order that I \add may know\add* him \add better\add* \f*, I have rejected all things as worthless. I consider them \add as useless as\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* rubbish, in order that I may have \add a close relationship with\add* Christ \f + \ft metaphor \f*,
\v 9 and in order that I may completely belong to him. It was not as a result of \add my obeying\add* the laws \add he gave Moses\add* that God erased the record of my sins. Instead, it is because I have trusted in Christ \add that God\add* has declared the guilt for my sins to be ended and he enables me to act righteously. \add It is\add* God \add himself who\add* has erased the record of my sins, and he enables me to act righteously, \add only\add* because I have trusted \add in Christ\add*.
\v 10 I \add want\add* to know Christ \add better and better\add*. Particularly, I \add want\add* to continually experience \add his working\add* powerfully in me\f + \ft Or: my life \f*, \add just like God worked powerfully when he\add* caused Christ to become alive after he died. I \add also want to be continually willing\add* to suffer \add in order that I may obey God\add*, just like Christ suffered \add in order that he might obey God. I also want\add* to be completely willing to die for \add Christ\add*, even as he died for me,
\v 11 \add because I expect that, as a result of God's goodness\add*, he will cause me to live again after I have died.

\v 8 Instead, even more I now consider all things as not only worthless, but as useless garbage to throw away, compared to how great it is to know Christ Jesus my Lord. I have removed from my life everything worthless, in order to  benefit from Christ.
\v 9 I now belong completely to Christ. I know that I cannot make myself good in God's sight by keeping the Law. Instead I trust totally in Christ, so God has declared me good in His sight.
\v 10 When God declared me good in his sight, he did this so that I could begin to know Christ; so that God could begin to work in me with the same power with which he raised Christ from the dead; so that I could begin to suffer along with Christ as he suffered; and so that Christ could make me more like him when he died.
\v 11 All of this is because I fully expect that God will cause me to live again, as he has promised.

\v 8 In fact, now I count all things to be loss because of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord. For him I have discarded all things; I consider them garbage so that I may gain Christ.
\v 9 And now I am found in him; I do not have a righteousness of my own from the law. Instead, I have the righteousness from God that is through faith in Christ.
\v 10 It is a righteousness of knowing him, the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferingsâ€”and I am transformed by Christ into the likeness of his death,
\v 11 so somehow I may experience the resurrection from the dead.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **In fact**  - "Really," or "Truly,"
  * **now I count**  - The word "now" emphasizes how Paul has changed since he quit being a Pharisee and became a believer in Christ. This can made explicit: "now that I have trusted in Christ." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]])
  * **I count all things to be loss**  - Paul states it is worthless to trust in anything other than Christ. This can be translated as "I consider everything to be worthless."
  * **because of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord.**  - "because knowing Christ Jesus my Lord is worth so much more."
  * **For him I have discarded all things**  - This could be translated as "Because of him I have willingly rejected everything else."
  * **I consider them garbage**  - Paul compares anything a person may trust in to waste that is thrown out. He is emphasizing how worthless they really are. It could be translated as "I think of them as trash" or "I think of them as completely worthless. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **so that I may gain Christ**  - "so that I may have Christ alone"
  * **and now I am found in him**  - The phrase "found in him" means to have a close relationship or to be united with him. This can be translated with an active verb: "and now I have a relationship with christ" or "and now I am united with christ." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **I do not have a righteousness of my own from the law.**  - "I am not trying to please God on my own by obeying the law."
  * **Instead, I have**  - "Rather, I have" or "Exactly the opposite, I have"
  * **I have the righteousness from God that is through faith in Christ.**  - "God has accepted me because I have put my trust in Christ."
  * **It is a righteousness of knowing him**  - This can be translated as "I only want Christ so that I might know him"
  * **the power of his resurrection**  - "and know his power that gives us life"
  * **the fellowship of his sufferings**  - "and share in his sufferings"
  * **and I am transformed by Christ into the likeness of his death** - The word "transform" means to change one thing into something else. The way Jesus died resulted in eternal life. So, Paul wants his death to be like Jesus' death so he may also receive eternal life. This can be translated with an active clause: "and Christ has changed me into the likeness of his death" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **so somehow I may experience the resurrection from the dead** - The word "somehow" means Paul does not know what is going to happen to him in this life, but whatever happens it will somehow result in eternal life. This could be translated as "so that, no matter what happens to me now, I will come back to life after I die."
