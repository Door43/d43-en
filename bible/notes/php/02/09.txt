\v 9 Because of Christ's obedience to him, God honored him very much;
\q he honored him more than anyone else who has ever lived,
\q
\v 10 so that when everyone hears the name "Jesus"
\q everyone will bow down to honor him,
\q people who are in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth;
\q
\v 11 so that everyone will say the same praises, 
\q that Jesus Christ is Lord,
\q and they will praise God the Father because of him.

\q
\v 9 Therefore God also highly exalted him.

\q the knees of those in heaven and on earth and under the earth.
\q
\v 11 He did this so that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,
\q to the glory of God the Father.
