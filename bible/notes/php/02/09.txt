<usfm>
\v 9 So God honored him very much,
\q2 honored him more than anyone else who has ever lived, 
\q1
\v 10 so that when everyone hears the name "Jesus" 
\q2 they will bow down to honor him,
\q2 everyone in heaven, on earth, and under the earth;
\q1
\v 11 so that everyone will acknowledge
\q2 that Jesus Christ is Lord,

\q 
\v 9 Therefore also God highly exalted him, 
\q2 and gave him the name above every name.
