\v 22 But you know that Timothy has proven that he loves the Lord, because he worked with me to teach the good news, just as a child works with his father.
\v 23  I confidently expect to send Timothy to you as soon as I know what will happen to me.
\v 24 And because I believe that the Lord wants this to happen, I am confident that they will soon release me, and that I will come to you myself.
