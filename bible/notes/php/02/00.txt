====== Philippians 02 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations, like the ULB, prefer to set apart the lines of 2:6-11. This is a description of the "mind of Christ." This is an important teaching on the person of Jesus. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Practical instructions ==
This chapter contains many practical instructions that Paul gives to the church in Philippi. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "If any" ==
This appears to be a type of hypothetical statement, but it is not because it is assumed to be true. The translator may also translate as "since."
