\v 19 My relationship with the Lord Jesus \add leads me\add* to confidently expect that \add he will enable me\add* to send Timothy to you soon, in order that \add his telling you the news about me will encourage you. But\add* I also expect that \add his returning to me and\add* telling me the news about you will encourage me.
\v 20 \add Keep in mind that\add* I have no one \add else\add* like him who genuinely cares for you.
\v 21 All the others \add whom I have considered that I might send to you\add* are concerned \add only\add* about their own matters. They are not concerned about what Jesus Christ \add considers important\add*.

\v 19 I am trusting in the Lord Jesus to be able to send Timothy to you soon. I hope that when he returns, he will encourage me by telling me about what God is doing in your lives.
\v 20 I have no one else like Timothy who genuinely cares for you.
\v 21 All the others whom I might send to you are concerned only about their own matters. They are not concerned enough about what Jesus Christ considers important.

\v 19 But I expect in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that his report may also encourage me when I know how you are doing.
\v 20 I have no one like Timothy who will truly care for you.
\v 21 For they all seek their own interests, not the things of Jesus Christ.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **But I expect in the Lord Jesus**  - AT: "But, if the Lord Jesus is willing, I expect"
  * **For they all**  - Here the word "they" refers to a group of people Paul does not feel he can trust to send to Philippi. Paul is also expressing his displeasure with the group, who should have been able to go, but Paul does not trust them to fulfill their mission. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
