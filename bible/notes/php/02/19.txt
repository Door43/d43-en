====== Philippians 02:19-21 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm> \v 19 My relationship with the Lord Jesus \add leads me\add* to confidently expect that \add he will enable me\add* to send Timothy to you soon, in order that \add his telling you the news about me will encourage you. But\add* I also expect that \add his returning to me and\add* telling me the news about you will encourage me. \v 20 \add Keep in mind that\add* I have no one \add else\add* like him who genuinely cares for you. \v 21 All the others \add whom I have considered that I might send to you\add* are concerned \add only\add* about their own matters. They are not concerned about what Jesus Christ \add considers important\add*. </usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 19 I am trusting in the Lord Jesus to be able to send Timothy to you soon. I hope that when he returns, he will encourage me by telling me about what God is doing in your lives. \v 20 I have no one else like Timothy who genuinely cares for you. \v 21 All the others whom I might send to you are concerned only about their own matters. They are not concerned enough about what Jesus Christ considers important. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \p \v 19 But I expect in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that his report may also encourage me when I know how you are doing. \v 20 I have no one like Timothy who will truly care for you. \v 21 For they all seek their own interests, not the things of Jesus Christ. </usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **But I expect in the Lord Jesus**  - This could also be translate as "But, if the Lord Jesus is willing, I expect."
  * **For they all**  - Here the word "they" refers to a group of people Paul does not feel he can trust to send to Philippi. This may possibly refer to the group Paul mentions in 1:17.
