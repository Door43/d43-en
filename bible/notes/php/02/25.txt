\v 25 I have concluded that it is \add really\add* necessary that I send Epaphroditus \add back\add* to you. He is a fellow believer and my fellow worker, and he \add endures difficulties together with me\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add just like\add* soldiers \add endure together difficulties\add*. You sent him \add to me\add* in order that he might help me when I was needy \f + \ft euphemism \f*.
\v 26 \add But I have concluded that I must send him back to you\add* because he has been longing to see you all. Furthermore, he has been \add very\add* distressed because \add he knows that\add* you heard that he had become sick.
\v 27 Indeed, he was so sick that he almost died. However, \add he did not die\add*. Instead, God pitied him and he also pitied me, \add and as a result he healed him. God pitied me\add* because he did not want me to be even more sorrowful than I already was.

\v 25 I believe that I must send Epaphroditus back to you. He is a fellow believer and my fellow worker and soldier for Christ, and your messenger and servant whom you sent to help me in my need.
\v 26 When Epaphroditus learned that you heard he was sick, he became very worried and began longing to be there with all of you at Philippi.
\v 27 Indeed, he was so sick that he almost died, but he did not die. Instead, God was very kind to him and also to me, so that I would not have a reason to grieve much.

<usfm>
\v 25 I think it necessary to send you back Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-worker and fellow-soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need.
\v 26 Because you heard he was sick, he was deeply distressed and longed to be with you all. 
\v 27 For indeed he was so sick he almost died, but God had mercy on him. And not on him only, but also on me that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Epaphroditus**  - This is the name of a man. (See: [[en:ta:translate:translatenames]])
    * **my brother and fellow-worker and fellow-soldier**  - Here “soldier” is comparing a person who fights physical battles with a believer who fights spiritual battles. Paul is emphasizing that a believer has to struggle against evil in order to spread the gospel. This could be translated as "my fellow believer who works and struggles along with us." ([[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
    * **and your messenger and minister to my need** - "and who brings your messages to me and helps when I am in need"
    * **he was deeply distressed and longed to be with you all** - "he was very worried and wanted to be with you all"
    * **sorrow upon sorrow**  - The full meaning of this phrase can be made explicit: "sorrow added to the sorrow I already have from being in prison." (See: [[en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit]])
