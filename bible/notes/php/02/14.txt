<usfm>
\v 14 Do everything \add God or your leaders ask you to do\add*. Never complain about what they want you to do or argue with them.
\v 15 Behave like that in order that you may be completely faultless \f + \ft doublet \f* and may be perfect children of God \f + \ft doublet \f* while you live in the midst of people who are wicked and do very wicked things \f + \ft doublet \f*. As you live among them, show them clearly \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add the way they ought to behave\add*, just like the sun, moon, and stars \add show an earthly road clearly to us\add* \f + \ft simile \f*.
\v 16 Tell them the message about how \add to\add* have eternal life. I \add ask that you do that\add* in order that on the day Christ \add returns\add* I may be able to rejoice \f + \ft metonymy \f*, that I did not labor \f + \ft doublet \f* so hard among you in vain.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 Do everything without complaining or arguing,
\v 15 so that you do or think nothing wrong as you live among unbelievers--for many of these are wicked people who call evil good. Among these wicked people you should be like the stars at night that shine in the midst of darkness.
\v 16 Keep trusting in the message that can make you live forever. If you do this, I will rejoice at the time when Christ returns, because then I will know that did not work among you uselessly.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 Do everything without complaining and arguing,
\v 15 so that you may become blameless and honest children of God without blemish, and shine as lights in the world in the middle of a crooked and depraved generation. 
\v 16 Hold tightly to the word of life so that I may have reason to glory in the day of Christ, because then I will know that I did not run in vain nor labor in vain.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **blameless and honest children of God without blemish**  - The phrase "blameless...without blemish" is saying the same thing in two different ways for emphasis. Also, "blemish" compares a believer who is morally perfect with an animal that was physically perfect and used in the Old Testament as a sacrifice to God. "This can be translated as "completely innocent children of God." (See: [[en:ta:translate:doublet]] and [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
    * **shine as lights**  - This compares believers living in a way that honors God among people who dishonor God to a light shining in the dark. This could be translated as "live in a way that honors God."
    * **in the world in the middle of a crooked and depraved generation**  - Here "world" refers to all values and behaviors that do not honor God. Also, "crooked and depraved" is saying the same thing in two different ways to emphasize how wicked the generation is. This could be translated as "among wicked people who do not honor God." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
    * **to glory**  - "to rejoice" or "to be glad"
    * **in the day of Christ**  - This refers to when Jesus comes back to set up his kingdom and rule over the earth. This can be translated as "when Christ returns."
    * **I did not run in vain nor labor in vain**  - Here "run...labor" is saying the same thing in two different ways to emphasize how hard Paul has worked to help people believe in Christ. It could be translated as "I did not work for nothing." It is also a negative phrase that could be stated as a positive: "my work had a purpose." (See: [[en:ta:translate:litotes]])
