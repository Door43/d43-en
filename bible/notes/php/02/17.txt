===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **But even if my life is poured out as an offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice with great joy with you all.** - Paul is comparing his death with the Old Testament ritual where wine or olive oil is poured on top of or beside the animal sacrifice that a worshiper would offer to God. What Paul means is that he would gladly die for the Philippians if that would make them more pleasing to God. Also, "is poured out" is passive. It can be translated as an active clause: "But, even if the Romans decide to execute me, I will greatly rejoice if my death will make your faith and obedience more pleasing to God." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]] and [[en:ta:translate:active]])
    * **you** - In 2:17-18 this pronoun is plural and refers to the Philippian believers. (See: [[en:ta:translate:formsofyou-plural]])
    * **And in the same manner**  - "Likewise"
    * **you also must rejoice with great joy with me**  - The phrase "rejoice with great joy" is used for emphasis. It can be translated as "I want you to greatly rejoice with me."
