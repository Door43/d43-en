\v 17 Perhaps \add the Roman authorities\add* will execute me, \add and my blood will pour out\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add as the\add* wine pours out when the priest offers it to God \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add For your part\add*, you believe \add in Christ firmly\add*. As a result, you have given yourselves completely to God in order that you might do what he wills \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add just like a priest\add* offers a sacrifice \add completely to God\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add Because I dedicate myself wholly to God\add* together with you, even if \add they are about to execute me\add*, I will greatly rejoice \f + \ft doublet \f*, \add because I am giving myself wholly to God\add*, and because you all \add are giving yourselves wholly to God\add*.
\v 18 Similarly, you too should rejoice \add because you are giving yourselves wholly to God\add*, and you should rejoice because I \add am giving myself wholly to God\add*.

\v 17 And I will greatly rejoice with you all, even if they kill me, and my blood pours out like something I offer to God. It will be in addition to what you sacrifice to God because you trust in him.
\v 18 In the same way you, too, should rejoice together with me!

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But even if I am poured out as an offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and I rejoice with you all** - Paul speaks of his death as if he were a drink offering which is poured upon the animal sacrifice to honor God. What Paul means is that he would gladly die for the Philippians if that would make them more pleasing to God. Also, this can be expressed in active form. AT: "But, even if the Romans decide to execute me, I will greatly rejoice if my death will make your faith and obedience more pleasing to God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **you also rejoice, and you rejoice with me** - These two expressions together signal intense joy. "I want you to greatly rejoice with me"
