\v 5 You should think\f + \ft Or: act \f* just like Christ Jesus \add thought\f + \ft Or: acted \f*\add*.
\v 6 \add Although\add* he has the same nature as God has, he did not insist on keeping all the privileges of being equal with God.
\v 7 Instead, he \add willingly\add* gave up divine privileges. \add Specifically\add*, he became a human being and took the attitude of a servant. When he had become a human being,
\v 8 he humbled himself \add even more. Specifically\add*, he obeyed \add God\add* even to the extent of \add being willing to\add* die. \add He was even willing to\add* be nailed to a cross, \add to die as though he was a criminal\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Think the same way as Christ Jesus thinks:
\q
\v 6 Although he is deserving of all the honors that God should receive, 
\q he took his honors and laid them down, and did not hold on to them.
\q
\v 7 Instead, he gave up everything.
\q He took on the qualities of a servant,
\q and he became a human being.
\q He shared the nature of human beings, though he was still God,
\q
\v 8 And he humbled himself by taking on human form,
\q and in his humility he obeyed God 
\q even though obedience to God meant he had to die,
\q and he died a terrible death, the death of a criminal, death on the cross.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Think in the way that was also in Christ Jesus.
\q
\v 6 He existed in the form of God,
\q but he did not consider his equality with God
\q as something to hold on to.
\q
\v 7 Instead, he emptied himself.
\q He took the form of a servant.
\q He appeared in the likeness of men.
\q He was found in appearance as a man.
\q
\v 8 He humbled himself and became obedient until death,
\q the death of the cross.

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **Think in the way that was also in Christ Jesus** - "Have the same attitude that Christ Jesus had" or "Think about things the way Christ Jesus did" 
  * **he did not consider his equality with God as something to hold on to** - Paul is speaking here of equality with God the Father as if it were something that Christ could grasp with his hands. As the UDB makes clear, during Christ's time on earth, he did not cease to be God; instead, he ceased to act as God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he emptied himself** - Paul speaks of Christ as if he were a container in order to say that Christ refused to act with his divine powers during his ministry on earth. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **He was found in appearance as a man. He humbled** - The words "was found ... as" is an idiom for "was" or "became." "Having become a human being, he humbled" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]). Your language might have a similar idiom, such as "Everyone could see he was a human being. He humbled." 
  * **became obedient until death** - Paul speaks of death here in a figurative way. The translator can understand it either as a metaphor of location (Christ went all the way to death) or as a metaphor of time (Christ was obedient even until the time that he died).  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **the death of the cross** - "death on a cross"
