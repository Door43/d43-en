\v 5 Have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus,
\q 
\v 6 who existed in the form of God.
\q2 He did not consider his equality with God 
\q3 as something to hold on to.
\q 
\v 7 But instead he emptied himself. 
\q2 He took the form of a servant. 
\q2 He appeared in the likeness of men. 
\q  He was found in appearance as a man.
\q2 
\v 8 He humbled himself and obeyed to the point of death, 
\q2   even the death of the cross.
