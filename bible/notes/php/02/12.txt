====== Philippians 02:12-13 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 My dear friends, as you consider this, since you have always obeyed \add God\add*, each of you should very reverentially \f + \ft doublet \f* try to do those things \add that are proper for people whom God has\add* saved. \add You should do those things\add* not only when I am with you. \add Instead, you should try\add* even more \add to do them\add* now when I am not with you.
\v 13 \add You are able to do these things\add*, since God \add himself\add* causes you to desire to do what he wants you to do, and he also enables you to do what he wants you to do.

<usfm>
\v 12 My dear friends, as you always obeyed God when I was with you, now that I am apart from you, obey him even more. Honor God together, be humble, and do your best to live as those whom God is saving.
\v 13 For God is working in your hearts so that you will want to do and then actually do the good things that please him.

\v 12 So then, my beloved, as you always obey, not only in my presence but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
\v 13 For it is God who is working in you both to will and to work for his good pleasure.
