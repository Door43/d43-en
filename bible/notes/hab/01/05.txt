\v 5 Yahweh replied to me,
\q1 "This is happening, but look around at what is happening in the other nations.
\q2 If you look, you will be amazed, and even astonished, since I am doing something
\q1 during this time that you would never have believed would happen,
\q2 even if someone told you about it.
\q1
\v 6 Very soon I will bring the soldiers of Babylonia, who are fierce and swift.
\q1 They will march across the entire earth
\q2 and conquer many other countries.
\q1
\v 7 They are a people whom others fear very much,
\q2 and they do whatever they want to,
\q2 because they believe that they are very great and that they have the right to judge everyone else.

\v 5 "Look at the nations and examine them; be amazed and astonished!
\q For I am surely about to do something in your days that you will not believe when it is reported to you.
\q
\v 6 For look! I am about to raise up the Chaldeans—that fierce and impetuous nation—
\q they are marching throughout the breadth of the land to seize homes that were not their own.
\q
\v 7 They are terrifying and fearsome; their judgment and splendor proceed from themselves.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh responds to Habakkuk.

  * **be amazed and astonished** - The words "amazed" and "astonished" share similar meanings. Together they emphasize the strength of the emotion. AT: "be very amazed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **in your days** - This idiom refers to Habakkuk's lifetime. AT: "during your lifetime" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **when it is reported to you** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "when someone reports it to you" or "when you hear about it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **look!** - The word "look!" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.
  * **I am about to raise up the Chaldeans** - Yahweh speaks of making the Chaldeans powerful as if he were raising them up. AT: "I am about to make the Chaldeans very powerful" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **impetuous** - Possible meanings are 1) "violent" or 2) "hasty."
  * **the breadth of the land** - This can mean 1) everywhere in Judah or 2) everywhere in the world. This would be an exaggeration to emphasize how powerful the Chaldean army is. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **They are terrifying and fearsome** - The words "terrifying" and "fearsome" share similar meanings. Together they emphasize the fear that the Chaldeans instilled in other people. AT: "They cause others to be greatly terrified" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **their judgment and splendor proceed from themselves** - The word "splendor" represents their pride in how they view themselves. Yahweh speaks of their opinion of themselves as if the qualities of judgment and splendor came from them. AT: "because they are prideful, they decide for themselves what judgment looks like" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
