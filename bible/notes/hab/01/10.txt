<usfm>
\v 10 They make fun of kings and princes \add of other countries\add*,
\q2 and they ridicule all the cities that have high walls around them.
\q1 They pile dirt \add outside those walls\add*
\q2 \add in order to climb up\add* and capture those cities.
\q1
\v 11 They rush past like the wind,
\q2 and then they go \add to attack other cities\add*,
\q1 But they are very guilty,
\q2 because \add they think that\add* their own power is their god."

<usfm>
\q
\v 10 So they mock kings, and rulers are only a mockery for them.
\q They laugh at every stronghold, for they heap up earth and take them.

\q
\v 11 Then the wind will rush on; it will move past—guilty men, those whose might is their god."
