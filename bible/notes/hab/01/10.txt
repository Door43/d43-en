\q2 \add in order to climb up\add* and capture those cities.

\v 11 They rush past like the wind,
\q2 and then they go \add to attack other cities\add*,
\q1 But they are very guilty,
\q2 because \add they think that\add* their own power is their god."

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues describing the Chaldean soldiers.

  * **the wind will rush on** - The invading Chaldean army is compared to the wind which rushes through one area and  quickly continues on to the next place. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
