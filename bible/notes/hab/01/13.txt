===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 13 Your eyes are too pure to gaze upon evil, and you are not able to look on wrongdoing with favor; 
\q why then have you looked favorably on those who betray?
\q Why are you silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves?
\q
\v 14 You make men like fish in the sea, like creeping things without a ruler over them.

===== Translation Notes: =====
Habakkuk continues speaking to Yahweh about the Chaldeans.

    * **"those who betray"**  - "the Chaldeans, whom no one can trust"
    * **swallow up** - "destroy" (UDB)
    * **like fish in the sea ... like creeping things** - These two phrases express the same idea that God has allowed the Chaldeans to treat the Israelites as if they were creatures with very little value, and not like people should be treated. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
