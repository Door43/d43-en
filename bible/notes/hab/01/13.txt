<usfm>
\q
\v 13 Your eyes are too pure to gaze upon evil, and you are not able to look on wrongdoing with favor; 
\q why then have you looked favorably on those who betray?
\q Why are you silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves?
\q
\v 14 You make men like fish in the sea, like creeping things without a ruler over them.
