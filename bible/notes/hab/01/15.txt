\v 15 They bring up all of them with fishhooks; they drag men away in fish-nets and gather them in their net. This is why they rejoice and shout exuberantly!
\v 16 Therefore they sacrifice to their fishing-net and burn incense to their net, for fattened beasts are their portion and the fatty meat is their food!
\v 17 Will they therefore empty their net and continue to slaughter the nations, feeling no compassion?"
