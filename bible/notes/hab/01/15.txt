\q
\v 15 They bring up all of them with fishhooks; they drag men away in fish-nets 
\q and gather them in their net. This is why they rejoice and shout exuberantly!
\q
\v 16 Therefore they sacrifice to their fishing-net and burn incense to their net, 
\q for fattened beasts are their portion, and the fatty meat is their food!
\q
\v 17 Will they therefore empty their net and continue to slaughter the nations, feeling no compassion?"

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **"They"**  - The word "they" refers to the Babylonians/Chaldeans.
    * **They bring up all of them with fishhooks; they drag men away in fish-nets
and gather them in their net** - The words "fishhooks" and "fish-nets" are tools used to catch fish.  The word "net" is a tool used to catch small animals.  These words are used to show how easy it is for the Chaldeans to capture and kill people. (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
    * **fattened beasts are their portion, and the fatty meat is their food** - These are two ways to say the same thing. Alternate translation: "fatty meat is their share of the food" (See: [[en:ta:translate:parallelism]])
    * **portion** - A small part of something bigger that is shared between many people.
    * **"Will they therefore empty their net and continue to slaughter the nations, feeling no compassion?"**  - Habakkuk is asking Yahweh if the Chaldeans will be allowed to continue capturing and killing people.  The phrase "empty their net" is used to compare the Chaldeans moving from nation to nation with a fisherman who will empty his net in order to throw it again and catch more fish. (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
