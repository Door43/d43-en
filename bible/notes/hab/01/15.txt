\q
\v 15 They bring up all of them with fishhooks; they drag men away in fishnets 
\q and gather them in their net. This is why they rejoice and shout exuberantly!
\q
\v 16 Therefore they sacrifice to their fishing net and burn incense to their net, 
\q for fattened beasts are their portion, and the fatty meat is their food!
\q
\v 17 Will they therefore empty their net and continue to slaughter the nations, feeling no compassion?"

  * **net** - a tool used to catch "creeping things" ([[:en:bible:notes:hab:01:13|1:14]])
  * **fattened beasts are their portion, and the fatty meat is their food** - Alternate translation: "the best animals and the finest meat is their share of the food" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **portion** - a small part of something bigger that is shared between many people
  * **empty their net**  - A fisherman will empty his net in order to throw it again and catch more fish. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
