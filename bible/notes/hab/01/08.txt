\q
\v 8 Their horses also are swifter than leopards, quicker than the evening wolves! 
\q So their horses stamp, 
\q and their horsemen come from a great distance—they fly like an eagle hurrying to eat!
\q
\v 9 They all come for violence, 
\q their multitudes go like a desert wind, and they gather captives like sand!
