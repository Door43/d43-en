\v 8 Their horses also are swifter than leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves; and their horsemen press proudly on: yea, their horsemen come from far; they fly as an eagle that hastens to devour.
\v 9 They come all of them for violence; the set of their faces is forwards; and they gather captives as the sand.
