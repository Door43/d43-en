====== Habakkuk 01:8-9 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 The horses \add that pull their chariots\add* go faster than leopards,
\q2 and they are fiercer than wolves are in the evening.
\q1 The horses on which the soldiers ride gallop swiftly;
\q2 the soldiers riding them come from distant places.
\q1 They are like \f + \ft simile \f* eagles that swoop down to \add snatch and\add* kill small animals.
\q1
\v 9 As they ride along,
\q2 they are determined to act violently.
\q1 They advance like \f + \ft simile \f* a wind from the desert,
\q2 gathering prisoners that are as \add numerous as grains of\add* sand.

\q1 They advance eagerly, as fast as the wind over the desert,
\q2 and gather up as many prisoners as there are grains of sand!

\q
\v 8 Their horses also are swifter than leopards, quicker than the evening wolves! 
\q So their horses stamp, 
\q and their horsemen come from a great distance—they fly like an eagle hurrying to eat!
\q
\v 9 They all come for violence, 
\q their multitudes go like a desert wind, and they gather captives like sand!

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Their horses...their horses** - the horses of the Chaldean soldiers
    * **quicker than the evening wolves** - The horses of the Chaldeans are compared to fierce wolves that run after their prey in the evening when they are very hungry because they have not eaten all day. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **their horsemen** - The Chaldeans' soldiers riding the horses.
    * **leopards** - large, swift cats (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
    * **they fly like an eagle**  - "the horsemen ride as quickly as eagles fly" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
    * **their multitudes go like a desert wind, and they gather captives like sand** - The Chaldeans are many, and like the grains of sand the wind picks up in a storm are too many to count, so no one can count the people they capture and make prisoners. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
