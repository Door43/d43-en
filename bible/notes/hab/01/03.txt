===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 3 Why do you make me see iniquity and look upon wrongdoing? 
\q Destruction and violence are before me; there is strife, and contention rises up!
\q
\v 4 Therefore the law is weakened, and justice does not last for any time. 
\q For the wicked surround the righteous; therefore false justice goes out."

===== Translation Notes: =====
Habakkuk continues his prayer to God.

    * **contention rises up** - "fighting among the people is becoming more common" 
    * **the wicked surround the righteous** - This can mean that righteous people suffer injustice because 1) "wicked people have more power than righteous people" (see UDB) or 2) "there are more wicked people than righteous people." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
