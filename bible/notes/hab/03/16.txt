\q
\v 16 I heard, and my inner parts trembled! My lips quivered at the sound.
\q Decay comes into my bones, and under myself I tremble
\q as I wait quietly for the day of distress to come upon the people who invade us.

  * **General Information:** - Habakkuk describes his reaction to his vision of Yahweh.

  * **I heard** - You may indicate what it is that Habakkuk heard. Possible meanings are 1) "I heard everything in that vision" or 2) "I heard Yahweh approach like a great storm" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **my inner parts trembled** - The word translated here as "inner parts" is literally "belly." If your language has a specific internal organ that it uses to express the feeling of great fear, you can consider using it here. AT: "my heart beat rapidly" or "my stomach turned" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **My lips quivered at the sound** - Quivering lips is another spontaneous response that comes with great fear.
  * **Decay comes into my bones** - Habakkuk speaks of having no strength in his body as if his bones began to decay. You may consider using an idiom from your own language here.

  * **under myself I tremble** - The words "under myself" refer to what is below him. Possible meanings for the idiom are 1) "my legs tremble" or 2) "I tremble where I stand." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
