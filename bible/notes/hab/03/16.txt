\v 16 I heard, and my inner parts trembled! My lips quivered at the sound!
\q Decay comes into my bones, and under myself I tremble

===== Translation Notes: =====

Habakkuk describes his fear when he thinks about how Yahweh would punish the Chaldeans.

    * **my inner parts trembled! My lips quivered...Decay comes into my bones...under myself I tremble**  - These refer to fear caused by thinking about future events. Habakkuk uses several parts of his body to express that every part of him is afraid.  (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **Decay** - rot
