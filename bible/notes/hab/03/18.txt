===== Translation Notes: =====

Habakkuk praises Yahweh.

  * **rejoice…be happy **- Both words mean "be joyful" (see UDB), but if your language has a special word for rejoicing after winning a battle, use that for "exult" here.
  * **makes my feet like hinds' feet and leads me upon my high places**  - Feet like a hind, or a deer, would give Habakkuk the ability to climb steep rocky cliffs. The words "high places" refer to places out of the reach of danger. He is saying God is giving him the ability to find a place of safety. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown|Translate Unknowns]])
