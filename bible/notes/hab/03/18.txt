===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Habakkuk praises Yahweh.

  * **rejoice ... be happy** - Both words mean "be joyful," but if your language has a special word for rejoicing after winning a battle, use that "exult" here.
  * **makes my feet like the deer's; he leads me upon my high places** - Feet like a deer would give Habakkuk the ability to climb steep rocky cliffs. The words "high places" refer to places out of the reach of danger. He is saying God is giving him the ability to find a place of safety. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
