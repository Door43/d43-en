\p
\v 1 The prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, as a lamentation:
[[Shigionoth is an obscure term usually left untranslated, but this might be confusing for a MTT. The sense seems to be that this is some form of lamentation, so I went with that interpretation. We can change this if you think it would be better that way.]]
\q
\v 2 Yahweh, I have heard your report, and I am afraid!
\q Yahweh, revive your work in the midst of these times, in the midst of these times make it known;
\q remember compassion in your wrath!
