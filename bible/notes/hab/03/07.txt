===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Habakkuk continues to describe his vision of Yahweh.

  * **I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction, and the fabric of the tents in the land of Midian trembling** - Possible meanings are 1) the words "the tents" and "the fabric of the tents" are metonyms for the people who live in those tents. AT: "I saw the people who live in tents in the land of Cushan in affliction, and the people who live in tents in the land of Midian trembling" or 2) this is a metaphor in which Habakkuk speaks of the tents in Cushan and Midian being blown about by a storm as if the tents were people who were trembling in affliction. AT: "I saw the tents of Cushan blown about like people in affliction, and the fabric of the tents in the land of Midian trembling as if they were people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Cushan** - This can be 1) the name of a people group otherwise unknown or 2) the same as Cush. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **you rode upon your horses and your victorious chariots** - The phrases "your horses" and "your victorious chariots" both refer to the same thing. This speaks of Yahweh as if he were a warrior riding a horse-drawn chariot into battle. AT: "you rode your horse-drawn chariots to victory" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
