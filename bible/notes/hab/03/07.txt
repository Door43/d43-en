===== Translation Notes: =====
Habakkuk continues to describe his vision of Yahweh.

    * **the tents of Cushan in affliction, and the fabric of the tents...of Midian trembling** - The people of Midian and Cushan who tremble or shake with fear are like tent cloth that moves when the wind blows. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **Cushan** - This can be 1) the name of a people group otherwise unknown or 2) the same as Cush. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]) and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
    * **Was Yahweh angry with the rivers? Was your wrath against the rivers, or your fury against the sea...?** - If your language does not have separate words for "angry" and "wrath" and "fury," you can combine the lines: "Was Yahweh angry with the rivers? Was your fury against the sea...?" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) Alternate translation: "Yahweh was not angry with the rivers. Your wrath was not against the rivers, nor was your fury against the sea...." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **you rode upon your horses, your chariot of salvation** - As a soldier would ride a horse or a chariot into battle, Yahweh came to save the people of Israel.
