\v 9 You have brought out your bow without a cover; you put arrows to your bow! \qs Selah. \qs*

    * **Selah**  - This term means "stop and reflect" or "lift up, exalt." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
    * **The mountains saw you and twisted in pain** - As God divided the earth, the mountains moved, as if they could see God's actions and react by turning away from where the earth was divided. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
    * **the deep sea raised a shout!** - the sound of large waves in the sea
    * **It lifted up its waves!** - water levels rise
