===== Translation Notes: =====
Habakkuk describes Yahweh destroying the Chaldeans.

    * **they came like a storm** - The power and quickness of the Chaldeans as they attacked the people of Israel is compared to the coming of a sudden storm. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
    * **gloating** - "bragging"
    * **devours the poor in a hiding place** - finds poor people who are hiding from them and kills them and takes all their goods (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **devours** - eats everything quickly
