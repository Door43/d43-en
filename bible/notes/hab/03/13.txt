  * **General Information:** - Habakkuk describes Yahweh.

  * **your anointed one** - This can also mean "your Messiah," but the reference is clearly to "your people," so use a common noun here, not as a proper name.
  * **You shatter the head of the house of the wicked** - "You completely destroy the leader of the wicked people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
