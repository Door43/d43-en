\v 17 Therefore,
\q1 even if there are no blossoms on the fig trees,
\q2 and there are no grapes on the grapevines,
\q1 and even if there are no olives growing on the olive trees,
\q2 and there are no crops in the fields,
\q1 and even if the flocks of sheep and goats die in the fields,
\q2 and there are no cattle in the stalls, this is what I will do.

<usfm>
\q2
\v 17 Though the fig tree does not bud and there is no produce from the vines;
\q2 though the produce of the olive tree disappoints, and the fields yield no food;
\q2 though the flock is cut off from the fold, and there is no cattle in the stalls—

  * **fig tree ... vines ... olive tree ... fields ... flock ... cattle** - there is no food. These are almost all the sources of food to be found in the land of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
