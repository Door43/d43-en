\v 6 Won't all of these people take up a parable against him and a taunting proverb regarding him, and say, 'Woe to the one increasing what is not his! For how long? 
For debt will weigh heavy upon him!'
\v 7 Won't they ones gnashing at you rise up suddenly, and the ones terrifying you awaken? You will be a spoil for them!
\v 8 Because you have plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples will plunder you, on account of the blood of man and the violence done to the land, 
the village, and the inhabitants of it.
