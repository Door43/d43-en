\v 6 Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increases that which is not his! how long? and that ladeth himself with pledges!
\v 7 Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and you shall be for booty to them?
\v 8 Because you have plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples shall plunder thee, because of men’s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all that dwell therein.
