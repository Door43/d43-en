<usfm>
\v 4 Think about the proud \add people of Babylonia\add*!
\q2 They are certainly not doing what is righteous.
\q1 But people who are righteous will live
\q2 because they faithfully \add do what I want them to do\add*.
\q1
\v 5 If people \add trust in their wealth\add* they will deceive themselves,
\q2 and proud people are never able to rest.
\q1 \add It is as though\add* the greedy people \add of Babylonia open their mouths\add* as wide as the place where dead people are,
\q1 and they never have enough,
\q2 like \add the place where\add* dead people go never has enough dead people \f + \ft personification \f*.
\q1 The \add armies of Babylonia\add* conquer many nations for themselves,
\q2 and capture all their people.

\v 5 If people live for excess such as wine, they will deceive themselves,
\q2 and proud people are never able to rest.
\q1 Greedy people open their mouths as wide as the place where dead people are,
\q1 and they never have enough,
\q2 just like the place of the dead never has enough dead people.
\q1 The armies of Babylonia conquer many nations for themselves,
\q2 and capture all their people.

\q
\v 4 Look! The one whose desires are not right within him, is puffed up. But the righteous will live by his faith.
\p
\q
\v 5 For wine is a betrayer of the arrogant young man so that he will not abide, 
\q but enlarges his desire like the grave and, like death, is never satisfied.
\q He gathers to himself every nation and gathers up for himself all of the peoples.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to answer Habakkuk.

  * **Look!** - The word "Look!" here adds emphasis to what follows.
  * **The one whose desires are not upright within him ... the arrogant young man ... he will not abide, but enlarges his desire ... He gathers to himself ... gathers up for himself** - Yahweh speaks of the Chaldeans as though they are one person.
  * **He gathers to himself every nation and gathers up for himself all of the peoples** - This is saying the same thing in two different ways. "He collects all the people from every nation" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) "He" refers to the Chaldeans as though they are one person.
  * **gathers** - "collects"
  * **every ... all** - a very large number (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
