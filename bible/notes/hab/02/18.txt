\v 18 What does the carved figure profit you? For the one who has carved it, or who casts a figure from molten metal, is a teacher of lies;
\q for he trusts his own handiwork when he makes these mute gods.
\q
\v 19 'Woe to the one saying to the wood, Wake up! Or to the silent stone, Arise!' Do these things teach? 
\q See, it is overlaid with gold and silver, but there is no breath at all within it.
\q
\v 20 But Yahweh is in his holy temple! Be silent before him, all the land!"

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **you**  - the word "you" refers to the Chaldeans.
    * **cast figure** - This is a statue created by pouring liquid metal into something carved in the form that is wanted.  The metal will take the form of the cast and harden as a figure or statue.
    * **molten** - This is the word for metal when it is in its liquid form.
    * **he is a teacher of lies** - This phrase refers to the carved figure.  By being in the form of a false god, he is teaching a lie.
    * **the former trusts his own form** - The phrase "the former" means the one who came before.  In this passage "the one who carved it" is mentioned before, or former to "his cast figure." The idol maker is making his idols to look like humans. "The one who cared the idol believes gods look like humans"
    * **these mute gods** - English translations refer to a false god using a small “g” and write God with a large “G” when referring to the one true God. Other languages may also choose to do that. Another option would be to use a different word to refer to the false gods.
