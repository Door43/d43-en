\v 18 What does the idol profit you? For the one forming his idol from molten metal is a teacher of lies since he trusts his own handiwork when he makes these false gods.
\v 19 'Woe to the one saying to the wood, Wake up! Or to the silent stone, Arise!' Do these teach? He himself engraves the gold and silver, and there is spirit at all within it.
\v 20 But Yahweh is in his holy temple! Be silent before him, all the land!"
