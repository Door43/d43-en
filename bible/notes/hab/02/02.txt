\v 2 Then Yahweh replied to me,
\q1 "Write plainly on tablets \add what I am revealing to you in\add* this vision,
\q2 \add and then read it to a messenger\add*
\q2 in order that he can run with it \add to tell it to\add* other people.
\q1
\v 3 In this vision \add I will be talking about things that will happen\add* in the future.
\q1 Now is not the time when those things will happen,
\q2 but they certainly will happen,
\q2 and when they occur, they will occur quickly,
\q2 and they will not be delayed.
\q1 Now you \add want those things to happen immediately, but\add* they are not happening.
\q2 But wait patiently for them \add to happen\add*!

\v 2 Yahweh answered me and said, 
\q "Record this vision, and write plainly upon the tablets so that the one reading them might run!
\q
\v 3 For the vision is yet for a future time and will finally speak and not fail. 
\q Though it delays, wait for it! For it will surely come and will not tarry!

===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh answers Habakkuk.

    * **Record this vision, and write plainly upon the tablets** - Both of these phrases are saying the same thing in two different ways. Alternate translation: "Write clearly on tablets what God is about to tell you" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])  
    * **tablets**  - These are flat pieces of stone or clay that were used for writing.
    * **the one reading them might run** - This can mean 1) someone will run with the tablets and read them to people (see UDB) or 2) anyone who reads them will be able to read them easily (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **and will finally speak** - What is written will happen or become real. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
    * **and will not tarry** - Possible meanings: 1) "and will not wait" or 2) "and will not come slowly"
