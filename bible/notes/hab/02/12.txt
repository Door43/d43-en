===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to answer Habakkuk. He refers to the Chaldeans as though they are one person. 

  * **Woe to the one who builds a city with blood, and who establishes a town in iniquity** - These two phrases are saying the same thing in different ways. Alternate translation: "A warning to the Chaldeans who built their cities with what they have stolen from the people they have killed" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **with blood** - by killing people (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]). Alternate translation: "the one who kills people and steals their goods in order to build a city." (See [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **and who establishes a town in iniquity** - "The one who starts a town through evil behavior." The Chaldeans built their cities using goods stolen from the people they killed. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Is it not from Yahweh of Hosts that peoples labor for fire and that the nations weary themselves for nothing?** - God has caused the destruction of what the people built. It is said in two different ways in order to make the meaning more clear. Alternate translation: "Yahweh is the one who causes what people work hard to build to be destroyed by fire and result in nothing." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
