===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to answer Habakkuk. He refers to the Chaldeans as though they are one person. 

  * **who carves out evil gains for his house** - "who works to get dishonest profits for his family"
  * **set his nest on high** - "builds his house far from trouble"
  * **the hand of evil**  - This can be translated 1) "the hand of evil," treating "evil" as a person (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]]) or 2) "evil people" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]]).
  * **You have devised shame for your house by cutting off many people** - "Because you cut off many people, your family will be suffer shame"
  * **You** - singular (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_yousingular]])
  * **cutting off** - destroying (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]
  * **sinned against your own soul** - "hurt yourself"
  * **stones...rafters of timber** - The "stones" and "rafters of timber" represent the people hurt in the building of the house, who in turn represent the people destroyed by the Chaldeans. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **cry out** - make accusations to God against the house builder
