\v 15 Woe to the one making his neighbor drink, you who add your poison until you make them drunk so you can look on their nakedness!'
\v 16 You are gorged with shame rather than glory! Drink of it also, and reveal your uncircumcision! The cup of Yahweh's right hand will surround you, 
and disgrace will cover your glory.
