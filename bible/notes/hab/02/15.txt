\p
\v 15 Woe to him that gives his neighbor drink, to you that addest your venom, and make him drunken also, that you may look on their nakedness!
\v 16 You are filled with shame, and not glory: drink you also, and be as one uncircumcised; the cup of Jehovah’s right hand shall come round to thee, and foul shame shall be upon your glory.
