    * **"the one"**  - The phrase "the one" refers to the Babylonians/Chaldeans.
    * **"The cup of Yahweh's right hand"**  - This phrase means Yahweh's judgement is represented as a cup. It is  held in the hand of power which is the right hand. This continues the image of a cup being forced upon another that has been previously developed earlier in the book. (See: [[en:ta:translate:personification]])
