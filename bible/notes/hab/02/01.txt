===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **I...my...me**  - Habakkuk
    * **he**  - Yahweh
    * **I will stand at my guard-post and station myself on the watchtower** - These phrases say the same thing in two different ways. "I will stand at my post on the watchtower" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])  Habakkuk uses these phrases to compare himself waiting to hear from God to a soldier standing guard on a watchtower. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **I should turn from my complaint** - The word "turn" compares someone changing their mind to turning from one thing to another. "I should stop complaining and agree with God." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
