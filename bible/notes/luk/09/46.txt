\v 46 Sometime later, the disciples began to argue among themselves about which one of them would be the most important.
\v 47 But Jesus knew what they were thinking, so he brought a young child to stand beside him.
\v 48 He said to them, "If someone welcomes a little child like this because of me, it is the same as welcoming me. And if someone welcomes me, it is the same as welcoming God, who sent me. Remember that those among you who seem to be the least important are the ones whom God considers to be most important."

\v 46 Then an argument started among them about which of them would be the greatest.
\v 47 But Jesus, knowing the reasoning in their hearts, took a little child and put him by his side
\v 48 and said to them, "Whoever welcomes this child in my name, welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me, welcomes the one who sent me. For whoever is least among you all is the one who is great."
