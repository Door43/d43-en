===== translationNotes: =====

  * **someone** - This was not one of the disciples.
  * **Foxes have holes ... nowhere to lay his head** - Jesus responds with a proverb to teach the man about being Jesus' disciple. Jesus implies that if the man were to follow him, that man too might not have a home. AT: "Foxes have holes ... nowhere to lay his head. So do not expect that you will have a home" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_proverbs]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Foxes** - These are land animals similar to small dogs. They sleep in a den or a burrow in the ground.
  * **birds in the sky** - "birds that fly in the air"
  * **Son of Man** - Jesus is speaking about himself in the third person. AT: "I, the Son of Man" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **nowhere to lay his head** - "nowhere to rest my head" or "nowhere to sleep." Jesus exaggerates to emphasize that he has no permanent home and that people did not often invite him to stay with them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
