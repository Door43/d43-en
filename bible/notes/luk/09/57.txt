===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **someone**  - This was not one of the disciples.
  * **Foxes have holes…nowhere to lay his head**  - Jesus was implying that if the the man were to follow him, that man too might not have a home. The implied information can be made explicit: "So do not expect that you will have a home." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]])
  * **Foxes**  - These are land animals similar to small dogs. They sleep in a den or a burrow in the ground.
  * **birds of the sky**  - "birds that fly in the air"
  * **Son of Man**  - Jesus is speaking about himself in the third person. This could be translated as "I, the Son of Man." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:123person|First, Second or Third Person]])
  * **nowhere to lay his head**  - "nowhere to rest my head" or "nowhere to sleep." This is a hyperbole. Jesus is exaggerating in order to get across the point that he was not welcome anywhere to live. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:hyperbole|Hyperbole]])
