===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Foxes** - These are land animals similar to small dogs. They sleep in a den or a burrow in the ground.
    * **someone** - This was not one of the disciples.
    * **birds of the sky** - "birds that fly in the air"
    * **Son of Man** - Jesus is speaking about himself in the third person. This could be translated as "I, the Son of Man." (See: talink 123 Person)
    * **nowhere to lay his head** -  "nowhere to rest my head" or "nowhere to sleep." This is a hyperbole. Jesus is exaggerating to say that he did not have a home of any kind. (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:hyperbole]])
