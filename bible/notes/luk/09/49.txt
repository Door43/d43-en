\v 49 John replied to Jesus, "Master, we saw a man who was using your name to command demons to come out of people. So we told him to stop doing that, because he is not following you as part of our group."

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **John answered and said**  - "in answer, John said" or "as an answer, John said"
    * **Master**  - The Greek word that is translated here as “Master” is a not the normal word for “Master.” This one refers to someone who has authority, and not to  someone who owns someone else. You could also translate it as "Boss" or "Foreman" or with a word that is commonly used to address a person in authority, such as “Sir.”
    * **he that is not against you is for you** - This could be translated as "if a person does not hinder you, it is if they were helping you" or "if someone is not working contrary to you, he is working in your favor." Some modern languages have sayings that mean the same thing.
