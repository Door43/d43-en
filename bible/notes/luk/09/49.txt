\v 49 John replied to Jesus, "Master, we saw a man who was using your name to command demons to come out of people. So we told him to stop doing that, because he is not following you as part of our group."
\v 50 But Jesus said, "Do not stop him from doing that! If someone is not doing something that is harmful to you, then what he is doing is helpful to you!"

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **John answered and said**  - "In reply, John said" or "John replied to Jesus." John was responding to what Jesus had said about being the greatest. He was not answering a question. He wanted to know what rank this man who was forcing out demons would have among the disciples. 
    * **Master**  - The word that is translated here as “Master” is a not the normal word for “Master.” This one refers to someone who has authority, and not to  someone who owns someone else. You could also translate it as "Boss" or "Foreman" or with a word that is commonly used to address a person in authority, such as “Sir.”
    * **in your name** - This means the person was speaking with the power and authority of Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **he that is not against you is for you** - This could be translated as "if a person does not hinder you, it is if they were helping you" or "if someone is not working contrary to you, he is working in your favor." Some modern languages have sayings that mean the same thing.
