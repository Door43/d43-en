===== translationNotes: =====

  * **John answered and said** - "In reply, John said" or "John replied to Jesus." John was responding to what Jesus had said about being the greatest. He was not answering a question. He wanted to know what rank this man who was forcing out demons would have among the disciples. 
  * **we saw** - This does not include Jesus, but only the disciples. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **in your name** - This means the person was speaking with the power and authority of Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Do not stop him** - This can be stated positively. AT: "Allow him to continue"
  * **he that is not against you is for you** - Some modern languages have sayings that mean the same thing. AT: "if a person does not hinder you, it is as if they were helping you" or "if someone is not working contrary to you, he is working in your favor"
