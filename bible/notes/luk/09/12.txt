\v 13 But he said to them, "\add No\add*, you \add yourselves\add* give them something to eat!" They replied, "We\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* have only five small loaves and two \add cooked\add* fish. Are you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* going to \add give\add* us \add the money\add* to go somewhere and buy food for all these people?"

\v 12 Now it was getting late in the day, so the twelve disciples came to him and said, "Please send this large crowd of people away so that they can go to the surrounding villages and farms to get some food and find places to stay, since we are out here in  this isolated place"
\v 13 But he said to them, "You must give them something to eat!" They replied, "All we have are five small loaves of bread and two small fish. We could never go buy enough food for all these people!"
\v 14 They said this because there were about five thousand men there. Then Jesus said to the disciples, "Tell the people to sit down in groups, with about fifty people in each group."

\v 12 The day began to come to an end, and the twelve came to him and said, "Dismiss the crowds that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find lodging and food, because we are here in a deserted place."
\v 13 But he said to them, "You give them something to eat." They said, "We have no more than five loaves of bread and two fish, unless we went and bought food for all this crowd of people."
\v 14 There were about five thousand men there. He said to his disciples, "Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each."
