====== Luke 09 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "To preach the kingdom of God" ==
There is some controversy among scholars about whether the kingdom of God here refers to the reign of God on earth or the gospel message (Jesus died for the sins of man). It is best to translate this as "to preach about the kingdom of God" or "to teach them about how God was going to show himself as king." It is best not to treat it as a metaphor for the gospel because it is unnecessary here. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
== Elijah ==

The prophet Malachi prophesied that one day Elijah would return before the Messiah came. Jesus explains that John the Baptist fulfilled this prophecy by serving God in the same manner as Elijah. Elijah is mentioned in two different ways in this chapter, the actual person of Elijah and the metaphorical return of Elijah. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:obe:kt:christ]])

== "Kingdom of God" ==
The term "kingdom of God" is used in this chapter to refer to a kingdom that is still in the future when the words were spoken. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:kingdomofgod]])

== "They saw his [Jesus'] glory" ==

The glory of God is seen as a great, brilliant light in Scripture. God's grandeur always produces fear in the person who sees it. Such an event, presented in this chapter, is called the "transfiguration," in which Jesus is changed or transfigured so that he shows some of his divine glory. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:glory]] and [[:en:obe:kt:fear]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Paradox == 

This is a statement that seems absurd or appears to contradict itself. An example in this chapter is: "Whoever would try to save his life will lose it" ([[:en:bible:notes:luk:09:23|9:24]]).

== Son of Man ==
Jesus refers to himself as the "Son of Man" in this passage. Referring to oneself using the third person may not be possible in all languages. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sonofman]])

== "Receiving" ==
The ULB uses this word several times in this chapter with a variety of meanings. Jesus says, "If someone receives a little child like this in my name, he also is receiving me, and if someone receives me, he is also receiving the one who sent me" ([[:en:bible:notes:luk:09:46|9:48]]). In this verse, "receiving" could be translated as "serving." In another verse it is said, "the people there did not receive him" ([[:en:bible:notes:luk:09:51|9:53]]). In this verse, "receive" can be translated as "believe" or "accept." (See: [[:en:obe:kt:believe]])
