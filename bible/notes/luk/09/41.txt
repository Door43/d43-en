  * **Jesus answered and said** - "In answer Jesus said"
  * **You unbelieving and corrupt generation** - This was addressed to the crowd that had gathered, and not to the disciples.
  * **how long will I have to stay with you and bear with you?** - Here "you" is plural. Jesus uses a question to scold the crowd. AT: "I have done so much and still you do not believe!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **Bring your son here** - Here "your" is singular. Jesus is speaking directly to the father who addressed him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **still coming** - "on his way" or "on the way"
