===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **And Jesus answered and said**  - Or, "And in answer Jesus said."
    * **you unbelieving and corrupt generation** - This was addressed to the crowd that had gathered, and not to the disciples.
    * **how long will I have to stay with you and bear with you?** - This is a rhetorical question. Jesus did not expect and answer. The meaning is "I have done so much and still you do not believe!" (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
    * **Bring your son here**  - Here Jesus is speaking directly to the father who addressed him.
    * **still coming**  - "on his way" or "on the way"
    * **rebuked** - "spoke harshly to"
