===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Jesus answered and said**  - "In answer Jesus said"
  * **You unbelieving and corrupt generation** - This was addressed to the crowd that had gathered, and not to the disciples.
  * **how long will I have to stay with you and bear with you?** - This is a rhetorical question. Jesus did not expect and answer. The meaning is "I have done so much and still you do not believe!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Bring your son here**  - Here Jesus is speaking directly to the father who addressed him.
  * **still coming**  - "on his way" or "on the way"
  * **rebuked** - "spoke harshly to"
