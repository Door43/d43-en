\v 26 As for people who reject my message and refuse to say that they belong to me, I, the Son of Man will also refuse to say that they belong to me when I come back in my glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.
\v 27 But I tell you this fact: some of you standing here now will not die until you see God show himself as king!"
