\v 26 Those who reject my message\add and\add* refuse to say that \add they belong\add* to me, \add I\add*, the one who came from heaven, will also refuse to say that \add they belong to me\add* when I come back with the holy angels, and have the glorious brightness that my Father has.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 26 As for people who reject my message and refuse to say that they belong to me, I, the Son of Man will also refuse to say that they belong to me when I come back in my glory and in the glory of the Father, along with the holy angels.
\v 27 But I tell you this fact: some of you standing here now will not die until you experience God's kingdom!"

<usfm>
\v 26 For whoever is ashamed of me and my words, of him shall the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in his own glory, and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.
