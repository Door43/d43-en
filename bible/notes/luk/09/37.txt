\v 37 The next day, after they had come down from the mountain, a large crowd \add of people\add* met Jesus.
\v 38 Then a man from the crowd exclaimed, "Teacher, I plead with you, \add do something to help\add* my son! He is my only child!
\v 39 At various times an evil spirit suddenly seizes him and \add causes\add* him to scream. The evil spirit shakes him violently and causes him to foam at the mouth. It does not leave until my child is completely exhausted.
\v 40 I pleaded with your disciples \add who were here\add* for them to expel \add the evil spirit\add*, but they were not able to do it!"

\v 37 The next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a large crowd of people met Jesus.
\v 38 Suddenly a man from the crowd called out, "Teacher, I plead with you, do something to help my son! He is my only child.
\v 39 An evil spirit suddenly seizes him and causes him to scream. It shakes him violently and causes him to foam at the mouth. It hardly ever leaves my child and when it does, it injures him severely.
\v 40 I pleaded with your disciples to command the evil spirit to come out of him, but they were not able to do it!"

\v 37 Now on the next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him.
\v 38 Behold, a man from the crowd cried out, saying, "Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.
\v 39 You see, a spirit takes control over him and he suddenly screams; it causes him to have convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It hardly ever leaves him and it bruises him badly.
\v 40 I begged your disciples to force it out, but they could not."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The next day after Jesus' dazzling appearance, Jesus heals a demon-possessed boy that the disciples were unable to make better.

  * **Behold, a man from the crowd** - The word "behold" alerts us to the new person in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this. English uses "There was a man in the crowd who said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_participants|Introduction of New and Old Participants]])
  * **You see, a spirit** - The phrase "You see" introduces us to the evil spirit in the man's story. Your language may have a way of doing this. English uses "There was an evil spirit" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_participants|Introduction of New and Old Participants]])
  * **he foams at the mouth** - "foam comes out of his mouth." When a person has a seizure, they can have trouble breathing or swallowing. This causes white foam to form around their mouths.
