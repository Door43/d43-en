\v 37 The next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a large crowd of people met Jesus.
\v 38 Suddenly a man from the crowd called out, "Teacher, I plead with you, do something to help my son! He is my only child.
\v 39 An evil spirit suddenly seizes him and causes him to scream. It shakes him violently and causes him to foam at the mouth. It hardly ever leaves my child and when it does, it injures him severely.
\v 40 I pleaded with your disciples to command the evil spirit to come out of him, but they were not able to do it!"

\v 37 And it happened, on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, that a great crowd of people met him.
\v 38 And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, saying, "Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child,
\v 39 and behold, a spirit takes him, and suddenly he screams, and it causes him to have convulsions with foaming at the mouth. It departs from him with difficulty, injuring him badly when it leaves.
\v 40 And I pleaded with your disciples to force it out of him, but they could not."
