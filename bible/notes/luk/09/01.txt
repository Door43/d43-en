===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus reminds his disciples not to depend on money and their things, gives them power, and then sends them out to various places.

  * **power and authority** - These two terms are used together to show that the twelve had both the ability and the right to heal people. Translate this phrase with a combination of words that include both of these ideas.
  * **all the demons** - Possible meanings are 1) "every demon" or 2) "every kind of demon."
  * **diseases** - "sicknesses" 
  * **sent them out** - "sent them to various places" or "told them to go"
