===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **the twelve **- This is the group of disciples that Jesus chose to be his apostles.
    * **power and authority**- These two terms are used together to show that the twelve had both the ability and the right to heal people. Translate this phrase with a combination of words that include both of these ideas.
    * **diseases**  - That is, "sicknesses." This refers to what makes a person sick.
    * **sent them out** - that is, "sent them to various places" or "told them to go."
    * **preach the kingdom of God** - This can also be translated as "teach them about God's kingdom" as in the UDB.
