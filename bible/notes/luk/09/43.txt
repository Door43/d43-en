\v 43 Then all the people there were completely amazed at the great power of God.
\p While they were all still in wonderment at all the miracles Jesus was doing, he said to his disciples,
\v 44 "Listen carefully to what I am about to tell you: I, the Son of Man, will soon be handed over to my enemies."
\v 45 But the disciples did not understand what he meant by this. God prevented them from understanding it, so that they would not know yet what he meant, and they were afraid to ask him about what he had said.

\v 43 Then they were all amazed at the greatness of God. While they all were marveling at everything he was doing, he said to his disciples,
\v 44 "Let these words go deeply into your ears: the Son of Man will be betrayed into the hands of men."
\v 45 But they did not understand this statement. It was hidden from them, so they could not know its meaning, and yet they were afraid to ask about this statement.
