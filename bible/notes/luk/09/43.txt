\v 43 Then all the people there were completely amazed at the great power of God.
\p While they were all still in wonderment at all the miracles Jesus was doing, he said to his disciples,
\v 44 "Listen carefully to what I am about to tell you: I, the Son of Man, will soon be handed over to my enemies."
\v 45 But the disciples did not understand what he meant by this. God prevented them from understanding it, so that they would not know yet what he meant, and they were afraid to ask him about what he had said.

\v 43 They were all amazed at the greatness of God. But while all were still marveling at all the things which he did, he said to his disciples,
\v 44 "Let these words go deeply into your ears, for the Son of Man will be delivered over into the hands of men."
\v 45 But they did not understand what this statement meant, and it was concealed from them, so they could not understand it. They were afraid to ask him about that statement.
