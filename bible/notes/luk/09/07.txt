\v 7 Herod \add Antipas\add*, the ruler of \add that\add* district, heard about the things that \add Jesus and his disciples\add* were doing. \add He had previously commanded his soldiers to execute John the Baptizer, so now\add* he was perplexed, because some people were saying that John had become alive again \add and was doing those miracles\add*.
\v 8 Others were saying that \add the prophet\add* Elijah had appeared \add again as had been prophesied\add*. Others were saying that one of the \add other\add* former prophets had become alive again \add and was doing those miracles\add*.
\v 9 But Herod said, "\add It cannot be John who is doing these things\add*, \add because\add* I \add commanded my soldiers to\add* cut off his head. So who is \add this man\add* that I am hearing these things about?" And he kept wanting to see \add Jesus\add*.

\v 7 Herod, the ruler over the region of Galilee, heard about everything that was happening.  He was perplexed, because some people were saying that John the Baptizer had become alive again.
\v 8 Other people were saying that the prophet Elijah had appeared again and still others were saying that one of the other prophets from long ago had become alive again.
\v 9 But Herod said, "It cannot be John because I had his head cut off. So who is this man that I am hearing these things about?" And he kept looking for a way  to see Jesus.

\v 7 Now Herod, the tetrarch, heard about all that was happening and he was very disturbed, because it was said by some that John the Baptizer had risen from the dead,
\v 8 and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the ancient prophets had risen to life again.
\v 9 And Herod said, "I beheaded John, but who is this about whom I hear such things?" And he tried to find a way to see him.
