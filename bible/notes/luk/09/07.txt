\v 9 But Herod said, "\add It cannot be John who is doing these things\add*, \add because\add* I \add commanded my soldiers to\add* cut off his head. So who is \add this man\add* that I am hearing these things about?" And he kept wanting to see \add Jesus\add*.

\v 7 Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening, and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John the Baptist had risen from the dead ones,
\v 8 and it was said that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the prophets of long ago had risen.
\v 9 Herod said, "I beheaded John, but who is this about whom I hear such things?" and he tried to see him.
