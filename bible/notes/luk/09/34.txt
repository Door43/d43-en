\v 34 As he was saying this, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.
\v 35 A voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is my Son, the one who is chosen; listen to him."
\v 36 When the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. They kept silent and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen.
