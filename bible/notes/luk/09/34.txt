\v 34 Then while he was saying these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were afraid as they were surrounded by the cloud.
\v 35 A voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is my chosen Son. Listen to him."
\v 36 When the voice had finished, Jesus was alone. They kept silent, and in those days they told no one any of the things which they had seen.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **while he was saying these things** - "while Peter was saying these things"
    * **they were afraid** - These adult disciples were not afraid of clouds. This phrase indicates that some kind of unusual fear came over them with the cloud. It could be translated as "they were terrified."
    * **A voice came out of the cloud saying** - If it is unnatural to talk about a voice speaking, it could be translated as "God spoke to them from the cloud, saying."
    * **my chosen Son** - This can be translated as "my Son, whom I have chosen" (UDB) or "my Son, the chosen one." The word "chosen" is adding information about God's Son. It is not saying that God has more than one son.  (See: information about Adjectives on [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_partsofspeech]])
    * **those days** - This may refer to the days until Jesus was taken up to Heaven after the resurrection or possibly the days directly after Jesus made the statement.
