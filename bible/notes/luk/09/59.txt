===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Follow me** - This could be translated as "Be my follower" or "Be my disciple and come with me."
    * **allow me first to go** - This could be translated as "before I do that, let me go." This is a request from the man to Jesus.
    * **Leave the dead to bury their own dead** - "Let the dead people bury their own dead people." Since people who are dead cannot bury anyone, the implied meaning here is "let the spiritually dead bury the dead people." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
