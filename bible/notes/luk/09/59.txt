===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to talk with the people along the road.

  * **Follow me** - This implies to be Jesus' disciple and go with him.
  * **first let me go and bury my father** - It is unclear whether the man's father has died and he will bury him immediately, or if the man wants to stay for a longer amount of time until his father dies so he can bury him then. The main point is the man wants to do something else first before he follows Jesus.
  * **first let me go** - "before I do that, let me go"
  * **Leave the dead to bury their own dead** - Jesus does not mean literally that dead people will bury other dead people. Possible meanings of "the dead" are 1) it is a metaphor for those who will soon die, or 2) it is a metaphor for those who do not follow Jesus and are spiritually dead. The main point is that a disciple must not let anything delay him from following Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the dead** - This refers to dead people in general. AT: "the dead people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]])
