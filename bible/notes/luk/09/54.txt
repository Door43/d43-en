===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **saw this** - "saw that the Samaritans did not receive Jesus"
  * **command fire to come down from heaven and destroy them** - James and John suggested this method of judgment because they knew that this was how the prophets such as Elijah had judged people who rejected God. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **he turned and rebuked them** - "Jesus turned and rebuked James and John." Jesus did not condemn the Samaritans, as the disciples expected.
