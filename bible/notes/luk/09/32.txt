\v 32 Peter and the other disciples who were with him were heavy with sleep. When they woke up, they saw Jesus' glory; they also saw the two men standing with him.
\v 33 As Moses and Elijah were starting to leave Jesus, Peter said to him, "Master, it is good for us to be here! We should make three shelters, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah!" But he really did not realize what he was saying.

\v 32 Now Peter and those who were with him were burdened with sleep. But when they were fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men who were standing with him.
\v 33 And it happened that, as they were going away from Jesus, Peter said to him, "Master, it is good for us to be here and we should make three shelters: one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah." He did not understand what he was talking about.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Master **  - This refers to someone who has been put in charge over a group of people, and not someone who owns someone else. It is a different word than is usually translated as “Master” and does not have the same level of authority. You may want to translate it as “Boss” or “Foreman.”
  * **shelter**-Or, "tent"
