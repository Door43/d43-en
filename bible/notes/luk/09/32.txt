\v 32 Peter and the other disciples who were with him were very sleepy. When they woke up, they saw Jesus' glory; they also saw the two men standing with him.
\v 33 As Moses and Elijah were starting to leave Jesus, Peter said to him, "Master, it is good for us to be here! We should make three shelters, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah!" But he really did not realize what he was saying.

\v 32 Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep. But when they were fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men who were standing with him.
\v 33 It happened that, as they were going away from Jesus, Peter said to him, "Master, it is good for us to be here and we should make three shelters. Let us make one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." He did not understand what he was talking about.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **they saw his glory** - This refers to the brilliant light that surrounded them. AT: "they saw brilliant light coming from Jesus" or "they saw very bright light coming out of Jesus."
  * **the two men who were standing with him** - This refers to Moses and Elijah.
  * **It happened that** - This phrase is used here to mark where the action starts. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **Master**  - The word that is translated here as "Master" is a not the normal word for "Master." This one refers to someone who has authority, and not to someone who owns someone else. AT: "Boss" or "Foreman" or with a word that is commonly used to address a person in authority, such as "Sir."
  * **shelter**- "tent" or "hut"
