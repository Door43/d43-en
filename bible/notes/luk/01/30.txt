===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **for you have found favor with God** - AT: "God has decided to give you his grace” or "God is showing you his kindness"
  * **you will conceive in your womb and bear a son...Jesus...the Son of the Most High** - Mary, Jesus' mother, will have a son who will be called "the Son of the Most High" (UDB). Here the Scripture clearly describes Jesus as a human son born of a human mother, but he is also "the Son of the Most High," meaning the Son of God. Christ's human sonship of Mary and his divine Sonship of God are both made very clear in this passage. Translators must maintain that clarity and translate with a common, widely used word for "son." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **will be called** - Possible meanings are 1) "people will call him" or 2) "God will call him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **give him the throne of his ancestor David** - The throne represents the king's authority to rule. AT:  "give him authority to rule as king as his ancestor David did." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
