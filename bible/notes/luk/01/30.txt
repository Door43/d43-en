===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **for you have found favor with God**  - AT:"God has decided to give you his grace" or "God is showing you his kindness"
  * **you will become pregnant and bear a son, and you will name him Jesus. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High** - Mary, Jesus' mother, will have a __son__ called "__the Son of the Most High__." Scripture describes Jesus as a human son born of a human mother, but he is also "the Son of the Most High," meaning the Son of God. Jesus is the Son of Man (Mary his mother was human) and the Son of God. Translate this as clearly and accurately as possible in your language.
  * **will be called** -  Possible meanings are 1) "people will call him" or 2) "God will call him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **give him the throne of his father, David** -  The throne represents the king's authority to rule. AT:  "give him authority to rule as king as his ancestor David did." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **his father** - The Bible often uses the word "fathers" to refer to ancestors and uses the word "sons" to refer to descendants. The word "his" refers to Mary's son.
