===== translationNotes: =====

  * **They** - This refers to the people who were there for the circumcision ceremony.
  * **made signs** - "motioned." Either Zechariah was unable to hear, as well as speak, or the people assumed that he could not hear.
  * **to his father** - "to the baby's father"
  * **how he wanted him to be named** - "what name Zechariah wanted to give the baby"
  * **His father asked for a writing tablet** - It may be helpful to state how Zechariah "asked," since he could not speak. AT: "His father used his hands to show the people that he wanted them to give him a writing tablet" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **writing tablet** - "something on which to write" 
  * **astonished** - "very surprised" or "amazed"
