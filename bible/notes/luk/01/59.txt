\v 59 On the eighth day after this, people gathered together for the ceremony to circumcise the baby. Since his father's name was Zechariah, they wanted to give the baby the same name.
\v 60 But his mother said, "No, his name must be John!"
\v 61 So they said to her, "But John is not the name of any of your relatives!"

\v 59 Now it happened on the eighth day that they came to circumcise the child. They would have called him "Zechariah," after the name of his father. 	
\v 60 But his mother answered and said, "No. He will be called John."
\v 61 They said to her, "There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name."
