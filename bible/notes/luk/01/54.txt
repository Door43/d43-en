    * (Mary continues to praise God:)
    * **He has helped** - "The Lord has helped" 
    * **his servant Israel** - "Israel" here refers to the nation, or people, of Israel. If readers confuse this with the the man named Israel, it could be translated as "his servant, the nation of Israel" or "Israel, his servants." 
    * **just as he promised** - "because he promised"
    * **his descendants** - "Abraham's descendants"
    * (This is the end of Mary's speech.)
