\v 1 Dear Theophilus, 
\p Many people have written reports about the amazing events that have happened among us.
\v 2 We heard about these things from people who saw them happen, from the time everything first started happening. These people taught others about God's message.
\v 3 I myself have carefully studied everything that these people wrote and taught. So I decided that it would also be good for me to write for you, noble Theophilus, an accurate account of these matters.
\v 4 I am doing this so that you may know that what you have been taught about these things is true.

\c 1 
\p 
\v 1 Many people have attempted to write accounts concerning those things which have been fulfilled among us. 
\v 2 Those who were eyewitnesses from the beginning and had become servants of the word, reported them to us. 
\v 3 So, it seemed good to me also, having investigated everything accurately from the beginning, to write it down for you in order, most excellent Theophilus. 
\v 4 I want you to know the certainty of the things that you were taught.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **accounts** - "reports" or "true stories"
  * **us** - The word "us" in this section may or may not exclude Theophilus. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **eyewitnesses** - "observers" or "watchers"
  * **had become servants of the word** - AT: "had served God by telling people his message" or "had taught people the good news about Jesus"
  * **reported them to us**  - The "us" in this phrase is exclusive. It does not include Theophilus. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **investigated everything accurately**  - This means he was careful to find out exactly what happened. He probably talked to the different people who saw what happened to make sure that what he wrote down about these events was correct. Another way to translate this would be "carefully researched everything that happened"
  * **most excellent** - Luke said this to show honor and respect for Theophilus. This manner of address may also mean that Theophilus was an important government official. Other ways to translate this would be "honorable" or "noble" Some people may prefer to also put this greeting at the beginning and say "To…..Theophilus" or "Dear… Theophilus"
  * **Theophilus**  - This name means "friend of God." It may describe this man's character or it may have been his actual name. Most translations have it as a name. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
