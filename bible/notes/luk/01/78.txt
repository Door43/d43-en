====== Luke 01:78-79 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 78 Our God will do that because he is very kind to us.
\q1 Just like a new day begins when the sun rises \f + \ft metaphor \f*,
\q1 God will do that new thing for us when the Messiah comes to us from heaven.
\q1
\v 79 People who do not know God \f + \ft metaphor \f* are like those who sit in the darkness.
\q1 They are afraid \f + \ft metonymy \f* that they will soon die.
\q1 But when the Messiah tells us God's message,
\q1 it will be like causing such people to see a bright light.
\q1 He will guide us \f + \ft synecdoche \f* so that we will be living peacefully.

<usfm>
\v 78 God will forgive us because he is kind and merciful to us.

\q will come to us from heaven to help us. 
\q
\v 79 His message will shine on people who live in spiritual darkness and in the fear of death. 
\q He will guide us so that we will live peacefully.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q 
\v 78 This will happen because of the tender mercy of our God,    
\q because of which the sunrise from on high will come to us,
\q 
\v 79 to shine on them who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death.
\q He will do this to guide our feet into the path of peace.”
