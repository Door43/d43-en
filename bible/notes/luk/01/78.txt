====== Luke 01:78-79 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 78 Our God will do that because he is very kind to us.
\q1 Just like a new day begins when the sun rises \f + \ft metaphor \f*,
\q1 God will do that new thing for us when the Messiah comes to us from heaven.
\q1
\v 79 People who do not know God \f + \ft metaphor \f* are like those who sit in the darkness.
\q1 They are afraid \f + \ft metonymy \f* that they will soon die.
\q1 But when the Messiah tells us God's message,
\q1 it will be like causing such people to see a bright light.
\q1 He will guide us \f + \ft synecdoche \f* so that we will be living peacefully.
