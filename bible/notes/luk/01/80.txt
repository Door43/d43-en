===== Translation Notes: =====

This is the end of the account about the birth and childhood of John the Baptist.  

  * **became strong in spirit** - AT: "became spiritually mature" or "strengthened his relationship with God"
  * **until** - "even when." This does not necessarily mark a stopping point. John continued to live out in the desert even after he started preaching publicly. 
  * **he began to appear publicly to** - "the time he began go before." or AT: "he began to preach in public to."
