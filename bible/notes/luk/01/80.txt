===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This tells briefly about John's growing years. 

  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Luke quickly moves from the birth of John to the beginning of his ministry as an adult.
  * **became strong in spirit** - "became spiritually mature" or "strengthened his relationship with God"
  * **was in the wilderness** - "lived in the wilderness." Luke does not say at what age John began to live in the wilderness.
  * **until** - This does not necessarily mark a stopping point. John continued to live out in the desert even after he started preaching publicly. 
  * **the day of his public appearance** - "when he began to preach in public"
  * **the day** - This is used here in the general sense of "the time" or "the occasion."
