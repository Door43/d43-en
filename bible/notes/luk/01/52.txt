  * [[:en:obe:other:lowly]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He has thrown down princes from their thrones** - A throne is a chair that a ruler sits on, and it is a symbol of his authority. If a prince is brought down from his throne, it means he no longer has the authority to reign. AT: "He has taken away the authority of princes" or "He has made rulers stop ruling" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **thrown down princes ... raised up those of low condition** - The contrast between these two opposite actions should be made clear in the translation if possible.
  * **low condition** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:luk:01:48|1:48]].
  * **has raised up those of low condition** - "poverty." Mary's family was not rich. In this word picture, people who are important are higher than people who are less important. AT: "has made humble people important" or "has given honor to people whom others have not honored" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **He has filled the hungry ... the rich he has sent away empty** - The contrast between these two opposite actions should be made clear in the translation if possible.
  * **filled the hungry with good things** - Possible meanings are 1) "given the hungry good food to eat" or 2) "given the needy good things."
