===== translationNotes: =====

  * **See** - This expression here emphasizes the importance of the statement about Elizabeth that follows.
  * **your relative Elizabeth** - If you need to state a specific relationship, Elizabeth was probably Mary's aunt or great-aunt.
  * **has also conceived a son in her old age** - "has also become pregnant with a son, even though she is already very old" or "even though she is old, has also become pregnant and will bear a son." Make sure it does not sound as though both Mary and Elizabeth were old when they conceived.
  * **the sixth month for her** - "the sixth month of her pregnancy"
  * **For** - "Because" or "This shows that"
  * **nothing will be impossible for God** - The double negatives in this statement can be stated with positive terms. AT: "This shows that God can do anything." Elizabeth's pregnancy was proof that God was able to do anything—even enable Mary to become pregnant without her sleeping with a man. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives|Double Negatives]])
  * **See** - Mary uses the same expression as the angel to emphasize how serious she was about her decision to submit to the Lord.
  * **I am the female servant of the Lord** - Choose an expression that shows her humility and obedience to the Lord. She was not boasting about being the Lord's servant.
  * **Let it be for me** - "Let this happen to me." Mary was expressing her willingness for the things to happen that the angel had told her were about to happen.
