===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - An angel appears to Zechariah while he is offering incense in the temple. 

  * **of the Lord** - "from the Lord" or "who was sent by the Lord"
  * **appeared to him** - "suddenly came to him" or "was suddenly there with Zechariah"
  * **your prayer has been heard**- "God has heard what you asked." The following is implied and could be added: "and will grant it." God did not just hear what Zechariah prayed for; he was also going to do it. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
