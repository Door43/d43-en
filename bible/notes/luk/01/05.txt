  * **Judea** - AT: "the region of Judea" or "the people who lived in Judea"
  * **there was a certain** - This is a way of introducing an important character in a story. Consider how your language does this. "there was a particular" or "there was a" 
  * **division** - AT: "division of priests" or "group of priests"
  * **of Abijah** - Abijah was an ancestor of this group of priests and all of them were descended from Aaron, who was the first Israelite priest. "who descended from Abijah" 
  * **His wife** - "Zechariah's wife"
  * **was also from the daughters of** -  "was also descended from Aaron" or AT: "Zechariah and his wife Elizabeth were both descended from Aaron"
  * **before God**  - "in God's sight" or "in God's opinion"

  * **all the Lord's commandments and requirements**  - AT: "all that the Lord had commanded and required"
