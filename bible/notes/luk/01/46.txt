===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Mary begins a song of praise to the Lord her Savior.

  * **My soul praises ... my spirit has rejoiced** - Mary is using a form of poetry where she states the same thing in two slightly different ways. If possible, translate these with two slightly different words or phrases that have that similar meaning. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **My soul ... my spirit** - Both "soul" and "spirit" refer to the spiritual part of a person. Mary is saying that her worship comes from deep inside her. AT: "My inner being ... my heart" or "I ... I" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **has rejoiced in** - "has felt very joyful about" or "was very happy about"
  * **God my savior** - "God, the One who saves me" or "God who saves me"
