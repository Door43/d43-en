===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **My soul…my spirit** – These could be translated as "Oh how I" or "how I" which express deep emotion. (See: [[en:tA:figuresofspeech:synecdoche]]) Mary is using a form of poetry where she states the same thing in two slightly different ways. Both "soul" and "spirit" refer to the spiritual part of a person. She is saying that her worship comes from deep inside her.  If possible, translate these with two slightly different words or phrases that have that similar meaning. (See: [[en:tA:figuresofspeech:doublet]]) 
  * **exalts** – "highly honors" or "greatly praises"  
  * **rejoices in** – “feels very joyful about” or “is very happy about”
  * **God my Savior** – “God, the One who saves me” or “God who saves me”
