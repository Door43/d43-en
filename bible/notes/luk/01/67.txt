===== Translation Notes: =====

Zechariah begins to prophesy and praise God for what he has done. 

  * **His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit** - "The Holy Spirit filled his father Zechariah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **spoke this prophecy** - Consider natural ways of introducing direct quotes in your language.  AT: "prophesied and said" or "prophesied, and this is what he said"   (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **the God of Israel** - AT: "the God who reigns over Israel" or "the God whom Israel worships." Israel here refers to the nation of Israel. Zechariah, as well as the people to whom he was talking, all belonged to the nation of Israel.
