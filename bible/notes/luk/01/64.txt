===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **his mouth was opened...his tongue was freed** - These are idioms meaning that now he was able to speak. (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:idiom]])
  * **Fear came on everyone who lived around them** - This could be translated as "All who lived around Zechariah and Elizabeth were afraid" or "All who lived around them were in awe of God" because they saw that God is powerful. "All who lived around them" does not refer only to their immediate neighbors, but to all who lived in that area. (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:idiom]])
  * **everything that happened was being talked about** - This could be translated as "people were talking about all these things that had happened."
  * **who heard about them**- The word "them" refers to the things that had happened.
  * **thinking** - "wondering"
  * **and said** - This could be translated as "wondering" or "asking". 
  * **What will this child become?** - This could be translated as "What kind of great person will this baby grow up to be?" or "What a great man this child will be!" This is a rhetorical question that shows the people's surprise. Because of what they had heard about the baby, they realized that he would grow up to be an important man. 
  * **the hand of the Lord was with him** - "The Lord's power was with him" or "The Lord was working in him powerfully." This is an example of metonymy in which the phrase "the hand of the Lord" refers to the Lord's power. (See: [[en:tA:figuresofspeech:metonymy]])
