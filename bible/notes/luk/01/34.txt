===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **How will this happen** - AT: "How is this possible" Though Mary did not understand how it could happen, she did not doubt that it would happen.
    * **will come over you** - This phrase and the next one are ways of saying that the Holy Spirit would supernaturally cause Mary to become pregnant even while she still remained a virgin. Make sure it is clear that there was no physical union involved; this was a miracle.
    *  **The power of** - AT: "By his power"
    * **will overshadow you** - "will cover you like a shadow" or AT: "will be with you" or AT: "will cause this to happen" Again, make sure this does not imply any physical union.
    * **the holy one** - AT: "the holy child" or "the holy baby"
    * **will be called** - AT: "people will call him" or "people will acknowledge that he is" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
