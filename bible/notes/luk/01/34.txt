===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **How will this happen** - AT: "How is this possible?" Though Mary did not understand how it could happen, she did not doubt that it would happen.
  * **the power of** - AT: "by his power"
  * **will come over you** - "will cover you like a shadow" or AT: "will cause this to happen." This phrase and the previous one are ways of saying that the Holy Spirit would supernaturally cause Mary to become pregnant even while she still remained a virgin. Make sure this does not imply any physical or sexual union—this was a miracle. 
  * **the holy one** - AT: "the holy child" or "the holy baby"
  * **will be called** - Possible meanings are 1) "people will call him" or 2) "God will call him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God** - Jesus was called "the Son of God" because Jesus' father was the Spirit of God. Jesus' mother Mary was a human into whom God supernaturally placed a child. This child was God the Son, "called the Son of God," the human Jesus. There was no sexual activity in Jesus' conception because it was a miracle completed by the Spirit of God. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
