===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **How will this happen** - AT: "How is this possible?" Though Mary did not understand how it could happen, she did not doubt that it would happen.
    * **will come over you** - This phrase and the next one are ways of saying that the Holy Spirit would __supernaturally__ cause Mary to become pregnant even while she still remained a virgin. Make sure it is clear that there was no physical or sexual union involved; this was a miracle.
    * **the power of** - AT: "by his power"
    * **will overshadow you** - Again, make sure this does not imply any physical or sexual union. "will cover you like a shadow" or AT: "will cause this to happen."
    * **the holy one** - AT: "the holy child" or "the holy baby"
    * **will be called** -  Possible meanings are 1) "people will call him" or 2) "God will call him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
    * **Therefore, the holy one who will be born will be called the Son of God** - Jesus was called "the Son of God" because Jesus' father was the Spirit of God. Jesus' mother Mary was a human into whom God supernaturally placed a child. This child was God the Son, "called the Son of God," the human Jesus. There was no sexual activity in Jesus' conception because it was a miraculous event completed by the Spirit of God.
