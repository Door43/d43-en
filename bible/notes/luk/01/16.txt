\v 16 He will persuade many descendants of Israel to stop sinning and start obeying the Lord their God again.
\v 17 Your son will go in advance of the Lord as his forerunner and will be powerful in his spirit like the prophet Elijah was. He will cause parents to love their children again. He will cause many people who do not obey God to live wisely and to obey him as righteous people do. He will do this in order to cause many people to be ready when the Lord comes."

\v 16 And many of the people of Israel will be turned to the Lord their God.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **many of the people of Israel** - If it sounds as though Zechariah is not included, this phrase could be translated as "many of you descendants of Israel" or "many of you who are God's people, Israel." If this change is made, make sure that "their God" is also changed to "your (plural) God."
  * **be turned** - "be turned back" or "return"
  * **will go before the face of the Lord** - He would go in advance to announce to the people that the Lord would come to them. 
  * **before the face of** - Here, "face of" is an idiom that refers to the Lord's presence. It is sometimes omitted in translation. AT: "before."
  * **in the spirit and power of Elijah** - "with the same spirit and power that Elijah had." The word "spirit" either refers to God's Holy Spirit or to Elijah's attitude or way of thinking. Make sure that the word "spirit" does not mean ghost or evil spirit.
  * **turn the hearts of the fathers to the children** - "persuade fathers to care about their children again" or "cause fathers to restore their relationships with their children"
  * **turn the hearts** - The heart is spoken of as if it is something that can be turned to go in a different direction. This refers to changing someone's attitude toward something. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the disobedient will walk** - "walk" is a metaphor for the way a person lives and acts. AT: "the disobedient will act" or "the disobedient will live" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the disobedient** - "people who do not obey"
  * **make ready for the Lord** - It is not stated how they will be ready. This implied information could be added. AT: "make ready to believe the Lord's message" or "make ready to obey the Lord" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
