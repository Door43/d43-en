===== Translation Notes: =====
This concludes the angel's speech to Zechariah.

  * **many of the sons of Israel**  - If it sounds as though Zechariah is not included, this phrase could be translated as "many of you descendants of Israel" or "many of you who are God's people, Israel." If this change is made, make sure that "their God" is also changed to "your (plural) God."
  * **in advance of him** - He would go to announce to the people that the Lord would come to them.
  * **in the spirit and power of Elijah** - "with the same spirit and power that Elijah had" The word "spirit" either refers to God's Holy Spirit or to Elijah's attitude or way of thinking. Make sure that the word "spirit" does not mean ghost or evil spirit.
  * **turn the hearts of the fathers to their children**  - AT: "persuade fathers to care about their children again" or "cause fathers to restore their relationships with their children" This would also apply to mothers, but only father's are named.
  * **the disobedient to walk** - "the disobedient to act" or "the disobedient to live" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **prepared for the Lord** - This could be translated as "ready to believe the Lord's message" or "ready to obey the Lord."
