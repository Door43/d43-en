\v 19 Then the angel said to him, "I am Gabriel! I stand in God's presence! I was sent to tell you this good news about what will happen to you.
\v 20 What I have told you will certainly happen at the time God has decided, but you did not believe my words. So now God will cause you to be unable to talk until the day your son is born!"

\v 18 Zechariah said to the angel, "How will I know this will happen? For I am an old man, and my wife also is very old."
\v 19 The angel answered him, "I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. 
\v 20 See, you will be silent and not able to speak until the day when these things happen, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled at the proper time."
