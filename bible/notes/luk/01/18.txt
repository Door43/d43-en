\v 18 Then Zechariah said to the angel, "I am very old, and my wife is also very old. So how can I believe that the things you said will really happen?" 
\p
\v 19 Then the angel said to him, "I am Gabriel! I stand in God's presence! I was sent to tell you this good news about what will happen to you.
\v 20 What I have told you will certainly happen at the time God has decided, but you did not believe my words. So now God will cause you to be unable to talk until the day your son is born!"

\v 18 And Zechariah said to the angel, "How will I know this will happen? For I am an old man, and my wife also is very old."
\v 19 And the angel answered him, "I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you\f + \ft singular \f*\, and to bring you this good news. 
\v 20 And indeed, you will be silent and not able to speak, until the day when these things happen, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled at the proper time."
