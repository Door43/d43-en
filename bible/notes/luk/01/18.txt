\v 19 Then the angel said to him, "I am \add God's chief angel\add*, Gabriel! \add I do what God tells me, because\add* I constantly stand in God's presence!

\v 18 Then Zechariah said to the angel, "I am very old, and my wife is also very old. So how can I believe that the things you said will really happen?" 
\p
\v 19 Then the angel said to him, "I am Gabriel! I stand in God's presence! I was sent to tell you this good news about what will happen to you.
\v 20 What I have told you will certainly happen at the time God has decided, but you did not believe my words. So now God will cause you to be unable to talk until the day your son is born!"

\v 18 Zechariah said to the angel, "How can I know this? For I am an old man and my wife is very old." 
\v 19 The angel answered and said to him, "I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God. I was sent to speak to you, to bring you this good news. 
\v 20 And behold, you will be silent, unable to speak, until the day these things take place. This is because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled at the right time."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **How can I know this?** - "How can I know for sure that what you said will happen?" Here, "know" means to learn by experience, suggesting Zechariah was asking for a sign as proof. AT: "What can you do to prove to me that this will happen?"
  * **well advanced in years** - "very old"
  * **I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God** - This is stated as a rebuke to Zechariah. The presence of Gabriel, coming directly from God, should be enough proof for Zechariah.
  * **who stands** - "who serves"
  * **I was sent to speak to you** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God sent me to speak to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **behold** - The word "behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.
  * **silent, unable to speak** - These mean the same thing, and are repeated to emphasize the completeness of his silence. AT: "completely unable to speak" or "not able to speak at all" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **not believe my words** - "not believe what I said"
  * **at the right time** - "at the appointed time"
