===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The angel continues to speak to Zechariah. 

  * **For** - "Because" or "In addition to this"
  * **he will be great in the sight of the Lord** - AT:  "he will do very important things for the Lord"
  * **he will be filled with the Holy Spirit** - "the Holy Spirit will empower him" or "the Holy Spirit will guide him." Make sure it does not sound similar to what an evil spirit might do to a person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **from his mother's womb** - People had been filled with the Holy Spirit before, but no one had heard of an unborn baby being filled with the Holy Spirit.
