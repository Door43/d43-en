===== Translation Notes: =====
Zechariah continues to prophesy.

  * **his servant David** - AT: "King David, who served him"
  * **just as God** - AT: "That is what God promised he would do when he"
  * **spoke through his holy prophets** - AT: "caused his holy prophets to say" (UDB) When God spoke through the prophets, they used their own voices, but God enabled them to speak the words he wanted them to speak.
  * **salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of everyone who hates us** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and are repeated for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **and from the hand** - AT: "and salvation from the hand" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **hand** - "power" or "control" The word "hand" is associated with the power or control that is being used to harm God's people. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
