\v 21 Now the people were waiting for Zechariah. They were surprised that he was spending so much time in the temple. 
\v 22 But when he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized that he had had a vision while he was in the temple. He kept on making signs to them and remained silent. 
\v 23 It came about that when the days of his service were over, he went to his house.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Now** - This marks a shift in the story from what happened inside the temple to what happened outside. AT: "During the time" or "While the angel and Zechariah were talking."
  * **They realized that he had had a vision while he was in the temple. He kept on making signs to them and remained silent** - These things probably happened at the same time, and Zechariah's signs helped the people understand that he had had a vision. It might be helpful to your audience to change the order to show that. AT: "He kept on making signs to them and remained silent. So they realized that he had had a vision while he was in the temple"
  * **a vision** - The earlier description indicated that Gabriel actually came to Zechariah in the temple. The people, not knowing that, assumed Zechariah saw a vision. 
  * **It came about** - This phrase moves the story ahead to when Zechariah's service was ended.
  * **he went to his house** - Zechariah did not live in Jerusalem, where the temple was located. He traveled to his home town.
