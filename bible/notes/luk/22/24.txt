===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Then there arose also a quarrel among them**  - "the apostles began to argue among themselves" (UDB)
  * **greatest**  - "most important"
  * **He said to them**  - "Jesus said to the apostles"
  * **have lordship over them**  - "rule harshly over them" or "like to exercise power over them"
  * **are called**  - This can be translated as "like to be called" or "call themselves." The people probably did not think of those rulers as honored rulers.
  * **honored rulers**  - This can also be translated as "benefactors" or "leaders who help the people."
