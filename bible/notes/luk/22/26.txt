\v 26 But you should not be like them! Instead, those who \add want God to\add* \add consider them\add* the greatest should \add act as though they\add* were the youngest, \add since the youngest are expected to serve the older ones\add*. Whoever is a leader should be one who serves \add the others\add*.
\v 27 Keep in mind who is the most important one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. It is certainly the one who \add just sits\add* at the table, not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* those who serve \add the meal\add*. But I, \add your leader\add*, have been \add an example for you\add* by serving you \add while I have been\add* among you.

\v 26 But you should not be like those rulers! Instead, the most honored persons among you should act as if they were the youngest, and the one who leads must act like a servant.
\v 27 For you know that the  important person is the one who eats at the table, not the servant who brings the food. But I am your servant.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 26 But it shall not be like this with you. Instead, let the one who is the greatest among you become like the youngest. And let the one who is the most important become like the one who serves.
\v 27 For which is greater, the one who sits at the table, or the one who serves? Is it not the one who sits at the table? Yet I am among you as one who serves.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **it shall not be like this with you**  - "you should not act like that"
    * **the youngest**  - "the least important"
    * **the one who serves**  - "a servant"
    * **which is greater**  - "which one is more important?" Jesus asked this rhetorical question in order to cause the apostles to think about the role of a servant. ([[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:rhetoricalquestion]])
    * **Is it not the one who serves?**  - This is also a rhetorical question. The implied answer is: "of course the one who sits at the table is more important!"
    * **bold words**  - explanation
