\v 26 But you should not be like them! Instead, those who \add want God to\add* \add consider them\add* the greatest should \add act as though they\add* were the youngest, \add since the youngest are expected to serve the older ones\add*. Whoever is a leader should be one who serves \add the others\add*.
\v 27 Keep in mind who is the most important one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. It is certainly the one who \add just sits\add* at the table, not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* those who serve \add the meal\add*. But I, \add your leader\add*, have been \add an example for you\add* by serving you \add while I have been\add* among you.

\v 26 But you should not be like those rulers! Instead, the most honored persons among you should act as if they were the youngest, and the one who leads must act like a servant.
\v 27 For you know that the important person is the one who eats at the table, not the servant who brings the food. But I am your servant.

<usfm>
\v 26 But it must not be like this with you. Instead, let the one who is the greatest among you become like the youngest. And let the one who is the most important become like the one who serves.
\v 27 For who is greater, the one who sits at the table, or the one who serves? Is it not the one who sits at the table? Yet I am among you as one who serves.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues teaching his apostles.

  * **it must not be like this with you** - "you should not act like that"
  * **the youngest** - Older people were respected in that culture. The leaders were usually older people and were called "elders." The youngest person would be the least likely to lead, and the least important. AT: "the least important" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the one who serves** - "a servant"
  * **For** - This connects Jesus' commands in verse 26 with the whole of verse 27. It means that the most important person should serve because Jesus is a servant.
  * **For who is greater ... serves?** - "For who is more important ... serves?" Jesus uses this question to begin to explain to the apostles who is truly great. AT: "I want you to think about who is greater ... serves." ([[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the one who sits at the table** - "the one who is dining"
  * **Is it not the one who sits at the table?** - Jesus uses another question to teach the disciples. AT: "Of course the one who sits at the table is more important than the servant!" ([[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Yet I am among you as one who serves** - "But I am serving you." The word "yet" is here because there is a contrast between what people would expect Jesus to be like and what he really was like.
