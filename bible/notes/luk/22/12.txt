Jesus continues giving instructions to Peter and John.
  * **He will show you** - "The owner of the house will show you" 
  * **upper room** - "room upstairs." If your community does not have houses with rooms above other rooms, you may need to consider how to describe buildings in the city.
  * **So they went** - "So Peter and John went"
