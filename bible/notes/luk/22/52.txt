\v 52-53 Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the Temple guards, and the \add Jewish\add* elders who had come to \add seize\add* him, "It is ridiculous that you have come \add here\add* with swords and clubs to capture \f + \ft metonymy \f* me, as \add if I were\add* a bandit!\f + \ft Or: Why have you come here with swords and clubs to capture ( metonymy ) me, as if I were a bandit? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* Day after day \add I was with you\add* in the Temple \add courtyard\add*, \add and\add* you did not seize me! But this is the time \f + \ft metonymy \f* when \add God is allowing\add* you \add to do what you want\add*. It is also the time \f + \ft metonymy \f* when God is allowing \add Satan, who rules\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add in\add* the darkness, \add to do what he wants\add*."

\v 52-53 Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guards, and the Jewish elders who had come to arrest him, "It is surprising that you have come here with swords and clubs to arrest me, as if I were a robber. For many days I was with you in the temple, but you did not try to arrest me at all! But this is the time you are doing what you want. It is also the time when Satan is doing the evil things as he wants to do.

\v 53 When I was daily with you in the temple, you did not lay your hands on me. But this is your hour, and the authority of darkness."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Do you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs?**  - "Do you come out with swords and clubs because you think I am a robber?" This a rhetorical question. It can be translated as "You know that I am not a robber, yet you come out to me bringing swords and clubs." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **I was daily with you**  - "I was among you every day"
  * **in the temple**  - This can be translated as "in the temple courts" or "at the temple."
  * **lay your hands on me**  - This idiom means "arrest me." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **your hour** - "your time"
  * **the authority of darkness**  - This could be translated as "the time of the ruler of darkness" or "the time when Satan is doing the evil things as he wants to do" (UDB). The "authority of darkness" is a metonym for the evil ruler, Satan. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
