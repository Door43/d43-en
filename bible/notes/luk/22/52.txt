\v 52-53 Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the Temple guards, and the \add Jewish\add* elders who had come to \add seize\add* him, "It is ridiculous that you have come \add here\add* with swords and clubs to capture \f + \ft metonymy \f* me, as \add if I were\add* a bandit!\f + \ft Or: Why have you come here with swords and clubs to capture ( metonymy ) me, as if I were a bandit? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* Day after day \add I was with you\add* in the Temple \add courtyard\add*, \add and\add* you did not seize me! But this is the time \f + \ft metonymy \f* when \add God is allowing\add* you \add to do what you want\add*. It is also the time \f + \ft metonymy \f* when God is allowing \add Satan, who rules\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add in\add* the darkness, \add to do what he wants\add*."

\v 52-53 Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the Temple guards, and the Jewish elders who had come to arrest him, "It is surprising that you have come here with swords and clubs to arrest me, as if I were a robber. For many days I was with you in the Temple, but you did not try to arrest me at all! But this is the time you are doing what you want. It is also the time when Satan is doing the evil things as he wants to do.
