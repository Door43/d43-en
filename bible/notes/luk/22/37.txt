\v 37 I tell you this because what a prophet wrote about me in the scriptures must happen: 'People considered him to be a criminal.' Everything that is written about me in the scriptures is happening.
\v 38 The disciples said, "Lord, look! We have two swords!" He replied, "Enough. Do not talk like this any longer."

  * **the lawless ones** - "those who break the law" or "the criminals"
  * **For what is predicted about me is being fulfilled** - Possible meanings are 1) "For what the prophet predicted about me is about to happen" or 2) "For my life is coming to an end" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
