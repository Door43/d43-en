\v 37 I tell you this because what a prophet wrote about me in the Scriptures must come true: 'People considers him to be a criminal.' Everything that is about me in the Scriptures must happen.
\v 38 The disciples said, "Lord, look! We have two swords!" He replied, "Enough. Do not talk like this any longer."
