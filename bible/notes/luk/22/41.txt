===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **about a stone's throw** - This means "about the distance that someone can throw a stone." AT: "a short distance" or with an estimated measurement like "about 30 meters" (UDB). (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Father, if you are willing** - Jesus will bear the guilt of all the sin of human history by the agony of the cross. He prays to his Father asking if there is another way. But, Jesus is crucified and satisfies His Father's infinite, holy nature. The Father gives His only Son. The word "Father" must be translated clearly to honor his love for his Son, the Son's love for his Father, and their love for all people.
  * **remove this cup from me** - Jesus is referring to the suffering that he is about to endure as if it were in a cup and that he was going to drink it. AT: "take away from me this cup of suffering" or "take away this suffering from me" or "rescue me from having to suffer like this." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Nevertheless not my will, but yours be done** - AT: "However, I want your will to be done rather than mine."
