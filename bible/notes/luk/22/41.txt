===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **about a stone's throw** - This is an idiom that means "about the distance that someone can throw a stone." It can also be translated as "a short distance" or with an estimated measurement like "about 30 meters" (UDB). (See: [[en:ta:translate:idiom]])
  * **remove this cup from me** - This is a metaphor. Jesus is referring to the suffering that he is about to endure as if it were in a cup and that he was going to drink it. This can also be translated as "take away from me this cup of suffering" or "take away this suffering from me" or "rescue me from having to suffer like this." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
  * **Nevertheless not my will, but yours be done**  - This can also be translated as "However, I want your will to be done rather than mine."
