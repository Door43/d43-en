====== Luke 22 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

The events of this chapter are commonly referred to as the "last supper." This Passover feast in many ways parallels Jesus' sacrifice as the lamb of God.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== The eating of the body and blood ==

To this day, this symbolic action is practiced in nearly all churches to this day in remembrance of Christ's sacrifice for the [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sins]] of man.

== The New Covenant ==
Jesus mentions the New Covenant during the last supper. The New Covenant is a source of controversy among scholars. There are many different opinions about when this covenant begins and the church's relationship to the new covenant.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Son of Man ==

Jesus refers to himself as the "Son of Man." Every language may not have the ability to have a person refer to himself (the first person) in the third person.

== "this is your hour" ==
In many cultures, there is a belief that only bad things happen in the middle of the night, when the good people are asleep. This phrase is an insult that the people arresting Jesus are doing [[:en:obe:kt:evil|evil]].
