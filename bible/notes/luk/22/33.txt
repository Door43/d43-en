===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Simon Peter reacts to Jesus' statement that Satan will test Peter.)
  * **the rooster will not crow** - Here, the crowing of the rooster is used as a metonym for that time of day." Roosters often crow before the sun appears in the morning. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  *  **the rooster will not crow…before you deny…** - This can be stated positively: "the rooster will crow…only after you deny." The order of the parts of the verse can also be reversed: "You will deny three times that you know me before the rooster crows this day" 
  * **this day** - The Jewish day begins at sunset. Jesus was speaking after the sun had set. The rooster would crow just before morning. The morning was part of "this day." It can also be translated as "tonight" or "in the morning."
