===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **after blindfolding him** - "after they covered his eyes so that he could not see"
    * **Prophesy! Who is the one that hit you?** - The guards did not believe that Jesus was a prophet. Rather they believed that a real prophet would know who hit him even if he could not see it. They called Jesus a prophet, but they wanted to show that he was not a prophet. Alternate translation: “Prove that you are a prophet. Tell us who hit you” or “Hey prophet, who hit you?” (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
    * **Prophesy!**  - "Speak words from God!" The implied information is that God would have to tell Jesus who struck him since Jesus was blindfolded and could not see. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
