===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Jesus speaks directly to Simon.)
  * **Simon, Simon** - Jesus said his name twice to show that what he was about to say to him was very important.
  * **to have you that he might sift you** - The word "you" refers to all of the apostles. Languages that have different forms of "you" should use the plural form. (See: [[en:ta:translate:formsofyou]])
  * **sift you as wheat**  - This is a metaphor that means "test you to find something wrong." The meaning can be made clear as in the UDB: "test you." And it can be translated as a simile: "like someone shakes grain in a sieve" as in the UDB. (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
  * **But I have prayed for you**  - The word "you" here refers specifically to Simon. Languages that have different forms of you should use the singular form.
  * **that your faith will not fail** - This can be expressed positively as "that you will continue to have faith" or "that you will continue to trust me." (See: [[en:ta:translate:active]])
  * **your brothers** - This refers to the other disciples. This can be translated as "your fellow believers" or "your brothers in the faith" or "the other disciples."
