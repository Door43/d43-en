===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **insisted and said**  - "said insistently" or "said loudly" (UDB)
  * **Truly this man** - "This man" refers to Peter. The speaker probably did not know Peter's name.
  * **he is a Galilean** - Matthew [[:en:bible:notes:mat:26:73|26:73]] says that the people could tell Peter was from Galilee from the way he talked.
  * **I do not know what you are saying**  - This idiom is used to say very strongly "What you said is not true at all" or "What you said is completely false." (See: [[en:ta:translate:idiom]])
  * **while he was speaking** - "while Peter was speaking"
