===== translationNotes: =====

  * **insisted and said** - "said insistently" or "said loudly" 
  * **Truly this man** - Here "this man" refers to Peter. The speaker probably did not know Peter's name.
  * **he is a Galilean** - The man could probably tell Peter was from Galilee from the way he talked. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Man** - Peter did not know the man's name. He was not insulting him by calling him "Man." If people would think he was insulting him, you could use a culturally acceptable way for a man to address a man he does not know, or you could leave out the word. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:luk:22:56|22:58]].
  * **I do not know what you are saying** - "I do not know what you are talking about." This expression means that Peter completely disagree with the man. AT: "what you said is not true at all" or "what you said is completely false" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **while he was speaking** - "while Peter was speaking"
  * **a rooster crowed** - Roosters often crow just before the sun appears in the morning. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:luk:22:33|22:34]].
