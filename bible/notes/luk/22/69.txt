===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues speaking to the council.

  * **from now on** - "from this day" or "starting from today"
  * **the Son of Man** - Jesus used this phrase to refer to himself. This title also referred to the Christ, but the elders would have to ask to verify that he was claiming to be the Christ. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **seated at the right hand of the power of God** - The Jews understood that only God could sit there. They considered this equal to saying "will be with God as God." 
  * **the power of God** - "the all-powerful God." Here "power" refers to his supreme authority. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Then you are the Son of God?** - The council asked this question because they wanted Jesus to explicitly confirm their understanding that he was saying he was the Son of God. AT: "So when you said that, did you mean that you are the Son of God?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) 
  * **Son of God** - This is an important title for Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **You say that I am** - "Yes, it is just like you say" 
  * **Why do we still need a witness?** - They use a question for emphasis. AT: "We have no further need for witnesses!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **heard from his own mouth** - The phrase "his own mouth" refers to his speech. AT: "heard him say that he believes he is the Son of God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
