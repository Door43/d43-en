===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues speaking to the council of elders.

  * **from now on**  - "from this day" or "starting from today"
  * **the Son of Man**  - Jesus used this phrase to refer to the Christ. He was implying that he was talking about himself, but the elders would have to ask to see if that's what he was really saying.
  * **seated at the right hand of the power of God**  - The Jews understood that no one could sit there. They considered this equal to saying "will be with God as God."
  * **the power of God**  - "the all-powerful God." Here "power" refers to his supreme authority.
  * **Then are you the Son of God?**  - The council asked this question because they wanted Jesus to explicitly confirm their understanding that he was saying he was the Son of God. This could be translated as "So when you said that, did you mean that you are the Son of God?" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **You say that I am**  - "Yes, it is just like you say" (UDB)
  * **Why do we still need a witness?**  - This is a rhetorical question. It means "We have no further need for witnesses!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **from his own mouth**  - This idiom uses a body part (the mouth) to refer to the person. It means "directly from him." It emphasizes the fact that Jesus himself said the things that they were accusing him of saying. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
