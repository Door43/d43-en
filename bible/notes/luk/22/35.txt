===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **When I sent you out** - Jesus was talking to his apostles. So languages that have different forms of "you" should use the plural form. (See: [[en:ta:translate:formsofyou]])
  * **purse**  - A purse is a bag for holding money. Here it is used to refer to "money." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
  * **a bag of provisions** - This can be translated as "travelers' bag"  or "food," which would have been in the bag if they had taken one.
  * **did you lack anything?** - "did you need anything that you did not have?" This is a rhetorical question to help the apostles remember how well the people they went to provided for them. (See: [[en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion]])
  * **Nothing** - "We did not lack anything"
  * **cloak**  - "coat" or "outer garment"
  * **The one who does not have a sword should sell his cloak** - Jesus was not referring to a specific person who did not have a sword. It can also be translated as "If anyone does not have a sword, he should sell his cloak."
