  * **you will sit on thrones**  - "Sit on thrones" is a metonym for "do the work of kings." This means "you will work as kings" or "you will do the work of kings." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **thrones**  - This can be translated as "kings' chairs" or "chairs made for kings."
