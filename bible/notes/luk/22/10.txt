===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **He answered**  - The word "He" refers to Jesus.
  * **a man bearing a pitcher of water will meet you** - This can also be translated as "you will see a man carrying a pitcher of water."
  * **bearing a pitcher of water** - "carrying a jar with water in it." He probably would have carried the jar on his shoulder.
  * **Follow him into the house** - This can be translated as "Follow him, and go into the house."
  * **The Teacher says to you** - This begins a direct quotation where Jesus tells the disciples what they should say. The UDB renders this as an indirect quotation: "Our teacher says to show us." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **The Teacher** - This refers to Jesus. 
  * **eat the Passover** - "eat the Passover meal"
