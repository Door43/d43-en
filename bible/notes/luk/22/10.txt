===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He answered them** - "Jesus answered Peter and John"
  * **Listen** - Jesus used this word to tell them to pay close attention and to do exactly what he tells them.
  * **a man bearing a pitcher of water will meet you** - "you will see a man carrying a pitcher of water"
  * **bearing a pitcher of water** - "carrying a jar with water in it." He probably would have carried the jar on his shoulder.
  * **Follow him into the house** - "Follow him, and go into the house"
  * **The Teacher says to you** - This begins a direct quotation where Jesus tells the disciples what they should say. The UDB renders this as an indirect quotation: "Our teacher says to show us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **The Teacher** - This refers to Jesus. 
  * **eat the Passover** - "eat the Passover meal"
