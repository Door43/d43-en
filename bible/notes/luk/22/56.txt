===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **looked straight at him and said**  - "looked straight at Peter and said to the other people in the courtyard"
  * **This man also was with him**  - The woman was telling the people about Peter being with Jesus. She probably did not know Peter's name.
  * **But Peter denied it**  - "But Peter said that it was not true"
  * **Woman, I do not know him** - Peter did not know the woman's name. He was not insulting her by calling her "woman." If people would think he was insulting her, you could use a culturally acceptable way for a man to address a woman he does not know, or you could leave out the word.
  * **Man, I am not** - See the note above about "woman."
