===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Festival of Unleavened Bread**  - The festival was called by this name because during the festival, the Jews did not eat bread that was made with yeast. This can be translated as "the festival when they would eat unleavened bread."
  * **Unleavened Bread**  - This is bread that has no yeast in it to make it rise. It can be called "Bread without Yeast."
  * **drew near**  - "was almost ready to begin"
  * **how they could put Jesus to death**  - "how they might cause Jesus to be put to death." The priests and scribes did not have the authority to kill Jesus themselves, but they hoped to get others to kill him.
  * **afraid of the people**  - Possible meanings are 1) "scared of what the people might do" or 2) "scared that the people would make Jesus king."
