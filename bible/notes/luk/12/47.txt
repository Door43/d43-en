\v 48 But every \add servant\add* who did not know \add what his master wanted\add* him to do, and who did things for which he deserved to be punished, will be beaten lightly \f + \ft Or:\add the master\add* will beat lightly every \add servant\add* who did not know \add what his master wanted\add* him to do and did the things for which he deserved that \add his master\add* would beat him \f*. \add God will treat his people similarly, because he\add* expects a lot from those people whom \add he\add* has allowed \add to understand a lot\add*. People who entrust things \add to others' care\add* expect those people\add to care for those things\add* very well. Similarly, \add God\add* expects a lot from those people whom he has allowed \add to understand a lot\add*. Furthermore, he expects the most from people to whom he has given the most \add ability\add*."

\v 47 That servant, having known his lord’s will, and not having prepared or done according to his will, will be beaten with many blows.
\v 48 But he who did not know, and did things worthy of a beating, will be beaten with a few blows. Everyone to whom much is given, much will be required of him, and to whom they entrust much, they will ask even more of him.
