\v 47 Every servant who knows what his master wants him to do but who does not get himself ready and does not do what his master desires will be beaten severely \f + \ft Or:\add The master\add* will beat severely every servant who knows what his master wants him to do but who does not get himself ready and does not do what his master desires \f*.
\v 48 But every \add servant\add* who did not know \add what his master wanted\add* him to do, and who did things for which he deserved to be punished, will be beaten lightly \f + \ft Or:\add the master\add* will beat lightly every \add servant\add* who did not know \add what his master wanted\add* him to do and did the things for which he deserved that \add his master\add* would beat him \f*. \add God will treat his people similarly, because he\add* expects a lot from those people whom \add he\add* has allowed \add to understand a lot\add*. People who entrust things \add to others' care\add* expect those people\add to care for those things\add* very well. Similarly, \add God\add* expects a lot from those people whom he has allowed \add to understand a lot\add*. Furthermore, he expects the most from people to whom he has given the most \add ability\add*."

\v 47 The servant who knew what his master wanted but did not get ready and do it, will be severely punished.
\v 48 But every servant who did not know what his master wanted him to do, and then did something wrong , will only get a mild punishment. A lot is expected from those people who have been given a lot. Even more is expected from those who have been entrusted with a lot."

<usfm>
\v 47 That servant, having known his lord's will, and not having prepared or done according to his will, will be beaten with many blows.
\v 48 But the one who did not know and did what deserved a beating, he will be beaten with a few blows. From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded, and the one to whom much has been entrusted, even more will be demanded of him.
