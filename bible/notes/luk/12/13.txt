===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **And someone from the crowd** - That is, "someone in the crowd." 
    * **Man** - Some understand this to be simply a way of addressing a stranger.  Others understand that Jesus was rebuking the man. Your language might have a way of addressing people in either of these ways. Some people do not translate this word at all.
    * **who made me a judge or a mediator over you?** - This is a rhetorical question. It could also be translated as "I am not your judge or mediator." Some languages would use the plural form for "you" or "your". Languages that have a dual form would use that. (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Question]], [[en:ta:vocabulary:formsofyou|Forms of you.]])
    * **mediator** - A mediator is a person who solves disagreements between people.
    * **And he said to them** - The word "them" here probably refers to the whole crowd of people. That is, "Jesus said to the crowd."
    * **Take care** - That is, "Beware" or "Watch out."
    * **Keep yourself from all greedy desires** - That is  "Guard yourself from all greed." It could also be translated as, "Don't allow yourself to love having things"  or, "Don't be controlled by the urge to have more".
    * **a man's life does not consist of the abundance of his possessions** - That is, "a person's life does not depend on having many things," or "The value of man's life is not measured by how much wealth he has."
