===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues to teach his disciples.
  * **seek his kingdom**  - "focus on God's kingdom" or "greatly desire God's kingdom"
  * **these things will be added to you **  - "these things also will be given to you." "These things" refers to food and clothing.
  * **little flock**  - Jesus was calling his disciples a flock. A flock is a group of sheep or goats that a shepherd cares for. As a shepherd cares for his sheep, God would care for Jesus' disciples. This can be translated as "small group" or "dear group." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
