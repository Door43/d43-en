===== Translation Notes: =====

    * (Jesus continues to teach his disciples.)
    * **seek his kingdom** - "focus on God's kingdom" or "greatly desire God's kingdom"
    * **these things will be added to you ** - "these things also will be given to you."  "These things" refers to food and clothing.
    * **Do not fear** - This can be translated as "Stop being afraid."
    * **little flock**  -  Jesus was calling his disciples a flock. A flock is a group of sheep or goats that a shepherd cares for. As a shepherd cares for his sheep, God would care for Jesus' disciples. This can be translated as "small group" or "dear group." (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor]])
