\v 24 Think about the birds: They do not plant \add seeds\add*, and they do not harvest \add crops\add*. They do not have rooms or buildings in which to store crops. But God provides food for them. \add And\add* you are certainly much more valuable than birds. \add So God will certainly provide what you need!\add*
\v 25 There is not a one of you who can add a little bit to how long he lives by worrying about it!\f + \ft Or: Is there any of you who can add a little bit to how long he lives by worrying about it? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 26 That is a small thing to do. So since you cannot do that, you certainly should not worry about other things that \add you need to have in order to live!\add*\f + \ft Or: why do you worry about other things that \add you need to have in order to live\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 25 None of you can add even a minute to his life by worrying about it!
\v 26 So since you cannot even do that small thing, you certainly should not worry about anything else.

\v 24 Consider the ravens, that they do not sow or reap. They have no storeroom or barn, but God feeds them. How much more valuable you are than the birds!
\v 25 And which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his lifespan?
\v 26 If then you are not able to do even that smallest thing, why do you worry about the rest?

===== Translation Notes: =====
    * (Jesus continues to teach his disciples.)
    * **ravens**  - Ravens are a kind of bird that eat the flesh of dead animals. It can be translated as "birds".
    *  How much more valuable you are than the birds! - This is an exclamation, emphasizing the fact that people are much more valuable to God then birds. 
    * **add a cubit to his lifespan** - "add half a meter to the length of his life" or "add half a meter to his life's journey." A journey is a metaphor for person's lifetime. It can be translated without the metaphor as "add even a minute his life" (UDB) or "make his life last an hour longer." (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor]])
