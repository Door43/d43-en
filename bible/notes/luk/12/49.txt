===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues to teach his disciples.
    * **I came to cast fire upon the earth**  - "I came to throw fire on the earth" or "I came to set the earth on fire."  Possible meanings for this metaphor are 1) judgment or 2) purification or 3) division. 
    * **how I wish that it was already kindled** - This is an exclamation emphasizing how much he wants this to happen. AT: "I wish very much that it was already lit" or more generally as "How I wish that it had already begun." (See the section on Sentence Types in [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_sentences]].)
    * **But I have a baptism to be baptized with** - Baptism is used here as a metaphor for suffering. Just as water covers a person during baptism, suffering will overwhelm Jesus. AT: "I will be baptized with suffering" or as a simile: "I must be overwhelmed in suffering as a person being baptized is covered by water." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]], [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
    * **But** - The word "but" is used to show that he cannot cast the fire on the earth until after he is baptized.
    * **how I am distressed until it is completed!** - This exclamation emphasizes how distressed he was. AT: "I am terribly distressed and will be so until this suffering is completed!" (See the section on Sentence Types in [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_sentences]])
