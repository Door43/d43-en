===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to teach his disciples.

  * **I came to cast fire upon the earth** - "I came to throw fire on the earth" or "I came to set the earth on fire." Possible meanings are 1) Jesus has come to judge people or 2) Jesus has come to purify believers or 3) Jesus has come to cause division among people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **how I wish that it were already kindled** - This exclamation emphasizes how much he wants this to happen. AT: "I wish very much that it was already lit" or "how I wish that it had already begun" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclamations]])
  * **But I have a baptism to be baptized with** - Here "baptism" refers to what Jesus must suffer. Just as water covers a person during baptism, suffering will overwhelm Jesus. AT: "I must go through a baptism of terrible suffering" or "I must be overwhelmed by suffering as a person being baptized is covered by water" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **But** - The word "but" is used to show that he cannot cast the fire on the earth until after he goes through his baptism.
  * **how I am distressed until it is completed** - This exclamation emphasizes how distressed he was. AT: "I am terribly distressed and will be so until I complete this baptism of suffering" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclamations]])
