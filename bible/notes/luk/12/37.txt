\v 37 Blessed are those servants, whom the master will find watching when he comes. Truly I say to you that he will tuck his long robe in his belt, make them sit down to a meal, and will come and serve them.
\v 38 If the master comes in the second watch of the night, or if even in the third watch, and finds them ready, blessed are those servants.

===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues to tell his disciples a parable.

  * **Blessed are**  - "How good it is for"
  * **whom the master will find watching when he comes**  - "whose master finds them waiting for him when he returns" or "who are ready when the master returns"
  * **he will tuck…make them sit down**  - This is a reversal the previous verses. Because the servants have been faithful to their master, the master will now reward them by serving them.
  * **he will tuck his long robe in his belt**  - This can be translated with the implicit information made explicit: “He will prepare to serve by tucking his clothes into his belt” or “He will dress to serve.” (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]])
  * **in the second watch of the night**  - This can be translated as "late at night" or "just before midnight." The second watch was between 9:00 p.m. and midnight. (See: [[en:obe:other:biblicaltimewatch]])
  * **or if even in the third watch**  - This can be translated as "or if he comes very late at night." The third watch was from midnight to 3:00 a.m. (See: [[en:obe:other:biblicaltimewatch]])
