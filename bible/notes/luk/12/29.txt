===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to teach his disciples.
  * **Do not look for what you will eat and drink**  - "Do not focus on what you will eat and drink" or "do not greatly desire more to eat and drink"
  * **all the nations of the world**  - This can be translated as "all people of other nations" or "all the unbelievers in the world." "Nations" is used here as a metonym for "unbelievers." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
