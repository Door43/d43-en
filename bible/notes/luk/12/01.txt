But first he said to his disciples, "Be careful that you do not become like the Pharisees who act religious in public, but do evil things in secret.

  * **he began to say to his disciples, first of all**  - That is, "Jesus first started speaking to his disciples, and said to them."

  * **the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.**  - This is a metaphor. It could also be translated as, "the hypocrisy of the Pharisees, which is like yeast." You could also add this explanation of how the hypocrisy is like yeast. "Just as yeast spreads through a whole lump of bread dough, their hypocrisy spreads through the whole community." This whole warning could be translated as 'Be careful that you do not become hypocrites like the Pharisees. Their evil behavior influences everyone just as yeast affects a lump of dough.
