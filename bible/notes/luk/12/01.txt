\v 1 Meanwhile, many thousands of people gathered around Jesus. There were so many that they were stepping on each other. But first he said to his disciples, "Be careful that you do not become like the Pharisees who act religious in public, but do evil things in secret. Just like yeast causes a lump of dough to rise, their evil behavior causes others to be hypocrites like they are.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This is the next part of the story. Jesus begins to teach his disciples in front of thousands of people.

  * **In the meantime** - "While they were doing that"
  * **when many thousands of the people ... they trampled on each other** - This is background information that tells the setting of the story. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **many thousands of the people** - "a very great crowd"
  * **they trampled on each other** - This is probably an exaggeration to emphasize that so many people were crowded close together that they would step on each other. AT: "they were stepping on each other" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **he began to say to his disciples first of all** - "Jesus first started speaking to his disciples, and said to them"
  * **Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy** - Just as yeast spreads through a whole lump of bread dough, their hypocrisy was spreading through the whole community. AT: "Guard yourself against the hypocrisy of the Pharisees, which is like yeast" or "Be careful that you do not become hypocrites like the Pharisees. Their evil behavior influences everyone just as yeast affects a lump of dough" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
