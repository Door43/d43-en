\v 8 I tell you also, that if people tell others that they are my disciples, then I, the Son of Man, will say that they are my disciples to God's angels.
\v 9 But if they tell others that they are not my disciples, then I will say to God's angels that they are not my disciples.
\v10 I also tell you that if people say evil things about me, the Son of Man, God will forgive them for that. But if people say evil things about the Holy Spirit, God will not forgive them for that.
