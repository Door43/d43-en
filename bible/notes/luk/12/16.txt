\v 19 Then I will say to myself, "Now I have enough things stored up to last many years. So now I will take life easy. I will eat and drink and be happy!"'

\v 16 Then Jesus told them a parable, saying, "The field of a certain rich man yielded abundantly,
\v 17 and he reasoned with himself, saying, 'What will I do, because I do not have a place to store my crops?'
\v 18 He said, 'This is what will I do: I will pull down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store all of my grain and other good things/food.
\v 19 I will say to my soul, 'Soul, you have many good things/much food stored up for many years; rest easy, eat, drink, be merry.'
