\v 39 But you must also remember this: If the owner of a house knew what time the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have allowed the thief to break into his house.
\v 40 So be ready, because I, the Son of Man, will come again at a time when you do not expect me."

\v 39 Moreover know this, that if the master of the house had known the hour the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into.

    * [[:en:obe:kt:sonofman]]

===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues to tell his disciples a parable.

  * **because you do not know the hour when the Son of Man comes** - The only similarity between a thief and the Son of Man is that people do not know when either one will come, so they need to be ready.
  * **when the Son of Man comes** -  Jesus was talking about himself. So it can be translated as "when I, the Son of Man, will come."
