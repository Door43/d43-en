\v 54 He also said to the crowds, "When you see a dark cloud forming in the west, you immediately say 'It is going to rain!' and that is what happens.
\v 55 When the wind blows from the south, you say, 'It is going to be a very hot day!' and you are right.
\v 56 You hypocrites! By observing the clouds and the wind, you are able to discern what is happening regarding the weather. Why are you not able to discern what God is doing at this present time?

\v 54 Jesus  was saying to the crowds also, "When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say, 'A shower is coming,' and so it happens.
\v 55 And when a south wind is blowing, you say, 'There will be a scorching heat,' and it happens.
\v 56 Hypocrites, you know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the heavens, but how is it that you do not know how to interpret the present time?
