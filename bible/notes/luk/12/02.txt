===== Translation Notes: =====


    * (Jesus continues to warn his disciples against hypocricy.)
    * **There is nothing concealed will not be revealed.**  - This could also be translated as "Everything that is hidden will be shown" or "People will find out about everything that people do secretly."
    * **and nothing hidden, that will not be made known**  - This part of the sentence uses different words to say the same thing as the first part in order to emphasize its truth. (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:doublet]])
    * **spoken in the ear**  - This could also be translated as "whispered to another person."
    * **in the inner chambers**  - "in a closed room." It could also be translated as "behind closed doors" or "in privacy."
    * **will be proclaimed**  - "will be shouted loudly" or "people will proclaim"
    * **upon the housetops**  - Houses in Israel had flat roofs, so people could go up and stand on top of them. If readers would be distracted trying to imagine how people would get up on the house tops, this could also be translated with a more general expression, such as "from a high place where everyone will be able to hear."
