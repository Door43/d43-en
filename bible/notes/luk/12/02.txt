\v 2 People will not be able to continue covering up their sins the way they can now. Someday God will let everyone know the things that people hide now.
\v 3 Everything you say in the dark, someday people will hear in the daylight. Whatever you whisper in your room will someday be as public as if it were shouted from the rooftops."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 2 But there is nothing concealed, that will not be revealed, and nothing hidden, that will not be known.
\v 3 So whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light, and what you have spoken in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed upon the housetops.

===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues to warn his disciples against hypocrisy.

  * **There is nothing concealed that will not be revealed**  - This could also be translated as "Everything that is hidden will be shown" or "People will find out about everything that people do secretly."
  * **and nothing hidden, that will not be made known**  - This part of the sentence uses different words to say the same thing as the first part in order to emphasize its truth. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **spoken in the ear**  - This could also be translated as "whispered to another person."
  * **in the inner chambers**  - "in a closed room." It could also be translated as "behind closed doors" or "in privacy" or "secretly."
  * **will be proclaimed**  - "will be shouted loudly" or "people will proclaim"
  * **upon the housetops**  - Houses in Israel had flat roofs, so people could go up and stand on top of them. If readers would be distracted trying to imagine how people would get up on the house tops, this could also be translated with a more general expression, such as "from a high place where everyone will be able to hear."
