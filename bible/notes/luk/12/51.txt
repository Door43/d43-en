\v 51 Do you think that I came to bring peace on the earth? No, I tell you, but rather division.
\v 52 For from now on there will be five in one house divided: three people against two, or two people against three.
\v 53 They will be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against mother; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law."
