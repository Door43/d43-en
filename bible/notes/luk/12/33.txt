\v 33 So now sell the things that you own. Give the money to those who do not have as much as you do. Get yourselves wallets that don't get worn out, that is, store up treasure in heaven where it will always be safe. There, no thief can come near to steal it, and no termite can destroy it.
\v 34 Whatever it is that you treasure, that is what you will think about and spend your time on.
