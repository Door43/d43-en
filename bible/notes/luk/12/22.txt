===== Translation Notes: =====

    * (Jesus continues to teach his disciples not to worry about food and possessions.)
    * **Therefore I say to you **- That is, "Because of this story I mentioned I say to you," or "So I tell you."
    * **Do not worry**- That is, "Do not be thinking too much about." This has the idea of "do not make it your habit to worry," or "do not make it part of your life to worry."
