===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues to teach his disciples.

  * **woe to you** - This phrase is repeated three times. It is the opposite of "blessed are you." Each time, it indicates that God's anger is directed at the people, or that something negative or bad awaits them.
  * **woe to you who are rich** - "how terrible it is for you who are rich " or "trouble will come to you who are rich." AT: "You who are rich, how sad for you" or "You who are rich, what sorrow you will have." 
  * **your comfort** - "what comforts you" or "what satisfies you" or "what makes you happy"
  * **who are full now** - "whose stomachs are full now" or "who eat much now"
  * **who laugh now** - "who are happy now"
