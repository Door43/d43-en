\v 7 The men who taught the \add Jewish\add* laws and the Pharisees \add who were there\add* watched Jesus, to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath\f + \ft Or: on the Jewish rest day \f*. They did this so that, \add if he healed the man\add*, they would accuse him \add of disobeying their laws by working on the day of rest\add*.
\v 8 But Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said to the man with the shriveled hand, "Come and stand here \add in front of everyone\add*!" So the man got up and stood there.

\v 6 It happened on another Sabbath that he went into the synagogue and taught the people there. A man was there whose right hand was shriveled.
\v 7 The scribes and the Pharisees were watching him closely to see whether he would heal someone on the Sabbath, so that they might find a reason to accuse him of doing something wrong.
\v 8 But he knew what they were thinking and he said to the man whose hand was shriveled, "Get up, and stand here in the middle of everyone." So the man got up and stood there.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **And it happened** - This phrase is used here to mark the beginning of a new part of the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **hand was shriveled**  - The man's hand was damaged in such a way that he could not stretch it. It was probably bent into almost a fist, making it look smaller and wrinkled.
  * **were watching him closely** - "were watching Jesus carefully"
  * **so that they might find** - This could be translated as "because they wanted to find."
  * **in the middle of everyone** - This could be translated as "in front of everyone" (UDB). Jesus wanted the man to stand where everyone there could see him.
