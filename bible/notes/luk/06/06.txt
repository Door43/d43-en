\v 7 The men who taught the \add Jewish\add* laws and the Pharisees \add who were there\add* watched Jesus, to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath\f + \ft Or: on the Jewish rest day \f*. They did this so that, \add if he healed the man\add*, they would accuse him \add of disobeying their laws by working on the day of rest\add*.
\v 8 But Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said to the man with the shriveled hand, "Come and stand here \add in front of everyone\add*!" So the man got up and stood there.
