  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to speak to his disciples and the crowd who is listening to him as well.

  * **to you who are listening** - Jesus now begins to speak to the entire crowd, rather than just to his disciples. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_participants]])
  * **love ... do good ... Bless ... pray** - Each of these commands are to be done continually, not just a single time.
  * **love your enemies** - This does not mean they were to only love their enemies and not their friends. This can be stated. AT: "Love your enemies, not only your friends!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **love ... do good to** - These two phrases mean the same thing, and together emphasize the point. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Bless those** - God is the one who blesses. This can made explicit. AT: "Ask God to bless those" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
