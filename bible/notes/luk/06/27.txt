===== Translation Notes: =====
Apparently Jesus begins to speak to the whole crowd that was there, including those who were not his disciples.

  * **love… do good… bless… pray**  - Each of these commands are to be done continually, not just a single time.
  * **love your enemies**  - "care about your enemies" or "do what is good for your enemies"
  * **those who curse you**  - "those who habitually curse you"
  * **those who mistreat you**  - "those who habitually mistreat you"
