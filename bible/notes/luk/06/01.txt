  * **grain fields**  - In this case, these are large sections of land where wheat seed had been scattered to grow more wheat.
  * **heads of grain**  - This is the topmost part of the wheat plant, which is a kind of large grass. It holds the mature grain or seeds of the plant.
  * **Why are you doing something that is not lawful to do on the Sabbath** - This could be translated as, "Why are you picking grain on the Sabbath?"
