===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Now it happened** - This phrase is used here to mark the beginning of a new part of the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **grain fields**  - In this case, these are large sections of land where wheat seed had been scattered to grow more wheat.
  * **heads of grain**  - This is the topmost part of the wheat plant, which is a kind of large grass. It holds the mature grain or seeds of the plant.
  * **Why are you doing something that is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day?** - This could be translated as, "Why are you picking grain on the Sabbath?" It is a rhetorical question that means "Picking grain on the Sabbath is against God's law!" The word "you" is plural, and refers to the disciples.
