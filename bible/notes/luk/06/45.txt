===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The good man**  - "The good person." The word "good" here refers to moral goodness. The word "man" here refers to a person, male or female. Since it does not refer to a specific person, it could also be translated as "A good person" or "Good people" (UDB).
  * **from the good treasure of his heart**  - "from among the good things in his heart"  or "from the good thoughts he has stored in his heart"
  * **brings forth that which is good**  - "brings out good things." This could also be translated without the metaphor as "produces life that is morally good, or "lives his life in a morally good way." or "does good things" (UDB).
  * This is a metaphor that compares the things that a person thinks to things that a person would store carefully in a safe place. And it compares living a good life or doing good things to taking good things out of one's heart. It could also be translated without the figure of speech as in the UDB. (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor|Metaphor]])

  * **For from the abundance of his heart his mouth speaks**  - "For his mouth speaks about the things that his heart is full of." or "What is in a person's heart affects what he says." the That is, "What a person keeps in his heart is what a person will talk about," or "what a person highly values in his heart will show itself in how he speaks."
