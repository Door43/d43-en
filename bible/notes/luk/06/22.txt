\v 22 It is very good when other people hate you, when they reject you, when they insult you and say that you are evil because you follow me, the Son of Man.
\v 23 When that happens, rejoice! Jump up and down because you are so happy! God will give you a great reward in heaven! Do not forget that their ancestors did similar things to God's prophets long ago!

<usfm>
\v 22 Blessed are you when people hate you and when they separate you from their company, they hate you, and they reject your name as being evil, for the sake of the Son of Man.
\v 23 Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because you will surely have a great reward in heaven, for their ancestors treated the prophets in the same way.
