<usfm>
\v 46 Jesus said to the people, "Why do you call me 'Lord' when you don't even obey what I say to do?
\v 47 Let me tell you what people are like who come to me, hear my teachings, and obey them.
\v 48 They are like a man who dug deep into the ground to prepare to build his house. He made sure that the foundation for the house was built on solid rock. Then there was a flood and a torrent of water was beating against the house. But the torrent could not even shake the house, because the house was built on a solid foundation.

\v 46 Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and yet you do not obey the things that I say?
\v 47 Every person who comes to me and hears my words and obeys them, I will tell you what he is like.
\v 48 He is like a man building a house, who dug down deep in the ground and built the house's foundation on solid rock. When a flood came, the torrent of water flowed against that house, but could not shake it, because it had been well built.

===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus teaches the crowd about the importance of obeying him.

    * **a man building a house...** - *This metaphor compares a man building a house on rock to a person who lives his life based on the teachings of Jesus. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **foundation** - "base" or "support" 
    * **solid rock** - This is the very large, hard rock that is deep under the soil. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **built the house's foundation on solid rock** - "dug the foundation of the house deep enough to reach" or "built the house on solid rock." Some cultures may not be familiar with building on bedrock. In those cases, this could be translated in a more general way as in "set the house's foundation firmly in solid ground." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **torrent of water** - "fast-moving water" or "river" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **flowed against** - "crashed against" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **because it had been well built** - "because the man had built it well" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]], [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
