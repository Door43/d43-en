\v 46 Jesus said to the people, "Why do you call me 'Lord' when you don't even obey what I say to do?
\v 47 This is what people are like who come to me, hear my teachings, and obey them:
\v 48 They are like a man who dug deep into the ground to prepare to build his house. He made sure that the foundation for the house was built on solid rock. Then there was a flood and a torrent of water was beating against the house. But the torrent could not even shake the house, because the house was built on a solid foundation.

\v 46 And why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and yet you do not obey the things that I say?
\v 47 Every person who comes to me and hears my words and obeys them, I will tell you what he is like:
\v 48 he is like a man building a house, who dug down deep in the ground and built the house's foundation on solid rock. And when a flood came, the torrent of water flowed against that house, but could not shake it, because it had been well built.
