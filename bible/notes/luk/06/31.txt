\v 31 As you want people to do to you, you should do the same to them.
\v 32 If you only love people who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.
\v 33 If you do good only to people who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.
\v 34 If you only lend to people who you expect will pay you back, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to get back the same amount.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **As you want people to do to you, you should do the same to them** - In some languages it may be more natural to reverse the order. AT: "You should do to people the same as what you want them to do to you" or "Treat people they way you want them to treat you"
  * **what credit is that to you?** - "What reward will you receive?" or "What praise will you receive for doing that?" This can be written as a statement. AT: "You will not receive any reward for that" or "God will not reward you for that" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **to get back the same amount** - The law of Moses commanded the Jews not to receive interest on money they loaned to each other. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
