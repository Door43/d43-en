\v 31 As you want people to do to you, you should do the same to them.
\v 32 If you only love people who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.
\v 33 If you do good only to people who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.
\v 34 If you only lend things to people who you expect will give them back to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, and expect to receive the same amount back again.

===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues to teach the crowd to love their enemies.

  * **As you want people to do to you, you should do the same to them** - In some languages it may be more natural to reverse the order. AT: "You should do to people the same as what you want them to do to you" or "Treat people they way you want them to treat you."
  * **what credit is that to you?** - "What reward will you receive?" AT: "You will not receive any credit for that."  or "What praise will you receive for doing that?" or "Will anyone think that you have done something special?" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
