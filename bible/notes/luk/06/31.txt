\v 31 And as you want people to do to you, you should do the same to them.
\v 32 And if you only love people who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.
\v 33 And if you do good only to people who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.
\v 34 And if you only lend things to people who you expect will give them back to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, and expect to receive the same amount back again.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * (Jesus continues to teach his disciples to love their enemies.)
    * **as you want people to do to you, you should do the same to them** - In some languages it may be more natural to reverse the order. "You should do to people the same as what you want them to do to you" or "Treat people they way you want them to treat you."
    * **what credit is that to you?** - This is a rhetorical question. It could also be translated with a statement "You will not receive any credit for that.  (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Questions]])  This could also be translated as "What praise will you receive for doing that? or "Will anyone think that you have done something special?" Another possible meaning is "What reward will you receive?" 
    * **if you only lend things to people who... ** - This could also be translated as "if you only allow people who ... to borrow from you." This is not lending to receive interest.
