===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus includes some examples to make his point. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]])

  * **Can a blind person guide another blind person?** - Jesus used this question to get the people to think about something that they already know. This can be written as a statement. AT: "We all know that a blind person cannot guide another blind person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **blind person** - The person who is "blind" is a metaphor for a person who has not been taught as a disciple. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **If he did** - Some languages might prefer, "if one did." This is an absurd situation that is not likely to actually happen. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **they would both fall into a pit, would they not?** - This can be written as a statement. AT: "both of them would fall into a hole" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **A disciple is not greater than his teacher** - Possible meanings are 1) "A disciple does not have more knowledge than his teacher" or 2) "A disciple does not have more authority than his teacher." AT: "A disciple does not surpass his teacher"
  * **everyone when he is fully trained** - "every disciple who has been trained well" or "every disciple whose teacher has fully taught him"
