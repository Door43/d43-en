===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues to teach the crowd not to judge people.

  * **Can a blind person guide another blind person?**  - Jesus used this rhetorical question to get people to think about something that they already knew. It can be translated as "A blind person cannot guide another blind person, can he?" or "We all know that a blind person cannot guide another blind person." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **If he did**  - Some languages might prefer "if one did."
  * **they would both fall into a pit, would they not?**  - This is another rhetorical question. It could be translated as "Would they not both fall into a pit?" or "They both would fall into a hole" (UDB).  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **A disciple is not greater than his teacher**  - This could either mean 1) "A disciple does not have more knowledge than his teacher" or 2) "A disciple does not have more authority than his teacher." It could be translated as "A disciple has not surpassed his teacher."
  * **everyone when he is completely trained**  - "every disciple who has been trained well." It can be translated with an active verb: "every disciple whose training has reached its goal" or "every disciple whose teacher has fully taught him." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
