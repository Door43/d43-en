===== Translation Notes: =====

    * (Jesus teaches his disciples not to judge people.)
    * **Can a blind person guide another blind person?** - Jesus used this rhetorical question to get people to think about something that they already knew. It can also be translated as "A blind person cannot guide another blind person, can he?" or "We all know that a blind person cannot guide another blind person." (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Questions]])
    * **If he did** - Some languages might prefer "if one did."
    * **they would both fall into a pit, would they not?**- This is another rhetorical question. It could also be translated as "Would they not both fall into the pit?" or "They would both fall into a pit."
    * **A disciple is not greater than his teacher** - That is, "A disciple is not more trained than his teacher, or "a disciple does not have more knowledge than his teacher." It could also be translated as "A disciple has not surpassed his teacher."
    * **everyone when he is completely trained will be like his teacher**- That is "every disciple who has been trained well will be like his teacher" or "every disciple who's training has reached its goal will be like his teacher." Original language means to adjust down or fit together​.
