===== Translation Notes: =====
This is a list of the twelve men Jesus chose to be his apostles.

  * **The names of the apostles were** - This phrase introducing the names was added to the ULB to clarify what the list is.  Some translators may prefer not to write it.
  * **his brother, Andrew** - "Simon's brother, Andrew"
  * **Zealot** - Possible meanings are 1) "the Zealot" or 2) "the zealous one." The first meaning indicates he was part of the group of people who wanted to free the Jewish people from Roman rule. AT: "patriot" or "nationalist." The second meaning indicates that he was zealous for God to be honored. AT: "passionate."
  * **became a traitor** - AT: "betrayed his friend" or "turned his friend over to enemies" (usually in return for money paid) or "exposed a friend to danger by telling enemies about him"
