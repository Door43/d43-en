    * **Do not judge** - "Do not judge people"
    * **and** - This could also be translated as "and as a result"
    * **you will not be judged**  - Jesus did not say explicitly who would not judge. In some languages this could be translated as "someone will not judge you" or "they will not judge you." If you need to make it explicit who would not judge, you  could also translate it as "God will not judge you" or "no one will judge you" (See: [[en:ta:vocabulary:implicitexplicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]], [[en:ta:vocabulary:active|Active or Passive]])
    * **Do not condemn** - "Do not condemn people". 
    * **you will not be condemned**  - See the note for "you will not be judged."
    * **you will be forgiven** - See the note for "you will not be judged." This could also be translated as "Someone will forgive you" or "They will forgive you" or "God will forgive you."
