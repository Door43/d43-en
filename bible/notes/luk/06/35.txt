\v 35 Instead, love your enemies! Do good things for them! Lend to them, and do not expect them to pay anything back! Then God will give you a great reward. And you will be children of God the Most High, since God is kind even to people who are unthankful and wicked.
\v 36 So you should act mercifully toward other people, just like your Father in heaven acts mercifully toward people.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * (Jesus continues to teach the crowd to love their enemies.)
    * **your reward will be great**  - "you will receive a great reward"  or "you will receive good payment" or "you will receive good gifts because of it"
    * **you will be sons of the Most High**  - The words "sons of" is an idiom meaning "like." It indicates that people who love their enemies act like God acts. This could be translated as "you will be acting like children of the the Most High God"  or "you will be like the Most High God." Make sure that the word "sons" is plural so it is not confused with Jesus' title "The Son of God."
    * **unthankful and evil people** - "people who who do not thank him and who are evil"
    * **your Father** - This refers to God. This could be made clearer by saying "your Father in heaven."
