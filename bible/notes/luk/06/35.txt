\v 35 Instead, love your enemies! Do good things for them! Lend to them, and do not expect them to pay anything back! Then God will give you a great reward. And you will be children of God the Most High, since God is kind even to people who are unthankful and wicked.
\v 36 So you should act mercifully toward other people, just like your Father in heaven acts mercifully toward people.

\v 35 But love your enemies and do them good. Lend to them, never worrying about getting anything back, and your reward will be great. And you will be sons of the Most High, for he himself is kind toward unthankful and evil people.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * (Jesus continues to teach his disciples about how to relate to people.)
    * **your reward will be great**  - "you will receive a great reward"  or "you will receive good payment" or "you will receive good gifts because of it."
    * **sons of the Most High**  - The words "sons of" is an idiom meaning "like." This could also be translated as "You will be like sons of the the Most High God." That is, you will be doing what God does and so acting like his sons would in representing him as a son would.
    * **unthankful and evil people - "people who who do not thank him and who are evil."
    * **your Father** - This refers to God.
