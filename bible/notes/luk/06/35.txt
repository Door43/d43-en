\v 35 Instead, love your enemies! Do good things for them! Lend to them, and do not expect them to pay anything back! Then God will give you a great reward. And you will be children of God the Most High, since God is kind even to people who are unthankful and wicked.
\v 36 So you should act mercifully toward other people, just like your Father in heaven acts mercifully toward people.
