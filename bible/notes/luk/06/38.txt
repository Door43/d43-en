<usfm>
\v 38 Give good things to others, and then God will give good things to you. It will be like he is giving you a generous amount of grain, pressing it down in a basket and shaking the basket to make sure it is completely full, to the point that some of the grain even spills over the sides! Remember that the standard you use to judge or bless others will be the standard God uses to judge or bless you!"

<usfm>
\v 38 Give to others, and it will be given to you. A generous amount -- pressed down, shaken together and spilling over -- they will pour into your lap. For with whatever standard of measure you use to measure with, that same standard will be used to measure for you.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **and it will be given to you** -  Jesus did not say explicitly who would give. In some languages this could be translated as “someone will give it to you” or “they will give it to you.” If you need to make it explicit who would give it, you could translate it as “God will give it to you."  (See: [[en:ta:vocabulary:implicitexplicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]], [[en:ta:vocabulary:active|Active or Passive]])
    * **a generous amount** - "a large amount"
    * **A generous amount ... your lap** - The order of this sentence can be reversed and active verbs can be used. "They will pour into your lap a generous amount that they have pressed down and shaken together and that is spilling over." Jesus used the metaphor of a grain merchant giving a generous amount. It could also be translated as a simile "Like a grain merchant who presses down the grain and shakes it together and pours in so much grain that it spills over, they will give generously to you." (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor|Metaphor]],  [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:simile|Simile]])
    * **the same standard will be used to measure for you** - This can also be translated as "They will use the same size measure to measure things for you" or "They will measure things for you by the same standard."
