\v 15 One day people were bringing even their babies to  Jesus so that he would put his hands on them and bless them. When the disciples saw this, they told them not to do that.
\v 16 But Jesus called for the children to  be brought to him. He said, "Let the little children come to me! Do not stop them! It is humble and trusting people like these children who can experience God ruling them in his kingdom.
\v 17 Indeed I say to you that whoever does not enter into God's kingdom as humbly as a child does, will not enter it at all."

\v 15 And they were also bringing to him their infants, so that he might touch them, but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.
\v 16 But Jesus called them to him, saying, "Permit the little children to come to me, and do not forbid them. For the kingdom of God belongs to such ones.
\v 17 Truly I say to you, whoever will not receive the kingdom of God as a child does will definitely not enter it."
