===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus begins to tell a parable as he continues to teach his disciples. This is the same part of the story that began in [[:en:bible:notes:luk:17:20|17:20]]. Verse 1 gives us a description of the parable Jesus is about to tell. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]])

  * **Then he** - "Then Jesus"
  * **they should always pray, and not become discouraged** - These two clauses have similar meanings, which Jesus used to emphasize his point. Some languages have different ways of emphasizing. AT: "they should always keep on praying" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **saying** - This could also begin a new sentence: "He said" 
  * **a certain city** - Here "certain city" is a way to let the listener know that the narrative that follows takes place in a city, but the name of the city itself is not important. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_intro]])
  * **did not respect people** - "did not care about other people"
