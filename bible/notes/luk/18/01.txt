===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues speaking to his disciples.
  * **Then he** - "Then Jesus"
  * **saying** - This could also begin a new sentence: "He said" (UDB).
  * **not become discouraged**  - This could also be translated as "not grow tired of praying" or "not lose faith."
  * **There was in a certain city a certain judge**  - The words "certain" are used to as a way to say this this happened, but without identifying the judge or the city.
  * **fear**  - "revere" (UDB)
  * **did not respect people**  - "paid no regard to a person"
