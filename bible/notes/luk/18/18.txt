\v 18 Once a Jewish leader asked Jesus, "Good teacher, what must I do in order to have eternal life?"
\v 19 Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? God is the only one who is truly good!
\p
\v 20 In answer to your question, certainly you know the commandments that God gave to Moses for us to obey:  'Do not commit adultery, do not murder anyone, do not steal, do not give a false report, honor your father and mother.'"
\v 21 The man said, "I have obeyed all those commandments ever since I was young."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **what must I do**  - "what do I need to do" or "what is required of me"
  * **inherit**  - "become the rightful owner of." This usually refers to the property of someone who has died. Luke uses this metaphor to show that the ruler understood that eternal life could not be earned, and that not everyone will live eternally. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **No one is good, except God alone**  - This could also be translated as two sentences: "No person is truly good. God alone is good."
  * **do not kill**  - "do not murder"
  * **All these things**  - "All of these commandments"
