===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Behold**  - This indicates a significant change in the ministry of Jesus as he goes to Jerusalem for the final time.
  * **the prophets**  - This refers to the Old Testament prophets.
  * **will be accomplished**  - "will happen" or "will occur"
  * **Son of Man**  - Jesus speaks of himself as "the Son of Man" and uses "he" to refer to himself.
  * **on the third day**  - This refers to the third day after his death. However, the disciples did not yet understand this, so it is best not to add this explanation when translating this verse.
