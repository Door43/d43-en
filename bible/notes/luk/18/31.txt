\v 32 My enemies will put me into the power of the non-Jews. They  will mock me, treat me with disdain and spit on me.
\v 33 They will whip me, and then they will kill me. But, on the third day after that I will become alive again."

\v 31 After he gathered the twelve to himself, he said to them, "See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things that have been written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be accomplished.
\v 32 For he will be given over to the Gentiles, and will be mocked, and shamefully treated, and spit upon.
\v 33 After whipping him, they will kill him and on the third day he will rise again."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **See**  - This indicates a significant change in the ministry of Jesus as he goes to Jerusalem for the final time.
  * **the prophets**  - This refers to the Old Testament prophets.
  * **will be accomplished**  - "will happen" or "will occur"
  * **Son of Man**  - Jesus speaks of himself as "the Son of Man" and uses "he" to refer to himself.
  * **on the third day**  - This refers to the third day after his death. However, the disciples did not yet understand this, so it is best not to add this explanation when translating this verse.
