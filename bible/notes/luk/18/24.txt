<usfm>
\v 24 When Jesus saw how sad the man was, he too became very sorrowful. He said, "It is very difficult for those who are wealthy to agree for God to rule over them."
\v 25 In fact, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for rich people to let God rule their lives."

===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **Then Jesus, seeing him, became very sad**  - This phrase is absent from many Greek manuscripts and so often omitted from English translations.
  * **a camel to go through a needle's eye** - It is impossible for a camel to fit through the eye of a needle. Therefore, it appears that Jesus may have been using hyperbole to say "it is extremely difficult for a rich man to be saved." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **needle's eye** - The needle's eye is the hole in a sewing needle through which the thread is passed.
