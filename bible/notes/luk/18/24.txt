\v 24 When Jesus saw how sad the man was, he too became very sorrowful. He said, "It is very difficult for those who are wealthy to agree for God to rule over them."
\v 25 In fact, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for rich people to let God rule their lives."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **How difficult it is ... kingdom of God!** - This is an exclamation, and not a question. AT: "It is so very hard ... kingdom of God!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclamations]])
  * **a camel to go through a needle's eye** - It is impossible for a camel to fit through the eye of a needle. Jesus was probably using hyperbole to mean it is extremely difficult for a rich man to enter God's kingdom. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **needle's eye** - The needle's eye is the hole in a sewing needle through which the thread is passed.
