\v 13 But the tax collector stood far away from the other people in the temple courtyard. He would not even look up toward heaven. Instead, he beat on his chest  and said, 'O God, please be merciful to me and forgive me, because I am a terrible sinner!'"
\v 14 Then Jesus said, "I tell you that the tax collector was forgiven as they left to go home, but not the Pharisee. This is because everyone who exalts himself will be made humble, and everyone who humbles himself will be exalted."

\v 13 But the tax collector, standing at a distance, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but hit his breast, saying, 'God, be merciful to me, a sinner.'
\v 14 I say to you, this man went back down to his house justified rather than the other, because everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but everyone who humbles himself will be exalted."

===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues to speak to these people.
    * **lift up his eyes to heaven**  - AT: "look toward heaven" or "look upward" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
    * **hit his breast**  - This is a physical expression of great sorrow, and shows this man's repentance and humility.
    * **God be merciful to me a sinner** - This could be translated as "God, please have mercy on me even though I am a terrible sinner," or "God please be merciful to me. I am a great sinner." 
    * **this man**- "the tax collector"
    * **rather than the other** - "rather than the other man" or "instead of the other man" or "and not the other man." This can also be translated as "but the other man was not justified."
    * **because everyone who exalts himself...** - With this phrase, Jesus switches from the story to state the general principle that the story illustrates. 
    * **exalted**  - "greatly honored"
