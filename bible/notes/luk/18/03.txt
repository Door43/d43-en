\v 3 There was a widow in that city who kept coming to that judge, saying, 'Please get justice for me from the man who is opposing me in court.
\v 4 For a long time the judge refused to help her. But later, he said to himself, 'I do not revere God and I do not care about people,
\v 5 but this widow keeps bothering me! So I will judge her case and make sure she is treated fairly, because if I do not do that, she will exhaust me by continually coming to me!'"

\v 3 Now there was a widow in that city, and she came often to him, saying, 'Help me get justice against my opponent.'
\v 4 And for a long time he was not willing to help her, but after awhile he said to himself, 'Though I do not fear God or respect man,
\v 5 yet because this widow causes me trouble, I will help her get justice, so that she does not wear me out by her constant coming.'"
