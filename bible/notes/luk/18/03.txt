\v 3 There was a widow in that city who kept coming to that judge, saying, 'Please get justice for me from the man who is opposing me in court.
\v 4 For a long time the judge refused to help her. But later, he said to himself, 'I do not revere God and I do not care about people,
\v 5 but this widow keeps bothering me! So I will judge her case and make sure she is treated fairly, because if I do not do that, she will exhaust me by continually coming to me!'"

\v 3 Now there was a widow in that city, and she came often to him, saying, 'Help me get justice against my opponent.'
\v 4 For a long time he was not willing to help her, but after awhile he said to himself, 'Though I do not fear God or respect man,
\v 5 yet because this widow causes me trouble, I will help her get justice, so that she does not wear me out by her constant coming.'"

===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues telling his parable.
  * **widow**  - A widow is a woman whose husband has died. Jesus' hearers would have thought of her as without defense against evildoers.
  * **help me get justice against** - This could be translated as "punish" or "grant me retribution against."
  * **my opponent**  - "my enemy" or "the person who is trying to harm me." This is an opponent in a lawsuit. It is not clear whether the woman is suing the man or the man is suing the woman.
  * **fear God**  - "revere God"
  * **man**  - This refers here to "people" in general.
  * **causes me trouble**  - This can also be translated as "bothers me."
  * **wear me out **- "exhaust me"
  * **by her constant coming**  - "by continually coming to me"
