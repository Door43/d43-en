\v 3 There was a widow in that city who kept coming to that judge, saying, 'Please get justice for me from the man who is opposing me in court.
\v 4 For a long time the judge refused to help her. But later, he said to himself, 'I do not revere God and I do not care about people,
\v 5 but this widow keeps bothering me! So I will judge her case and make sure she is treated fairly, because if I do not do that, she will exhaust me by continually coming to me!'"

\v 3 Now there was a widow in that town, and she came often to him, saying, 'Help me get justice against my opponent.'
\v 4 For a long time he was not willing to help her, but after awhile he said to himself, 'Though I do not fear God or respect man,
\v 5 yet because this widow causes me trouble, I will help her get justice, so that she does not wear me out by her constant coming.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Now there was a widow** - Jesus uses this phrase to introduce a new character to the story. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_participants]])
  * **widow** - A widow is a woman whose husband has died. Jesus' hearers would have thought of her as a person who had no one to protect her from those who wanted to harm her.
  * **she came often to him** - The word "him" refers to the judge.
  * **Help me get justice against** - "Give me a just ruling against"
  * **my opponent** - "my enemy" or "the person who is trying to harm me." This is an opponent in a lawsuit. It is not clear whether the widow is suing the man or the man is suing the widow.
  * **man** - This refers here to "people" in general. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_gendernotations]])
  * **causes me trouble** - "bothers me"
  * **wear me out** - "exhaust me"
  * **by her constant coming** - "by continually coming to me"
