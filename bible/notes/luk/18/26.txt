===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Those hearing it said** - "The people who listening to Jesus said"
  * **Then who can be saved?** - It is possible that they were asking for an answer. But it is more likely that they used the question to emphasize their surprise at what Jesus said. AT: "Then no one can be saved from sin!" or in active form: "Then God will not save anyone!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **impossible for people** - "people cannot do"
  * **possible with God** - "possible for God to do" or "God can do"
