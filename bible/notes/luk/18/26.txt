===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Those hearing it** - This can also be translated as "The people who heard what Jesus said.
    * **Then who can be saved?** - It is possible that they were asking for an answer. But it is more likely that this is a rhetorical question that means "Then no one can be saved!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **be saved** - "to be saved from sin"
    * **possible with God** - "possible for God to do"
