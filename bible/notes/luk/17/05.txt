===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Increase our faith**  - That is, "Please give us more faith" or "Please add more faith to our faith."
  * **If you had faith as a mustard seed**  - That is, "If you had faith that was even as small as mustard seed" or "If only your faith was as big as a mustard seed, but it isn't." The construction of the phrase implies that they did not, in fact, have faith that was even the size of a mustard seed.
  * **be uprooted, and be planted in the sea**  - That is, "uproot yourself and plant yourself in the sea" or "take your roots out of the ground, and put your roots down into the ocean."
  * **it would obey you**  - That is, "the tree would obey you." This result is conditional–it would happen only if they had faith.
