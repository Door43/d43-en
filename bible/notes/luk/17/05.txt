\v 6 The Lord replied, "Even if you had faith that was no bigger than this tiny mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, 'Pull yourself with your roots out of the ground and plant yourself in the sea' and it would obey you!"

===== translationWords: =====

  * [[:en:obe:kt:apostle]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:lord]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:faith]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:obey]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Increase our faith**  - "Please give us more faith" or "Please add more faith to our faith"
  * **If you had faith as a mustard seed**  - This could be translated as "If you had faith that was even as small as mustard seed" or "If only your faith was as big as a mustard seed, but it isn't." The construction of the phrase implies that they did not, in fact, have faith that was even the size of a mustard seed.
  * **a sycamore tree** - “a sycamore fig tree.” It produces small round fruit about 2.5 centimeters across. This can be translated simply as “a fig tree” or “a tree.”
  * **be uprooted, and be planted in the sea**  - This could be translated as "uproot yourself and plant yourself in the sea" or "take your roots out of the ground, and put your roots down into the ocean."
  * **it would obey you**  - "the tree would obey you" This result is conditional. It would happen only if they had faith.
