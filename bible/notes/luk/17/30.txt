===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues speaking.

    * **After the same manner it will be** - This means "It will be like that." How it will be like the time of Lot can be stated clearly as in the UDB: "People will be unprepared." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
    * **on the day that the Son of Man is revealed** -  "when the Son of Man appears" or "when the Son of man comes"
    * **do not let him that is on the housetop go down**  - “Whoever is on the housetop must not go down” or “If anyone is on his housetop, he must not go down” 
    * **on the housetop** - Their housetops were flat and people could sit on them.
    * **his goods** - "his possessions" or "his things"
    * **return back**  - The implied information that they were not to go back to the house to get anything and that they must flee quickly can be stated clearly as in the UDB. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
