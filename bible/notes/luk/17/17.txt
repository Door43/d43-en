===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Jesus answering, said** - Jesus responded to what the man did, but he was speaking to the group of people around him. AT: "So Jesus said to the crowd." 
  * **Were not the ten cleansed?** - This is the first of three rhetorical questions. Jesus used them to show the people around him how surprised and disappointed he was that only one of the ten men came back to glorify God. AT: "Ten men were healed" or "God healed ten men." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]], [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Where are the nine?** - AT: "The other nine men should have come back, too" or "Why did not the other nine come back?" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Were there no others who returned to give glory to God, except this foreigner?** - AT: "No one but this foreigner came back to give glory to God" or "Ten men were healed, yet only this foreigner came back to give glory to God" or "Can it be true that no one but this foreigner came back to give glory to God?" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] )
  * **this foreigner**  - Samaritans had non-Jewish ancestors and they did not worship God in the same way that the Jews did. (See: [[:en:obe:other:samaria]])
  * **Your faith has healed you**  - "Because of your faith you have become well." AT: "Because you believe, you are healed."
