<usfm>
\v 1 \add One day Jesus\add* said to his disciples, "Things that will tempt \add people\add* to sin are certain to happen, but it will be terrible for anyone who causes them to happen!
\v 2 Suppose you caused one of these people who \add do not believe in me very strongly\add* to sin. If a huge stone was fastened \f + \ft Or:someone fastened a huge stone \f* around your neck and you were thrown \f + \ft Or:and threw you \f* into the sea, \add you would consider that a severe punishment, but God will punish\add* you even more severely \add if you cause someone to sin!\add*

<usfm>
\v 1 Jesus said to his disciples, "Things that tempt people to sin will certainly happen, but how terrible it will be for anyone who causes those things to happen!
\v 2  It would be better for that person if someone fastened a huge stone around his neck and threw him into the sea, than if he were to cause to sin someone who is weak in his faith.
