===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **But which of you **  - That is, "But who among you" or "But which one of you." This is the beginning of a rhetorical question. It could also be translated as a statement starting with "If one of you" or "Suppose that one of you." See the UDB for an example of how to do this. (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Questions]])
    * **who has a servant plowing or tending sheep**  - That is, "who has a servant that plows your field or takes care of sheep" or "who has a servant with a duty to plow your field or take care of your sheep."
    * **when he has come in from the field**  - That is, "when he has entered the house after coming in from the field" or​ "when has come inside the house from the field."
    * **Come immediately and sit down to eat**  - That is, "Come here at once and sit down at the table to eat."
    * **But will he not say to him**- This can also be translated as "But instead you would say to him" or "Instead, this is what you will say to him."
    * **Prepare something for me to eat**  - That is, "Prepare what I would eat" or "Prepare my meal so I can eat."
    * **put a belt around your clothes and serve me**  - This could also be translated as "dress up properly and take care of me." Or: "after girding yourself up, serve me." When someone "girded himself up", he tied up his clothes around his waist to enable him to work easier.
    * **until I have finished eating and drinking **  - That is, "until I have eaten and drunk," or "until I have finished eating my meal" or "while I eat and drink."
    * **Then afterwards you will eat and drink**  - That is, "and after these things you will eat and drink," or "then after preparing my meal and serving me while I eat and drink, you can eat and drink."
