===== Translation Notes: =====



    * **But which of you**  - That is, "But who among you" or "But which one of you." This is the beginning of a rhetorical question. It could also be translated as a statement starting with "If one of you" or "Suppose that one of you." See the UDB for an example of how to do this. (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Questions]])
    * **which of you who has a servant** - Jesus was asking a group of people about what one of them might do if a certain situation were to come up. It could also be translated as "But which of you if you have servant."
    * **a servant plowing or tending sheep**  - That is, "a servant that plows your field or takes care of your sheep."  
    * **plow** - "To plow" means to turn up the ground, or cut narrow trenches in the ground, in order to plant seeds in it.
    * **when he has come in from the field**  - That is, "when he has come into the house after coming from the field."​ It could also be translated as "when has come back from the field and come inside."
    * **Come immediately and sit down to eat**  - That is, "Come now and sit down to eat" or "Come to the table now and sit down and eat."
    * **But will he not say to him** - Depending on how you translate "who has a servant," you could translate this as "But will you not say to him." Since this is a rhetorical question, it can also be translated as "But instead you would say to him" or "Instead, this is what you will say to him."  (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Questions]])
    * **put a belt around your clothes and serve me**  - This could also be translated as "tie your clothes at your waist and serve me" or "dress up properly and take care of me." People would tie their clothes closely around their waist so that their clothes would not get in their way while they worked.
    * **Then afterwards you will eat and drink**  - That is, "Then after you serve me."
    * **you will eat and drink - ** This can also be translated as "You may eat your meal."
