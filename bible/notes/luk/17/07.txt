===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Jesus continues to teach his disciples.)
  * **But which of you**  - "But who among you" or "But which one of you" This is the beginning of a rhetorical question. It could be translated as a statement starting with "If one of you" or "Suppose that one of you." See the UDB for an example of how to do this. (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:rhetoricalquestion]])
  * **which of you who has a servant**  - Jesus was asking a group of people about what one of them might do if a certain situation were to come up. It could be translated as "But which of you, if you have servant."
  * **a servant plowing or tending sheep**  - "a servant that plows your field or takes care of your sheep"
  * **plow**  - "To plow" means to turn over the ground, or cut narrow trenches in the ground, in order to plant seeds in it.
  * **But will he not say to him**  - This is a rhetorical question. It can be translated as "But instead you would say to him" or "Instead, this is what you will say to him." (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:rhetoricalquestion]])
  * **put a belt around your clothes and serve me**  - "tie your clothes at your waist and serve me" or "dress up properly and take care of me" People would tie their clothes closely around their waist so that their clothes would not get in their way while they worked.
  * **Then afterwards**  - "Then after you serve me"
