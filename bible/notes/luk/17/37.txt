===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The disciples ask Jesus a question about his teaching and he answers them.
  * **Where, Lord?** - "Lord, where will this happen?" 
  * **Where there is a body, there will the vultures also be gathered together** - Apparently this is a proverb that means "It will be obvious" or "You will know it when it happens." AT: "As vultures gathering shows that there is a dead body, so these things show that the Son of Man is coming" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_proverbs]])
  * **vultures** - Vultures are large birds that fly together and eat the flesh of dead animals that they find. You could describe birds this way or use the word for a local bird that does this. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown|Translate Unknowns]])
