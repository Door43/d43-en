\v 22 Jesus said to his disciples, "There will be a time when you will want to see me, the Son of Man, ruling powerfully. But you will not see that.
\v 23 People will say to you, 'Look, the Messiah is over there!' or they will say 'Look, he is here!' When they say that, do not follow them.
\v 24 Because when the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other, everyone can see it. Similarly  when I, the Son of Man, come back again, everyone will see me.

\v 22 Jesus said to the disciples, "The days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it.
\v 23 They will say to you, 'Look, there! Look, here!' But do not go looking, nor follow after them,
\v 24 for as the lightning appears when it flashes from one part of the sky to another part of the sky, so will the Son of Man be in his day.
