\v 9 You will not thank your servant for doing the work that he had been told \f + \ft Or:you had told him \f* to do!\f + \ft Or: Would you thank your servant because he did the work that he had been told ( Or:you had told him ) to do? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 10 Similarly, when you\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add* have done everything that \add God\add* has told you to do, you should say, 'We\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* are not worthy \add of God thanking us\add* \f + \ft Or:\add being thanked\add* \f*. We are only God's servants. We have only done the things that he told us to do.'"

<usfm>
\v 9 You will not thank your servant for doing the work that he had been told to do!
\v 10 Similarly, when you have done everything that God has told you to do, you should say, 'We are only God's servants and do not deserve for him to thank us. We have only done the things that he told us to do.'"

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 He does not thank the servant because he did the things that were commanded, does he?
\v 10 Even so you also, when you have done everything that you are commanded, should say, 'We are unworthy servants. We have only done what we ought to do.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus finishes teaching. This is the end of this part of the story. 

  * **He does not thank the servant...commanded, does he?** - Jesus uses this question to show how people treat servants. This can be a statement. AT: "He would not thank the servant...commanded." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the things that were commanded** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the things you commanded him to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **does he?** - "right?" or "Isn't this true?"
  * **you also** - Jesus was speaking to his disciples, so languages that have a plural form of "you" would use it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **that you are commanded** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "that God has commanded you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **We are unworthy servants** - This is an exaggeration to express that they did not do anything worthy of praise. AT: "We are ordinary slaves" or "We servants do not deserve your praise" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
