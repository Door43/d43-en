\v 25 But before that happens, I must suffer in many ways, and I will be rejected by people.
\v 26 But when I, the Son of Man, come again, people will be doing things just like people were doing at the time when Noah lived.
\v 27 At that time people ate and drank as usual, and they got married as usual, up until the day when Noah and his family entered the big boat. But then the flood came and destroyed all those who were not in the boat.
