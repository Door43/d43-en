  * **when the kingdom of God would come** - AT: "When will the kingdom of God come?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **The kingdom of God is not something that can be observed** - They would not see that Jesus was already among them as the king because they were looking for a physical kingdom. AT: "Although you look for the kingdom of God, you will not see it."
