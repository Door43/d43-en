  * **rebuke him**  - That is, "warn him strongly" or "tell him strongly that what he did was wrong" or "correct him."
  * **if he sins**  - This is a conditional statement that talks about an event that will probably happen in the future.
  * **if he sins seven times**  - This is a hypothetical future situation. It may never happen, but even if it does, Jesus tells people to forgive.
  * **seven times in the day**  - This could also be translated as "many times in a day." The number seven in the Bible is a symbol for completeness.
