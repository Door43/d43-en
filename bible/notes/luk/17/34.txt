\v 34 I tell you, in that night there will be two men in one bed. One will be taken, and the other will be left.
\v 35 There will be two women grinding together. One will be taken, and the other will be left."
\v 36 \f + \ft Luke 17:36 - the sentence, "There will be two in the field; one will be taken and the other left." is not in the best Greek manuscripts, and it appears to be a repetition of Matthew 24:40; it is not printed here for those reasons. \f*

===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues speaking.

  * **In that night**  - This refers to what will happen if the Son of Man comes during the night.
  * **there will be two men in one bed**  - This is a hypothetical situation about what two people might be doing at the time. It can be translated as "there may be two men on one couch." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo|Hypothetical Situations]])
  * **bed**  - "couch" or "cot"
  * **the one will be taken and the other left**  - "one man will be taken and the other man will be left behind." AT: "God will take one man and leave the other," or "angels will take one and leave behind the other." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **there will be two women grinding together**  - This is a hypothetical situation about what two women might be doing at the time. AT: "there may be two women grinding grain together." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo|Hypothetical Situations]])
  * **Where, Lord?**  - "Lord, where will this happen?" (UDB)
  * **Where there is a body, there will the vultures also be gathered together**  - Apparently this is a proverb that means "It will be obvious" or "You will know it when it happens." It can also be translated as a simile: "As vultures gathering shows that there is a dead body, so these things show that the Son of Man is being revealed." (See: [[:en:obe:other:proverb]], [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **vultures**  - Vultures are large birds that fly together and eat the flesh of dead animals that they find. You could describe birds this way or use the word for a local bird that does this.
