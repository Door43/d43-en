===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues speaking.

  * **in that night**  - This refers to what will happen if the Son of Man comes during the night.
  * **there will be two men in one bed**  - This is a hypothetical situation about what two people might be doing at the time. It can be translated as "there may be two men on one couch." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **bed**  - "couch" or "cot"
  * **One will be taken, and the other will be left**  - "one man will be taken and the other man will be left behind." AT: "God will take one man and leave the other," or "angels will take one and leave behind the other." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **There will be two women grinding together**  - This is a hypothetical situation about what two women might be doing at the time. AT: "There may be two women grinding grain together." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **Where, Lord?**  - "Lord, where will this happen?" (UDB)
  * **Where there is a body, there will the vultures also be gathered together**  - Apparently this is a proverb that means "It will be obvious" or "You will know it when it happens." It can also be translated as a simile: "As vultures gathering shows that there is a dead body, so these things show that the Son of Man is being revealed." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **vultures**  - Vultures are large birds that fly together and eat the flesh of dead animals that they find. You could describe birds this way or use the word for a local bird that does this.
