===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **It came about that**  - This phrase is used here to mark the beginning of a new part of the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **as they were on the way to Jerusalem**  - "as they were traveling to Jerusalem"
  * **there he was met by ten men who were lepers**  - This can be translated with an active verb: "ten men who were lepers met him" or "ten men who had leprosy met him." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **they lifted up their voices**  - This means "they called with a loud voice" or "they called aloud."
  * **Master**  - The word that is translated here as “Master” is a not the normal word for “Master.” This one refers to someone who has authority, and not to someone who owns someone else. You could also translate it as "Boss" or "Foreman" or with a word that is commonly used to address a person in authority, such as “Sir.”
  * **have mercy on us**  - This can be translated as "please show us mercy by healing us." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
