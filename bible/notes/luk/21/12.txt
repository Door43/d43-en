===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues speaking to his disciples about the future.
  * **these things**  - This refers to the terrible things that Jesus had said would happen in verses [[:en:bible:notes:luk:21:07|8-11]].
  * **they will lay their hands on you**  - "they will arrest you" or "they will grab you." Some languages will need to say who will do these things: "people will lay their hands on you" or "enemies will lay their hands on you."
  * **you**  - Jesus was talking to his disciples. The word "you" is plural. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **delivering you over to the synagogues**  - "handing you over to the leaders of the synagogues." The leaders of the synagogues could forbid all the other Jews from interacting with the disciples because they follow Jesus.
  * **and prisons**  - "and delivering you over to the prisons" or "and putting you in prisons." 
  * **for your testimony**  - "for you to tell them your testimony about me"
