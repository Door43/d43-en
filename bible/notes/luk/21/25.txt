\v 26 People will be so afraid that they will faint, because they are waiting for what will happen next in the world. The stars in the sky will have to leave from their usual places.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **there will be distress of the nations** - Here "the nations" refers to the people in them. AT: "the people of the nations will be distressed" or "the people of the nations will be very anxious"
  * **in despair from the roar of the sea and waves** - "because they will be confused by the roar of the sea and its waves" or "and the loud noise of the sea and its rough movements will frighten the people." This seems to refer to unusual storms or disasters involving the seas.
  * **the things which are coming upon the world** - "the things that will happen in the world" or "the things that will happen to the world"
  * **the powers of the heavens will be shaken** - This can be stated in active form. Possible meanings are 1) the things in the sky like the sun, moon, and stars will not move in their normal way. AT: "God will shake the powerful things in the heavens" or 2) the powerful spirits in the heavens will be distressed. The first is recommended. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
