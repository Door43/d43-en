===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues speaking to his disciples about the future.
    * **there will be distress of the nations**  - This can be translated as "the people of the nations will be distressed" or "the people of the nations will be very anxious."
    * **in despair from the roar of the sea and waves**  - "because they will be confused by the roar of the sea and its waves" or "and they will be frightened by the very loud noise of the sea and its rough movement." This seems to refer to unusual storms or disasters involving the seas.
    * **the things which are coming upon the world**  - "the things that will happen in the world" or "the things that will happen to the world"
    * **the powers of heaven will be shaken**  - "the powerful things in the heavens will be shaken." Possible meanings are 1) The things in the sky like the sun, moon, and stars will not move in their normal way or 2) the powerful spirits in the heavens will be distressed. The first is recommended.
