<usfm>
\v 32 Keep this in mind: All the things that \add I have just now described\add* will happen before all the people who have observed the things that I have done have died.
\v 33 \add You can be certain that these things\add* that I have told \add you\add* about will happen. That they will happen is more\add certain\add* than that the earth and sky will continue to exist."

\v 33 The sky and the earth will come to an end, but what I tell you will never come to an end.
