\v 1 Jesus looked up from where he was sitting and saw rich people putting their gifts into the temple offering box.
\v 2 He also saw a poor widow put in two small coins of very little value.
\v 3 And he said to his disciples, "The truth is that this poor widow has put into the offering box more money than all these rich people.
\v 4 For they all have a lot of money, but they gave only a small part of it. But this widow, who is very poor, has given all the money that she had to buy what she needed.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - This is the next event in the story. Possible setting: 1) this may have occurred on the same day that Jesus was questioned by the Sadducees ([[:en:bible:notes:luk:20:27|20:27]]) or 2) this may be a different day. Jesus begins teaching his disciples. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])

  * **gifts** - "gifts of money"
  * **treasury** - "collection box" or "money box." This was one of the boxes in the temple courtyard where people put money as a gift to God.
  * **a certain poor widow** - This is a way of introducing a new character to the story. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_participants]])
  * **two mites** - "two small coins" or "two tiny copper coins." These were the least valuable of the coins people used then. AT: "two pennies" or "two small coins of little value" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bmoney]])
  * **Truly I say to you** - This means that what Jesus was about to say was very important.
  * **I say to you** - Jesus was talking to his disciples. The word "you" is plural. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **this poor widow put in more than all of them** - God considers her gift, a small amount of money, more significant than the large amounts of money the men gave. AT: "the small gift of this widow was more valuable than larger gifts of the rich men" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **gave gifts out of their abundance** - "have a lot of money but only gave a small portion of it"
  * **out of her poverty** - "who has very little money"
