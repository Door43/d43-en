<usfm>
\v 7 And they asked him, saying, "Teacher, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign when these things are about to happen?"
And he said, "Be careful that you are not deceived. For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he'; and, 'The time is near.'  Do not go after them.
\v 9 And when you hear of wars and riots, do not be terrified, for these things must happen first, but the end will not happen immediately."
