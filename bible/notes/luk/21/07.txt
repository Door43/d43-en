\v 7 Then they asked him, "Teacher, when will these things happen? And what will happen to show that these things are about to take place?"
\v 8 Jesus replied, "Be careful that no one deceives you. For many people will come and each will claim to be me. Each will say about himself, 'I am the Messiah!' They will also say, 'The time is almost here, when God will rule as king!' Do not follow after them to become their disciples!
\v 9 Also, whenever you hear about wars and people fighting each other, do not be terrified. For these things must happen before the end of the world comes."

\v 7 So they asked him, saying, "Teacher, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign when these things are about to happen?"
\v 8 Jesus answered, "Be careful that you are not deceived. For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he,' and, 'The time is near.'  Do not go after them.
\v 9 When you hear of wars and riots, do not be terrified, for these things must happen first, but the end will not happen immediately."
