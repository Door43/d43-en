===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **strong enough to escape all these things**  - Possible meanings are 1) "strong enough to endure these things" or 2) "able to avoid these things."
  * **these things that will take place** - "these things that will happen." Jesus had just told them about terrible things that would happen such as persecution, war, and captivity.
  * **to stand before the Son of Man**  - "to stand with confidence before the Son of Man." This probably refers to when the Son of Man judges everyone. A person who is not ready will be afraid of the Son of Man and will not stand with confidence.
