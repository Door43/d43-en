\v 24 Many of them will be killed \f + \ft Or:Their enemies will kill many of them \f* with swords. \add Others will be captured\add* and taken \f + \ft Or:They will capture \add others\add* and take them \f* to \f + \ft hyperbole \f* \add other\add* countries.

\v 23 How terrible it will be for the pregnant women and those nursing their babies in those days, because there will be great suffering in the land, and its people will suffer enormously because God will be angry with them.
\v 24 Many of them will die because the soldiers attacked them with weapons. Others will become prisoners and they will be sent to many places around the world. The Gentiles will keep marching their troops through the streets of Jerusalem for as long as God allows."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 23 Woe to them who are pregnant and to them who are nursing in those days! For there will be great distress upon the land, and wrath to this people.
\v 24 They will fall by the edge of the sword and they will be led captive into all the nations, and Jerusalem will be trampled by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.
