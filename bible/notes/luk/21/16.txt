===== Translation Notes: =====

    * (Jesus continues speaking to his disciples about the future.)
    * **you will be delivered up**  - "you will be handed over to your enemies"
    * **they will put some of you to death** - Possible meanings are 1) "the authorities will put some of you to death" or 2) "Those who deliver you up will put some of you to death." The first meaning is more likely. It may also be translated as "some of you will be put death" or "the authorities will put some of you to death."
    * **because of my name**  - "because of me" or "because you follow me"
    * **But not a hair of your head will perish**  - This is a figure of speech that means "You will not be harmed at all." It refers to one of the smallest parts of a person to emphasize that the whole person will not perish. Jesus had already said that some of them would be put to death. So some understand this to mean that they would not be harmed spiritually. This can also be translated as "But these things cannot really harm you"
