\v 20 "When you see armies surround Jerusalem, then you will know that they will soon destroy this city.
\v 21 At that time those of you who are in the region of Judea must flee to the mountains. And those of you who are in this city must leave. Those of you who are in the nearby countryside must not come into the city.
\v 22 For this will be the time when God will punish this city; when he does, the words in the scriptures will come true.

<usfm>
\p
\v 20 When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its destruction is near.
\v 21 Then let those in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those who are in the middle of the town leave, and do not let those who are in the country enter it.
\v 22 For these are days of vengeance, so that all the things that are written will be fulfilled.
