\v 20 When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its destruction is near.
\v 21 Then let those in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those who are in the middle of the city leave,  and do not let those who are in the country enter it.
\v 22 For these are days of vengeance, so that all the things that are written will be fulfilled.
