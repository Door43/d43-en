\v 13 Only a few days later, the younger son gathered together all that he owned and traveled to a country far away. There in that country he spent all his money foolishly in wasteful, immoral living.
\v 14 After he had spent all his money, there was a severe famine throughout that country. And soon he did not have anything left to live on.

\v 13 Not many days later, the younger son gathered together all he owned and went to a country far away, and there he wasted his money, buying things he did not need, and wasting his money on wild living.
\v 14 Now when he had spent everything, a severe famine spread throughout that country, and he began to be in need.
