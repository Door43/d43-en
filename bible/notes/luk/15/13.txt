Jesus continues telling his parable.
    * **packed up**  - "packed his things" or "put his things in his bag"
    * **with wildly extravagant living**  - This can be translated as  "by spending all his money on things he did not need."
    * **There a great famine happened**  - "There was a severe famine" (UDB) or "there was not enough food"
    * **famine**  - A famine is a time when there is little food. Often it is the result of little rain and the failure of crops to grow well.
    * **to be in need** - "to lack what he needed" or "to not have enough"
