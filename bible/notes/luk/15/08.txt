\v 8 Or, suppose that a woman has ten very valuable silver coins and then she loses one of them. Certainly she will light a lamp and sweep the floor and search carefully until she finds it.
\v 9 And when she finds it, she will call together her friends and neighbors and say to them, "Be very happy with me, because I have found the coin that I lost!'
\v 10 I tell you that, in a similar way, there is much joy among the angels of God because of one sinner who repents from his sins ."

\v 8 Or what woman who has ten silver coins, if she were to lose one coin, would not light a lamp, sweep the house, and seek diligently until she has found it?
\v 9 And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin which I lost.'
\v 10 Even so, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents."

===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues speaking to the religious leaders.
    * **What woman…would not light a lamp…and seek diligently until she has found it?**  - This is a rhetorical question. Jesus was reminding the people that if any of them lost a silver coin, they would certainly look for it diligently. This sentence can be translated as “You know that if a woman had ten silver coins and lost one, she would light a lamp, sweep the floor and search carefully until she has found it.” (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
    * **what woman** - This is a hypothetical situation and not a story about a real woman. Some languages have ways of showing this. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
    * **Even so**  - "In the same way" or "Just as people would rejoice with the woman"
    * **over one sinner who repents**  - This can be translated as "when one sinner repents."
