\v 8 Or, suppose that a woman has ten very valuable silver coins and then she loses one of them. Certainly she will light a lamp and sweep the floor and search carefully until she finds it.
\v 9 When she finds it, she will call together her friends and neighbors and say to them, "Be very happy with me, because I have found the coin that I lost!'
\v 10 I tell you that, in a similar way, there is much joy among the angels of God because of one sinner who repents from his sins."

\v 8 Or what woman who has ten silver coins, if she were to lose one coin, would not light a lamp, sweep the house, and seek diligently until she has found it?
\v 9 And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin which I lost.'
\v 10 Even so, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus begins telling another parable. It is about a woman with 10 sliver coins.

  * **Or what woman ... would not light a lamp ... and seek diligently until she has found it?** - Jesus uses a question to remind the people that if any of them lost a silver coin, they would certainly look for it diligently. AT: "Any woman ... would certainly light a lamp ... and seek diligently until she has found it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **if she were to lose** - This is a hypothetical situation and not a story about a real woman. Some languages have ways of showing this. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **Even so** - "In the same way" or "Just as people would rejoice with the woman"
  * **over one sinner who repents** - "when one sinner repents"
