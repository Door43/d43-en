===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Here Jesus starts to tell a new part of the story about the older son.
  * **out in the field** - It is implied that he was out in the field because he was working there. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **one of the servants** - The word that is translated here as "servant" is normally translated as "boy." It may indicate that the servant was very young.
  * **what these things might be** - "what was happening" 
  * **the fattened calf** - A calf is a young cow. People would give one of their calves special food so that it would grow well, and then when they wanted to have a special feast, they would eat that calf. See how you translated this phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:luk:15:22|15:23]]. AT: "the best calf" or "the young animal we have been making fat" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
