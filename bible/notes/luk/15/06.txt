====== Luke 15:6-7 ======

\v 6 When you brought it home, you would call together your friends and neighbors and say to them, 'Be happy with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost!'
\v 7 I tell you\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add* that similarly\add God\add* will be very happy about each and every sinner who turns from doing evil. God does not \add need to\add* be happy about ninety-nine people who \add think that they\add* are \f + \ft irony \f* righteous and think that they do not need to turn from doing evil.

<usfm>
\v 6 And when you come home, you will call together your friends and neighbors and say to them: 'Be joyful with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost!'
\v 7 I tell you that, in a similar way, there will be more joy in heaven because of one sinner who repents from his sins than about many people who think they are righteous and think they have no need to repent.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 When he comes to the house, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my lost sheep.'
\v 7 I say to you that even so, there will be joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, more than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.

===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues telling his parable.

  * **When he comes to the house**  - "When the owner of the sheep comes home" or "When you come home" (UDB). Refer to the owner of the sheep as you did in the previous verse.
  * **I say to you** - The word "I" refers to Jesus. He is speaking to a group of people, so the word "you" is plural. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **even so** - "in the same way" or "as the shepherd and his friends and neighbors would rejoice"
  * **there will be joy in heaven**  - "everyone in heaven will rejoice"
  * **ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent** - "ninety nine people who think that they are righteous and do not need to repent." Jesus was not saying that there really are any righteous people.  Rather he was using a figure of speech called irony, because he was talking to people who assumed that they were righteous, but they were not. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
