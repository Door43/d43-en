\v 17 Finally he thought clearly about what he had done. He said to himself, 'All of my father's hired servants have plenty of food! They have more \f + \ft synecdoche \f* than they can eat, but here I am dying because I do not have anything to eat \f + \ft hyperbole \f*!
\v 18 So I will leave here and go back to my father. I will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against God \f + \ft metonymy, euphemism \f* and against you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add*.
\v 19 I am no longer worthy to be called \f + \ft Or:of \add you\add* calling me \f* your son. Just hire me to be like one of the other hired servants."'

\v 17 Finally he began to think clearly about how foolish he had been and he said to himself: 'All of my father's hired servants have more than enough food to eat, but here I am dying because I do not have anything to eat!
\v 18 So I will leave here and go back to my father. I will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against God and against you.
\v 19 I am no longer worthy to be called your son; please just employ me to work for you as one of your hired servants."'

\v 17 But when the young son came to himself, he said, 'How many of my father's hired servants have more than enough food, and I am here, dying from hunger!
\v 18 I will leave here and go to my father, and will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight.
\v 19 I am no more worthy to be called your son; make me as one of your hired servants."'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **came to himself** - This idiom means "came to his senses." AT: "clearly understood his situation" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **How many of my father's hired servants have more than enough food** - This is part of an exclamation, and not a question. AT: "All my father's hired servants have more than enough food to eat"
  * **dying from hunger** - This is probably not an exaggeration. The young man may really have been starving.
  * **I have sinned against heaven** - Jewish people sometimes avoided saying the word "God" and used the word "heaven" instead. AT: "I have sinned against God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I am no more worthy to be called your son** - "I am not worthy to be called your son." This can be stated in active form. AT: "I am not worthy for you to call me son" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **no more worthy** - "no longer worthy." It means that in the past he was worthy, but now he was not.
  * **make me as one of your hired servants** - "hire me as an employee" or "hire me and I will become one of your servants". This is a request, not a command. It may be helpful to add "please" as the UDB does.
