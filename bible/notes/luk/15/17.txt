\v 17 Finally he began to think clearly about how foolish he had been and he said to himself: 'All of my father's hired servants have more than enough food to eat but here I am dying because I do not have anything to eat!
\v 18 So I will leave here and go back to my father. I will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against God and against you.
\v 19 I am no longer worthy to be called your son; please just employ me to work for you as one of your hired servants."'

\v 18 I will leave here and go to my father, and will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight.
\v 19 I am no more worthy to be called your son; make me as one of your hired servants."'

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * (Jesus continues his story.)
    * **came to himself** - "came to his senses" or "understood his situation" or "began to think clearly"
    * **How many of my father's hired hands have more than enough food** - This is part of an exclamation. It can be translated as "All my father's hired servants have more than enough food to eat" (UDB).
    * **dying from hunger**  -  This is probably not an exaggeration. The young man may really have been starving.
    * **I have sinned against heaven** - "I have sinned against God." Jewish people sometimes avoided saying the word "God" and used the word "heaven" instead.
    * **I am no more worthy to be called your son** - "I am not worthy to be called your son." A son has the legal right to inherit part of his father's property.
    * **no more worthy** - "no longer worthy" (UDB). It means that in the past he was worthy, but now he was not.
    * **make me as one of your hired servants** - "hire me as an employee" or "hire me and I will become one of your servants"
