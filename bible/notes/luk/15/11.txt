  * [[:en:obe:kt:inherit]]
 
===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus begins telling another parable. It is about a young man who asks his father for his part of the inheritance. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]])

  * **A certain man** - This introduces a new character in the parable. Some languages might say "There was a man who" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_participants]])
  * **give me** - The son wanted his father to give it to him immediately. Languages that have a command form that means that they want it done immediately should use that form.
  * **the portion of the wealth that falls to me** - "the part of your wealth that you planned for me to receive when you die"
  * **between them** - "between his two sons"
