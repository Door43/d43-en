===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **a certain man**  - literally, "some person."
    * **give me now**  - The son wanted his father to give it to him immediately. Languages that have a command form that means that they want it done immediately should use that form.
    * **the property I am due to inherit**  - That is, "the portion of your property that I am due to inherit" or "the portion of your wealth that you would normally give to me when you die."
