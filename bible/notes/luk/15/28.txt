\v 28 But the older brother was angry and did not want to go into the house. So his father came out and pleaded with him to come in.
\v 29 But he replied to his father, 'Listen! For all these years I have worked for you as hard as a slave. I always obeyed everything you told me to do. But you never gave me even a young goat to eat so that I could give a feast with my friends.
\v 30 But now that this son of yours has come back home, after wasting all your money on prostitutes, you have told your servants to kill the fattened calf for a celebration!'

\v 28 The elder son was angry, and would not go in, and his father came out, and begged him.
\v 29 But the elder son answered and said to his father, 'Look, these many years I slaved for you, and I never broke a rule of yours, and yet you never gave me a young goat that I might celebrate with my friends,
\v 30 but when your son came, who has devoured your living with prostitutes, you killed for him the fattened calf.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **these many years** - "for many years"
  * **I slaved for you** - "I worked extremely hard for you" or "I worked as hard as a slave for you"
  * **never broke a rule of yours** - "never disobeyed any of your commands" or "always obeyed everything you told me to do" 
  * **a young goat** - A young goat was smaller and less expensive than a fatted calf. AT: "even a young goat" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **your son** - "that son of yours." The older son refers to his brother this way in order to show how angry he is.
  * **devoured your living with prostitutes** - "wasted all your wealth on prostitutes" or "thrown away all your money by paying prostitutes." Possible meanings are 1) he assumed this is how his brother spent the money or 2) he is using hyperbole to intentionally exaggerate his brother's sin. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **fattened calf** - A calf is a young cow. People would give one of their calves special food so that it would grow well, and then when they wanted to have a special feast, they would eat that calf. See how you translated this phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:luk:15:22|15:23]]. AT: "the best calf" or "the young animal we have been making fat" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
