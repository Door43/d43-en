===== Translation Notes: =====


    * (Jesus continues telling his parable.)
    * **angry** - This is a settled or seething anger which seeks to penalize the offender without concern for the moral implications of the offense.
    * **I slaved for you** - That is, "I worked like a slave for you." 
    * **broke a rule of yours**  - That is, "disobeyed a command of yours" or "disobeyed any of your commands."
    * **have a feast** - This can also be translated as "celebrate."
    * **your son**  - The older son refers to his younger brother as "that son of yours." He does this to show how angry he is with that younger son.
    * **devoured your living**  - This could also be translated as, "entirely consumed your wealth" or "wasted all your wealth" or "thrown away all your money."
    * **with prostitutes** - That is, "on prostitutes" or "by going to prostitutes."
    * **killed**  - that is "sacrificed" or "slaughtered".
    * **fattened calf** - This could also be translated as "the calf that was fed very well" or "the calf that was given grain" or "the best calf." Wealthy families would give a few of their young animals expensive grain to eat so that their meat would be especially good. Most of their animals simply ate grass, so their meat was not as special.
