  * **This man welcomes sinners**  - "This man lets sinners into his presence" or "This man associates with sinners"
  * **This man**  - They were talking about Jesus.
  * **even eats with them**  - The word "even" shows that they thought it was bad enough that Jesus allowed sinners to come to him, but it was worse that he would eat with them.
