\v 22 But his father said to his servants; 'Go quickly and bring my best robe and put it on my son. Also put a ring on his finger and shoes on his feet!
\v 23 And bring the calf that has been fattened for a special occasion and kill it, so that we can eat it and  celebrate!
\v 24 We need to celebrate because this son of mine was like a dead man, but he is now alive again! He was like a lost person, but he has now been found!' So they all began to celebrate.
