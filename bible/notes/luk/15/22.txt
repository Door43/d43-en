===== Translation Notes: =====


    * (Jesus continues telling his parable.)
    * **best robe**  - A robe was a long garment worn over other clothing. This could also be translated as "the best robe in the house." In places where robes are not know, this could be translated as "the best coat" or "the best garment."
    * **put it on him** - That is, "and put the robe on my son" or "and dress him with it."
    * **put a ring on his hand**  - This could also be translated as "put a ring on his finger." A ring was a small circle of metal that some men wore as a sign of authority.
    * **sandals**  -  Sandals are a type of shoe. This could also be translated as "flip-flips" or "thongs" or "shoes."
    * **fattened calf**  - A calf is a young bull. People would give one of their calves special food so that it would grow well, and then when they wanted to have a special feast, they would eat it. This could also be translated as, "the best calf" or "the young bull we have been been giving lots of food to" or "the young animal we have been making fat."
    * **and kill it** - Since people only ate cooked me, the father expected them to cook the animal. This implied information could be made clear: "and kill it and cook it."
