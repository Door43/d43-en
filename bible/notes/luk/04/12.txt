===== translationNotes: =====

  * **It is said** - Jesus tells the devil why he will not do what the devil told him to do. His refusal to do it can be stated clearly. AT: "No, I will not do that, because it is said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **It is said** - Jesus quotes from the writings of Moses in Deuteronomy. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Moses has said" or "Moses has said in the scriptures" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Do not put the Lord your God to the test** - Possible meanings are 1) Jesus should not test God by jumping off the temple, or 2) the devil should not test Jesus to see if he is the Son of God. It is best to translate the verse as stated rather than to try to explain the meaning.
  * **until another time** - "until another occasion"
  * **had finished testing Jesus** - This does not imply that the devil was successful in his temptation—Jesus resisted every attempt. This can be stated clearly. AT: "had finished trying to tempt Jesus" or "stopped trying to tempt Jesus" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
