Jesus uses this metaphor to refer to the Holy Spirit being on him to prepare him for this work. AT: "the Holy Spirit is upon me to empower me" or "the Holy Spirit gave me power and authority" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the poor** - "the poor people""
  * **proclaim freedom to the captives** - "tell people who are being held captive that they can go free" or "set free the prisoners of war"
  * **recovery of sight to the blind** - "give sight to the blind" or "make the blind be able to see again"
  * **set free those who are oppressed** - "set free those who are treated harshly"
