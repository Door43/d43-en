===== Translation Notes: =====
This is what Jesus read on the scroll from Isaiah. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:isa:61:01|61:1-2]])
    * **The Spirit of the Lord is upon me**  - "God is with me in a special way." Someone saying this is claiming to speak the words of God.
    * **to proclaim freedom to the captives** - AT: "to tell people who are being held captive that they can go free" or "to set free the prisoners of war."
    * **recovery of sight to the blind** - "to proclaim that the blind shall see" or "to give sight to the blind" or "to make the blind be able to see again"
    * **To set free those who are oppressed**  - "to set free  those who are treated harshly"
    * **To proclaim the favorable year of the Lord**  - AT: "To announce that this is the year that the Lord will show his kindness" or "To tell everyone that the Lord is ready to bless his people."
