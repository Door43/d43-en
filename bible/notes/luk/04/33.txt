===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus casts a demon out of a man in the synagogue in Capernaum.

  * **who had the spirit of an unclean demon** - "who was possessed by an unclean demon"
  * **he cried out with a loud voice** - "he shouted loudly." Some languages have an idiom for this like the English idiom, "he shouted at the top of his lungs." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **What do we have to do with you...?** - It is a belligerent response that means: "You have no right to bother us!" AT: "What do we have in common?" or "We have nothing to do with you!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
