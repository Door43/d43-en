===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **with the power of the Spirit **- This could be translated as "and the Spirit was giving him power." God was with Jesus in a special way, enabling him to do things that humans usually couldn't. 
    * **news about him spread**  - This could be translated as "people spread the news about Jesus" or "people told other people about Jesus" or "knowledge about him was passed on from person to person." Those who heard Jesus told other people about him, and then those other people told even more people about him. 
    * **throughout the entire surrounding region** - This refers to the areas or places around Galilee.
    * **everyone praised him** - "everyone said great things about him" or "all the people spoke about him in a good way"
