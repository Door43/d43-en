\v 25 But think about this: There were many widows in Israel during the time when \add the prophet\add* Elijah \add lived. During that time\add*, because of there being no rain \f + \ft metonymy \f* for three years and six months, there was a great famine throughout the country.
\v 26 But \add God\add* did not send Elijah to \add help\add* any of those \add Jewish\add* widows. \add God sent him\add* to Zarepath \add town\add* near Sidon \add city\add*, to \add help\add* a \add non-Jewish\add* widow.
\v 27 There were also many \add Jewish\add* lepers in Israel during the time when the prophet Elisha \add lived\add*. But \add Elisha\add* did not heal any of them. He healed only Naaman, a \add non-Jewish\add* man from Syria."

\v 25 But think about this: There were many widows in Israel during the time when the prophet Elijah lived, when there was a great famine throughout the country because there had been no rain for three and half years.
\v 26 But God did not send Elijah to help any of those Israelite widows. God sent him to the town of Zarephath near the city of Sidon, to help a non-Israelite widow.
\v 27 There were also many Israelite lepers in Israel during the time when the prophet Elisha lived. But Elisha did not heal any of them. He healed only Naaman, a non-Jewish man from Syria."

\v 25 But I say to you in truth that there were many widows in Israel during Elijah's time, when the sky was shut up with no rain for three and a half years, when there was a great famine over all the land. 
\v 26 But Elijah was not sent to any of them, but only to a widow living in Zarephath near the city of Sidon. 
\v 27 There were also many lepers in Israel during the time of Elisha the prophet, but none of them were healed except Naaman the Syrian."

===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues to speak to the people in the synagogue.

  * **I say to you in truth**  - "I tell you truthfully." This phrase was used to emphasize the importance, truth, and accuracy of the statement that follows.
  * **widows**  - A widow is a woman whose husband has died.
  * **during Elijah's time**  - This could also be translated as "when Elijah was prophesying in Israel." The people Jesus was speaking to would have known that Elijah was one of God's prophets. If your readers would not know that, you can make this implicit information explicit as in the UDB. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **when the sky was shut up with no rain**  - This can be translated as "when no rain came down from the sky" or "when there was no rain at all." This is a metaphor. The sky is pictured as a ceiling that was closed up to keep the water above it from coming down as rain. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **when there was a great famine**  - "when there was a serious lack of food" or "when the people did not have enough food." A famine is a long period of time when the crops do not produce enough food for the people.
  * **a widow living in Zarephath**  - The people living in the town of Zarephath were Gentiles, not Jews. This could be translated as "a Gentile widow living in Zarephath." The people listening to Jesus would have understood that the people of Zarephath were Gentiles. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]], [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Naaman the Syrian**  - A Syrian is a person from the country of Syria. The people of Syria were Gentiles, not Jews. This could be translated as "the Gentile Naaman from Syria." (See:  [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
