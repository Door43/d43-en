\v 5 Then the devil was leading Jesus up to a high place and he showed him all the kingdoms of the world in an instant of time. 
\v 6 The devil said to him, "I will give to you all this authority—along with their splendor—because they have been handed over to me to rule over, and to anyone I give it to.
