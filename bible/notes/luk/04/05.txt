\v 5 Then the devil led him up to a high place, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. 
\v 6 The devil said to him, "I will give to you the authority to rule all of these kingdoms, along with all their splendor. I can do this because they have been given to me to rule over, and I can give them to anyone I want to.
