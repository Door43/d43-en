===== translationNotes: =====

  * **All the people in the synagogue were filled with rage when they heard these things** - The people of Nazareth were deeply offended that Jesus had cited scriptures where God had helped Gentiles instead of Jews. 
  * **forced him out of the town** - "forced him to leave the town" or "shoved him out of the city" 
  * **cliff of the hill** - "edge of the cliff"
  * **he passed through the middle of them** - "through the middle of the crowd" or "between the people who were trying to kill him." The word "right" here is similar to the word "simply." It indicates that nothing hindered him from walking past the angry crowd.
  * **he went to another place** - "he went away" or "he went on his way" Jesus went where he had planned to go instead of where the people were trying to force him to go.
