===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **filled with rage when they heard this things** - That is, "very angry with Jesus because of what he said."
    * **forced him out of the city**  - This could also be translated as "forced him to leave the city."
    * **edge of the hill**  - You could also say, "brow of the cliff."
    * **throw him over the cliff** - This could also be translated as  or "push him off the cliff" or "push him down the cliff."
    * **right through the midst of them**  - This could also be translated as "through the middle of them" or "between the people who were trying to kill him." The word "right" here is similar to the word "simply" in the UDB. It indicates that nothing hindered him from walking past the people.
    * **went on his way**  - It can also be translated as "went away." Jesus went where he had planned to go instead of where the people were trying to force him to go.
