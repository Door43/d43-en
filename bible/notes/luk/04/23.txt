===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **Whatever we ... hometown too**  - Since this is not part of the proverb it might help to separate it from the proverb, as in "Certainly you will say this proverb to me, 'Doctor, heal yourself.' And surely you will tell me 'Whatever we heard that you did in Capernaum, do here in your hometown too.'"
    * **in your own hometown**  - This was in Nazareth, the town Jesus had grown up in. 
    * **no prophet is accepted in his own country** - This could be translated as "prophets are not accepted in their own country" or "people from a prophet's own country do not accept him." Jesus was rebuking the people for refusing to believe him just because they thought they knew him.
    * **own country**  - This could be translated as "own town" or "hometown."
