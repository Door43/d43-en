===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Nazareth is the town in which Jesus grew up. 

  * **Surely** - "Certainly" or "Without doubt." This is a strong affirmation.
  * **Doctor, heal yourself** - If a doctor does not appear to be healthy, there is no reason to believe he is really a doctor. When the people speak this proverb to Jesus, they will mean they do not believe he is a prophet because he does not look like one. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_proverbs]])
  * **Whatever we heard ... do the same in your hometown** - The people of Nazareth did not believe Jesus could be a prophet because of his low status as Joseph's son. They will not believe unless they personally see him do miracles.
  * **Truly I say to you** - "It is certainly true." This is an emphatic statement about what follows.
  * **no prophet is received in his own hometown** - Jesus makes this general statement in order to rebuke the people. He means that they are refusing to believe the reports of his miracles in Capernaum. They thought they already knew all about him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_proverbs]])
  * **own hometown** - "homeland" or "native city" or "country where he grew up"
