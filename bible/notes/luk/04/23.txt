===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Nazareth is the town in which Jesus grew up. 

  * **Surely** - "Certainly" or "Without doubt." This is a strong affirmation.
  * **Doctor, heal yourself!** - If a doctor does not appear to be healthy, there is no reason to believe he is really a doctor. When the people speak this proverb to Jesus, they will mean they do not believe he is a prophet because he does not look like one. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_proverbs]])
  * **Whatever we heard ... do the same in your hometown** - The people of Nazareth did not believe Jesus could be a prophet because of his low status as Joseph's son. They will not believe unless they personally see him do miracles.
  * **Truly I say to you** - "It is certainly true." This is an emphatic statement about what follows.
  * **no prophet is welcomed in his own hometown** - Jesus uses the form of a proverb to rebuke the people. He means that they refuse to believe the reports of his miracles in Capernaum because they thought they already knew all about him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_proverbs]])
  * **own hometown** - "homeland" or "native city" or "country where he grew up"
