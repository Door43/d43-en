===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **own hometown**  - That is, parent country, fatherland, or motherland.
    * **doctor heal yourself -**  Or, "physician, we command you, heal yourself."
    * **Whatever we****…hometown too**  - This is not part of the proverb because this is what Jesus was saying the people would tell him to do. It might help to separate this from the proverb, as in "Certainly you will say this proverb to me, 'Doctor, heal yourself,' and surely you will tell me 'Whatever we heard that you did in Capernaum, do here in your hometown too.'"
    * **own country**  - That is, parent country, fatherland, or motherland.
