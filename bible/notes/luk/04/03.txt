===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **If you are the Son of God**  - The devil was probably challenging Jesus to prove that he was the Son of God.
  * **this stone**  - The devil was either holding a stone in his hand or pointing to a nearby stone.
  * **It is written**  - AT: "Moses has written in the scriptures." The quotation is from Deuteronomy [[:en:bible:notes:deu:08:03|8:3]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Man will not live on bread alone**  - This could be translated as "People cannot live on just bread" or "It is not just food that makes a person live." The word "bread" is used to refer to food in general. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]]) The point is that food is not enough to sustain a person. People need to obey God. Jesus was quoting the scripture to say why he would not turn the stone into bread.
