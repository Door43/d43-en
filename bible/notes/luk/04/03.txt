===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **If you are the Son of God** - This could also be translated as "If you really are the Son of God" (UDB). The devil was probably challenging Jesus to prove that he was the Son of God. 
    * **this stone**  - The devil was either holding a stone in his hand or pointing to a nearby stone.
    * **It is written**  - That is, "it is written in the scriptures" or "the scriptures say" or "in the scriptures God said."
    * **Man will not live on bread alone**  - This could also be translated as "People cannot live on just bread" or "It is not just food that makes a person live." The word "bread" is used to refer to food in general. The point is that food is not enough to sustain a person. People need to obey God. (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:synecdoche|Synecdoche]])
