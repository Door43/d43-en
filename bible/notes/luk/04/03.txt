===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **If you are the Son of God** - The devil tried to cause Jesus to sin to stop Jesus from becoming the Savior of the world. But Jesus did not sin, proving he is  "the Son of God."
  * **this stone** - The devil was either holding a stone in his hand or pointing to a nearby stone.
  * **It is written**  - The quotation is from Moses' writings in the Old Testament. AT: "Moses has written in the scriptures." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Man shall not live on bread alone** - The word "bread" is used to refer to food in general. The point is that food is not enough to sustain a person. Jesus quoted the scripture to say why he would not turn the stone into bread. AT: "People cannot live on just bread" or "It is not just food that makes a person live." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
