    * **he went down** - "Jesus went downhill." Capernaum was lower in altitude than Nazareth.
    * **Capernaum, a city in Galilee** - Since Jesus was already in Galilee, this could be translated as "Capernaum, another city in Galilee." 
    * **astonished**  - "greatly surprised" or "impressed"
    * **he spoke with authority** - This could be translated as "his word had authority" or "he spoke as one with authority."
