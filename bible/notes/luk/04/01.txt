  * **was led by the Spirit** - This could be stated in active form. AT: "the Spirit led him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **for forty days and was tempted there** - It is not completely clear if Jesus was tempted throughout the forty days, or only at the end. Most versions say that it was throughout the forty days. The UDB states "While he was there, the devil kept tempting him" to make this clear.
