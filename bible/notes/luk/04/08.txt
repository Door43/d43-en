===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus answers the devil again.

  * **answered and said to him** - "responded to him" or "replied to him"
  * **It is written** - AT: "Moses has written in the scriptures" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **You must worship the Lord your God** - Jesus was quoting a law from the scriptures to say why he would not worship the devil.
  * **you** - This refers to the people in the Old Testament who received God's Law. You could use the singular form of 'you' because each person was to obey it, or you could use the plural form of 'you' because all of the people were to obey it.  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **him** - The word "him" refers to the Lord God.
