===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Jesus rebuked the demon, saying**  - That is, "Jesus scolded the demon, saying" or "Jesus sternly said to the demon" or "Jesus angrily said to the demon."
    * **"Be quiet and come out of him"**  - That is, "Shut up and leave him!" This was a strong statement, so do not choose words just to avoid offending people.
    * **What kind of words are these** - This is a figure of speech. The people wonder where Jesus received the authority to speak in such a way, and they conveyed their wonder by asking about the quality of his speech.
    * **news about him began to spread** - That is, "reports about Jesus began to spread" or "people spread the news about Jesus."
