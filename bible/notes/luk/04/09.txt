===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the very highest point** - This was the corner of the temple roof. If someone fell from there, they would be seriously injured or die.
  * **If you are the Son of God** - The devil was challenging Jesus to prove that he was the Son of God.
  * **Son of God** - This is an important title for Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **throw yourself down** - "jump down to the ground"
  * **For it is written** - The devil implies that his quote from the Psalms means Jesus will not be hurt if he is the Son of God. This can be stated clearly, as the UDB does: AT: "You will not be hurt, because it is written" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **it is written** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the writer has written" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **He will give orders** - "He" refers to God. The devil partially quoted from the Psalms in an effort to persuade Jesus to jump off the building.
