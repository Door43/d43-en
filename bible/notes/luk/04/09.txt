\v 9 Then the devil took Jesus to Jerusalem. He set him on the highest part of the temple and said to him, " If you really are the Son of God, jump down from here.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **the devil led** - That is, “the devil took him up.” This does not mean that the devil was leading the way or that Jesus was following him. Rather, it was an active effort of putting him at the described destination.
    * **the very highest point**  - This was the corner of the temple roof. If someone slipped or jumped from there, they would be seriously injured or die.
    * **If you are the Son of God** - This could also be translated as "If you really are the Son of God" (UDB). The devil was probably challenging Jesus to prove that he was the Son of God. 
    * **throw yourself down**- That is, "jump down to the ground."
    * **It is written** - That is, “it is written in the scriptures” or “the scriptures say” or “in the scriptures God said.”
    * **He will command** - The devil was quoting scripture. "He" refers to God.
