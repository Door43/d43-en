===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **Then he closed the scroll** - "Then Jesus rolled up the scroll"
    * **synagogue attendant**  - This refers to a synagogue worker who made sure that the scrolls containing the scriptures were brought out and put away with proper care and reverence.
    * **were fixed on him** - "were focused on him" or "were looking at him"
    * **this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing** - This could be translated as "What this scripture said would happen has happened now while you listened to it." Jesus was saying that he was fulfilling that prophecy by his actions and speech at that very time. 
    * **amazed at the gracious words coming out of his mouth** - "surprised about the gracious things he was saying"
    * **Isn't this Joseph's son?**  - This could be translated as "Isn't this just Joseph's son?" or "This is just Joseph's son!" or "His father is only Joseph!" People thought that Joseph was Jesus' father. Joseph was not a religious leader, so they were surprised that his son would preach what he did.
