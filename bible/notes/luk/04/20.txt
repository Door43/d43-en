===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **Then he closed the scroll** - "Then Jesus rolled up the scroll"
    * **synagogue attendant**  - This refers to a synagogue worker who made sure that the scrolls containing the scriptures were brought out and put away with proper care and reverence.
    * **were fixed on him** - "were focused on him" or "were looking at him"
    * **this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing** - Jesus was saying that he was fulfilling that prophecy by his actions and speech at that very time. AT: "What this scripture said would happen has happened now while you listened to it."
    * **amazed at the gracious words which were coming out of his mouth** - "surprised about the gracious things that he was saying." Here "gracious" may refer to how well or eloquent Jesus spoke. Or, it may mean that Jesus spoke words about God's grace.
    * **This is only Joseph's son, is it not?**  - People thought that Joseph was Jesus' father. Joseph was not a religious leader, so they were surprised that his son would preach what he did.  AT: "Isn't this just Joseph's son?" or "This is just Joseph's son!" or "His father is only Joseph!"  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]).
