\v 15 Then the Lord replied to him, "You\add \f + \ft singular \f* and your fellow religious leaders are\add* hypocrites!

\v 16 This woman \add is more important than an animal; she is a Jew\add*, descended from Abraham!

\v 15 Then the Lord replied to him, "You and your fellow religious leaders are hypocrites! Each of you also works on the day of rest sometimes! Would you not untie your ox or donkey to lead it from the food trough to where it can drink water?
\v 16 This woman is a Jew, descended from Abraham! But Satan has kept her crippled for eighteen years, as though he had tied her up! Certainly you would agree that it is right that I free her from Satan, even if I do it on a day of rest!

\v 15 The Lord answered him and said, "Hypocrites! Does not each of you untie your donkey or cow from its stall and lead it to drink on the Sabbath?
\v 16 So too this daughter of Abraham, whom Satan bound for eighteen long years, should her bonds not be untied on the Sabbath day?"

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **The Lord answered him** - "the Lord responded to the synagogue ruler"
    * **Does not each of you untie your donkey** - This starts a rhetorical question. Jesus used this to get them to think about something they already knew. It can be translated as statement: "You untie your donkey"  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **donkey or cow** - These are animals that people care for by giving them water.
    * **daughter of Abraham**  - "descendant of Abraham"
    * **whom Satan bound** - This is a metaphor. It means "whom Satan kept crippled." The metaphor can be kept and the meaning can be made explicit: "whom Satan bound with this disease." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **eighteen long years** - The word "long" here emphasizes that eighteen years was a very long time for the woman to suffer. Other languages may have other ways of emphasizing this. 
    * **to untie her bonds** - This is a metaphor. It can be translated as "to untie her from Satan" or "to untie the bonds of this illness" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
