\v 34 Oh, people of Jerusalem! You killed the prophets who lived long ago, and you killed others, whom God sent to you, by throwing stones at them. Many times I wanted to gather you together to protect you like a hen gathers her young chicks under her wings. But you did not want me to do that.
\v 35 Now look! God will no longer protect you, people of Jerusalem. I will also tell you this: I will enter your city only once more. After that, you will not see me until the time when I return and you say about me, ‘God is truly pleased withMay honor be given to this man who comes with God's authority!'"

\v 34 Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those sent to you. How often I desired to gather your children the way a hen gathers her brood under her wings, but you did not desire this.
\v 35 Behold, your house is abandoned. I say to you, you will not see me until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'”
