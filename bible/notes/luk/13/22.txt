===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This is the next part of the story. Jesus responds to a question by using a metaphor about entering God's kingdom. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **Jesus visited each town and village ... and taught them** - This is background information that tell us what Jesus had been doing when this event occurred. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **taught them** - Here "town" and "village" are metonyms for the people who lived in them. AT: "taught the people in them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **are only a few people to be saved?** - This could be stated in active form. AT: "will God save only a few people?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Struggle to enter through the narrow door** - "Work hard to go through the narrow doorway." Jesus is speaking about the entrance to God's kingdom as if it were a small doorway to a house. Since Jesus is talking to a group, the "you" implied in this command is plural. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **the narrow door** - The fact that the door is narrow implies that it is difficult to go through it. Translate it in a way to keep this restrictive meaning. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **many will want to enter, but will not be able to enter** - It is implied that they will not be able to enter because of the difficulty of entering. The next verse explains the difficulty. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
