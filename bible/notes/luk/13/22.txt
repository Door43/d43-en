===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Struggle to enter the narrow door**  - "Work hard to go through the narrow doorway." This is part of a metaphor about God's kingdom . In this metaphor, God's kingdom is represented by a house. Jesus was speaking to a group of people. So the "you" implied in this command is plural. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]], [[en:obe:kt:kingdomofgod]], [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **the narrow door**  - Becoming part of the kingdom is represented by entering the narrow door. The fact that the door is narrow implies that only a few people at a time can go through it. Translate it in a way to keep this restrictive meaning. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
