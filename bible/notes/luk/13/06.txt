===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues speaking to the crowd.
    * **Jesus told this parable** - He spoke the parable to explain his statement in the previous verse that they should repent or perish. 
    * **Why let it waste the ground** - This is a rhetorical question. It can be translated as a statement as it is in the UDB or as a command: "Do not let it waste the ground." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
