\v 25 Once the owner of the house gets up and locks the door, then you will start to stand outside and pound the door and say, ‘Lord, lord, let us in.’ And he will answer and say to you, 'I do not know you, where are you from?'
\v 26 Then you will start to say, 'We ate and drank in front of you and you taught in our streets.'
\v 27 But he will speak and say to you, 'I do not know where you are from. Get away from me, you unrighteous workers.'

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * (Jesus continues to tell his parable.)
    * **housemaster**  - in a large household, as that of a wealth land owner or someone in the ruling class, there would be many people, and possibly many families. The housemaster would be either the cheif of the servants, the steward in charge of house hold management, or the owner of the house. In either case, none of the lower servants would be able to argue past the gate; you were either in, or out, for the night.
    * **I do not know you**-That is, "I have not known you." The people claimed a relationship but one never existed.
    * **I do not know where**-That is, "I have not known where" you are from**.**
