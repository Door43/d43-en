\v 25 Once the owner of the house gets up and locks the door, then you will start to stand outside and pound the door and say, ‘Lord, lord, let us in.’ And he will answer and say to you, 'I do not know you, where are you from?'
\v 26 Then you will start to say, 'We ate and drank in front of you and you taught in our streets.'
\v 27 But he will speak and say to you, 'I do not know where you are from. Get away from me, you unrighteous workers.'
