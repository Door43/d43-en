===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues speaking in the synagogue.
  * **To what can I compare the kingdom of God?** - This is another rhetorical question that introduces what Jesus wants to talk about it. It can be translated as a statement as in the UDB.  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **It is like yeast** - Only a little bit of yeast was needed to make a lot of dough rise. This can be made clear as it is in the UDB. 
  * **three measures of flour** - AT: "a large amount of flour" or with a term that your culture uses for measuring a large amount of flour.
