===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues telling his story.
    * **Leave it alone** - This can be translated as "Do not do anything to the tree" or "Do not cut it down." 
    * **year** - See [[en:obe:other:biblicaltimeyear]].
    * **and put manure on it**  - "and put manure in the soil." Manure is animal dung. People put it in the ground to make the soil good for plants and trees.
    * **cut it down** - This can be translated as "Let me cut it down" or "Tell me to cut it down." The servant was making a suggestion; he was not giving a command to the owner.
