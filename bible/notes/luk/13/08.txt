===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues telling his story.
  * **Leave it alone** - AT: "Do not do anything to the tree" or "Do not cut it down." 
  * **year** - (See: [[en:obe:other:biblicaltimeyear]])
  * **and put manure on it**  - "and put manure in the soil." Manure is animal dung. People put it in the ground to make the soil good for plants and trees.
