\v 32 He replied to them, "Herod is \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add as cruel as\add* a fox, \add but also as insignificant as a fox\add*. \add So I do not worry about him\add*. But \add to show him that no one can harm me until it is the time and place God has determined\add*, go tell him this \add message from me\add*: 'Listen! I am expelling demons and performing miracles today, and \add I will continue doing\add* it for a short time. After that, I will finish my work.
\v 33 But I must continue my trip \add to Jerusalem\add* during the coming days, because \add they killed many other\add* prophets there, and \add since I am also a prophet\add*, no other place is appropriate for people to kill \add me\add*.'"

\v 31 That same day, some Pharisees came and said to Jesus, "Leave this area, because the ruler Herod Antipas wants to kill you!"
\v 32 He replied to them, "Tell that fox Herod this message from me: 'Listen! I am expelling demons and performing miracles today, and I will continue doing it for a short time. After that, I will finish my work.
\v 33 But I must continue my trip to Jerusalem during the coming days, since it is not appropriate to kill a prophet in a place other thananywhere except Jerusalem.

\v 31 Shortly after, some Pharisees came and said to him, "Go and leave here because Herod wants to kill you."
\v 32 And he said, "Go and tell that fox, 'Look, I cast out demons and perform healings today and tomorrow, and the third day I will reach my goal.'
\v 33 In any case, it is necessary for me to continue on today, tomorrow and the following day, since it is not acceptable to kill a prophet away from Jerusalem.
