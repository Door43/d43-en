\v 31 At that very time, some Pharisees came and said to Jesus, "Leave this area, because \add the ruler\add* Herod \add Antipas\add* wants to kill you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add*!"
\v 32 He replied to them, "Herod is \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add as cruel as\add* a fox, \add but also as insignificant as a fox\add*. \add So I do not worry about him\add*. But \add to show him that no one can harm me until it is the time and place God has determined\add*, go tell him this \add message from me\add*: 'Listen! I am expelling demons and performing miracles today, and \add I will continue doing\add* it for a short time. After that, I will finish my work.
\v 33 But I must continue my trip \add to Jerusalem\add* during the coming days, because \add they killed many other\add* prophets there, and \add since I am also a prophet\add*, no other place is appropriate for people to kill \add me\add*.'"

\v 31 That same day, some Pharisees came and said to Jesus, "Leave this area, because the ruler Herod Antipas wants to kill you!"
\v 32 He replied to them, "Tell that fox Herod this message from me: 'Listen! I am expelling demons and performing miracles today, and I will continue doing it for a short time. After that, I will finish my work.
\v 33 But I must continue my trip to Jerusalem during the coming days, since it is not appropriate to kill a prophet in a place other than Jerusalem.

\v 31 Shortly after, some Pharisees came and said to him, "Go and leave here because Herod wants to kill you."
\v 32 Jesus said, "Go and tell that fox, 'Look, I cast out demons and perform healings today and tomorrow, and the third day I will reach my goal.'
\v 33 In any case, it is necessary for me to continue on today, tomorrow, and the following day, since it is not acceptable to kill a prophet away from Jerusalem.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Shortly after**  - "Shortly after Jesus finished speaking"
  * **Go and leave here because Herod wants to kill you**  - Translate this as a warning to Jesus. They were advising him to go somewhere else and be safe.
  * **Herod wants to kill you**  - "Herod wants to have you killed." Herod would order people to kill Jesus.
  * **that fox**  - Jesus was calling Herod a fox. A fox is a small wild dog. This is a metaphor. Possible meanings are 1) Herod was not much of a threat at all 2) Herod was deceptive. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]).
  * **it is not acceptable to kill a prophet away from Jerusalem**  - The Jewish leaders killed many of God's prophets in Jerusalem and Jesus knew that they would kill him there too. AT: "It is in Jerusalem that the Jewish leaders kill God's messengers." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
