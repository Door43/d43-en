All the prophets \add who lived long ago will also be there\add*, in the kingdom where God \add is ruling\add*. But you will be outside, crying and grinding your teeth \add because you will have severe pain!\add*
\v 29 Furthermore, many \add non-Jewish\add* people will \add be inside\add*. There will be ones who have come from \add lands to\add* the north, east, south, and west. They will be feasting in that place where God is ruling\f + \ft Or: God's kingdom \f*.

\v 28 Then Jesus continued by saying, "You will see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the distance. All the prophets who lived long ago will also be there, where God will rule everything as king. But you will be outside, crying and grinding your teeth in pain!
\v 29 Furthermore, many non-Jewish people will be inside. There will be ones who have come from lands to the north, east, south, and west. They will be feasting to celebrate that God is ruling everything.
\v 30 Think about this: Some people who seem the least important now will be the most important then, and others who seem important now, will be the least important then."

\v 30 And know this, the last are the first, and the first will be last."
