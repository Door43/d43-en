\v 1 At that time, some people told Jesus about some Galileans who had recently been killed in Jerusalem. Pilate, the Roman governor, had ordered soldiers to kill them while they were offering sacrifices in the Temple.
\v 2 Jesus replied to them, "Do you think that this happened to those people from Galilee because they were more sinful than all the other Galileans?
\v 3 I assure you, that was not the reason! But you need to remember that God will similarly punish you if you do not turn from your sinful behavior.
