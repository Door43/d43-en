===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus begins telling another parable. It is about a master and the manager of his debtors. This is still the same part of the story and the same day that began in [[:en:bible:notes:luk:15:03|15:3]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]])

  * **Jesus also said to the disciples** - The last section was directed at Pharisees and scribes, though Jesus' disciples may have been part of the crowd listening.
  * **There was a certain rich man** - This introduces a new character in the parable. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_participants]])
  * **it was reported to him** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "people reported to the rich man" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **wasting his possessions** - "foolishly spending the rich man's wealth"
  * **What is this that I hear about you?** - The rich man uses a question to scold the manager. AT: "I have heard what you are doing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Give an account of your management** - "Set your records in order to pass on to someone else" or "Prepare the records you have written about my money"
