===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues to speak to the people.
  * **And Jesus also said to his disciples**  - The last section was directed at Pharisees and scribes, though Jesus' disciples may have been part of the crowd listening.
  * **it was reported to him**  - "people reported to the rich man"
  * **squandering his possessions**  - "scattering his possessions" or "foolishly spending the rich man's wealth"
  * **What is this I hear about you**? - This is a rhetorical question. The rich man is saying, "I have heard what you are doing." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Give an account of your management**  - This could also be translated as, "Set things in order to pass on to someone else" or "Straighten things up to hand over" or "Prepare the records you have written about my money."
