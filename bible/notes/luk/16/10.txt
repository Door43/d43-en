\v 10 He that is faithful in very little is faithful also in much: and he that is unrighteous in very little is unrighteous also in much.
\v 11 If therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous riches, who will commit to your trust the true riches?
\v 12 And if you have not been faithful in that which is another’s, who will give you that which is your own?
