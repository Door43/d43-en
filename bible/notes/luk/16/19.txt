===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues to speak.
    * **a certain rich man** -  It is not clear if this was a real person, or simply a story that Jesus told in order to make a point.
    * **who was clothed in purple and fine linen**  - "who wore clothing made with fine linen and purple dye" or "who wore very expensive clothes." Purple dye and fine linen cloth were very expensive. 
    * **was enjoying every day his great wealth**  - This could be translated as "was feasting every day" or "enjoyed eating expensive food every day" or "spent much money and bought whatever he desired."
    * **a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate** - "people had laid a certain beggar named Lazarus at his gate" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
    * **beggar** - "a poor man who had to beg people for food"
    * **at his gate**  - "at the gate to the rich man's house" or "at the entrance to the rich man's property"
    * **covered with sores**  - "with sores all over his body." 
    * **yearned to be fed with** - "wished to eat" or "wished he would be allowed to eat"
    * **what fell from the rich man's table** - This could also be translated as "crumbs of food that accidentally fell from the rich man's table as he was eating" or "the leftover food that was thrown from the rich man's table."
    * **And besides that** - This could also be translated as "In addition to that" or "Even." This shows that what follows is even worse than what has already be told about Lazarus.
    * **dogs**  - Dogs were an unclean animal. Lazarus was too sick and weak to stop the dogs from licking his wounds.
