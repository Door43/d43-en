===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues telling his story.

  * **It came about that**  - This phrase is used here to mark the beginning of a new part of the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **and was carried by the angels to Abraham's chest**  - "and the angels carried Lazarus to Abraham's chest"
  * **Abraham's chest**  - Apparently Abraham and Lazarus were reclining next to each other at a feast, and Lazarus's head was close to Abraham's chest. This was the Greek style of feasting for invited guests. This phrase could also be translated as "at Abraham's side" or "next to Abraham" or "reclining next to Abraham" or "sitting next to Abraham."
  * **being in torment**  - "where he was continually afflicted" or "while he was suffering severe pain"
  * **he lifted up his eyes**  - This is a metaphor that means "he looked up." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and Lazarus by his chest**  - This could also be translated as "and Lazarus reclining next to Abraham" or "and Lazarus sitting close to him" or "and Lazarus with him."
