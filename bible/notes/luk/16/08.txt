\v 8 When his master \add heard what the manager had done\add*, he admired the dishonest manager for the clever thing he had done. \add The truth\add* is that the ungodly people in this world act more wisely toward other people than godly people \f + \ft metaphor \f* act.
\v 9 \add So\add* I tell you\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add* this: Use the money that you have \add here\add* on earth to help others so that they will become your friends. Then when \add you die and\add* you cannot \add take\add* any money with you, \add God and his angels\add* will welcome you into a home \add in heaven\add* that will last forever.

\v 8 When the master heard what his manager had done, he admired the dishonest manager for the way he prepared for the fact that he was about to lose his job. The truth is, the ungodly people in this world, who act dishonestly and use deceit, look ahead and prepare for their future more than the godly, who shine like lights in this world.
\v 9 I tell you, use the money you made dishonestly to help others. When you do, they will become your friends, and when the money is gone, you will have friends who will welcome you into your eternal home.

<usfm>
\v 8 The master then commended the unrighteous manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the children of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own people than are the children of light.
\v 9 I say to you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous money, so that when it is gone, they may welcome you into the eternal dwellings.
