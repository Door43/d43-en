\v 16 The laws that God gave Moses and what the prophets wrote were proclaimed until John the Baptizer came. Since then I have been preaching that God will soon show himself as king. Many people are accepting that message and are very eagerly asking God to rule their lives.
\v 17 All of God's laws, even those that seem insignificant, are more permanent than heaven and earth.

<usfm>
\v 16 The law and the prophets were in effect until John came. From that time on, the gospel of the kingdom of God is preached, and everyone tries to force their way into it.
\v 17 But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter of the law to become invalid.
