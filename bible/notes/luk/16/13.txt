Jesus continues to teach the people.
  * **No servant can**  - This can also be translated as, "A servant cannot."
  * **he will hate**  - "the servant will hate"
  * **devoted**  - "dedicated" or "loyal"
  * **despise the other**  - "hold the other in contempt" or "sneer at at other" or "hate the other"
  * **You cannot serve**  - Jesus was talking to a group of people, so languages that have a plural form of "you" would use that. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you|formsofyou]])
  * **serve**  - "be a slave to"
