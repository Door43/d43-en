<usfm>
\v 13 No servant is able to serve two different masters at the same time. If he tried to do that, he would hate one of them and love the other one, or he would be loyal to one of them and despise the other one. You cannot devote your life to serving God if you are also devoting your life to acquiring money and other material possessions."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **No servant can** - "A servant cannot"
  * **serve two masters** - It is implied that he cannot "serve two different masters at the same time" 
  * **for either he will ... or else he will** - These two clauses are essentially the same. The only significant difference is that the first master is hated in the first clause, but the second master is hated in the second clause.
  * **he will hate** - "the servant will hate"
  * **devoted** - "dedicated." This means essentially the same as "love" in the previous clause. 
  * **despise the other** - "hold the other in contempt" or "hate the other"
  * **despise** - This means essentially the same as "hate" in the previous clause. 
  * **You cannot serve** - Jesus was talking to a group of people, so languages that have a plural form of "you" would use that. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
