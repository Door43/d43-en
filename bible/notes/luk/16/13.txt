\v 13 No servant is able to serve two different masters at the same time. If he tried to do that, he would hate one of them and love the other one, or he would be loyal to one of them and despise the other one.

  * **devoted** - "dedicated" or "loyal"
  * **despise the other** - "hold the other in contempt" or "hate the other"
