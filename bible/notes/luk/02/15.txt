===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **from them**  - "from the shepherds"
  * **to each other**  - "to one another"
  * **Let usâ€¦ to us**  - Since the shepherds were speaking to one another, languages that have inclusive forms for "we" and "us" should use the inclusive form here. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
