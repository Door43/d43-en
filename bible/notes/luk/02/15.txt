===== translationNotes: =====

  * **It came about** - This phrase is used to mark a shift in the story to what the shepherds did after the angels left.
  * **from them** - "from the shepherds"
  * **to each other** - "to one another"
  * **Let us ... to us** - Since the shepherds were speaking to one another, languages that have inclusive forms for "we" and "us" should use the inclusive form here. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
  * **Let us** - "We should" 
  * **this thing that has happened** - This refers to the birth of the baby, and not to the appearance of the angels.
  * **lying in the manger** - This was some kind of box or frame that people put hay or other food in for animals to eat. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:luk:02:06|2:7]].
