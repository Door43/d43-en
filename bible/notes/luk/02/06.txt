\v 6-7 When they arrived in Bethlehem, there was no place for them to stay in a place where visitors usually stayed. So they had to stay in a place where animals were sheltered. While they were there the time came for Mary to give birth and she gave birth to her first child, a son. She wrapped him in wide strips of cloth and placed him in an animal feeding trough as a bed for him.

\v 6 Now it came about that while they were there, the time came for her to deliver her baby.  
\v 7 She gave birth to a son, her firstborn child, and she wrapped him snugly in strips of cloth. Then she put him in an animal feeding trough, because there was no room for them in a guest room.

===== Important Terms: =====

  * [[:en:bible:notes:key-terms:firstborn|firstborn]]


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **while they were there**  - That is, "while Mary and Joseph were in Bethlehem."
  * **the time came**  - That is, "it was time."
  * **to deliver her baby**  - That is, "to give birth to her baby." Use a common expression that will not embarrass people.
  * **wrapped him snuggly in strips of cloth**  - That is, "wrapped him comfortably in a blanket" or "swaddled him in cloth." This act was an expression of love and concern for the newborn baby.
  * **an animal feeding trough**  - This trough was most likely clean and may have had something soft and dry like hay in it as a cushion for the baby. Animals were often kept near the home to keep them secure and to feed them easily. Apparently Mary and Joseph stayed in a room that was used for animals.
  * **guest room**  - This is a separate area for guests or travelers.
  * **there was no room for them in a guest room**  - That is, "there was no space in the guest room for them to stay." This was probably because so many people went to Bethlehem to register.
  * **because there was no room**  - If it is not clear why Mary put her son in a feeding trough, you could explicitly state the implied information about them staying in a room for animals, and you could change the order of the information in verse 7. "There was no room for them in a guest room, so they stayed in a room for animals. When she gave birth to a son, her firstborn child, she wrapped him snugly in strips of cloth. Then she put him in an animal feeding trough." (See: talink [[en:ta:vocabulary:implicitexplicit|Implicit Information]])
