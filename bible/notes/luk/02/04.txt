\v 4-5 Joseph also traveled to his family's hometown, along with Mary who was engaged to him and was pregnant. Because Joseph was a descendant of King David, they left the town of Nazareth in the region of Galilee and traveled to the town of Bethlehem, which is also known as the city of David. Joseph and Mary went there to be registered in the public record.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **traveled to the town of Bethlehem**  - This could be translated as "went up to the town of Bethlehem" Bethlehem was higher in elevation than Nazareth.
    * **city of David **- Bethlehem was called a city because of its importance, not its size. King David was born there and there was a prophecy that the Messiah would be born there. "City of David" could be translated as "city of King David."
    * **to register** - This could be translated as "to have his name written in the register" or "to be included in the count." 
    * **along with Mary** - Mary traveled with Joseph from Nazareth. It is likely that women were also taxed, so Mary would have needed to travel and be registered as well.
    * **who was engaged to him** - This could be translated as "his fiancée" or "who was promised to him." An engaged couple was considered legally married, but there would not have been physical intimacy between them.
