\v 4-5 Joseph also traveled to his family's hometown, along with Mary who was engaged to him and was pregnant. Because Joseph was a descendant of King David, they left the town of Nazareth in the region of Galilee and traveled to the region of Judea, to the town of Bethlehem, which is also known as the city of David. Joseph and Mary went there to be registered in the public record.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The UDB rearranges these two verses into a verse bridge in order to make it easier to shorten the sentences. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_versebridge]])

  * **Joseph also** - This introduces Joseph as a new participant in the story. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_participants]])
  * **to the city of David** - This is background information about the importance of Bethlehem. Although it was a small town, King David was born there, and there was a prophecy that the Messiah would be born there. AT: "which was called the city of King David" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **because he was of the house and family line of David** - "because Joseph was a descendant of David"
  * **to register** - This means to report to the officials there so they could include him in the count. Use a term for an official government count if possible.
  * **along with Mary** - Mary traveled with Joseph from Nazareth. It is likely that women were also taxed, so Mary would have needed to travel and be registered as well. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_participants]])
  * **who was engaged to him** - "his fiancee" or "who was promised to him." An engaged couple was considered legally married, but there would not have been physical intimacy between them.
