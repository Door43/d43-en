\v 22-23 It had been written by Moses \f + \ft Or:Moses had written \f* \add long ago\add* in a law that God gave him, that when a woman gave birth to her first son, the parents had to take him \add to the Temple\add* in Jerusalem in order that they might dedicate him to the Lord\f + \ft Or: to God \f*. So when the time came for them to do those rituals so that \add God would consider\add* them pure again, Mary and Joseph took Jesus there.
\v 24 God had commanded in his laws that if the first child \add of a couple\add* was a boy, his parents should offer as a sacrifice to God two turtledoves or two young pigeons. \add So Joseph and Mary gave the priest two birds so he could offer them\add*.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **the required number of days** - This could be translated as "the number of days that God required."
    * **for their purification** - "for them to become ceremonially clean" or "for God to consider them to be clean again"
    * **to present him to the Lord** - "to bring him to the Lord" or "to bring him into the Lord's presence." This was a ceremony acknowledging God's claim on the firstborn children who were male. 
    * **As it is written** - This could be translated as "They did this because it is written." 
    * **male that opens the womb** - This is an idiom for "firstborn offspring that is a male." The law was about the firstborn offspring of both people and domestic animals, but in this context it could be translated as "firstborn son." (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:idiom|Idiom]])
    * **turtledoves** - These are common birds that eat seeds and often live in open areas. They are small enough to be held in two hands, and people would eat them.
    * **young pigeons** - These are birds that eat seeds and often live in hilly or mountain areas. They are small enough to be held in two hands, and people would eat them.
