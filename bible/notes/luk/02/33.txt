===== Translation Notes: =====

Simeon speaks to Mary and Joseph, the parents of baby Jesus.

  * **This child is destined for the falling and rising of many people in Israel** - This pictures the ideas of turning away from God and drawing closer to God expressed in the words "rising" and "falling." AT: "God has caused many people in Israel to fall away from God or to rise closer to God" or "God has planned for him to cause some people in Israel to turn away from God and for other people in Israel to go closer to God." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **a sword will pierce your own soul** - This a metaphor describing the deep sadness that Mary would feel. AT: "You will grieve deeply" or "Your sadness will be painful as though a sword pierced your heart" 
  * **the thoughts from many hearts may be revealed** - AT: "the thoughts of many people will be revealed" or "it will be made known what many people truly think about God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
