===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues telling his parable.
  * **to make excuses** - Here it means "to say why they could not come to the dinner."
  * **Please excuse me**  - "Please forgive me" or "Please accept my apology"
  * **five pairs of oxen** -  Oxen are cows or bulls that people use to pull heavy loads or do other hard work. Oxen usually work in pairs. 
  * **married a wife**  - Use an expression that is natural in your language. Some languages may say "gotten married" or "taken a wife."
