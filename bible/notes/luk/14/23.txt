===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues telling his parable.
  * **the highways and hedges**  - This refers to roads and paths outside of the city. It can be translated as "the main roads and paths outside of the city."
  * **those men**  - The word here for "men" means "male adults" and not just people in general.
  * **who were first invited **- "whom I first invited"
  * **will taste my dinner**  - "will enjoy the dinner I have prepared"
