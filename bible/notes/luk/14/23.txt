===== Translation Notes: =====


    * (Jesus continues telling his parable.)
    * **highways and hedges**  - "the roads, the wide pathways, and the houses outside the city"
    * **compel them**  - That is, "compel (convince) the people there."
    * **who were first invited**  - That is, "who I invited at first."
    * **will taste my dinner**  - "will enjoy the dinner I have prepared"
    * **those men**  - The word here for "men" literally means "male adults" and not just people in general.
