\v 28 \add I will illustrate\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. If one of you desired to build a tower\f + \ft Or: big house \f*, you would surely first sit down and determine how much it would cost!\f + \ft Or: would you not first sit down and determine how much it would cost? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* Then you would determine whether you had enough money to complete it.
\v 29 \add If you did not do that\add*, if you laid the foundation and were not able to finish \add the rest of the tower\add*, everyone who saw it would make fun of you.
\v 30 They would say, 'This man started to build \add a tower\add*, but he was not able to finish it!'

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 If one of you desired to build a tower, would you not first sit down and determine how much it would cost? Then you would be able to determine whether you had enough money to complete it.
\v 29 Otherwise, if you laid the foundation and were not able to finish the rest of the tower, everyone who saw it would make fun of you.
\v 30 They would say, 'This man started to build a tower, but he was not able to finish it!'
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 For which of you, who desires to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost to calculate if he has what he needs to complete it?
\v 29 Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it will begin to mock him,
\v 30 saying, 'This man began to build and was not able to finish.'

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues speaking to the crowds.
  * **For which of you**  - This is the beginning of a rhetorical question. Jesus used it to get people to think about what they would do in a particular situation. It can also be translated as a statement: If one of you wanted to build a tower, you would certainly first sit down and count the cost." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **tower**  - This may have been a watchtower in a vineyard. Some languages might translate it as "a tall building" or "a high lookout platform."
  * **Otherwise**  - "If he does not first count the cost"
  * **when he has laid the foundation**  - "when he has built the base." It can also be translated as "when he started building."
