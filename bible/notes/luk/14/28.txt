\v 28 \add I will illustrate\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. If one of you desired to build a tower\f + \ft Or: big house \f*, you would surely first sit down and determine how much it would cost!\f + \ft Or: would you not first sit down and determine how much it would cost? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* Then you would determine whether you had enough money to complete it.
\v 29 \add If you did not do that\add*, if you laid the foundation and were not able to finish \add the rest of the tower\add*, everyone who saw it would make fun of you.
\v 30 They would say, 'This man started to build \add a tower\add*, but he was not able to finish it!'

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 If one of you desired to build a tower, would you not first sit down and determine how much it would cost? Then you would be able to determine whether you had enough money to complete it.
\v 29 Otherwise, if you laid the foundation and were not able to finish the rest of the tower, everyone who saw it would make fun of you.
\v 30 They would say, 'This man started to build a tower, but he was not able to finish it!'

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 For which of you, who desires to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost to calculate if he has what he needs to complete it?
\v 29 Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it will begin to mock him,
\v 30 saying, 'This man began to build and was not able to finish.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jesus continues to explain to the crowd that it is important to count the cost of being a disciple.

  * **For which of you, who desires to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost to calculate if he has what he needs to complete it?** - Jesus uses this question to prove that people count the cost of a project before they begin it. AT: "If a person wanted to build a tower, he would certainly first sit down and determine if he had enough money to complete it." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **tower** - This may have been a watchtower. AT: "a tall building" or "a high lookout platform."
  * **Otherwise** - It may be helpful to give more information. AT: "If he does not first count the cost." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **when he has laid a foundation** - "when he has built a base" or "when he has completed on the first part of the building"
  * **is not able to finish** - It is understood that he was not able to finish because he did not have enough money. This could be stated. AT: "does not have enough money to be able to finish." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
