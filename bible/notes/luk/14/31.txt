\v 31 Or, if a king decided to send his army to war against another king, he would surely first sit down with those who advised him. They would determine whether his army, which had only ten thousand soldiers, could defeat the other king's army, which had twenty thousand soldiers.
\v 32 If he decided his army could not defeat the other army, he would send a messenger to the other king while the other army was still far away. He would tell the messenger to say to that king, 'What things must I do to have peace with you?'
\v 33 So, similarly, if any one of you does not first decide that you are willing to give up all that you have, you cannot be my disciple."

\v 31 Or what king, as he goes to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand men to fight the other king who comes against him with twenty thousand men?
\v 32 And if not, while the other army is still far away, he sends an ambassador and asks for conditions of peace.
\v 33 So therefore, any one of you who does not give up all that he has cannot be my disciple.
