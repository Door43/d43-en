\v 34 Jesus also said, "You are like salt, which is very useful. But if salt were to lose its saltiness, could it ever be made to taste salty again?
\v 35 If salt does not taste salty anymore, it is no longer any good even for the soil or manure heap. People just throw it away. Every one of you should listen carefully to what I am telling you!"

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 34 Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its taste, how can it be made salty again?
\v 35 It is of no use for the soil or even for the manure pile. It is thrown away. He who has ears to hear, let him hear."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus finishes teaching the crowd.

  * **Salt is good** - "Salt is useful." Jesus is teaching a lesson about those who want to be his disciple. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **how can it be made salty again?** - Jesus uses a question to teach the crowd. AT: "It cannot be made salty again" or "No one can make it salty again." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **manure pile** - People use manure to fertilize gardens and fields. Salt without taste is so useless it is not even worth mixing with manure. AT: "compost heap" or "fertilizer."
  * **It is thrown away** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Someone just throws it away." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **He who has ears to hear, let him hear** - It may be more natural in some languages to use the second person: "You who have ears to hear, hear." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]]) 
  * **He who has ears to hear** - Possible meanings are 1) "Everyone" since everyone has ears or 2) "Whoever has the ability to understand" which refers to those who are willing to listen to God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]) 
  * **let him hear** - "he should listen well" or "he should pay attention to what I say"
