\v 34 Jesus also said, "You are like salt, which is very useful. But if salt were to lose its saltiness, could it ever be made to taste salty again?
\v 35 If salt does not taste salty anymore, it is no longer any good even for the soil or manure heap. People just throw it away. Every one of you should listen carefully to what I am telling you!"

\v 34 Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its taste, how can it be made salty again?
\v 35 It is of no use for the soil or even for the manure pile. It is thrown away. He who has ears to hear, let him hear."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Jesus continues speaking to the crowd following him)
  * **Salt is good**  - "Salt is useful"
  * **how can it be made salty again**  - This is a rhetorical question. It can also be translated as "It cannot be made salty again" or "No one can make it salty again." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **for the soil or the manure pile**  - "Manure pile" can be translated as "compost heap" or "fertilizer." Manure was used to fertilize gardens and fields. Food that had gone bad could be mixed in with manure. But salt that had lost its flavor could not be used even for that. It was completely useless.
  * **He who has ears to hear, let him hear**  - This can also be translated as a command: "If you have hears to hear, listen well" or "If you hear what I am saying, pay attention."
  * **He who has ears to hear**  - “Whoever can hear” or “If anyone hears me”
  * **let him hear**  - “let him listen well” or “let him pay attention to what I say”
