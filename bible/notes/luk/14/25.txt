\v 25 A large crowd of people was traveling with Jesus. He turned toward the people and said to them,
\v 26 "If anyone comes to me who loves his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters more than he loves me, he cannot be my disciple. He must even love me more than he loves his own life!
\v 27 Whoever does not carry his own cross and whoever does not obey me cannot be my disciple.

\v 25 Now large crowds were going with him, and he turned and said to them,
\v 26 "If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers and sisters—yes, and his own life also—he cannot be my disciple.
\v 27 Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father...he cannot be my disciple.** - AT: "If anyone comes to me, he can be my disciple only if he hates his own father."
    * **hate**  - This is an exaggeration to show how important it is to love Jesus much more than anyone else. AT: "If anyone comes to me and does not love me more than he loves his father...he cannot be my disciple" or positively as "If anyone comes to me, he can be my disciple only if he loves me more than he loves his own father." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
    * **yes, and his own life also**  - "and even his own life"
    * **Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple** - AT: "If anyone wants to be my disciple, he must carry his own cross and follow me."
    * **carry his own cross**  - This means "be willing to die." People who were condemned to die were often forced to carry the cross on which they would be hung and killed.  People who followed Christ would have to be willing to suffer persecution that could come.
