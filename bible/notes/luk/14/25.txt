\v 25 A large crowd of people was traveling with Jesus. He turned toward the people and said to them,
\v 26 "If anyone comes to me who loves his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters more than he loves me, he cannot be my disciple. He must even love me more than he loves his own life!
\v 27 Whoever does not carry his own cross and whoever does not obey me cannot be my disciple.

\v 25 Now large crowds were going with him, and he turned and said to them,
\v 26 "If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers and sisters, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.
\v 27 Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jesus begins to teach the crowd that was traveling with him.

  * **If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father ... he cannot be my disciple** - Here, "hate" is an exaggeration for the lesser love people are to show to people other than Jesus. AT: "If anyone comes to me and does not love me more than he loves his father ... he cannot be my disciple" or "Only if a person loves me more than he loves his own father ... can he be my disciple" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
  * **Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple** - This could be stated with positive verbs. AT: "If anyone wants to be my disciple, he must carry his own cross and follow me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
  * **carry his own cross** - Jesus does not mean every Christian must be crucified. The Romans often made people carry their own crosses before they crucified them as a sign of their submission to Rome. This metaphor means they must submit to God and be willing to suffer in any way to be Jesus' disciples. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
