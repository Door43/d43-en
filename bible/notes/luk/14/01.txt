===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Jesus visits with people at the house of a Pharisee.)
  * **to eat bread**  - This could also be translated as, "to eat food" or "to eat a meal" or "for a meal." The word "bread" here is used for food in general. (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:synecdoche|Synecdoche]])
  * **was suffering from edema**  - swelling of parts of the body due to the accumulation of water in an area. It occurs most often in the extremities, but depending on the type it can affect other parts of the body.
  * **watching him closely **- That is, the pharisees who invited Jesus into one of their homes for a meal were intently observing what will Jesus do to a sick man. The pharisees were curiously looking out for Jesus' next course of action whether he will have compassion on the sick man and heal him on Sabbath or would he observe the Sabbath law of doing no labor.
  * **Behold, there in front of him was a man**  - The word "behold" alerts us to a new person in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this. English uses "There in front of him was a man who was...”
  * **is it lawful**  - that is, does the Mosaic law permit
  * **bold words**  - explanation
