===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **to eat bread**  - "to eat" or "for a meal." Bread was an important part of a meal and is used in this sentence to refer to a meal. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **watching him closely **  - They wanted to see if they could accuse him of doing anything wrong.
  * **Behold, there in front of him was a man**  - The word "behold" alerts us to a new person in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this. English uses "There in front of him was a man who was…"
  * **was suffering from edema**  - Edema is swelling caused by water building up in parts of the body. Some languages may have a name for this condition. This AT: "was suffering because parts of his body were swollen with water."
  * **Is it lawful to heal**  - "Does the law permit us to heal"
