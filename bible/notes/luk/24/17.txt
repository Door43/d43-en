===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Are you the only person**  - "You" refers to Jesus, use you (singular). This is the beginning of a rhetorical question. Cleopas showed his surprise that Jesus appeared not to know about the things that had happened in Jerusalem. It can also be translated as "You must be the only person." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]],  [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
