===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **remembered his words**  - "remembered Jesus' words" 
  * **returned from the tomb**  - The narrator's point of observation is from the path between the tomb and apostles (ULB). The UDB has the point of observation at the tomb, noting that the women have left. In either case, the women left the tomb and went to where the apostles were.
  * **all the rest** - "all the rest of the disciples that were with the eleven apostles"
