===== translationNotes: =====

  * **were still incredulous with joy** - "were excited but still could not believe that it was really true." They were very excited, but at the same time, it was difficult for them to believe that it had really happened.
  * **and wondered** - "and were amazed" (UDB) or "and wondered how this could be"
  * **ate it before them** - Jesus did this to prove that he had a physical body. Spirits would not be able to eat food. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **before them** - "in front of them" or "while they were watching" (UDB)
