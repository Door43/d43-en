  * **who would free Israel** - The Romans ruled over the Jews. AT: "who would free the Israelites from our Roman enemies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Yes, and besides all this** - This introduces another reason why they believed Jesus would not free Israel. AT: "Now that does not seem possible because"
