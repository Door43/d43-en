===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **It happened that** - This phrase is used here to mark where the action starts. It starts with Jesus approaching them. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **Jesus himself** - The word "himself" focuses on Jesus and the surprise of Jesus actually appearing to them. So far the women had seen the angels, but no one had seen Jesus.
  * **their eyes were prevented from recognizing him** - "their eyes were kept from recognizing Jesus." The men's ability to recognize Jesus is spoken of as their eyes' ability to recognize him. AT: "they were kept from recognizing him" or "something prevented them so they could not recognize him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
