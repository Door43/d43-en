===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **Why are you troubled**  - This is a rhetorical question used to comfort them. It can be translated as "Do not be frightened." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **And why do questions arise in your heart?**  - "Why do you doubt in your mind?" This rhetorical question is a mild rebuke. It can be translated as "Stop doubting in your heart." Jesus was telling them not to doubt that he was alive. This can be made explicit as in the UDB. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]], [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
    * **flesh and bones** - This is a way of referring to the body.
