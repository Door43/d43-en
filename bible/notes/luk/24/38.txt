===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Why are you troubled?** - Jesus uses a question to comfort them. AT: "Do not be frightened" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Why do questions arise in your heart?** - Jesus uses a question to mildly rebuke them. Jesus was telling them not to doubt that he was alive. The word "heart" refers to their thinking. AT: "Do not doubt in your minds!" or "Stop doubting!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Touch me and see ... see me having** - Jesus asks them to confirm by touch that he is not a ghost. It may be helpful to combine and reorder these two sentences. AT: "Touch me and feel that I have flesh and bones that a ghost would not have"
  * **flesh and bones** - This is a way of referring to the physical body.
  * **his hands and his feet** - It is understood that his hands and feet contained the nail marks from his crucifixion that would prove it was really Jesus. This can be made explicit. AT: "the wounds in his hands and his feet"
