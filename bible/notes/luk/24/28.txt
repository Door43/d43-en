\v 28 As they drew near to the village, where they were going, Jesus acted as though he would go further.
\v 29 But they compelled him, saying, "Stay with us, for it is toward evening, and the day is now far spent." And Jesus went in to stay with them.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **As they drew near** - "As they came near" (UDB).
  * **he acted as though he would go further**  - The two men inferred from his actions that he was going on to another destination. Perhaps he kept walking on the road when they turned off to enter the gate into the village. There is no indication that Jesus deceived them with words.
  * **they compelled him** - "They strongly urged him". The Greek word literally means to use physical force over an extended time, but it seems to be hyperbole (see [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:hyperbole|Hyperbole]]): it took them some time to persuade him.
