\v 29 But they compelled him, saying, "Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is almost over." So Jesus went in to stay with them.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Jesus acted as though he was going further** - The two men understood from his actions that he was going on to another destination. Perhaps he kept walking on the road when they turned off to enter the gate into the village. There is no indication that Jesus deceived them with words.
  * **they compelled him** - You may need to make explicit what they compelled him to do. This is probably an exaggeration to show that they needed to speak with him for a long time before they could change his mind. The word "compel" means to use physical force, but it seems that they persuaded him using only words. AT: "They were able to persuade him to stay" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **it is toward evening and the day is almost over** - The Jewish day ended at sundown. 
  * **Jesus went in** - "Jesus entered the house"
  * **stay with them** - "stay with the two disciples"
