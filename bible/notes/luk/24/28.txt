===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **he acted as though he would go further**  - The two men inferred from his actions that he was going on to another destination. Perhaps he kept walking on the road when they turned off to enter the gate into the village. There is no indication that Jesus deceived them with words.
    * **compelled**  - The Greek word literally means to use physical force over an extended time, but it seems to be figurative overstatement for repeated verbal persuasion.
    * **bold words**  - explanation
    * **bold words**  - explanation
