\v 22 On the other hand, some women from our group amazed us. Early this morning they went to the tomb,
\v 23 but Jesus' body was not there! They came \add back\add* and said that they had seen some angels in a vision. The angels said that he was alive!
\v 24 Then some of those who were with us went to the tomb. They saw that things were exactly as the women had reported. But they did not see \add Jesus\add*."

\v 22 In spite of this, some women from our group amazed us. Early this morning they went to the burial chamber,
\v 23 but the body of Jesus was not there! They came back and said that they had seen some angels in a vision. The angels said that he was alive!
\v 24 Then some of those who were with us went to the burial chamber. They saw that things were exactly as the women had reported. But they did not see Jesus."

\v 22 But also, some women of our company amazed us, having been at the tomb early in the morning.
\v 23 When they did not find his body, they came, saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive.
\v 24 Some men who were with us went to the tomb, and found it just as the women had said. But they did not see him."
