===== Translation Notes: =====
The angels continue talking to the women.
  * **Remember how** - "Remember what"
  * **he spoke to you** - Jesus had said this at least a week earlier.
  * **to you** - The word "you" is plural. It refers to the women and the other disciples. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **that the Son of Man** - This is the beginning of an indirect quote. It can also be translated with a direct quote as in the UDB. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **the Son of Man must be** - "it was necessary for the Son of Man to be." This is something that would certainly happen because God had already decided that it would happen.
  * **delivered up into the hands of** - "handed over to" or "given over to." Here "hand" refers to power or control. AT: "They will have to hand me, the Son of Man, over to sinful men" (UDB) or "Someone will certainly enable sinful men to seize the Son of Man. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
