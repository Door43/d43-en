===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **must be** - This phrase literally indicates that the unnamed "they" (see dynamic version)  are under moral obligation to "hand [Jesus] over to sinful men." This is irony, shaming a person by saying the opposite of the truth, in this case shaming the religious leaders who would hand him over to the Romans by calling their desire to sin a moral obligation to do good. It could also carry an idea like "water must run downhill," that the leaders were acting by choice the way inanimate objects or people with no choice might act.
