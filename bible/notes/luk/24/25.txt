  * **slow of heart to believe** - AT: "your minds are slow to believe" or "you are slow to believe" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Was it not necessary**  - This is a rhetorical question that means "It was necessary." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) Jesus did right by suffering and would have done wrong by not suffering.
