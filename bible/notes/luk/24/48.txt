===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues speaking to the disciples.

  * **You are witnesses** - "You are to tell others that what you saw about me is true." The disciples had observed Jesus' life, death and resurrection, and could describe what he did to other people.
  * **I am sending the promise of my Father upon you** - "I will give you what my Father promised to give you." The "promise" that Jesus is here referring to is the Holy Spirit. The UDB makes this explicit. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Father** - This is an important title for God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **you are clothed with power** - God's power will cover them in the same way that clothes cover a person. This can be stated in active form. AT: "you receive power" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **from on high** - "from above" or "from God"
