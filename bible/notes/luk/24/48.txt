===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **You are witnesses**  - "You are to tell others that what you saw about me is true." The disciples had observed Jesus' life, death and resurrection, and could describe what he did to other people.
  * **I send forth the promise of my Father upon you**  - "I give you what my Father promised to give you"
  * **clothed with power**  - "be empowered" or "receive power." God's power will cover them in the same way that clothes cover a person. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **from on high**  - "from above" or "from God"
