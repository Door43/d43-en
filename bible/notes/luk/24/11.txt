\v 11 But the apostles dismissed their words as nonsense.
\v 12 However, Peter got up and ran to the burial chamber anyway. He stooped down and looked inside. He saw the linen cloths in which Jesus' body had been wrapped, but Jesus was not there. So, wondering what had happened, he went home.

\v 11 But this message seemed like idle talk to the apostles, and they did not believe the women.

\v 12 Yet Peter rose up, and ran to the tomb, and stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves.  Peter then departed to his home, wondering what had happened.
