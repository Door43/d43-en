\v 11 But the apostles dismissed their words as nonsense.
\v 12 However, Peter got up and ran to the burial chamber anyway. He stooped down and looked inside. He saw the linen cloths in which Jesus' body had been wrapped, but Jesus was not there. So, wondering what had happened, he went home.

\v 11 But this message seemed like idle talk to the apostles, and they did not believe the women.

\v 12 Yet Peter rose up, and ran to the tomb, and stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves. Peter then departed to his home, wondering what had happened.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But this message seemed like idle talk to the apostles** - "But the apostles thought that what the women said was foolish talk"
  * **Yet Peter** - This phrase contrasts Peter to the other apostles. He did not dismiss what the women said, but ran to the tomb to see for himself. 
  * **rose up** - This is an idiom that means "began to act." Whether Peter was sitting or standing when he decided to act is not important. AT: "started out" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **stooping** - "bending over." Tombs cut in solid rock were very low. Peter had to bend over in order to see inside the tomb.
  * **the linen cloths by themselves** - "only the linen cloths." This refers to the cloth that had been wrapped around Jesus' body when he was buried in [[:en:bible:notes:luk:23:52|23:53]]. It is implied that the body of Jesus was not there. AT: "the linen cloths in which Jesus' body had been wrapped, but Jesus was not there" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **departed to his home** - "went away to his home"
