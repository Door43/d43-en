\v 30 It happened that, when he had sat down with them to eat, he took the bread, blessed it, and breaking it, he gave it to them.
\v 31 Then their eyes were opened, and they knew him, and he vanished out of their sight.
\v 32 They said one to another, "Was not our heart burning within us, while he spoke to us on the way, while he opened to us the scriptures?"

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **It happened**  - This phrase is used here to mark an important event in the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **Then their eyes were opened**  - "then they understood" or "then they realized"
  * **the bread** - This refers to bread made without yeast. It does not refer to food in general. 
  * **blessed it** - This can be translated as "gave thanks for it" or "thanked God for it."
  * **he vanished out of their sight** - This means that suddenly he was no longer there. It does not mean that he became invisible.
  * **Was not our heart burningâ€¦**  -  "Our hearts were burning within us" (UDB). This is a rhetorical question. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **our hearts burning within** - This is a metaphor that describes the intense feelings they had while talking to Jesus. The question could be translated as "We had such intense feelings while he was speaking to us..." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **within us**  - The two men were speaking to each other. So the word "us" is dual inclusive for languages that make these distinctions. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pluralpronouns]], [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
  * **while he opened to us the scriptures** - "while he explained the scriptures to us." Jesus did not open a book or scroll.
