===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **It happened**  - This phrase is used here to mark an important event in the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **Then their eyes were opened**  - "then they understood" or "then they realized"
  * **the bread** - This refers to bread made without yeast. It does not refer to food in general. 
  * **blessed it** - This can be translated as "gave thanks for it" or "thanked God for it."
  * **he vanished out of their sight** - This means that suddenly he was no longer there. It does not mean that he became invisible.
  * **Was not our heart burning…**  -  "Our hearts were burning within us" (UDB). This is a rhetorical question. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **our hearts burning within** - This is a metaphor that describes the intense feelings they had while talking to Jesus. The question could be translated as "We had such intense feelings while he was speaking to us..." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **within us**  - The two men were speaking to each other. So the word "us" is dual inclusive for languages that make these distinctions. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pluralpronouns]], [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
  * **while he opened to us the scriptures** - "while he explained the scriptures to us." Jesus did not open a book or scroll.
