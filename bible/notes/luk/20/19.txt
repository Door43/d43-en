\v 20 So they watched him carefully. They also sent spies who pretended to be sincere. But they really wanted to get Jesus to say something wrong for which they could accuse him. They wanted to be able to turn him over to the governor of the province.

\v 19 So the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him in that very hour, for they knew that he had spoken this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people.
\v 20 Watching him carefully, they sent out spies who pretended to be righteous, that they might find fault with his speech, so as to deliver him up to the rule and to the authority of the governor.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **sought to lay hands on him**  - AT: "looked for a way to arrest Jesus." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **in that very hour**  - "immediately"
  * **they were afraid of the people**  - This is the reason that they did not arrest Jesus right away. The people respected Jesus, and the religious leaders were afraid of what the people might do if they arrested him. Some translations may need to make this explicit: "But they did not arrest him because they were afraid of the people." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **they sent out spies**  - "the scribes and chief priests sent spies to watch Jesus"
  * **that they might find fault with his speech**  - "they wanted to accuse Jesus of saying something bad"
  * **so as to deliver him up to**  - "in order to bring him to" or "so that they might hand him over to"
  * **to the rule and to the authority of the governor**  - "Rule" and "authority" are two ways of saying the same thing. It can be translated with one or both expressions. The reason for handing Jesus over to the governor can be made explicit: "so that the governor would punish Jesus." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
