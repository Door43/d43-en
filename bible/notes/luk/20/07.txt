===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **And they answered**  - "The chief priests, scribes and elders answered"
  * **they answered that they did not know**  - Some languages may prefer a direct quote. "They said, 'We do not know'" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **where it came from**  - "where John's baptism came from." It can be translated as "where John's authority to baptize came from" or "who authorized John to baptize people."
  * **Neither will I tell you**  - This could be translated as "And I will not tell you" or "Just as you will not tell me, I will not tell you."
