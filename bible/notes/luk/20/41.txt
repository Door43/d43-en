\v 41 Later Jesus said to them, "I will show you that when people say that the Christ is only a descendant of King David, they are wrong!
\v 42 David himself wrote in the book of Psalms about the Christ,
\q God said to my Lord,
\q 'Sit here beside me at my right, where I will highly honor you.
\q
\v 43 Sit here while I completely defeat your enemies.'
\p
\v 44 King David calls the Christ 'my Lord'! So the Christ cannot be just someone descended from King David! What I just said proves that he is much greater than David, isn't that right?"

\v 41 Jesus said to them, "How do they say that the Christ is Davidâ€™s son?
\v 42 For David himself says in the book of Psalms, 
\q The Lord said to my Lord,
\q 'Sit at my right hand,
\q
\v 43 until I make your enemies your footstool.'
\m
\v 44 David therefore calls the Christ 'Lord', so how is he David's son?"

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **How do they say**  - This is a rhetorical question. It can be translated as "Why do they say" or "Let's think about them saying" or "I will talk about them saying." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **David's son**  - "King David's descendant." The word "son" is used here to refer to a descendant. In this case it refers to the one who would reign over God's kingdom.  (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **The Lord said to my Lord**  - This can be translated as "The Lord God said to my Lord" or "God said to my Lord." This is a quotation from Psalm [[:en:bible:notes:psa:110:001|110:1]] which says "Yahweh said to my Lord." But the Jews stopped saying "Yahweh" and often said "Lord" instead.
  * **my Lord**  - David was referring to the Christ as "my Lord."
  * **my right hand**  - The right side is the place of honor. God was honoring the Messiah by saying "Sit at my right hand."
  * **until I make your enemies your footstool**  - This is a metaphor. It can be translated as "until I make your enemies like a footstool for you" or "until I conquer your enemies for you." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **so how is he David's son?**  - "so how can the Christ be David's son?" This is a rhetorical question. It can be translated as "This shows that the Christ is not merely David's descendant."  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
