\v 41 Later Jesus said to them, "I will show you that when people say that the Messiah is only a descendant of King David, they are wrong!
\v 42 David himself wrote in the book of Psalms about the Messiah,
\q God said to my Lord,
\q 'Sit here beside me at my right, where I will highly honor you.
\v 43 Sit here while I completely defeat your enemies.'
\p
\v 44 King David calls the Messiah 'my Lord'! So the Messiah cannot be just someone descended from King David! What I just said proves that he is much greater than David, isn't that right?"

\v 41 And he said to them, "How do they say that the Christ is David’s son?
\v 42 For David himself says in the book of Psalms, 
\q The Lord said to my Lord,
\q 'Sit on my right hand,
\q
\v 43 till I make your enemies your footstool.'
\m
\v 44 David therefore calls him 'Lord', and how is he his son?"
