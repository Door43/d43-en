===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues telling his parable.
  * **treated him shamefully**  - "humiliated him"
  * **wounded him**  - "injured him" 
  * **yet a third**  - "even a third servant." The word "yet" hints at the fact that the landowner should not have had to send the second servant, but he went beyond that and sent a third servant.
