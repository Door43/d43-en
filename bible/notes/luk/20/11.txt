===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Jesus continues his parable)
  * **shamefully**  - That is, "In a manner that causes, or should cause, great embarrassment"
  * **wounded**  - That is, "injured" or "deliberately injured" or "badly injured"
  * **yet a third**  - This could be translated as "even a third servant." The word "yet" hints at the fact that he should not have had to send a second servant, but he went beyond that and sent a third servant.
