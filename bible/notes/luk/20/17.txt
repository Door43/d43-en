===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues to speak to the crowd.

  * **But he looked at them**  - "But Jesus stared at them" or "But he looked straight at them."  He did this to hold them accountable to understand what he was saying. 
  * **What does this scripture mean** - This rhetorical question can also be translated as "Then what was this scripture talking about?" or "You should be able to understand this scripture." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])  
  * **The stone which the builders rejected has been made the cornerstone**  -  This metaphor is a prophecy from Psalm [[:en:bible:notes:psa:118:022|118:22]] about how people would reject the Messiah.  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **The stone which the builders rejected** - "The stone which the builders said was not good enough for building with." In those days people built the walls of houses and other buildings out of stones. 
  * **the cornerstone**  - This was an important stone for making a building stable. It can be translated as "the chief stone" or "the most important stone."
  * **Everyone that falls on that stone** - "Anyone who falls down onto that stone." This metaphor is a prophecy about what will happen to everyone who rejects the Messiah. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **will be broken to pieces** - "will break up into pieces." This is a result of falling onto the stone. 
  * **But on whomever it falls** - "But whomever that stone falls on." This metaphor is a prophecy about the Messiah judging those who reject him. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
