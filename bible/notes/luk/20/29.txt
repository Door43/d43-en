\v 29 There were seven brothers and the first took a wife, and died childless,
\v 30 and the second as well.
\v 31 The third took her, and likewise the seven also left no children, and died.
\v 32 Afterward the woman also died.
\v 33 In the resurrection then, whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as their wife."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The Sadducees finish asking Jesus their question.
  * **General Information:** - The Sadducees tell Jesus a short story in verses 29-32. This is a story they made up as an example. In verse 33, they ask Jesus a question about the story they told.

  * **There were seven brothers** - This may have happened, but it is probably a story that they made up to test Jesus.
  * **the first ... the second ... The third** - "brother number one ... brother number two ... Brother number three" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **and died childless** - "and died without having any children" or "and died, but did not have any children"
  * **the second as well** - They did not repeat many of the details to keep the story short. AT: "the second married her and the same thing happened" or "the second brother married her and died without having any children" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **The third took her** - "The third married her"
  * **likewise the seven also left no children, and died** - They did not repeat many of the details to keep the story short. AT: "in the same way the rest of the seven brothers married her and had no children and died" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **the seven** - "all seven of the brothers" or "each of the seven brothers"
  * **In the resurrection** - "When people are raised from the dead" or "When dead people will become alive again." Some languages have a way of showing that the Sadducees did not believe that there would be a resurrection, such as "In the supposed resurrection" or "When dead people are supposedly raised from the dead."
