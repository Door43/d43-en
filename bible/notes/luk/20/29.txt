\v 29 There were seven brothers and the first took a wife, and died childless,
\v 30 and the second as well. 
\v 31 The third took her, and likewise the seven also left no children, and died.
\v 32 Afterward the woman also died.
\v 33 In the resurrection then, whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as their wife."

===== Translation Notes: =====
The Sadducees continue speaking and tell Jesus a story.
  * **There were seven brothers** - This may have happened, but it is probably a story that they made up to test Jesus.
  * **died childless** - "died without having any children" or "died, but did not have any children"
  * **the second as well** - This can be translated as "the second married her and the same thing happened" or "the second brother married her and died without having any children."
  * **The third took her**  - "the third married her"
  * **likewise the seven also left no children, and died** - This can be translated as "in the same way the rest of the seven brothers married her and had no children and died."
  * **In the resurrection**  - "when people are raised from the dead" or "when dead people will become alive again" (UDB). Some languages have a way of showing that the Sadducees did not believe that there would be a resurrection, such as "In the supposed resurrection" or "When dead people are supposedly raised from the dead."
