\v 34 Jesus said to them, "The sons of this world marry, and are given in marriage.
\v 35 But they who are judged to be worthy to receive the resurrection from the dead and to enter eternity neither marry, nor are given in marriage.
\v 36 Neither can they die anymore, for they are equal to the angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.
