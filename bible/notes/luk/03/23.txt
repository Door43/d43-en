===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Now**  - This word is used here to mark a change from the story to background information about about Jesus’ age and ancestors. It ends after Luke 3:37. If your language has a way of showing that what follows is background information, you should use it here. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **Jesus himself**  - "this Jesus" or "this person Jesus." 
  * **thirty years of age** - AT: "30 years old" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]] and [[en:obe:other:biblicaltimeyear]])
  * **He was the son (as was supposed) of Joseph**  - "He was known as the son of Joseph" or "It was thought that he was the son of Joseph" or "People assumed that he was the son of Joseph"
  * **the son of Heli**  - Some translators may want to start a new sentence with "Joseph was the son of Heli" or "Joseph's father was Heli." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|How to Translate Names]])
  * **the son of Heli, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi…**  - The phrase "the son" is implied information. The text simply says "of Heli, of Matthat, of Levi…" This list could be translated as "who was the son of Heli, who was the son of Matthat, who was the son of Levi…" or "Joseph was the son of Heli, Heli was the son of Matthat, Matthat was the son of Levi" or "Heli's father was Matthat, Matthat's father was Levi…" Consider how people normally list ancestors in your language. You can use the same wording throughout the whole list. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|How to Translate Names]])
