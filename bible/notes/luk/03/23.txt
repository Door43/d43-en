===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **Now Jesus himself** - This phrase introduces a change in the story. From this point on, Jesus will be the main character. If your language has a way to show when the story shifts to a new person, consider using it. 
    * **Jesus himself** - That is, "this Jesus" or "this person Jesus." This is immediately followed by background information about Jesus. If your language has a way of showing that what follows is background information, you should use it here. (See: TA:background Information)
    * **about thirty years of age** - That is, "approximately thirty years old."
    * **He was the son (as was supposed) of Joseph**  - That is, "He was known as the son of Joseph" or "It was thought that he was the son of Joseph" or "People assumed that he was the son of Joseph."
    * **the son of Heli**  - Some translators may want to start a new sentence with "Joseph was the son of Heli" or "Joseph's father was Heli."
    * **the son of Heli, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi...**  - The phrase "the son" is implied information. The text simply says "of Heli, of Matthat, of Levi..." This list could be translated as "who was the son of Heli, who was the son of Matthat, who was the son of Levi..." or "Joseph was the son of Heli, Heli was the son of Matthat, Matthat was the son of Levi" or "Heli's father was Matthat, Matthat's father was Levi..." Consider how people normally list ancestors in your language. You can use the same wording throughout the whole list. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:translatenames|How to Translate Names]])
