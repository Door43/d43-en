===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Luke lists the ancestors of Jesus through the line of his supposed father, Joseph.

  * **When** - This word is used here to mark a change from the story to background information about Jesus' age and ancestors. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **thirty years of age** - "30 years old" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **He was the son (as it was assumed) of Joseph** - "It was thought that he was the son of Joseph" or "People assumed that he was the son of Joseph"
  * **the son of Heli, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi** - Consider how people normally list ancestors in your language. You should use the same wording throughout the whole list. Possible formats are 1) "who was the son of Heli, who was the son of Matthat, who was the son of Levi" or 2) "Joseph was the son of Heli, Heli was the son of Matthat, Matthat was the son of Levi" or 3) "Heli's father was Matthat, Matthat's father was Levi" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
