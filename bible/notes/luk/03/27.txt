===== Translation Notes: =====


    * (This is a continuation of the list of Jesus' ancestors.)
    * **the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa...** - That is, “who was the son of Joanan, who was the son of Rhesa...” or “Joda was the son of Joanan, Joanan was the son of Rhesa...” or “Joda's father was Joanan, Joanan's father was Rhesa...” Use the same wording as you used in the previous verses.
