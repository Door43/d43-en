===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa ... Levi** - This is a continuation of the list of Jesus' ancestors. Use the same format as you used in the previous verses. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **the son of Salathiel** - The name Salathiel may be a different spelling of the name Shealtiel (as some versions have it), but identification is difficult.
