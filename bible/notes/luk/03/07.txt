===== Translation Notes: =====

John speaks to people who have come to him to be baptized.

  * **to be baptized by him** - "for John to baptize them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **You offspring of poisonous snakes** - This is a word picture. Poisonous snakes are dangerous and represent evil. AT: "You evil poisonous snakes!" or "You are evil like poisonous snakes." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **who warned you**  - He wasn't really expecting them to answer. John was rebuking the people because they were asking him to baptize them so that God would not punish them, but they did not want to stop sinning. AT: "You can't flee from God's wrath like this" or "Do you think that you can flee from God's wrath just by being baptized?"  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **from the wrath that is coming** - The word "wrath" is used here to refer to God's punishment because his wrath precedes it. AT: "from the punishment that God is sending" or "from God's wrath on which he is about to act" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
