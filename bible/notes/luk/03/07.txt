===== translationNotes: =====

  * **to be baptized by him** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "for John to baptize them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **You offspring of vipers** - In this metaphor, John compares the crowd to vipers, which were deadly or dangerous snakes and represent evil. AT: "You evil poisonous snakes!" or "People should stay away from you just like they avoid poisonous snakes!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Who warned you ... coming?** - He was not really expecting them to answer. John was rebuking the people because they were asking him to baptize them so that God would not punish them, but they did not want to stop sinning. AT: "You cannot flee from God's wrath like this" or "You cannot escape from God's wrath just by being baptized" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **from the wrath that is coming** - The word "wrath" is used here to refer to God's punishment because his wrath precedes it. AT: "from the punishment that God is sending" or "from God's wrath on which he is about to act" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
