\v 15 People were getting very hopeful that the Messiah might be coming soon, and many of them were wondering if John might be the Messiah.
\v 16 But John replied to them all, "No, I am not. The Messiah is far greater than I am. He is so great that I am not worthy even to untie the straps of his sandals! When I baptized you, I used only water. But when the Messiah comes, he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.

\p
\v 15 Now as the people were eagerly expecting the Christ to come, everyone was wondering in their hearts concerning John whether he might be the Christ.
\v 16 John answered by saying to them all, "As for me, I baptize you with water, but someone is coming who is more powerful than I, and I am not worthy even to untie the strap of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **as the people** - "because the people." This refers to the same people who came to John.
  * **wondering in their hearts** - This expression here means "thinking about them silently" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **John answered by saying** - John's answer about a greater person coming clearly implies that John is not the Christ. It may be helpful to state this clearly for your audience, as the UDB does: "No, I am not" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **I baptize you with water** - "I baptize using water" or "I baptize by means of water"
  * **not worthy even to untie the strap of his sandals** - "not important enough even to loosen the straps of his sandals." Untying the straps of sandals was a duty of a slave. John was saying that the one who would come is so great that John was not even worthy enough to be his slave. 
  * **sandals** - "shoes made with leather" or "flip-flops of leather straps"
  * **He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire** - This metaphor compares literal baptism that brings a person into contact with water to a spiritual baptism that brings them into contact with the Holy Spirit and with fire. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **fire** - Here the word "fire" may refer to 1) judgment or 2) purification. It is preferred to leave it as "fire" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
