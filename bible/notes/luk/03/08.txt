===== Translation Notes: =====

John continues speaking to people who have come to him to be baptized.

  * **Produce fruits that are worthy of repentance** - In this word picture, a person's behavior is compared to fruit. Just as a plant is expected to produce fruit that is appropriate for that kind of plant, a person who says that he has repented is expected to live righteously.  AT: "Produce the kind of fruit that shows that you have repented" or "Do the good things that show that you have turned away from your sin."  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **saying within yourselves** - "saying to yourselves" or "thinking"
  * **We have Abraham for our father** - "Abraham is our ancestor" or "We are Abraham's descendants." If it is unclear why they would say this, you may also add the implied information: "So God won't punish us."
