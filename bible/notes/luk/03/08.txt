\v 8 Do the deeds that are appropriate for people who have truly turned from their sinful behavior! \add God promised to give Abraham many\add* descendants.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * (John continues speaking to the crowds.)
    * **produce fruits that come from repentance**  - This could also be translated as "Produce the kind of fruit that shows that you have repented" or "Do the good things that show that you have turned away from your sin." In this metaphor a person's behavior is compared to fruit. Just as a plant is expected to produce fruit that is appropriate for that kind of plant, a person who says that he has repented from his sin is expected to live righteously.  (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor|Metaphor]])
    * **saying within yourselves**  - "saying to yourselves" or "saying in your heart" or "thinking"
    * **We have Abraham for our father**  - That is, "Abraham is our ancestor" or "We are Abraham's descendants." If it is unclear why they would say this, you may also add the implied information "So God won't punish us."
