  * **Every valley will be filled ... every mountain and hill will be made low** - When people prepare the road for an important person who is coming, they cut down the high places and fill in the low places so that the road will be level.

  * **Every valley will be filled** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "They will fill in every low place in the road" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **every mountain and hill will be made low** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "they will level every mountain and hill" or "they will remove every high place in the road" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **see the salvation of God** - This can be stated as an action. AT: "learn how God saves people from sin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
