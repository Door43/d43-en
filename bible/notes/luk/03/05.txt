  * **Connecting Statement** - The quote from Isaiah's prophecy about John continues.

  * **Every valley will be filled** - When people prepare the road for an important person who is coming, they fill in the low places with dirt so that the road will be level. This is part of the metaphor started in the previous verse. AT: "They will fill in every low place in the road." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **every mountain and hill will be made level** - AT: "they will level every mountain and hill" or "they will remove every high place in the the road" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
