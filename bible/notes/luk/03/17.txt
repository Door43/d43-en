===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (John continues teaching about the Christ.)
  * **His winnowing fork is in his hand**  - This can also be translated as "He is holding a winnowing fork because he is ready." This metaphor compares how the Christ will separate the righteous people from the unrighteous people to how a man separates wheat grain from chaff. It can also be translated as a simile to make the connection more clear: "The Christ is like a man whose winnowing fork is in his hand."(See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor|metaphor]], [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:simile|simile]])
  * **winnowing fork**  - This is a tool for tossing wheat up into the air to separate the wheat grain from the chaff. The heavier grain falls back down and the unwanted chaff is blown away by the wind. It is similar to a pitchfork.
  * **his threshing floor**  - This is a place where people separate the grain from the chaff. This can also be translated as "his ground" or "the ground where he separates the grain from the chaff."
  * **and to gather the wheat**  - This could also be translated as "Then he will gather the wheat."
  * **storehouse**  - This is where the grain is kept safe in order to be used later. It can also be translated as "barn" or "granary."
  * **burn up the chaff**  - The chaff is not useful for anything, so people burn it up.
