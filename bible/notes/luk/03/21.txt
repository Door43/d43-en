===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Now it came about**  - This phrase is used here to mark the beginning of a new part of the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **while all the people were being baptized by John**  - The phrase "all the people" refers to the people present with John. This could be translated as "while John was baptizing all the people." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Jesus also was baptized by John**  - This could be translated as "John baptized Jesus, too." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the heavens opened up**  - "the sky opened" or "the sky became open." This is more than a simple clearing of clouds, but it's not clear what it means. It possibly means that a hole appeared in the sky.
  * **the Holy Spirit came down on him**  - "the Holy Spirit came down onto Jesus"
  * **in bodily form like a dove**  - "in physical form looking like a dove"
