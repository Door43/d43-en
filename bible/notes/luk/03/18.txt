\v 18 In many different ways like this, John urged the people to repent and turn back to God, as he kept telling them the good message from God.
\v 19 He also rebuked King Herod for marrying his brother's wife, Herodias, while his brother was still alive, and for doing many other evil things.
\v 20 Then Herod had his soldiers put John in prison, which was another very evil thing.

\v 18 With many other exhortations also, John preached good news to the people. 
\v 19 When Herod the tetrarch had been reproved for marrying his brother's wife, Herodias, and for all the other evil things that Herod had done, 
\v 20 he added this to his crimes: he locked John up in prison.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The story tells what is going to happen to John but has not happened at this time. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])

  * **With many other exhortations** - "With many other strong urgings"
  * **Herod the tetrarch** - Herod was a tetrarch, not a king. He had only limited rule over the region of Galilee.
  * **for marrying his brother's wife, Herodias** - "because Herod married Herodias, his own brother's wife." This was evil because Herod's brother was still alive. This can be stated clearly. AT: "because he married his brother's wife, Herodias, while his brother was still alive" See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **he locked John up in prison** - "he told his soldiers to put John in jail"
