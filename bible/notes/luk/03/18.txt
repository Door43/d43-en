===== Translation Notes: =====

John continues his ministry until he is put in prison by Herod.

  * **With many other exhortations** - "With many other strong urgings"
  * **rebuked Herod the tetrarch** - "reproached Herod the tetrarch" or AT: "told Herod the tetrarch that he had sinned." Herod was a tetrarch, not a king. He had only limited rule over the region of Galilee.
  * **for marrying his brother's wife** - "because Herod married his own brother's wife"
  * **He had John locked up in prison** - "He told his soldiers to put John in jail"
