===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Crying** - "Shouting"
  * **into your hands I commit my spirit** - AT: "I entrust my spirit to your care" or "I give my spirit to you, knowing you will care for it." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Crying with a loud voice, Jesus said, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit."** - God the Father had to send God the Son to the cross to die as the ultimate sacrifice for the sins of humanity. But, the Son still loves the Father and trusts his life to his Father. The words "Father" and "Son" must be translated literally to accurately show who God is in the original Scriptures. 
  * **Having said this** - "After Jesus said this"
  * **he died** - "Jesus died"
  * **what was done** - "what had happened"
