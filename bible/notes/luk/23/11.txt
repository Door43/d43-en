===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **clothed him in beautiful clothing**  - The translation should not imply that this was done to honor or care for Jesus. They did it to mock Jesus and to make fun of him.
  * **And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day.**  - The implied information is that they became friends because Herod appreciated Pilate allowing him to judge Jesus. You could make this explicit: "And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day because Pilate had sent Jesus to Herod for judgment." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Before**  - "Before that day"
