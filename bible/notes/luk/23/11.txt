===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Herod with his soldiers** - "Herod and his soldiers"
  * **dressed him in elegant clothing** - "put beautiful clothes on him." The translation should not imply that this was done to honor or care for Jesus. They did it to mock Jesus and to make fun of him.
  * **Herod and Pilate had become friends with each other that very day** - The implied information is that they became friends because Herod appreciated Pilate allowing him to judge Jesus. AT: "Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day because Pilate had sent Jesus to Herod for judgment" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **before this they had been enemies with each other** - This information is enclosed in parentheses to show that it is background information. Use a format that your audience would understand. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
