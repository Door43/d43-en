\v 16-17 So I will \add have my soldiers\add* whip him and then release him."\f + Pilate had to release one prisoner for the people during the Passover festival each year."\f*
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 Even Herod does not think he is guilty, because he sent him back to me without punishing him. So it is clear that this man does not deserve to die.
\v 16 So I will tell my soldiers to whip him and then set him free."
\v 17 (Pilate said this because he had to set free one prisoner at the Passover feast).

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 No, nor does Herod, for he sent him back to us, and behold, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.
\v 16 I will therefore punish him, and release him."
\v 17 Now Pilate was obligated to release to the Jews one prisoner at the feast.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **No, nor does Herod**  - "Even Herod does not think he is guilty" (UDB)
  * for - "because" or "we know this
  * **behold**  - The word “behold” here alerts us pay attention to the important statement that follows.
  * **nothing worthy of death has been done by him**  - This can be translated in active voice: "He has not done anything to deserve a death sentence." (See: [[:en:ta:vocabulary:active|Active or Passive]])
  * **I will therefore punish him**  - Because Pilate had found no fault in Jesus he should have released him without punishment. It is not necessary to try to make this statement fit logically into the translation. Pilate punished Jesus, whom he knew to be innocent, only because he was afraid of the crowd.
  * **he was obligated to release to them one prisoner**  - Pilate was required to do this by political custom. This implied information can be stated explicitly: "he was obligated by custom to release to them one prisoner." (See: [[:en:ta:vocabulary:implicitexplicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]])
  * **bold words**  - explanation
