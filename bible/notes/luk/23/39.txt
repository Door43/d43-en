\v 39 One of the criminals who was hanging on a cross also insulted Jesus; he said, "You are the Messiah, are you not? So save yourself, and save us too!"
\v 40 But the other criminal stopped him from speaking; he said, "You should be afraid of God punishing you! They are punishing him and us in the same way.
\v 41 We two deserve to die. They are punishing us as we deserve for the evil things that we did. But this man has done nothing wrong!"

\v 39 One of the criminals who was crucified, insulted him, saying, "Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us."
\v 40 But the other answered, rebuking him said, "Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence?
\v 41 We indeed are here justly, for we are receiving what we deserve for our deeds. But this man did nothing wrong."
