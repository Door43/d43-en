===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **hear this** - "heard that Jesus began to teach in Galilee"
    * **the man**  - This refers to Jesus.
    * **he was under Herod's authority**  - The passage does not state the implied fact that Herod was the ruler of Galilee. You could make this information explicit: "he was under the authority of Herod because ruled over Galilee." (See: [[:en:ta:vocabulary:implicitexplicit]])
    * **in those days**  - This could be translated as "during the Passover Feast."
    * **bold words**  - explanation
