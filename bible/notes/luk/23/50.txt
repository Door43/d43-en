\v 50-51 Now there was a man named Joseph from Arimathea, a Jewish town. He was a good and a righteous man, and he was a member of the Jewish council. He saw everything happen, but he had not agreed with the other Council members when they decided to kill Jesus and when they did it it. He was waiting eagerly for the time when God would send his king to begin to rule.

===== translationNotes: ===== 

  * **General Information:** - This is the next part of the story. Joseph asks Pilate for Jesus' body. These verses give us background information about who Joseph is. It may be helpful to reorder some of this information with a verse bridge as the UDB does. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_versebridge]])

  * **Behold, there was a man** - The word "behold" alerts us to a new person in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this. AT: "There was a man who was" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_participants]])
  * **the Council** - "the Jewish Council"
  * **a good and righteous man** - This can be translated as a new sentence. AT: "He was a good and righteous man"
  * **with the decision of the Council and their action** - What the decision was can be stated clearly. AT: "with the Council's decision to kill Jesus and their action" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **the Judean town of Arimathea** - Here "Judean town" means it was located in Judea. AT: "the town called Arimathea, which is in Judea" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
