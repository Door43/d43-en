====== Level 2 Checking (Language Community) ======

Level 2 checking will be done by a wider group of people from the language community. It is assumed that the checkers will be native speakers of the language. The purpose of this level of checking is to verify that a larger group of the target population agrees that the translation is a good one.

The primary topics that this level of checking should cover are:

  * The translator faithfully followed the notes during the translation process
  * The translation clearly and accurately communicates the meaning of the original text as described in the notes
  * The language of the translation is natural for the language group
  * The translation includes all the text of the book that was translated
  * The translation is written at an appropriate level and style for the audience
  * The alphabet and spelling used in the book are appropriate for the audience

Each of these topics are important, and will be further developed below.

One way to determine if the text is clear and accurate is to do a community check using the Comprehensive Questions for the book. Use the link below for an explanation of how to perform this check.
