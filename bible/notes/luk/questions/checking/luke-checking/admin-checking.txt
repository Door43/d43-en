====== Admin Page for Checking ======

This is the "working page" to organize and develop Checking resources. This page will not be visible to the end-users.

Andy's initial comments about Checking are here: [[:en:bible:notes:luk:questions:checking:luke-checking|Luke Checking Questions]]

We are developing the Checking resources to parallel the three levels of approval for UnfoldingWord.
==== Level 1 Checking ====

Level 1 checking will be done by the translator or translation group. The purpose of this level is to verify that:

  - the translation was done according to the translation notes
  - the translator tested the translation with other local speakers of the language

Level 1 Checking is explained here:  [[:en:bible:notes:luk:questions:checking:luke-checking:level1:level1|Level 1 Checking]]


==== Level 2 Checking ====




==== Level 3 Checking ====
