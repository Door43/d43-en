====== Admin Page for Checking ======

This is the "working page" to organize and develop Checking resources. This page will not be visible to the end-users.

We are developing the Checking resources to parallel the three levels of approval for UnfoldingWord.

==== Level 1 Checking ====

Level 1 checking will be done by the translator or translation group. The purpose of this level is to verify that:

  - the translation was done according to the translation notes
  - the translator tested the translation with other local speakers of the langauge




==== Level 2 Checking ====




==== Level 3 Checking ====
