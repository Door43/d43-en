===== Level 1 Checking (Translator) =====

Level 1 checking will be done by the translator or translation group. It is assumed that they will be native speakers of or fluent in the language. The purpose of this level is to verify that:

  * the translation was done according to the notes
  * the translator tested the translation with other local speakers of the language

=== Notes ===

The notes consists of:

  * Introductory materials for each book
  * Translation Notes for each chunk of verses
  * Important Terms pages for significant words or phrases
  * Translation Academy links to explain translation principles

The notes contain a wealth of information about every verse in the book. In order to achieve a Level 1, translators must verify that they read the notes and to the best of their ability, used the notes to guide the way they translated the book. 


=== Comprehension Questions ===

Comprehension questions have been developed for each chapter of a book. The purpose of these questions is to test whether the translation is clear and accurately conveys the meaning of the verses. 

When each portion of the translation is ready, it should be presented to local speakers of the language for them to hear or read. Next, the translators should ask the comprehension questions for that portion of the book to the audience. This will allow the translators to determine if the meaning of the translation was correctly understood.
