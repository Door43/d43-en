\v 28 When he saw Jesus, the man cried out, lay face down before him, and said with a loud voice, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God?  I beg you, do not torment me!"
\v 29 The man said this because Jesus had just commanded the evil spirit to come out of him. Although the man had been bound with chains on his wrists and ankles while people guarded him, many times the evil spirit would suddenly seize him by force. Then the man would break the chains and the demon would make him go out into deserted places.

\v 28 When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him. With a loud voice he said, "What do I have to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me."
\v 29 For Jesus was commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man, because many times it had seized him. Even though he was bound with chains and shackles and kept under guard, he would break the bonds apart and be driven by the demon into the wilderness.
