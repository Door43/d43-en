Then he would be sent away by the demons \f + \ft Or:the demons would send him away \f* to the desolate area.
\p When Jesus stepped out of the boat onto the shore, the man saw him. He \add ran to Jesus\add* and prostrated himself before him. Then Jesus commanded, "You evil spirit, come out of that man!" But it \add did not leave immediately. Instead, it\add* caused the man to shout very loudly, "Jesus, Son of the great God in heaven, since we\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* have nothing in common, \add leave me alone\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*! I beg you, do not torture me \add now\add*!"

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 29 The man said this because Jesus had just commanded the evil spirit to come out of him. Although the man had been bound with chains on his wrists and ankles while people guarded him, many times the evil spirit would suddenly seize him by force. Then the man would break the chains and the demon would make him go out into deserted places.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 And when he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, "What do I have to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me."
\v 29 For Jesus was commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man, because many times it had seized him. And even though he was bound with chains and shackles, and kept under guard, he would break the bonds apart and be driven by the demon into the wilderness.
