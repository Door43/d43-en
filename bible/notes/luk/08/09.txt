\v 9 Then Jesus' disciples asked him to tell them the meaning of the story.
\v 10 And he said, "To you has been granted the privilege of knowing the hidden things about how God will rule as king. But I speak to everyone else only in parables, so that,
\q 'Although they see, they may not perceive, and although they hear, they may not understand.'

\v 9 Then his disciples asked him what this parable might mean. 
\v 10 Jesus said to them, "You have been given the privilege of understanding the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but the rest of the people will only be taught with parables, so that 'seeing they will not really see, and hearing they will not really understand.'

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **You have been given the privilege of understanding**  - This can be translated with an active verb and the implied information that God is the giver. "God has given you the gift of understanding" or "God has made you able to understand." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]], [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the mysteries of the kingdom of God**  - These are truths that had been kept hidden but Jesus was revealing them.
  * **seeing they will not really see**  - "though they see, they will not perceive." If the verbs require an object, this could be translated as "though they see things, they will not understand them" or "though they see things happen, they will not understand what they mean." (See: the section about Verbs and Objects on [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_verbs]])
  * **hearing they will not really understand**  - "though they hear, they will not understand." If the verbs require an object it could be translated as "though they hear instruction, they will not understand the truth." (See: the section about Verbs and Objects on [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_verbs]])
