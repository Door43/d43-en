  * **desiring to see you**  - "waiting to see you" or "and they want to see you"
  * **My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God, and obey it.** - This metaphor can be translated as a simile: "Those who hear the word of God and obey it are like a mother and brothers to me" or "Those who hear the word of God and obey it are as important to me as my mother and brothers."
