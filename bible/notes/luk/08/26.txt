\v 27 After Jesus stepped out of the boat onto the land, he was met by a certain man from the town in that area. This man had demons in him.  For a long time this man had not worn clothes and did not live in a house. Instead, he lived in the burial caves.

===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **region of the Gerasenes**  - Gerasenes were people from the city called Gerasa. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **opposite Galilee**  -  "on the other side of the lack from Galilee"
  * **a certain man from the city**  - "a man from the city of Gerasa" 
  * **had demons**  - "he was controlled by demons"
  * **he had worn no clothes**  - "he had not worn clothes"
  * **tombs**  - These are places where people put dead bodies, possibly caves.  The fact that the man was living in them indicates that these were not holes dug down in the ground.
