\v 41 Just then a man named Jairus, who was one of the leaders of the synagogue there, came near to Jesus and prostrated himself at his feet. He pleaded with Jesus to come to his house,
\v 42 because his only daughter, who was about twelve years old, was dying and he wanted Jesus to heal her.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the crowd welcomed him** - This could be translated as "the crowd joyfully greeted him."
  * **And behold, there came a man named Jairus**  - The word "behold" alerts us to Jairus as a new person in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this. English uses "There was a man who was named Jairus.” (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **one of the leaders of the synagogue**  - "one of the leaders at the local synagogue" or "a leader of the people who met at the synagogue in that area"
  * **fell down at Jesus' feet**  -  1) “bowed down at Jesus feet” or 2) “lay down on the ground at Jesus feet.” Jairus did not fall accidentally. He did this as a sign of humility and respect for Jesus.
  * **she was dying**  - "she was about to die" or "she was near death"
  * **But as he was going** - Some translators may need to first say "So Jesus agreed to go with the man." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the crowds of people were pressing against him**  - "the people were crowding tightly around Jesus"  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
