===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the crowds of people ... are pressing in against you** - By saying this, Peter was implying that anyone could have touched Jesus. This implicit information can be made explicit if necessary. AT: "there are many people crowding around you and pressing in against you, so any one of them might have touched you!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Someone did touch me** - It may be helpful to distinguish this intentional "touch" from the accidental touches of the crowd. AT: "I know that someone deliberately touched me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **I know that power has gone out from me** - Jesus did not lose power or become weak, but his power healed the woman. AT: "I know that healing power went out from me" or "I felt my power heal someone" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
