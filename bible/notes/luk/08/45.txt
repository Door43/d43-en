===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Master**  - The Greek word that is translated here as “Master” is a not the normal word for “Master.” This one refers to someone who has authority, and not to  someone who owns someone else. You could also translate it as "Boss" or "Foreman" or with a word that is commonly used to address a person in authority, such as “Sir.”
    * **the crowds of people are pressing in on you and crowding you** - By saying this, Peter was saying that anyone could have touched Jesus. This can be made explicit if necessary as in the UDB. (See [[en:ta:vocabulary:implicitexplicit]])
    * **I know that power was going out from me** - "I felt power go out from me" or "power has gone out of me to heal that person" (UDB). Jesus did not lose power or become weak, but his power healed the woman.
