===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus is still on the way to heal Jairus' daughter.

  * **Master**  - The word that is translated here as "Master" is a not the normal word for "Master." This one refers to someone who has authority, and not to  someone who owns someone else. AT: "Boss" or "Foreman" or with a word that is commonly used to address a person in authority, such as "Sir."
  * **the crowds of people are pressing in on you and crowding you** - By saying this, Peter was implying that anyone could have touched Jesus. This implicit information can be made explicit if necessary as in the UDB. (See [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **I knew that power was going out from me** - "I felt healing power go out from me." Jesus did not lose power or become weak, but his power healed the woman.
