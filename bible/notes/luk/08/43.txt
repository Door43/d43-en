===== translationNotes: =====

  * **A woman was there** - This introduces a new character in the story. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_participants]])
  * **had been bleeding** - "had a flow of blood." She was probably bleeding from her womb even when it was not the normal time for it. Some cultures may have a polite way of referring to this condition. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **but could not be healed by any of them** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "but none of them could cure her" or "but none of them could heal her" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **touched the edge of his garment** - "touched the fringe of his robe." Jewish men wore tassels on the edges of their robes as a part of their ceremonial dress as commanded in God's Law. This is likely what she touched.
