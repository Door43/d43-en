===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **had been bleeding**  - She was probably bleeding from her womb even when it was not the normal time for it. Some cultures may have a polite way of referring to this condition. (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:euphemism]])
    * **but could not be healed by any of them**  - "but none of them could cure her"
    * **touched the border of his garment**  - That is, "brushed the fringe of his robe" or "lightly brushed his clothes." Jewish men wore tassels on the edges of their robes as a part of their ceremonial dress, as commanded in God's Law. This is likely what she touched lightly.
