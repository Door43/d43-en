===== Translation Notes: =====
This event happens on the way to heal Jairus' daughter.

  * **had been bleeding**  - "had a flow of blood." She was probably bleeding from her womb even when it was not the normal time for it. Some cultures may have a polite way of referring to this condition. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **but could not be healed by any of them**  - "but none of them could cure her"
  * **touched the border of his garment**  - "touched the fringe of his robe." Jewish men wore tassels on the edges of their robes as a part of their ceremonial dress, as commanded in God's Law. This is likely what she touched.
