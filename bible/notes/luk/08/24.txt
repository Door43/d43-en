\v 24 So Jesus' disciples came to him and woke him up. They said to him, "Master! Master! We are going to die!" He then woke up and commanded the wind and the violent waves to be still and they became still. Everything became calm.
\v 25 Then he said to them, "Why is your faith so weak?" The disciples were alarmed and amazed because of what had just happened. They kept saying to one another, "Who is this, that he is able to command even the winds and the water, and they obey him?"

\v 24 Then Jesus' disciples came over to him and woke him up, saying, "Master, master, we are about to die!" And he awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water; and they ceased, and there was a calm.
\v 25 Then he said to them, "Where is your faith?" And being afraid they were very amazed, saying one to another, "Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?"

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Master**  - This refers to someone who has been put in charge over a group of people, and not someone who owns someone else. It is a different word than is usually translated as "Master" and does not have the same level of authority. You may want to translate it as "Boss" or "Foreman."
  * **rebuked**  - That is, "spoke sharply to."
  * **raging of the water**  -
  * **there was a calm**  - That is, "everything was calm" or "everything calmed."
  * **and being afraid they were very amazed**  - You might say "and while they were afraid, they were also amazed." The idea here is that they were scared and in a state of amazed admiration at the same time.
  * **saying to one another**  - That is, "they said to one another" or "they said among themselves."
