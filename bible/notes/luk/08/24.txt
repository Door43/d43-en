\v 24 So Jesus' disciples came to him and woke him up. They said to him, "Master! Master! We are going to die!" He then woke up and commanded the wind and the violent waves to be still and they became still. Everything became calm.
\v 25 Then he said to them, "Why is your faith so weak?" The disciples were alarmed and amazed because of what had just happened. They kept saying to one another, "Who is this, that he is able to command even the winds and the water, and they obey him?"

\v 24 Then Jesus' disciples came over to him and woke him up, saying, "Master! Master! We are about to die!" He awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and there was a calm.
\v 25 Then he said to them, "Where is your faith?" and they were afraid. While they were afraid they were also amazed, and they asked one another, "Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?"
