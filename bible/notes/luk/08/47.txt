    * **in the presence**  - That is, "in the sight of" or "in the hearing of" or "before."
    * **falling down before Jesus** - Possible meanings are 1) “she bowed down in front of Jesus” or 2) “she lay down on the ground at Jesus feet” or 3) “she knelt down before Jesus.” She did not fall accidentally. She did this as a sign of humility and respect for Jesus.
    * **Daughter**  - This was a kind way of speaking to a woman. Your language may have another way of showing this kindness.

    * **go in peace**  - This is a way of saying “good-bye” and giving a blessing at the same time. It can be translated as “As you go, be peaceful” or “May God give you peace as you go” (UDB).
