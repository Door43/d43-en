\v 11 So this is the meaning of that parable: The seeds \add represent\add* God's message.
\v 12 \add Some people are like\add* the path on which some of \add the seeds fell\add*. When these people hear God's message, the devil comes and causes them to forget what they have heard. As a result, they do not believe it and will not be saved \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* will not save them \f*.
\v 13 \add Some people are like\add* the \add soil with\add* rock \add underneath\add*. When they hear \add God's\add* message, they accept it joyfully. \add But because it does not penetrate deeply\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add into their inner beings\add*, they believe it for \add only\add* a \add short\add* time. \add They are like the plants that\add* did not have \add deep\add* roots. When difficult things happen to them, they stop believing \add God's message\add*.

\v 11 Now, this is what the story means: The seeds represent God's word.
\v 12 The seeds that fell on the pathway show what happens when people hear God's word, but afterwards the devil comes and takes that word away from their minds and hearts. As a result, they do not believe it and are not saved.
\v 13 The seeds that fell on the rocky ground show what happens when people hear God's word and receive it joyfully, but they do not have deep roots. As a result, they only believe for a short time. As soon as difficult things happen to them, they stop believing God's word.

\v 11 Now this is the meaning of the parable: the seed is the word of God.
\v 12 The ones along the path are those who have heard, but then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so they may not believe and be saved.
\v 13 And the ones on the rock are the those who, when they hear the word, receive it with joy. But they have no root; they believe for a while, and in a time of testing they fall away.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus begins to explain the meaning of the parable of the soils to his disciples.

  * **The seed is the word of God** - Jesus clearly states what the seed represents in the parable. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]])
  * **The seeds that fell beside the road are people who** - This brief explanation assumes the reader knows the seed is the word of God. It may be necessary to add information to clarify this. AT: "The seeds that fell on the pathway show what happens when people" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart** - This means that he causes them to forget the word of God that they have heard.
  * **takes away** - In the parable this was a metaphor of a bird snatching away the seeds. Try to use words in your language that keep that image. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **so that they may not believe and be saved** - Since this is the devil's purpose, it can be translated as: AT: "because the devil thinks, 'They must not believe and they must not be saved'" or "so they will not believe with the result that God saves them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the ones that fell on the rocky ground are people who** - This brief explanation assumes the reader knows the seed is the word of God. It may be necessary to add information to clarify this.

  * **during a time of testing** - "when they experience hardship"
