===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continued on to Jairus' house despite hearing that his daughter was dead.

    * **Then when he came to the house, he**  - Because Jesus did not go alone to the house, it can be translated as "Then when they came to the house, Jesus."
    * **except Peter, John and James, and the father of the girl and her mother** - "He only allowed Peter, John and James, and the girl's father  and mother to go inside"
    * **all the people there were mourning and wailing for her**  - "all the people were showing how sad they were and crying loudly because the girl had died"
