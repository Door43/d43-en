\v 7 Some of the seeds fell on ground that contained seeds of thorn plants. The thorn plants grew up together with the young grain plants and crowded them out so that they could not grow.
\v 8 But some of the grain seeds fell on fertile soil, and grew so well that they produced a crop that had a hundred times as many seeds." After saying these things, Jesus called out to them, "All of you should think carefully about what you just heard me say!"

\v 7 And some fell among thorn, and the thorn grew up together with the seed and choked it.
\v 8 But some fell on good soil and produced a crop that was a hundred times greater." After Jesus had said these things, he called out, "Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus finishes telling the parable to the crowd.

  * **choked them** - The thorn plants took all the nutrients, water, and sunlight, so the farmer's plants could not grow well.
  * **produced a crop** - "grew a harvest" or "grew more seeds"
  * **a hundred times greater** - This means a hundred times more than the seeds that were sown. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear** - It may be more natural in some languages to use the second person: "You who have ears to hear, hear" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]]) 
  * **Whoever has ears to hear** - Possible meanings are 1) "Everyone" since everyone has ears or 2) "Whoever has the ability to understand" which refers to those who are willing to listen to God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]) 
  * **let him hear** - "he should listen well" or "he should pay attention to what I say"
