\v 7 Some of the seeds fell on ground that contained seeds of thorn plants. The thorn plants grew up together with the young grain plants and crowded them out so that they could not grow.
\v 8 But some of the grain seeds fell on fertile soil, and grew so well that they produced a crop that had a hundred times as many seeds." After saying these things, Jesus called out to them, "All of you should think carefully about what you just heard me say!"

\v 7 Still other seeds fell among thorn plants, and the thorn plants grew up together with the seeds and choked them.
\v 8 But some of the seeds fell on good soil, and grew into healthy plants, which produced a crop that was a hundred times greater." After Jesus had said these things, he called out, "Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear."

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * (Jesus continues telling his parable.)
    * **choked them**  - The thorn plants took all the nutrients, water, and sunlight, so the farmer's plants could not grow well.
    * **produced a crop**  - "grew a harvest" or "grew more seeds." The crop is the part of the plant the farmer wants.
    * **Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear** - It may be more natural in some languages to use the second person: "You who have ears to hear, hear." (See: talink 123 Person).
    * **Whoever has ears to hear**  - "Whoever can hear" or "Whoever hears me"
    * **let him hear**  -  "let him listen well" or "let him pay attention to what I say"
