\v 1 Many people have attempted to write accounts concerning those things which have been fulfilled among us. 
\v 2 Those who were eyewitnesses from the beginning and had become servants of the word reported them to us. 
\v 3 So, it seemed good to me also, having investigated everything accurately from the beginning, to write it down for you in order, most excellent Theophilus. 
\v 4 I want you to know the certainty of the things that you were taught. \b 
\p 
\v 5 In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a certain priest named Zechariah, from the division of Abijah. His wife was from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. 
\v 6 And they were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and requirements of the Lord. 
\v 7 And they did not have any children, because Elizabeth was barren, and they both were very old. 
\p
\v 8 One day while Zechariah was performing his duties as a priest before God in the order of his priestly group,
\v 9 the priests followed their custom and chose him by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense.
\v 10 And the whole assembly of the people were praying outside the temple when it was time to burn the incense.
\v 11 And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.
\v 12 Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and became very afraid.
\v 13 But the angel said to him, "Do not be afraid, Zechariah, because your prayer has been heard. Your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you will name him John. 
\v 14 And you will have joy and gladness; and many people will rejoice at his birth.
\v 15 For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he will drink no wine nor strong drink. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even while in his mother’s womb. 
\v 16 And he will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God.
\v 17 And he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah. He will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and cause the disobedient to walk according to the wisdom of the just. He will do this in order to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.
\p
\v 18 And Zechariah said to the angel, "How will I know this will happen? For I am an old man, and my wife also is very old."
\v 19 And the angel answered him, "I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to
you, and to bring you this good news. 
\v 20 And indeed, you will be silent and not able to speak, until the day when these things happen, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in the proper time."
\v 21 Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple.
\v 22 When he came out, he could not speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple. He made signs to them, but remained unable to speak.
\v 23 And when his time of service was fulfilled, he went back to his house.
\p
\v 24 After this, Elisabeth his wife conceived. She hid herself for five months, saying,
\v 25 "This is what the Lord has done to me. He watched over me, to take away my disgrace among other people."
\p
\v 26 Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,
\v 27 to a virgin who was engaged to a man named Joseph. He was a descendant of David, and the virgin’s name was Mary.
\v 28 And he came to her, and said, "Greetings, highly favored one! God is with you!"
\v 29 But she was very troubled by his words, and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.
\v 30 The angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.
\v 31 Indeed, you will become pregnant in your womb, and give birth to a son, and will call his name, 'Jesus.'
\v 32 He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father, David.
\v 33 He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and there will be no end to his kingdom.
\v 34 And Mary said to the angel, "How can this happen, since I am a virgin?"
\v 35 The angel answered her, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore, also the holy one who will be born will be called the Son of God.
\v 36 "And listen, Elizabeth your relative also has conceived a son in her old age; and she who was called barren is in her sixth month of pregnancy.
\v 37 For nothing is impossible for God."
\v 38 And Mary said, "Indeed, I am the Lord's servant. May it happen to me according to your word." And the angel left her.
\p
\v 39 Sometime in those days Mary started out and hurried to the hill country, to a city of Judah.
\v 40 When she arrived, she went into Zechariah's house and greeted Elizabeth.
\v 41 When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby in her womb leaped; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
\v 42 And she raised her voice with a loud exclamation, and said, "You are blessed among women, and the fruit of your womb is blessed.
\v 43 How is it that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
\v 44 For when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.
\v 45 She who has believed is blessed, for the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord will be fulfilled."
\v 46 And Mary said,\q My soul magnifies the Lord,
\q \v 47 And my spirit rejoices in God my Savior.
\q 
\v 48 For he has paid attention to the lowly position of his servant: 
\q From now on all generations will call me blessed. 
\q 
\v 49 For the Mighty One has done great things for me; 
\q And his name is holy.
\q 
\v 50 And his mercy continues from generation to generation
\q  To those who fear him.
\q 
\v 51 He has showed strength with his arm; 
\q He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their heart.
\q 
\v 52 He has pulled down powerful rulers from their thrones, 
\q and has raised up lowly people.
\q 
\v 53  He has given good things to hungry people; 
\q and has sent away rich people without anything.
\q
\v 54 He has given help to Israel his servant,
\q That he might remember mercy
\q
\v 55 (As he spoke to our fathers)
\q Toward Abraham and his seed for ever.
\p
\v 56 And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her house.
\p
\v 57 Now Elisabeth’s time was fulfilled that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.
\v 58 And her neighbors and her kinsfolk heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her; and they rejoiced with her.
\v 59 And it came to pass on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him Zacharias,
after the name of his father.
\v 60 And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.
\v 61 And they said to her, There is none of your kindred that is called by this name.
\v 62 And they made signs to his father, what he would have him called.
\v 63 And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marveled all.
\v 64 And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue \add loosed\add*, and he spake, blessing God.
\v 65 And fear came on all that lived round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill
country of Judaea.
\v 66 And all that heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, What then shall this child be? For the hand of the Lord was
with him.
\p
\v 67 And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,
\q
\v 68 Blessed \add be\add* the Lord, the God of Israel;
\q For he has visited and wrought redemption for his people,
\q
\v 69 And has raised up a horn of salvation for us
\q In the house of his servant David
\q
\v 70 (As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets that have been from of old),
\q
\v 71 Salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;
\q
\v 72 To show mercy towards our fathers,
\q And to remember his holy covenant;
\q
\v 73 The oath which he sware to Abraham our father,
\q
\v 74 To grant to us that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies
\q Should serve him without fear,
\q
\v 75 In holiness and righteousness before him all our days.
\q
\v 76 Yes and thou, child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High:
\q For you shall go before the face of the Lord to make ready his ways;
\q
\v 77 To give knowledge of salvation to his people
\q In the remission of their sins,
\q
\v 78 Because of the tender mercy of our God,
\q Whereby the dayspring from on high shall visit us,
\q
\v 79 To shine upon them that sit in darkness and the shadow of death;
\q To guide our feet into the way of peace.
\p
\v 80 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his showing to Israel.

\p
\v 1 Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to draw up a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us,
\v 2 even as they delivered them to us, who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word,
\v 3 it seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write to you in order,
most excellent Theophilus;
\v 4 that you might know the certainty concerning the things wherein you was instructed.
\b
\p
\v 5 There was in the days of Herod, king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abijah: and he had a
wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.
\v 6 And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.
\v 7 And they had no child, because that Elizabeth was barren, and they both were
\add now\add* well stricken in years.
\p
\v 8 Now it came to pass, while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his course,
\v 9 according to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.
\v 10 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the hour of incense.
\v 11 And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
\v 12 And Zechariah was troubled when he saw \add him\add*, and fear fell upon him.
\v 13 But the angel said to him, Fear not, Zacharias: because your supplication is heard, and your wife Elizabeth shall bear
you a son, and you shall call his name John.
\v 14 And you shall have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.
\v 15 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with
the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb.
\v 16 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.
\v 17 And he shall go before his face in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and
the disobedient \add to walk\add* in the wisdom of the just; to make ready for the Lord a people prepared
\add for him\add*.
\v 18 And Zechariah said to the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.
\v 19 And the angel answering said to him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and I was sent to speak to
you, and to bring you these good tidings.
\v 20 And behold, you shall be silent and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall come to pass, because you
believedst not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.
\v 21 And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marveled while he tarried in the temple.
\v 22 And when he came out, he could not speak to them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: and he
continued making signs to them, and remained dumb.
\v 23 And it came to pass, when the days of his ministration were fulfilled, he departed to his house.
\p
\v 24 And after these days Elizabeth his wife conceived; and she hid herself five months, saying,
\v 25 Thus has the Lord done to me in the days wherein he looked upon
\add me\add*, to take away my reproach among men.
\p
\v 26 Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,
\v 27 to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary.
\v 28 And he came in to her, and said, Hail, you that are highly favored, the Lord
\add is\add* with thee.
\v 29 But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this might be.
\v 30 And the angel said to her, Fear not, Mary: for you have found favor with God.
\v 31 And behold, you shall conceive in your womb, and bring forth a son, and shall call his name JESUS.
\v 32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High: and the Lord God shall give to him the throne of his
father David:
\v 33 and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.
\v 34 And Mary said to the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?
\v 35 And the angel answered and said to her, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall
overshadow thee: wherefore also the holy thing which is begotten shall be called the Son of God.
\v 36 And behold, Elizabeth your kinswoman, she also has conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her
that was called barren.
\v 37 For no word from God shall be void of power.
\v 38 And Mary said, Behold, the handmaid of the Lord; be it to me according to your word. And the angel departed from her.
\p
\v 39 And Mary arose in these days and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah;
\v 40 and entered into the house of Zechariah and saluted Elisabeth.
\v 41 And it came to pass, when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled
with the Holy Spirit;
\v 42 and she lifted up her voice with a loud cry, and said, Blessed
\add art\add* you among women, and blessed \add is\add* the fruit of your womb.
\v 43 And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
\v 44 For behold, when the voice of your salutation came into mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.
\v 45 And blessed \add is\add* she that believed; for there shall be a fulfilment of the things which have been spoken to her
from the Lord.
\v 46 And Mary said,
\q My soul does magnify the Lord,
\q
\v 47 And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour.
\q
\v 48 For he has looked upon the low estate of his handmaid:
\q For behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.
\q
\v 49 For he that is mighty has done to me great things;
\q And holy is his name.
\q
\v 50 And his mercy is to generations and generations
\q On them that fear him.
\q
\v 51 He has showed strength with his arm;
\q He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their heart.
\q
\v 52 He has put down princes from \add their\add* thrones,
\q And has exalted them of low degree.
\q
\v 53 The hungry he has filled with good things;
\q And the rich he has sent empty away.
\q
\v 54 He has given help to Israel his servant,
\q That he might remember mercy
\q
\v 55 (As he spoke to our fathers)
\q Toward Abraham and his seed for ever.
\p
\v 56 And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her house.
\p
\v 57 Now Elisabeth’s time was fulfilled that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.
\v 58 And her neighbors and her kinsfolk heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her; and they rejoiced with her.
\v 59 And it came to pass on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him Zacharias,
after the name of his father.
\v 60 And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.
\v 61 And they said to her, There is none of your kindred that is called by this name.
\v 62 And they made signs to his father, what he would have him called.
\v 63 And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marveled all.
\v 64 And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue \add loosed\add*, and he spake, blessing God.
\v 65 And fear came on all that lived round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill
country of Judaea.
\v 66 And all that heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, What then shall this child be? For the hand of the Lord was
with him.
\p
\v 67 And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,
\q
\v 68 Blessed \add be\add* the Lord, the God of Israel;
\q For he has visited and wrought redemption for his people,
\q
\v 69 And has raised up a horn of salvation for us
\q In the house of his servant David
\q
\v 70 (As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets that have been from of old),
\q
\v 71 Salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;
\q

\q
\v 79 To shine upon them that sit in darkness and the shadow of death;
\q To guide our feet into the way of peace.
\p
\v 80 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his showing to Israel.
