\v 18 Similarly, if Satan and his demons were fighting against each other, his rule over them would certainly not last! I say this because you are saying that I force out demons by the power of the ruler of demons!
\v 19 Now, if it is really true that Satan is enabling me to force out demons, is it also true that your disciples who force out demons do so by Satan's power ? Of course not! So they prove that you are wrong.
\v 20 But since it is actually by the power of God that I force out demons, I am showing you that God has begun to rule over you."

\v 18 If Satan is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say I cast out demons by Beezelbul.
\v 19 If I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your followers drive them out? Because of this, they will be your judges.
\v 20 But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you.

===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues to speak to the crowd about demons.

  * **If Satan is divided against himself**  - "If Satan and members of his kingdom are fighting among themselves."
  * **how will his kingdom stand**  - This is a rhetorical question. It could be translated as a statement: "Satan's kingdom cannot stand," or "Satan's kingdom will fall apart." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **For you say I cast out demons by Beelzebul**  - "For you say that it is by the power of Beelzebul that I make demons leave people." The next part of his argument can be stated explicitly: "that would mean that Satan is divided against himself." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **by whom do your followers drive them out**  - "by whose power do you followers force demons to leave people." This is a rhetorical question. It can be translated as "then we must agree that your followers also drive out demons by Beelzebub's power." The implied evaluation of that statement can be made explicit: "But we know that that is not true."  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]], [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **They will be your judges**  - "Your followers who cast out demons by God's power will judge you for saying that I cast out demons by Beelzebub's power."
  * **by the finger of God**  - The "finger of God" refers to God's power. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **then the kingdom of God has come to you**  - "this shows that God's kingdom has come to you"
