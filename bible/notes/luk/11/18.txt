\v 19 Furthermore, if \add it is true that\add* Satan enables me to expel demons, \add is it also true that\add* your disciples \add who\add* expel demons \add do so\add* by \add Satan's\add* power \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? \add No, that is not true\add*.

\v 20 But because it is by the power \f + \ft metonymy \f* of God \add that I expel demons\add*, I am showing you \add that the power of\add* God to \f + \ft metaphor \f* rule \add people's lives\add* has come to you."

\v 18 Similarly, if Satan and his demons were fighting against each other, his rule over them would certainly not last! I say this because you are saying that I force out demons by the power of the ruler of demons!
\v 19 Now, if it is really true that Satan is enabling me to force out demons, is it also true that your disciples who force out demons do so by Satan's power ? Of course not! So they prove that you are wrong.
\v 20 But since it is actually by the power of God that I force out demons, I am showing you that God has begun to rule over you."

\v 18 If Satan is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say I cast out demons by Beelzebul.
\v 19 If I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your followers drive them out? Because of this, they will be your judges.
\v 20 But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you.
