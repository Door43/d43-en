\v 18 \add Similarly\add*, if Satan \add and his demons\add* were fighting against each other, his rule over them would \add certainly\add* not last!\f + \ft Or: how would his rule over them last? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add I say this\add* because you are saying that I am expelling demons by \add the power of\add* the ruler of \add his own demons\add*!
\v 19 Furthermore, if \add it is true that\add* Satan enables me to expel demons, \add is it also true that\add* your disciples \add who\add* expel demons \add do so\add* by \add Satan's\add* power \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? \add No, that is not true\add*.

\v 20 But because it is by the power \f + \ft metonymy \f* of God \add that I expel demons\add*, I am showing you \add that the power of\add* God to \f + \ft metaphor \f* rule \add people's lives\add* has come to you."

<usfm>
\v 18 Similarly, if Satan and his demons were fighting against each other, his rule over them would certainly not last! I say this because you are saying that I force out demons by the power of the ruler of demons!
\v 19 Now, if it is really true that Satan is enabling me to force out demons, is it also true that your disciples who force out demons do so by Satan's power ? Of course not! So they prove that you are wrong.
\v 20 But since it is actually by the power of God that I force out demons, I am showing you that the kingdom of God has come to you."

<usfm>
\v 18 Since you say I cast out demons by Beezelbul, how will his kingdom stand if Satan is divided against himself?
\v 19 If I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your followers drive them out? Because of this, they will be your judges.
\v 20 But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Since you say I cast out demons by Beelzebul** -  "Since you say that it is by the power of Beelzebul that that I make demons leave people." Because of what the people were saying, Jesus was about to make a point about it. The next part of his argument can be stated explicitly: "that would mean that Satan is divided against himself." (See: [[en:ta:vocabulary:implicitexplicit]])
    * **how will his kingdom stand** - This is the beginning of a rhetorical question. It could be translated as statement: "Satan's kingdom cannot stand," or "Satan's kingdom will fall apart."  (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:rhetoricalquestion]])
    * **if Satan is divided against itself** -  "if Satan and members of his kingdom are fighting among themselves." This phrase can come before "how will his kingdom stand."
    * **by whom do your followers drive them out** - "by whose power do you followers force demons to leave people." This is a rhetorical question. It can be translated as "then we must agree that your followers also drive out demons by Beelzebub's power." The implied evaluation of that statement can be made explicit: "But we know that that is not true."
    * **They will be your judges** - "Your followers who cast out demons by God's power will judge you for saying that I cast out demons by Beelzebub's power."
    * **by the finger of God** - The "finger of God" refers to God's power. (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:metonymy]])
    * **then the kingdom of God has come to you** - "this shows that God's kingdom has come to you."
