\v 18 \add Similarly\add*, if Satan \add and his demons\add* were fighting against each other, his rule over them would \add certainly\add* not last!\f + \ft Or: how would his rule over them last? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add I say this\add* because you are saying that I am expelling demons by \add the power of\add* the ruler of \add his own demons\add*!
\v 19 Furthermore, if \add it is true that\add* Satan enables me to expel demons, \add is it also true that\add* your disciples \add who\add* expel demons \add do so\add* by \add Satan's\add* power \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? \add No, that is not true\add*. So they will show that you \add are not thinking logically\add*.
\v 20 But because it is by the power \f + \ft metonymy \f* of God \add that I expel demons\add*, I am showing you \add that the power of\add* God to \f + \ft metaphor \f* rule \add people's lives\add* has come to you."

<usfm>
\v 18 Similarly, if Satan and his demons were fighting against each other, his rule over them would certainly not last! I say this because you are saying that I force out demons by the power of the ruler of demons!
\v 19 Now, if it is really true that Satan is enabling me to force out demons, is it also true that your disciples who force out demons do so by Satan's power ? Of course not! So they prove that you are wrong.
\v 20 But since it is actually by the power of God that I force out demons, I am showing you that the kingdom of God has come to you."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 And since you say I cast out demons by Beezelbul, how will his kingdom stand if Satan is divided against himself?
\v 19 And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your followers drive them out? Because of this, they will be your judges.
\v 20 But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **beelzebul**  ​-Or, "lord of flies or filth." Another name for Satan. Another idea here would be for the translator to pick the name of a tribal god, who approximates what the Jews meant by Beelzebul.
    * **if Satan is divided against itself**- That is, "if Satan and members of his kingdom are fighting among themselves" or "if Satan and members of his kingdom are fighting each other."
    * **how will his kingdom stand**- The implied answer to this question is a no. That is, "Satan's kingdom will not stand," or "Satan's kingdom will not continue to exist."
    * **since you say **- That is, "because you say, " or "for you say."
    * **I cast out demons**- That is, "I expel demons out of people," or "I drive out demons out of people."
