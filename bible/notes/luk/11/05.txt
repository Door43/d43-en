\v 5 Then he said to them, "Suppose that one of you goes to the house of a friend at midnight. Suppose that you\add \f + \ft singular \f* stand outside and\add* call out to him, 'My friend, please lend me three buns!
\v 6 Another friend of mine who is traveling has just arrived \add at my house\add*, but I have no food \add ready\add* to give to him!'
\v 7 Suppose that he answers you from inside \add the house\add*, 'Do not bother me! The door has been locked \f + \ft Or:\add We( exclusive )\add* have locked the door \f* and all my family are in bed. \add So\add* I cannot get up and give you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* anything!'
\v 8 I will tell you that even if he does not \add want to\add* get up and give you \add any food\add*, to avoid being ashamed \add for not helping you\add* because you are his friend \f + \ft Or: if without being ashamed you continue asking him to do that \f*, he certainly will get up and give you whatever you need.

\v 5 Then he said to them, "Suppose that one of you goes to the house of a friend at midnight. Suppose that you stand outside and call out to him, 'My friend, please lend me three loaves of bread!
\v 6 Another friend of mine who is traveling has just arrived at my house, but I have no food ready to give to him!'
\v 7 Suppose that he answers you from inside the house, 'Do not bother me! The door has been locked and all my family are in bed. So I cannot get up and give you anything!'
\v 8 I tell you, he may not want to get up and give you any food even though you are his friend. But because you keep persisting in asking him,  he will certainly get up and give you whatever you need.

\v 5 Jesus said to them, "Which of you will have a friend, and will go to him at midnight, and say to him, 'Friend, lend to me three loaves of bread,
\v 6 since a friend of mine just came in from the road, and I do not have anything to set before him.'
\v 7 Then the one inside, answering, may say, 'Do not bother me. The door is already shut, and my children, along with me, are in bed. I am not able to get up and give bread to you.'
\v 8 I say to you, even if he does not get up and give bread to you because you are his friend, yet because of your shameless persistence, he will get up and give you as many loaves of bread as you need.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * (Jesus continues to teach his disciples about prayer.)
    * **he said to them**  - That is, "Jesus said to his disciples."
    * **Which of you will have**  - This could also be translated as "Suppose one of you has" or "Suppose you have". Jesus used a rhetorical question as a way of getting people to consider what might happen if they were in a certain situation. (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:rhetoricalquestion]])
    * **lend to me three loaves of bread**  - This could also be translated "let me borrow three loaves of bread" or "give me three loaves of bread and I will pay you later."
    * **three loaves of bread** - This could also be translated as "some cooked food," or "some prepared food." If your people do not know what bread is, or if they would not understand why someone would ask for bread, you could use a generic term like "cooked food." The problem would be if the host does not have any food ready to give to his guests.
    * **just came in from the road**  - This could also be translated as "who was traveling has just arrived at my house" (UDB) or "was traveling and just came to my house."
    * **anything to set before him**  - That is, "any food to give him" or "any food ready to give him."
