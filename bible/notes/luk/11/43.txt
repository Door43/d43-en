\v 43 There will be terrible punishment for you Pharisees, because you like \add to sit in\add* the best seats in our worship places \add so that people will think highly of you\add*, and you like people to greet you \add respectfully\add* in the marketplaces.
\v 44 There will be terrible punishment for you, because you are like ground where there is no marker \add to indicate that there is a\add* grave \add underneath\add*. People walk there, but they cannot see \add what is rotten down below\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*! \add Similarly, people who see you do not realize how polluted you are within yourselves\add*."

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 43 How terrible it will be for you Pharisees, because you like to sit in the most important seats in the synagogues, and you like people to greet you with special honor in the marketplaces.
\v 44 How terrible it will be for you, because you are like unmarked graves that cannot be seen, which people walk over without realizing it and become ceremonially unclean."

\v 43  Woe to you Pharisees, for you love the front seats in the synagogues and respectful greetings in the market places.
\v 44 Woe to you, for you are like unmarked graves that people walk over without knowing it."

===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues to speak to the Pharisees.
  * **the front seats** - "the best seats"
  * **you are like unmarked graves that people walk over without knowing it** - This is a simile. The Pharisees were like unmarked graves because they looked ceremonially clean, but they caused people around them to become unclean. This point of similarity is somewhat more clear in the UDB. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **unmarked graves** - These graves were holes dug in the ground where a dead body was buried. They did not have the white stones that people normally place over graves so that others would see them. When people walked over a grave, they would become ceremonially unclean.
