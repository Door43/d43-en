\v 43 How terrible it will be for you Pharisees, because you like to sit in the most important seats in the synagogues, and you like people to greet you with special honor in the marketplaces.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the front seats in the synagogues** - That is, "the best seats in the synagogues."
  * **unmarked graves** - These graves were holes dug in the ground where a dead body was placed and covered over. If anyone walked over a grave, he would become ceremonially unclean. So people normally mark graves with white stones so that others would see.
