\v 11 If one of you had a son who asked you for a fish to eat, you certainly would not give him a poisonous snake instead, would you?
\v 12 And if he asked you for an egg, you certainly would not give him a scorpion instead, would you?
\v 13 Even though you people are sinful, you know how to give good things to your children. So it is even more certain that your Father in heaven will give the Holy Spirit to you if you ask him to do that."

\v 11  Which of you whose son will ask his father for a loaf, will give to him a stone instead, or instead of a fish, a snake?
\v 12 Or if he asks for an egg, will you give a scorpion to him?
\v 13 Therefore, if you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father from heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?"

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * (Jesus continues teaching his disciples about prayer.)
    * Luke 11:11-13 has three rhetorical questions. Jesus' point is that just as fathers give good gifts to their children who ask for things, God gives good gifts to us when we ask him. (See [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:rhetoricalquestion]]).
    * **And which of you ... will give him a stone instead** - This can be translated as "If your son were to ask you for a loaf, would you give him a stone instead?" or "If your son were to ask you for a loaf to eat, you certainly would not give him a stone instead!" 
    * **loaf**  - "loaf of bread" or "bread roll." If your people do not normally eat bread, you could translate this as "piece of cooked food" or "vegetable." Jesus was suggesting a possible situation; he was not talking about "bread" in particular. 
    * **or instead of a fish, a snake?** - "Or if he were to ask for a fish, would you give him a snake instead?"
    * **scorpion** - A scorpion is similar to a spider, but it has a tail with a poisonous sting. If scorpions are not known where you are, you could translate this as "poisonous spider" or "spider that stings."
    * **if you who are evil know** - "since you who are evil know" or "even though you are sinful, you know."
    * **how much more will your Father from heaven give good gifts**  - "how much more certain is it that your Father from heaven will give good gifts". This could also be translated as "you can be sure that your Father from heaven will give good gifts."
