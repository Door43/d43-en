\v 11 If one of you had a son who asked you for a fish to eat, you certainly would not give him a poisonous snake instead, would you?
\v 12 And if he asked you for an egg, you certainly would not give him a scorpion instead, would you?
\v 13 Even though you people are sinful, you know how to give good things to your children. So it is even more certain that your Father in heaven will give the Holy Spirit to you if you ask him to do that."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 Which father among you, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead of a fish? \f + \ft The best ancient copies have the shorter reading, which we follow here. Some ancient copies have the longer reading, which also is found in Matthew 7:9, \fqa 'a loaf of bread, will give him a stone.' \f*
\v 12 Or if he asks for an egg, will you give a scorpion to him?
\v 13 Therefore, if you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father from heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus finishes teaching his disciples about prayer.

  * **Which father among you ... a fish?** - Jesus uses questions to teach his disciples. It could also be written as a statement. AT: "None of you fathers ... a fish" (See [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Or if he asks ... scorpion to him?** - Jesus uses questions to teach his disciples. It could also be written as a statement. AT: "And you would never give him a scorpion if he asks for an egg" (See [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **scorpion** - A scorpion is similar to a spider, but it has a tail with a poisonous sting. If scorpions are not known where you are, you could translate this as "poisonous spider" or "spider that stings" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **if you who are evil know** - "since you who are evil know" or "even though you are sinful, you know"
  * **how much more will your Father from heaven give the Holy Spirit ... him?** - "how much more certain is it that your Father in heaven will give the Holy Spirit ... him?" Jesus again uses a question to teach his disciples. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "you can be sure that your Father from heaven will give the Holy Spirit ... him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
