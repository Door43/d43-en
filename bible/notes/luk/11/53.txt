===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **After Jesus left there** - "After Jesus left the Pharisee's house"
  * **trying to trap him in his own words** - This is a metaphor. They wanted Jesus to say something wrong so that they could accuse him. It can be translated without the metaphor as in the UDB.
