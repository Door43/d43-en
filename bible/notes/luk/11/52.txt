===== Translation Notes: =====

    * (Jesus continues to tell the teachers of the law how they sin against God.)
    * **taken away the key of knowledge** -  This is a metaphor. It means "you have hidden God's truth." It can be translated as a simile as in the UDB.
    * **you do not enter in yourselves** - "You yourselves do not go into knowledge." This is a metaphor. It means "You yourselves do not gain knowledge."
