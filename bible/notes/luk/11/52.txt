===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Jesus continues to tell the teachers of the law how they sin against God.)
  * **you have taken away the key of knowledge**  - This is a metaphor. It means "you have prevented people from entering into the place where God's truth is stored." It can be translated as a simile as in the UDB. (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **the key**  - This represents the means of access, as to a house or storage room.
  * **you do not enter in yourselves**  - "You yourselves do not go in in order to get knowledge." This metaphor means "You yourselves do make use of the knowledge."
