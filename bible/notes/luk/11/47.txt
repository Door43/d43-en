===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 47 There will be terrible punishment for you! You decorate the tombs of the prophets whom your ancestors killed, \add but you do not live according to what the prophets taught\add*.
\v 48 So you are declaring that you approve of what your ancestors did. They killed the prophets, and you \add are not honoring them! You just\add* decorate their tombs!
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 47 How terrible it will be for you, because you construct buildings to mark the graves of the prophets, but your ancestors are the ones who killed them!
\v 48 So when you build these buildings, you are declaring that you approve of what your ancestors did when they killed the prophets.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 47 Woe to you, because you build memorials for the prophets' tombs, and yet it was your ancestors who killed them.
\v 48 So you are witnesses and consent to the works of your ancestors, because they indeed killed the prophets, whose tombs you build memorials for.

===== Translation Notes: =====

      * (Jesus continues to speak to the teachers of the law.)
      * **and yet** - This calls attention to the contrast between their honoring of the prophets while ignoring the fact that their ancestors murdered them.
      * **So you are witnesses and consent to the works of your ancestors** - This is an implied rebuke: "but you did not denounce them." They knew about the murder of the prophets, but did not condemn their ancestors for killing them. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
