\v 47 There will be terrible punishment for you! You decorate the tombs of the prophets whom your ancestors killed, \add but you do not live according to what the prophets taught\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 47 How terrible it will be for you, because you construct buildings to mark the graves of the prophets, but your ancestors are the ones who killed them!
\v 48 So when you build these buildings, you are declaring that you approve of what your ancestors did when they killed the prophets.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 47 Woe to you, because you build memorials for the prophets' tombs, and yet it was your ancestors who killed them.
\v 48 So you are witnesses and consent to the works of your ancestors, because they indeed killed the prophets, whose tombs you build memorials for.
