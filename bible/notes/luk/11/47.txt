====== Luke 11:47-48 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 47 There will be terrible punishment for you! You decorate the tombs of the prophets whom your ancestors killed, \add but you do not live according to what the prophets taught\add*.
\v 48 So you are declaring that you approve of what your ancestors did. They killed the prophets, and you \add are not honoring them! You just\add* decorate their tombs!
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 47 How terrible it will be for you, because you construct buildings to mark the graves of the prophets, but your ancestors are the ones who killed them!
\v 48 So when you build these buildings, you are declaring that you approve of what your ancestors did when they killed the prophets.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 47 Woe to you, because you build tombs for the prophets, and it was your ancestors who killed them.
\v 48 So you are witnesses and you consent to the works of your ancestors, for they indeed killed them and you build their tombs.
</usfm>

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **So you are witnesses and you consent** - Jesus is rebuking the Pharisees and teachers of the law. They knew about the murder of the prophets, but did not condemn their ancestors for killing them. AT: "So, rather than denouncing them, you confirm and agree" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
