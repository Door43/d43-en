\v 33 \add Then, to show them that they did not need more miracles, but that they needed only to understand better what he had already told them, he said to them\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, "People who light a lamp do not then hide it, or put it under a basket. Instead, they put it on a lampstand so that those who enter \add the house\add* can see \add things from\add* its light. \add Similarly, I have not concealed God's truth. I have revealed it to you\add*.
\v 34 Your eyes \f + \ft metaphor \f* are like a lamp for your body, because they enable you to see things. If your eyes are healthy, you are able to see everything well \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add Similarly, if you\f + \ft singular \f* accept my teaching, you will be able to know all that God wants you to know\add*. But if your eyes are bad, you are not able to see anything. It is like being in darkness \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add And similarly, if you\f + \ft plural \f* do not accept what I teach, you will not be able to know all the things that God wants you to know\add*.
\v 35 Therefore, \add you\f + \ft plural \f* do not need to see more miracles. You need to think carefully about what I have already\add* told you, so that the things that you have heard from others do not cause you to remain in spiritual darkness \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 36 If you \add live completely according to God's truth, you will be able to know everything that God wants you to know. It will be like\add* being in a room with a lamp shining brightly, enabling you to see everything clearly."

\v 33 "People who light a lamp do not then hide it, or put it under a basket. Instead, they put it on a lampstand so that those who enter the room or house can see the light.
\v 34 Your eye is the lamp of your body. If your eye is healthy, then your whole body is full of light. If, on the other hand, it is unhealthy, then your body will be full of darkness.
\v 35 Therefore, be careful that the light in you is not darkness.
\v 36 If your whole body is full of light and no part of it is darkened, all of your body will be full of light like the light of a lamp that enables you to see everything clearly."

\v 33 No one, after lighting a lamp, places it in a dark closet or under a basket, but on a lampstand so that those who enter may have light.
\v 34 Your eye is the lamp of the body. When your eye is good, the whole body is filled with light. But when your eye is bad, your body is full of darkness.
\v 35 Therefore, be careful that the light in you is not darkness.
\v 36 If then, your whole body is full of light, with no part of it in darkness, then your whole body will be like when a lamp shines its brightness on you."

===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues to teach the crowds.

  * Jesus did not intend for everyone in the crowd to understand this teaching. Therefore, it might be best to simply translate the images, rather than explaining them.
  * **puts it in a dark closet**  - "hides it in a closet"
  * **on a lamp stand**  - "on a table" or "they put it on a shelf"
  * **Your eye is the lamp of the body**  - This has several figures of speech. The eye is a metonym for vision, which is a metaphor for understanding. The body is a synecdoche for a person's life. It can be translated as "Your eye is the lamp of your life" or "Your vision is the lamp of your life."  Since Jesus was saying something that is true of everyone, it can be translated as "The eye is the lamp of a person's body." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]], [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]], [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche|Synecdoche]])
  * **When your eye is good**  - "When your vision is good" or "when you see well"  (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
  * **the whole body is filled with light**  - Light is a metaphor for truth. This metaphor means "your whole life is filled with the light of truth" or "his whole life is filled with truth."(See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **When your eye is bad, your body is full of darkness.**  - Darkness is a metaphor for falsehood. This metaphor means "When your vision is bad, your whole life is full of falsehood."  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
