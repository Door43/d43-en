\v 33 \add Then, to show them that they did not need more miracles, but that they needed only to understand better what he had already told them, he said to them\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, "People who light a lamp do not then hide it, or put it under a basket. Instead, they put it on a lampstand so that those who enter \add the house\add* can see \add things from\add* its light. \add Similarly, I have not concealed God's truth. I have revealed it to you\add*.
\v 34 Your eyes \f + \ft metaphor \f* are like a lamp for your body, because they enable you to see things. If your eyes are healthy, you are able to see everything well \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add Similarly, if you\f + \ft singular \f* accept my teaching, you will be able to know all that God wants you to know\add*. But if your eyes are bad, you are not able to see anything. It is like being in darkness \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add And similarly, if you\f + \ft plural \f* do not accept what I teach, you will not be able to know all the things that God wants you to know\add*.
\v 35 Therefore, \add you\f + \ft plural \f* do not need to see more miracles. You need to think carefully about what I have already\add* told you, so that the things that you have heard from others do not cause you to remain in spiritual darkness \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 36 If you \add live completely according to God's truth, you will be able to know everything that God wants you to know. It will be like\add* being in a room with a lamp shining brightly, enabling you to see everything clearly."

\v 33 "People who light a lamp do not then hide it, or put it under a basket. Instead, they put it on a lampstand so that those who enter the room or house can see the light.
\v 34 Your eye is the lamp of your body. If your eye is healthy, then your whole body is full of light. If, on the other hand, it is unhealthy, then your body will be full of darkness.
\v 35 Therefore, be careful that the light in you is not darkness.
\v 36 If your whole body is full of light and no part of it is darkened, all of your body will be full of light like the light of a lamp that enables you to see everything clearly."

\p
\v 33 No one, after lighting a lamp, places it in a dark closet or under a basket, but on a lampstand so that those who enter may have light.
\v 34 Your eye is the lamp of the body. When your eye is good, the whole body is filled with light. But when your eye is bad, your body is full of darkness.
\v 35 Therefore, be careful that the light in you is not darkness.
\v 36 If then, your whole body is full of light, with no part of it in darkness, then your whole body will be like when a lamp shines its brightness on you."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus finishes teaching the crowd.
  * **General Information:** - Verse 33-36 are a metaphor where Jesus speaks of his teaching as "light" which should be shared with everyone and acted upon. He speaks of people who do not accept his teaching as being in "darkness." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **places it in a dark closet** - "hides it in a closet"
  * **but on a lampstand** - It may be helpful to add the missing information. AT: "but they place it on a lampstand" or " but they put it on a table" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **Your eye is the lamp of the body** - In this part of the metaphor, the things they saw Jesus do provided understanding just as an eye provides light for the body. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Your eye** - The eye is a metonym for vision. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the body** - The body is a synecdoche for a person's life. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **When your eye is good** - "eye" here is a metonym for vision. AT: "When your vision is good" or "when you see well" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the whole body is filled with light** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the light will fill your whole body" or "you will be able to see everything clearly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **when your eye is bad** - Here "eye" is a metonym for vision. AT: "When your vision is bad" or "when you see poorly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **your body is full of darkness** - "you will not be able to see anything"
  * **be careful that the light in you is not darkness** - "make sure that what you think is light is not actually darkness" or "make sure you know what is light, and know what is darkness"
  * **then your whole body will be like when a lamp shines its brightness on you** - Jesus states the same truth as a simile. He speaks of people who are full of truth as if they are a lamp that shines brightly. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
