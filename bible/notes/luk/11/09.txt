\v 9 So I tell you this: Keep asking God for what you need, and he will give it to you. Keep seeking his will and he will show it to you. Keep on praying urgently to God, like someone knocking on a door, and he will open the way for you to receive what you pray for.
\v 10 Remember that anyone who asks will receive and anyone who seeks will find, and anyone who knocks will have the door opened for him.

\v 10 For every asking person receives; and the seeking person finds; and to the person who knocks, it will be opened.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * (Jesus continues to teach his disciples about prayer.)
    * **ask ... seek ... knock** - Jesus gave these commands to encourage his disciples to pray contiually. Use the form of "you" that would be most appropriate in this context. (See: [[en:ta:vocabulary:formsofyou]]). These commands can be translated as "keep asking ... keep seeking ... keep knocking".
    * **it will be given to you**  - This can be translated with an active verb: "God will give it to you" or "you will receive". (See: [[en:ta:vocabulary:active]]) 
    * **knock**  - To knock at a door is to hit it a few times to let a person inside the house know you are standing outside. It can also be translated using the way people in your culture show that they have arrived, such as "call out" or "cough" or "clap."
    * **it will be opened**  - This can be translated with an active verb: "God will open the door" or "you will be welcomed inside."
