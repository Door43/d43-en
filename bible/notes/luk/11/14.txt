===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **And he was driving out a demon** - "And Jesus was driving a demon out of a person" or "And he was making a demon leave a person."
    * **it was mute** -  It is unlikely that the demon could not speak. The readers would have probably understood that this demon had power to prevent people from speaking. You could make this implied information clear: "the demon caused the man to be unable to speak." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
    * **It happened that** - This phrase is used here to mark where the action starts. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here. When the demon comes out of the man, some of the people criticize Jesus, and that leads to Jesus teaching about evil spirits.
    * **when the demon had come out** - "when the demon came out of the man" or "when the demon left the man" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
    * **the mute man spoke**  - "the man who had been unable to speak spoke"
    * **by Beelzebul ... he drives out demons** â€‹ - "he drives out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of demons"
