===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **it happened** - This phrase is used here to mark the beginning of a new part of the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **when he finished praying** - Since this is the beginning of a new part of the story, in some languages it will be more natural to say "Jesus was praying in a certain place, and when he finish praying."
