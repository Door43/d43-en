You wash the outside of cups and dishes \add before you eat because you think that doing that will make you acceptable to God\add*, but within yourselves you are very greedy and wicked.
\v 40 You foolish people! \add God\add* is concerned about things that are outside \add our bodies\add*, but he is certainly also concerned about our inner \add beings\add*!\f + \ft Or: isn't he also concerned about our hearts? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 39 The Lord Jesus said to Him, "You Pharisees wash the outside of cups and dishes before you eat, but within yourselves you are very greedy and wicked.
\v 40 You foolish people! Surely you know that God not only made the outside, but he also made the inside!
\v 41 Instead of worrying about dishes being ritually clean, be merciful and give whatever is inside the dishes to those in need, and then both the inside and outside of you will be clean.

\v 39 But the Lord said to him, "Now then, you Pharisees clean the outside of a cup and a bowl, but the inside of you is filled with greed and evil.
\v 40 You senseless men! Did not the one who made the outside also make the inside?
\v 41 Give to the poor what is inside, and then all things will be clean for you.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **You clean the outside of a up and bow
    * **what is inside**  - 
    * **but the inside of you is filled with greed and wickedness** - The contrast is because greed and wickedness make a person unclean. This can be translated as "but the inside of you is filthy because you are filled with greed and wickedness."
