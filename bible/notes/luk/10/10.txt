\v 10 But if you enter a town whose people do not welcome you, go into its main streets and say,
\v 11 'As a warning against you, we will wipe off even the dust that sticks to our feet as we are leaving your town. Yet be sure of this; God will soon rule everything as king.'
\v 12 I tell you that on the final day when God judges everyone, the people of that town will be punished even more severely than the wicked people who lived long ago in the city of Sodom!

<usfm>
\v 10 Whenever you enter a town and they do not receive you, go out into its streets and say,
\v 11 'Even the dust from your town that clings to our feet we wipe off against you! But know this: The kingdom of God has come near.'
\v 12 I say to you that on the judgment day it will be more tolerable for Sodom than for that town.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **and they do not receive you** - "if the people of the city reject you"
  * **Even the dust from your town that clings to our feet we wipe off against you!** - This is a symbolic action to show that they reject the people of the city. AT: "Just as you rejected us, we thoroughly reject you. We even reject the dust from your town that clings to our feet" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **we wipe off** - Since Jesus was sending these people out in groups of two, it would be two people saying this. So languages that have a dual form of 'we' would use it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **But know this: The kingdom of God has come near** - The phrase "But know this" introduces a warning. It means "Even though you reject us, it does not change the fact that the kingdom of God is near!"
  * **The kingdom of God has come near** - The abstract noun "kingdom" can be expressed with the verbs "reign" or "rule." See how you translated a similar sentence in [[:en:bible:notes:luk:10:08]]. AT: "God will soon rule everywhere as king" or "The proof that God is reigning is all around you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **I say to you** - Jesus was saying this to the 70 people he was sending out. He said this to show that he was about to say something very important.
  * **the judgment day** - The disciples would have understood that this refers to the time of final judgment of sinners. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **it will be more tolerable for Sodom than for that town** - "God will not judge Sodom as severely as he will judge that town." AT: "God will judge the people of that town more severely than he will judge the people of Sodom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
