\v 33 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion.
\v 34 He approached him and bound up his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them. He set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
\v 35 The next day he took out two denarii, and gave them to the host, and said, 'Take care of him; and whatever extra you spend, when I return, I will repay you.'

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **when he saw him**  - "when the Samaritan saw the injured man"
    * **he was moved with compassion**  - "he felt sorry for him."
    * **bound up his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them**  - Since he would have put the oil and wine on the wounds first, it can be translated as "he put wine and oil on the wounds and wrapped them with cloth." Wine was used to clean the wound, and oil was probably used to prevent further infection.
    * **on his own beast**  - "on his own pack animal." This was an animal that he used to carry heavy loads. It may have been a donkey.
    * **two denarii**  ​- "two silver coins"
    * **the host**  - "the innkeeper" or "the person who took care of the inn."
