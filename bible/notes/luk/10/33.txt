\v 33 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion.
\v 34 He approached him and bound up his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them. He set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
\v 35 And the next day he took out two denarii, and gave them to the host, and said, 'Take care of him; and whatever extra you spend, when I return, I will repay you.'
