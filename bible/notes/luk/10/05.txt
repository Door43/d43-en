\v 5 Whenever you enter a house, first say to those people, 'May God give peace to you who are in this house!'
\v 6 If the people who live there are desiring to have God's peace, they will experience the peace that you are offering them. If the people who live there are not desiring to have God's peace, the peace you have offered will return to you.
\v 7 Stay in that same house until you leave that village. Do not move around from one house to another. Eat and drink whatever they provide for you, because a worker deserves to receive payment for his work.

<usfm>
\v 5 Whatever house you enter, first say, 'May peace be on this house!'
\v 6 If a person of peace is there, your peace will rest upon him, but if not, it will return to you.
\v 7 Remain in that same house, eating and drinking what they provide, for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Do not move around from house to house.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **May peace be on this house** - This was both a greeting and a blessing. Here "house" refers to those who live in the house. AT: "May the people in this household receive peace" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **a person of peace** - "a peaceful person." This is a person who wants peace with God and with people.
  * **your peace will rest upon him** - "peace" is described as a living thing that can choose where to stay. AT: "he will have the peace you blessed him with" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **if not** - It may be helpful to restate the entire phrase. AT: "if there is no person of peace there" or "if the owner of the house is not a peaceful person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **it will return to you** - "peace" is described as a living thing that can choose to leave. AT: "you will have that peace" or "he will not receive the peace you blessed him with" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **Remain in that same house** - Jesus was not saying that they should stay in the house all day, but that they should sleep at the same house every night they were there. AT: "Continue to sleep at that house" 
  * **for the laborer is worthy of his wages** - This is a general principle that Jesus was applying to the men he was sending out. Since they would be teaching and healing the people, the people should provide them with a place to stay and with food.
  * **Do not go from house to house** - This means the same things as "Remain in that same house." AT: "Do not go sleep at a different house each night" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
