\v 5 Whenever you enter a housel, first say to those people, 'May God give peace to you who are in this house!'
\v 6 If the people who live there are desiring to have God's peace, they will experience the peace that you are offering them. If the people who live there are not desiring to have God's peace, the peace you have offered will return to you.
\v 7 Stay in that same house until you leave that village. Do not move around from one house to another. Eat and drink whatever they provide for you,  because a worker deserves to receive payment for his work.

\v 5 And into whatever house you may enter, first say, 'May peace be on this house.'
\v 6 And if a person of peace is there, your peace will rest upon him, but if not, it will return to you.
\v 7 Remain in that same house, eating and drinking what they provide, for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Do not go from house to house.
