===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues to give directions to the 70 people he was sending out.

  * **Go on your way**  - This can be translated as "Go to the cities" or "Go to the people" or "Go bring in the people."
  * **I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves**  - This is a simile that means the people Jesus was sending out could be attacked by the people they were going to. It can be translated as "When I send you out, people will want to harm you as wolves attack sheep." The names of other animals could be substituted. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
  * **lambs**  - Lambs are baby sheep. They can't defend themselves against animals that attack them.
  * **wolves**  - Wolves are similar to large wild dogs. They attack and eat other animals, such as lambs. "Wolves" can be translated with a generic term like "wild dogs" or "fierce dogs" or with the name of a specific animal like a dog that your people know of, such as "coyotes" or "jackals" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown|How to Translate Unknowns]])
  * **Carry no bag of money**  - "Do not take a bag of money with you"
  * **Greet no one on the way**  - Jesus was emphasizing that they go quickly to the towns and do this work. He was not telling them to be rude.
