===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Go on your way** - "Go to the cities" or "Go to the people"
  * **I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves** - Wolves attack and kill sheep. This metaphor therefore means that there are people who would attempt to harm the disciples that Jesus is sending out. The names of other animals could be substituted. AT: "when I send you out, people will want to harm you as wolves attack sheep" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Carry no bag of money** - "Do not take a bag of money with you"
  * **greet no one on the way** - Jesus was emphasizing that they go quickly to the towns and do this work. He was not telling them to be rude.
