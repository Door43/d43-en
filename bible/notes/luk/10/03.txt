===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Jesus continues to give directions to the 72 people he was sending out.)
  * **Go on your way**  - If it is not clear why Jesus said this, it could also be translated as "Go to the cities" or, "Go to the people" or, "Go bring in the people."
  * **behold, I send you out**  - The word "behold" alerts us to a new task for the disciples to do in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this. English uses "And now I am sending you out...”
  * **lambs**  - Lambs are baby sheep. They can't defend themselves against animals that attack them.
  * **wolves**  - Wolves are a kind of wild dog that attack and eat other animals, such as lambs. "Wolves" could also be translated as "coyotes" "jackals" "wild dogs" or "fierce dogs".
  * **I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves**  - This could also be translated as "When I send you out, you will be like lambs among wolves." The phrase "as lambs in the midst of wolves" is a simile. It means that the people Jesus was sending out could be attacked by the people they were going to. It could also be translated as "When I send you out, people will want to harm you as wolves attack sheep." Since this is a simile, the names of other animals could be substituted. (See [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:simile|Simile]])
  * **Carry no bag of money**  - That is, "Do not take a bag of money with you."
