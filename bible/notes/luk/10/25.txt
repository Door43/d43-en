\v 25 One day as Jesus was teaching people, a certain teacher of Jewish laws was there. He wanted to test Jesus by asking him a difficult question. So he stood up and asked, "Teacher, what must I do in order to live with God forever?"
\v 26 Jesus said to him, "You have read what Moses has written in the laws that God gave him. What do the laws say?"
\v 27 The man replied, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength and with all your mind. And love your neighbor as much as you love yourself."
\v 28 Jesus replied, "You have answered correctly. If you do all that, you will live with God forever."

  * **tested him**  - "tested Jesus"
  * **What is written in the law**  - This can be translated with an active verb: "What did Moses write in the law" or "What do the scriptures say?" (See: [[:en:ta:translate:active|Active or Passive]])
  * **How do you read it?**  - "What have you read in it?" or "What do you understand it to say?"
