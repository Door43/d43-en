\v 13 How terrible it will be for you people who live in the cities of Chorazin and Bethsaida, because you refuse to repent! If the miracles that I performed for you had been done in the ancient cities of Tyre and Sidon, the wicked people who lived there would long ago have shown that they were sorry for their sins by sitting on the ground wearing coarse cloth and putting ashes on their heads.
\v 14 So on the final day when God judges everyone, he will punish you more severely than the wicked people who lived in Tyre and Sidon because you did not repent and believe in me even though you saw me do miracles!
\v 15 I also have something to say to you people who live in the town of Capernaum. Do you think you will be honored up in heaven? On the contrary, you will be brought down to the place of the dead!"

\v 13 Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
\v 14 But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.
\v 15 You, Capernaum, do you think you will be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida!** - Jesus spoke as if the people of the cities of Chorazin and Bethsaida were there listening to him, but they were not. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **If the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon** - Jesus is describing a situation that could have happened in the past but did not. AT: "If someone had performed the miracles for the people of Tyre and Sidon that I performed for you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **they would have repented long ago** - "the wicked people who lived there would have shown that they were sorry for their sins" 
  * **sitting in sackcloth and ashes** - "wearing sackcloth and sitting in ashes"
  * **But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you** - It may be helpful to clearly state the reason for their judgment.

  * **do you think you will be exalted to heaven?** - Jesus uses a question to rebuke the people of Capernaum for their pride. AT: "you will certainly not go up to heaven!" or "God will not honor you!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) 
  * **exalted to heaven** - This expression means "greatly exalted."
  * **you will be brought down to Hades** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "you will go down to Hades" or "God will send you to Hades" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
