===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **sent them out by pairs**  - That is, "sent them out in groups of two," or "sent them out each group having two members."
    * **into every city**  - That is, "into every town." 
    * **where he himself intended to go** - That is, "where he himself planned to go," or "where he himself was about to go."
    * **the harvest is plentiful but the laborers are few** - Another way to say this is, "There is a big crop ready to pick, but there aren't enough workers."  This is a metaphor. It means that there are many people who are ready to be brought into God's Kingdom, but there are not enough workers to bring them in. It could also be translated as "There is a big crop of people ready to be harvested, but there are few workers to bring them in." (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor|Metaphor]])
