===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **seventy**  - "70." Some versions say "seventy-two" or "72." You may want to include a footnote that says that. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **sent them out by pairs**  - "sent them out in groups of two" or "sent them out with two people in each group"
  * **He said to them**  - This was before the men actually went out. This can be translated as "This is what he said to them" or "Before they went out he told them."
  * **The harvest is plentiful but the laborers are few**  - "There is a big crop, but not enough workers to bring it in." This metaphor means that there are many people who are ready to be brought into the [[en:obe:kt:kingdomofgod]])
