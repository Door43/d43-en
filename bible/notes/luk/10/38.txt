===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **Now as they were traveling along** - "Now as Jesus and his disciples were traveling along." Since this is a new part of the story, it may be more natural in some languages to say who "they" were. You language may have a way of indicating that this is a new part of the story.
    * **a certain village** - This introduces the village as a new location, but does not name it. 
    * **a certain woman named Martha** - This introduces Martha as a new character. Your language may have a way of introducing new people.
    * **sat at the Lord's feet**  - This can be translated as "sat on the floor and listened to the Lord teach." This was the normal respectful position for a learner in that day.
