\v 40 But Martha was overly busy with preparing to serve a meal. She came up to Jesus, and said, "Lord, do you not care that my sister left me to serve alone? Therefore tell her to help me."
\v 41 But the Lord answered and said to her, "Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things,
\v 42 but only one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen the best part, which will not be taken away from her."

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **do you not care** - Martha was complaining that the Lord was allowing Mary to sit listening to him when there was so much work to do. She respected the Lord, so she used a rhetorical question to soften her complaint. It can be translated as "It seems like you do not care."
    * **anxious and troubled**  - "worried and upset"
    * **the best part** - "what is best" or "what is important"
    * **which will not be taken away from her**  - or, "I will not take it away from her"
