===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus now speaks to his disciples. You may need to add an introductory comment such as "Jesus also said to his disciples" (UDB).

  * **All things have been entrusted to me from my Father** - AT: "My Father has handed everything over to me." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the Son** - Jesus was referring to himself in the third person. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **knows who the Son is** - The word that is translated as "knows" means to know from personal experience. God the Father knew Jesus to this degree.
  * **except the Father**  - This means "Only the Father knows who the Son is."
  * **knows who the Father is** - The word that is translated as "knows" means to know from personal experience. Jesus knew God his Father in that way
  * **except the Son**  - This means "Only the Son knows who the Father is." As the Son of God, Jesus has always known the Father intimately, and always will.
  * **and anyone to whom the Son desires to reveal him**  - AT: "people know who the Father is only if the Son wants to reveal the Father to them."
