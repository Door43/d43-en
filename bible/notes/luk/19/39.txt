===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **rebuke your disciples**  - AT: "tell your disciples to stop doing these things"
  * **I tell you**  - Jesus said this to emphasize what he would say next.
  * **If these were silent**  - This is a hypothetical situation. Some translators may need to  make it clear what Jesus was implying when he said this: "No, I will not rebuke them, for if these people were to be silentâ€¦" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]], [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the stones would cry out**  - "the stones would call out praises"
