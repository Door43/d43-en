  * **I tell you**  - Jesus said this to emphasize what he would say next.
  * **If these were silent**  - This is a hypothetical situation. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:hypothetical|Hypothetical Situations]]) Some translators may need to  make it clear what Jesus was implying when he said this: "No, I will not rebuke them, for if these people were to be silent…" (See: [[:en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]])
