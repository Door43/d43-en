===== translationNotes: =====

  * **in the multitude** - "in the large crowd"
  * **rebuke your disciples** - "tell your disciples to stop doing these things"
  * **I tell you** - Jesus said this to emphasize what he would say next.
  * **if these were silent...cry out.** - This is a hypothetical situation. Some translators may need to make it clear what Jesus was implying when he said this: "No, I will not rebuke them, for if these people were to be silent...cry out." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the stones would cry out** - "the stones would call out praises"
