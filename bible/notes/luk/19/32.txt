===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Those who were sent** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "The two disciples that Jesus sent" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the owners** - "the owners of the colt"
  * **Why are you untying...Lord has need of it** - This is the question and answer that Jesus predicted in [[:en:bible:notes:luk:19:29|19:31]] and should be translated the same as in that verse.
  * **threw their garments upon the colt** - "put their robes on the young donkey." Garments are clothes. In this case it refers to their outer robes or cloaks.
  * **set Jesus on it** - "helped Jesus get up on and ride on the colt"
  * **they spread their garments** - "people spread their garments" or "others spread their cloaks." This is a sign of giving honor to someone. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
