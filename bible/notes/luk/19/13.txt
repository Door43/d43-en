\v 13 Before he left, he summoned ten of his servants. He gave each of them an equal amount of money. He said to them, 'Do business with this money until I return!' Then he left.
\v 14 But many people of his country hated him. So they sent some messengers to follow him and say to the higher king, 'We do not want this man to be our king!'
\v 15 But he was made king anyway. Later he returned as the new king. Then he called in the servants to whom he had given the money. He wanted to know how much they had gained by doing business with the money he had given them.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **ten minas**  - The mina was a Hebrew coin worth 60 shekels. The mina was made of silver and weighed 571 grams (Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible). According to http://www.translatorscafe.com a single mina equaled approximately 150 denarii. A denarius was one-day's wages. So ten minas would be equal to 1,500-days' wages.
