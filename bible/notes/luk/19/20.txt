\v 20 Then another servant came. He said, 'Sir, here is your coin. I wrapped it in a napkin and put it away, \add so that nothing would happen to it\add*.
\v 21 I did that \add because\add* I was afraid \add of what you would do to me if the business failed. I know\add* you are a man who does not do foolish things with your money. You \add even\add* take \add from others money\add* that does not really belong to you\add , like a farmer who\add* harvests grain \add from another man's field\add* where he did not\add even\add* do the planting.'

\v 20 Then another servant came. He said, 'Sir, here is your money. I wrapped it up in a cloth and hid it to keep it safe.
\v 21 I was afraid of what you would do to me if the business failed. I know you are a hard man who takes from others that which does not really belong to you. You are like a farmer who harvests grain that another man planted.'

\v 20 And another came, saying, 'Lord, here is your mina, which I kept safely in a cloth,
\v 21 for I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man. You take up that which you did not lay down, and reap that which you did not sow.'
