\v 20 Then another servant came. He said, 'Sir, here is your money. I wrapped it up in a cloth and hid it to keep it safe.
\v 21 I was afraid of what you would do to me if the business failed. I know you are a hard man who takes from others that which does not really belong to you. You are like a farmer who harvests grain that another man planted.'
