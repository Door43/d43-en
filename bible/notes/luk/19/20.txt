You \add even\add* take \add from others money\add* that does not really belong to you\add , like a farmer who\add* harvests grain \add from another man's field\add* where he did not\add even\add* do the planting.'

\v 20 Then another servant came. He said, 'Sir, here is your money. I wrapped it up in a cloth and hid it to keep it safe.
\v 21 I was afraid of what you would do to me if the business failed. I know you are a hard man who takes from others that which does not really belong to you. You are like a farmer who harvests grain that another man planted.'

\v 20 And another came, saying, 'Lord, here is your mina, which I kept safely in a cloth,
\v 21 for I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man. You take up that which you did not lay down, and reap that which you did not sow.'

  * **a severe man**  - "a stern man" or "a man who expects a lot from his servants" or "a hard man" (UDB)
  * **you take up that which you did not lay down**  - This can be translated as "you take out what you did not put in" or "you take what is not yours." It was a proverb describing a greedy person. (See: [[:en:obe:other:Proverb]])
  * **reap**  - "harvest" or "collect" or "gather"
  * **reap that which you did not sow**  - "reap what you did not plant." This is a metaphor. The servant was comparing his master to a farmer who takes food that someone else planted. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
