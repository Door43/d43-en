\v 21 I did that \add because\add* I was afraid \add of what you would do to me if the business failed. I know\add* you are a man who does not do foolish things with your money. You \add even\add* take \add from others money\add* that does not really belong to you\add , like a farmer who\add* harvests grain \add from another man's field\add* where he did not\add even\add* do the planting.'

\v 20 And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is your pound, which I kept safely in a napkin:
\v 21 for I feared you, because you are an austere man: you take up that which you did not lay down, and reap that which you did not sow.
