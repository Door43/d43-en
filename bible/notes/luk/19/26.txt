===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I say to you** - This was the king speaking. Some translators may want to start this verse with "And the king replied, 'I say to you'" or "But the king said 'I tell you this'" .
  * **everyone who has** - It is implied that what he has is the money he earned by using his mina faithfully. AT: "everyone who uses well what he has been given" or "everyone who uses well what I have given him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **will be given more** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "I will give him more" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **from him that has not** - It is implied that the reason he does not have money is because he did not use his mina faithfully. AT: "from the person who does not use well what I have given him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **will be taken away** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "I will take away from him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **these enemies of mine** - Since the enemies were not right there, some languages would say "those enemies of mine."
