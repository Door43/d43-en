===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Jesus continues speaking outside the city of Jerusalem)
  * **For** - What follows is the reason for Jesus' sadness.
  * **the days will come upon you**  - This indicates that they would experience hard times. Some languages do not talk about time coming. So this can be translated as "In the future these things will happen to you" or "Soon you will endure troublesome times."
  * **you** - The word “you” is singular because Jesus was speaking to the city. But if this would be unnatural in your language, you could use a plural form of “you” to refer to the people of the city. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **barricade**  - A barricade is a wall to keep the people from getting out of the city.
  * **They will strike you down to the ground** - Since Jesus was speaking to the city, this refers to the walls and buildings of the city. It can also be translated as "They will destroy your walls" or "They will destroy your city." 
  * **and your children within you** - This refers to the people who lived in the city. If you have used the plural form of you in this passage, this could also be translated as "and they will kill you people in the city."
  * **They will not leave one stone upon another** - This is a hyperbole to express how completely the enemies would destroy the city which was built of stones. It can be translated as "They will not leave any of the stones in place." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **you did not know** - "you did not recognize" or "you did not acknowledge"
