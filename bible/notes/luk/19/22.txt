\v 22 He said to that servant, 'You wicked servant! I will condemn you by the words you just said. You knew I was a hard man, because I take what does not belong to me and harvest what I did not plant.
\v 23 So you should at least have given my money to money lenders! Then when I returned I could have collected that amount plus the interest it would have earned!'

\v 22 The nobleman said to him, 'By your own words I will judge you, you wicked servant. You knew that I am a severe man, taking up that which I did not lay down, and reaping that which I did not sow.
\v 23 Then why did you not put my money in the bank, so that when I returned I would have collected it with interest?'

===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues telling his parable.

  * **that I am a severe man, taking up…** - The nobleman was repeating what the servant had said about him. He was not saying that it was true.
  * **a severe man**  - "a harsh man"
  * **Why did you not put my money** - This starts a rhetorical question. It is used as a rebuke. It can be translated as "You should have put my money." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **put my money in the bank** - This can be translated as  "lent my money to a bank." Cultures that do not have banks might translate it as "let someone borrow my money."
  * **bank**  - A bank is a business that safely holds money for people. Banks lend that money to others for a profit. Therefore it pays an extra amount, or interest, to the people who keep their money in the bank.
  * **I would have collected it with interest** - This can be translated as "I could have collected that amount plus the interest it would have earned" (UDB) or "I would gain a profit from it."
  * **interest**  - Interest is money that a bank pays people who put their money in the bank.
