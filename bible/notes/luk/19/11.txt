\v 11 The people were listening to everything Jesus said. Since he was getting close to Jerusalem, Jesus decided to tell them another story. He wanted to correct their idea that as soon as he got to Jerusalem he would become king as God desired.
\v 12 He said, "A prince prepared to go to a distant country in order to receive from a higher king the right to become king over the country where he lived. After he received the right of being king, he would return to rule his people.

\v 12 He said therefore, "A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then to return.
