\v 2 He saw two \add fishing\add* boats at the edge of the lake. The fishermen had gone out of the boats and were washing their \add fishing\add* nets \add on the shore\add*. One of the boats belonged to Simon.
\v 3 Jesus got in that boat and asked Simon to push the boat a little bit away from the shore \add so that he could speak to the crowd more easily. Jesus\add* sat in the boat and taught the people \add who were on the shore\add*.

  * **lake of Genessaret**  - This refers to the Sea of Galilee.
  * **lying**  - Or, "having been laid."
  * **washing their nets**  - That is, they were cleaning them to be used again to catch fish.
