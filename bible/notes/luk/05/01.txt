\v 1 One day while many people were crowding around him to hear the message from God, Jesus was standing on the shore of Gennesaret Lake, \add which is also called Lake Galilee\add*.
\v 2 He saw two \add fishing\add* boats at the edge of the lake. The fishermen had gone out of the boats and were washing their \add fishing\add* nets \add on the shore\add*. One of the boats belonged to Simon.
\v 3 Jesus got in that boat and asked Simon to push the boat a little bit away from the shore \add so that he could speak to the crowd more easily. Jesus\add* sat in the boat and taught the people \add who were on the shore\add*.

  * **washing their nets**  - They were cleaning their fishing nets in order to use them again them again to catch fish.
  * **asked him to put it out into the water**  - This could also be translated as "asked Peter to move the boat farther into the water." Peter probably got into the boat with Jesus to do this.
