He said, "People never tear a piece of cloth from a new garment and attach it to an old garment \add to mend it\add*. If they did that, not only would they be ruining the new garment by tearing it, but the new piece of cloth would not match the old garment.

\v 36 Then Jesus gave other examples to explain what he meant: He said, "People never tear a piece of cloth from a new garment and attach it to an old garment to mend it. If they did that, they would ruin the new garment by tearing it and the new piece of cloth would not match the old garment.

\v 36 Then Jesus also spoke a parable to them: "No man tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and uses it to mend an old garment; if he did that, he would tear the new cloth, and the piece of cloth from the new garment would not fit with the cloth of the old garment.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **he would tear the new cloth**  - This is a new piece of cloth that hasn't been washed with the rest of the cloth to which it is sewn. So, the new cloth will shrink when washed and dried, but the old cloth of the garment has already been washed and shrunken. The new cloth tears from the old cloth when it shrinks.
