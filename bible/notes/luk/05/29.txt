\v 29 Later on, Levi prepared a big feast in his own house for Jesus and his disciples. There was a large group of tax collectors and others eating together with them.
\v 30 Some men who belonged to the Pharisee sect, including those of them who taught Jewish laws, complained to Jesus' disciples, saying, "You should not be eating with tax collectors and other terrible sinners.
\v 31 Then Jesus said to them, "It is people who are sick who know they need a doctor, not those who think they are well.
\v 32 Similarly, I did not come from heaven to invite those who think they are righteous to come to me. On the contrary, I came to invite those who know that they are sinners, to turn from their sinful behavior and come to me."

\v 29 Then Levi gave a big banquet in his house for Jesus. There were many tax collectors there and other people who were reclining at the table and eating with them.
\v 30 But the Pharisees and their scribes were complaining to his disciples, saying, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and other sinful people?"
\v 31 Jesus answered them, "People who are well do not need a physician; only those who are sick.
\v 32 I did not come to call righteous people to repentance, but to call sinners to repentance."
