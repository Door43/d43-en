===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **behold**  - This phrase is often used to show the beginning of a new or important event. It also can be used to show where the action begins. If your language has a phrase that is used in this way, consider whether it would be natural to use it here.
  * **full of leprosy**  - That is, he was visibly covered in leprosy. In advanced stages, leprosy will cause the nose and fingers of a person to rot off their bodies, and patches of their skin will be visibly rotting on their bodies.
