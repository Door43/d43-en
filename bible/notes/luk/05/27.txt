===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - When Jesus leaves the house, he calls Levi, the Jewish tax collector, to follow him. Levi prepares a big meal for Jesus which annoys the Pharisees and scribes.

  * **saw a tax collector** - "looked at a tax collector with attention" or "looked carefully at a tax collector"
  * **Follow me** - To "follow" someone was a term that means to become their disciple. AT: "Be my disciple" or "Come, follow me as your teacher" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **leaving everything behind** - "left his work as a tax collector"
