===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **to tell no one** - This is an indirect quote. It can also be translated as a direct quote "Do not tell anyone." The implied information is "that you have been healed." (See: [[en:ta:vocabulary:quotation|Speech Quotations]], [[en:ta:vocabulary:implicitexplicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]])
    * **sacrifice for cleansing**  - The law required a specific sacrifice to accompany the declaration of cleansing. This allowed the person to be declared both physically and ceremonially clean, and able to again participate with religious rituals.
    * **for a testimony to them**  - "for a testimony to the priests" or "so that the priests will declare that you have truly been healed." The priests in the temple would be legal witnesses that his leprosy was actually cured.
