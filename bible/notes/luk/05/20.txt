===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Man**  - This is a general word that people used when speaking to a man whose name they did not know. It was not rude, but it also did not show special respect. Some languages might use a word like "friend" or "brother" or "sir."
  * **your sins are forgiven you**  - "you are forgiven" or "I forgive your sins" (UDB)
  * **question this**  - "discuss this" or "reason about this." This could also be translated as "discuss whether or not Jesus had authority to forgive sins."
  * **Who is this who speaks blasphemies?** - This rhetorical question shows how shocked and angry they were at what Jesus said. It could also be translated as "This man is blaspheming God" or "He blasphemes God by saying that" or "Who does he think he is to blaspheme God like that?" (See [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Who can forgive sins, but God alone?** - This rhetorical question can also be translated as "No one can forgive sins but God alone" or "God is the only one who can forgive sins." The implied information is that if a person claims to forgive sins he is pretending to be God. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]], [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
