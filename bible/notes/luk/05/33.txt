\v 33 Those Jewish leaders said to Jesus, "The disciples of John the Baptizer often abstain from food and pray, and the disciples of the Pharisees do that, too. But your disciples keep on eating and drinking! Why do they not fast like the others?"
\v 34 Jesus answered, You do not tell the friends of the bridegroom to fast while he is still with them, do you? No, no one would do that!
\v 35 But some day the bridegroom will be taken away  from his friends. Then, at that time, they will abstain from food."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **they said to him**  - "the religious leaders said to Jesus"
  * **Can anyone make**  - Jesus used this rhetorical question to cause the people to think about a situation that they already know. It can also be translated as "No one tells the wedding attendants of the bridegroom to fast while he is still with them." (See [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **wedding attendants**  - "guests" or "friends." These are friends who celebrate with a man who is getting married.
  * **But the days will come when**  - "But some day" (UDB) or "But soon"
  * **the bridegroom will be taken away from them**  - This is a metaphor. Jesus was speaking about himself. This can be made explicit by adding "In the same way, my disciples cannot fast while I am with them." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
