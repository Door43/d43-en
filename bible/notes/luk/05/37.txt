\v 37 Neither does anyone put freshly-\add squeezed\add* grape juice into old skin bags \add to store it\add*. If anyone did that, the grape juice would burst the skin bags \add because they would not stretch when the\add* new \add wine ferments and expands. Then\add* the skin bags would be ruined, and\add the wine\add* would\add also\add* be spilled.
\v 38 On the contrary, new wine must be put into new wineskins.
\p
\v 39 Furthermore, those who have drunk \add only\add* old wine \add are content with that\add*. They do not want to drink the new wine, because they say, 'The old wine is \f + \ft metaphor \f* good!'~"

\v 37 And no one puts newly-squeezed wine into old skin bags to store it. If anyone did that, the skin bags would tear open because they would not stretch when the new wine fermented and expanded. Then the skin bags would be ruined, and the wine would also be ruined because it would spill out..
\v 38 On the contrary, new wine must be put into new skin bags.
\p
\v 39 Furthermore, those who have drunk only old wine are content with that. They do not want to drink the new wine, because they say, 'The old wine is  good!'"

<usfm>
\v 37 And no man puts new wine into old wineskins. If he did that, the new wine would burst the skins, and the wine would be spilled, and the wineskins would be destroyed.
\v 38 But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.
\v 39 And no man, after drinking old wine, desires new wine, because he says, 'The old is better.'"

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **wine**  - That is, fermented grape juice.
    * **wineskins****
 - **  These are the containers in which the juice is fermented. At that time, a bottle made from skin. An older bottle would not be strong enough to withstand the fermentation process, so it would explode.
    * **The old is better**  - Wine is generally believed to improve in taste as it ages.
