\v 37 Neither does anyone put freshly-\add squeezed\add* grape juice into old skin bags \add to store it\add*. If anyone did that, the grape juice would burst the skin bags \add because they would not stretch when the\add* new \add wine ferments and expands. Then\add* the skin bags would be ruined, and\add the wine\add* would\add also\add* be spilled.
\v 38 On the contrary, new wine must be put into new wineskins.
\p
\v 39 Furthermore, those who have drunk \add only\add* old wine \add are content with that\add*. They do not want to drink the new wine, because they say, 'The old wine is \f + \ft metaphor \f* good!'~"

<usfm>
\v 37 And no one puts newly squeezed wine into old skin bags to store it. If anyone did that, the skin bags would tear open because they would not stretch when the new wine fermented and expanded. Then the skin bags would be ruined, and the wine would also be ruined because it would spill out.
\v 38 On the contrary, new wine must be put into new skin bags.
\p
\v 39 Furthermore, those who have drunk only old wine are content with that. They do not want to drink the new wine, because they say, 'The old wine is good!'"

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 37 No one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does that, the new wine would burst the skins, and the wine would be spilled, and the wineskins would be destroyed.
\v 38 But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.
\v 39 No one after drinking old wine wants the new, for he says, 'The old is better.'"

  * [[:en:obe:other:wine]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **no one puts** - "people never put" or "no one puts" 
  * **new wine** - "grape juice." This refers to wine that has not yet fermented.
  * **wineskins** - These were bags made out of animal skins. They could also be called "wine bags" or "bags made of skin."
  * **the new wine would burst the skins** - When the new wine ferments and expands, it breaks the old skins because they can no longer stretch out. Jesus' audience would have understood the information about the wine's fermenting and expanding. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the wine would be spilled** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the wine would spill out of the bags" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **fresh wineskins** - "new wineskins" or "new wine bags." This refers to new wineskins, unused.
  * **drinking old wine ... wants the new** - This metaphor contrasts the old teaching of the religious leaders against the new teaching of Jesus. The point is that people who are used to the old teaching are not willing to listen to the new things that Jesus is teaching. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **old wine** - "wine that has fermented"
  * **for he says, 'The old is better.'** - It may be helpful to add: "and he is therefore not willing to try the new wine" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
