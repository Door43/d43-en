===== Translation Notes: =====

    * (Jesus tells the religious leaders another parable.)
    * **no man puts** - "no one puts" (UDB) or "people never put"
    * **new wine**  - "grape juice." This refers to wine that has not fermented yet.
    * **wineskins** - These were bags made out of animal skins. They could also be called "wine bags" or "skin bags" (UDB).
    * **the new wine would burst the skins** -  "when the new wine ferments and expands, it would burst the old skins because they could no longer stretch out." Jesus' audience would have understood the implicit information about the wine fermenting and expanding. (See: [[en:ta:vocabulary:implicitexplicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]])
    * **the wine would be spilled** - "the wine would spill out of the bags"
    * **fresh wineskins** - "new wineskins" or "new wine bags." This refers to wineskins that have not been used.
    * **old wine** - "wine that has fermented"
    * **The old is better**  - Wine is generally believed to improve in taste as it ages.
