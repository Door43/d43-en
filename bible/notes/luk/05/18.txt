\v 18 While Jesus was there, several men brought to him a man who was paralyzed. They were carrying the man on a sleeping pad and tried  to bring him into the house to lay him down in front of Jesus.
\v 19 But they were not able to bring him in because there was such a large crowd of people in the house, so they went up the outside steps onto the roof. Then they removed some of the tiles from the roof to make an opening. They lowered the man on his sleeping pad through the opening into the middle of the crowd and put him down right in front of Jesus.

<usfm>
\v 18 Now some men came, carrying on a mat a man that was paralyzed, and they looked for a way to bring him inside in order to lay him down in front of Jesus.
\v 19 Not finding by what way they might bring him in because of the crowd, they went up to the housetop and let the man down through the tiles, on his mat, into the midst of the people, right in front of Jesus.

    * **Now some men came carrying** - These are new people in the story. Your language may have a way of showing that these are new people. English can also do it with “There were men who came carrying” or “There were men carrying.”
    * **mat**  - This could be translated as "sleeping pad" or "bed" or "stretcher" or "couch."
    * **was paralyzed**  -  "could not move himself" 
    * **And not finding by what way they might bring him in because of the crowd** - In some languages it might be more natural to reorder this. "But because of the crowd of people, they could not find a way to take the man inside. So...."
    * **they went up to the housetop** - Houses had flat roofs, and some houses had a ladder or staircase outside to make it easy to go up there.
    * **right in front of Jesus** - "directly in front of Jesus" or "immediately in front of Jesus"
