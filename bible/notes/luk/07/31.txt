===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Jesus talks about the people who have rejected him and John the Baptizer.)
  * **To what should I compare**  - This is the start of a rhetorical question. Jesus used it to introduce a comparison that he was about to make. This whole question could also be translated as, "This is what I will compare this generation to. This is what they are like." (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **the people of this generation**  - "the people living now" or "these people" or "you people of this generation"
  * **They are like**  - This is the beginning of Jesus' comparison. This is a simile (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:simile|Simile]]). Jesus is saying that the people of this generation were like children who were never satisfied with the way other children acted.
  * **marketplace**  - This was a large, open-air area where people would come to sell their goods.
  * **flute**  - This is a long, hollow musical instrument which is played by blowing air in or over one end.
  * **and you did not dance**  - "but you did not dance to the music"
  * **and you did not weep**  - "but you did not weep with us"
