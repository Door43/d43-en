    * [[:en:bible:notes:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]
    * [[:en:bible:notes:key-terms:israel|Israel]]
    * [[:en:bible:notes:key-terms:servant|servant]]


===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **I say to you** - Jesus said this to add emphasize to the surprising thing that he was about to tell them.
    * **not even in Israel**  - "not even among the people of Israel." The implication is that Jesus had expected to find Jewish people who had this kind of faith, but he didn't. He would not have expected to find a Gentile with this kind of faith, yet he did. You could add the implied information "as this man who is not a Jew has." (See the next note.)
    * **with so much faith** - This could also be translated as "who has as much faith as this man who is not a Jew has" or "who believes in God as strong as this believes." 
    * **those who were sent** - "the people whom the Roman officer had sent to Jesus"
