===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I say to you**  - Jesus said this to emphasize the surprising thing that he was about to tell them.
  * **not even in Israel have I found anyone with so much faith**  - The implication is that Jesus expected Jewish people to have this kind of faith, but they didn't. He did not expect Gentiles to have this kind of faith, yet this man did. You may need to add this implied information as the UDB does. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **those who were sent**  - "the people whom the Roman officer had sent to Jesus"
