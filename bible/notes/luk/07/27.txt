===== Translation Notes: =====
Jesus continues to talk to the people about John the Baptizer.

  * **This is he of whom it is written**  - "That prophet is the one the prophets wrote about" or "John is the one the prophets wrote about long ago"
  * **Beholdâ€¦**  - In this verse, Jesus is quoting from the prophet Malachi and saying that John was that messenger in the writings of Malachi [[en:bible:notes:mal:03:01|3:1]] .
  * **before your face**  - "in front of you" or "to go ahead of you." The word "you" is singular, because God was speaking to the Messiah in the quotation. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **I say to you**  - Jesus was speaking to the crowd, so "you" is plural. Jesus said this to emphasize the truth of the surprising thing he was about to say next. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **among them that are born of women**  - "among those to whom a woman has given birth." This is a figure of speech referring to all people. It could also be translated as "of all the people who have ever lived."
  * **no one is greater than John**  - This can be translated positively as "John is the greatest."
  * **the least important person in the kingdom of God**  - This refers to a person who will be part of the kingdom that God will establish." This could be translated as "who has entered into the kingdom of God."
  * **greater that he is**  - "higher spiritual status than John"
