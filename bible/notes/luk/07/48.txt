  * **are forgiven**  - Or, "have been forgiven." or, "I forgive your sins."
  * **Your faith has saved you**  - "Because of your faith, you are saved." Some languages have a verb meaning "believe" but no verb meaning "faith" or "belief." They could translate this as "You believe. That has saved you" or "Because you believe, you are saved" or "Because you believe, God has saved you."
