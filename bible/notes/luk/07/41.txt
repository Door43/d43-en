\v 41 Jesus replied, "Two people owed some money to a man who \add earned money by\add* lending \add it to others\add*. One owed him five hundred silver coins, and the other owed him fifty silver coins.
\v 42 Neither of them was able to pay back \add what he owed\add*, so the man \add very kindly\add* said that they did not have to pay back anything. So, which of those two men will love that man more?"
\v 43 Simon replied, "I think that the one who owed the most money and did not have to pay it back \add will love him more\add*." Jesus said to him, "That is correct."

\v 41 Jesus told him this story: "Two people owed money to a man who had a business lending money to people. One of these people owed him five hundred silver coins, and the other one owed him fifty silver coins.
\v 42 Neither of them was able to pay back what he owed, so the man very kindly said that they did not have to pay back anything. So, which of those two men will love that man more?"
\v 43 Simon replied, "I assume that the one who had owed him the most money will love him more." Jesus said to him, "You are correct."

\v 41 Jesus said, "There were two debtors to a certain lender. The one was owing five hundred denarii, and the other was owing fifty denarii.
\v 42 Since they had no money to pay, he forgave them both. Therefore, which of them will love him more?"
\v 43 Simon answered him by saying, "I suppose the one whom he forgave the most." And Jesus said to him, "You have judged correctly."
