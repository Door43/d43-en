\v 33 \add Similarly, you people are dissatisfied with both John the Baptizer and me!\add* When John came and \add preached to you\add*, he did not eat \add ordinary\add* food \f + \ft synecdoche \f* or drink wine, \add like most people do\add*. But you \add rejected him\add*, saying, 'A demon is controlling him!'
\v 34 In\add contrast\add*, \add I\add*, the one who came from heaven, eat \add the same food\add* and drink \add wine as others do\add*. But you \add reject me\add*, saying, 'Look! \add This man\add* eats too much food and drinks too much wine, and he associates with tax collectors and \add other\add* sinners!'
\v 35 But those who are \add truly God's\add* children \f + \ft personification \f* realize that \add what John and I do is truly\add* wise."

\v 33 Similarly, when John came to you and did not eat ordinary food or drink wine, you rejected him and said, 'A demon is controlling him!'
\v 34 But when the Son of Man came to you and did eat ordinary food and drink wine as others do, you also rejected him and said, 'Look! This man eats too much food and drinks too much wine, and he associates with tax collectors and other sinners!'
\v 35 But God's wisdom is proved right by those who follow it.

<usfm>
\v 33 For John the Baptizer came not eating bread and not drinking wine and you say, 'He has a demon.'
\v 34 The Son of Man came eating and drinking and you say, 'Behold, he is a gluttonous man and a drunkard, and a friend of tax collectors and sinners!'
\v 35 But wisdom is justified by all of her children."
