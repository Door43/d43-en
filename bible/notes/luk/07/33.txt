\v 33 \add Similarly, you people are dissatisfied with both John the Baptizer and me!\add* When John came and \add preached to you\add*, he did not eat \add ordinary\add* food \f + \ft synecdoche \f* or drink wine, \add like most people do\add*. But you \add rejected him\add*, saying, 'A demon is controlling him!'
\v 34 In\add contrast\add*, \add I\add*, the one who came from heaven, eat \add the same food\add* and drink \add wine as others do\add*. But you \add reject me\add*, saying, 'Look! \add This man\add* eats too much food and drinks too much wine, and he associates with tax collectors and \add other\add* sinners!'
\v 35 But those who are \add truly God's\add* children \f + \ft personification \f* realize that \add what John and I do is truly\add* wise."

\v 33 Similarly, when John came to you and did not eat ordinary food or drink wine, you rejected him and said, 'A demon is controlling him!'
\v 34 But when the Son of Man came to you and did eat ordinary food and drink wine as others do, you also rejected him and said, 'Look! This man eats too much food and drinks too much wine, and he associates with tax collectors and other sinners!'
\v 35 But God's wisdom is proved right by those who follow it.

\v 33 For John the Baptizer came not eating bread and not drinking wine and you say, 'He has a demon.'
\v 34 The Son of Man came eating and drinking and you say, 'Behold, he is a gluttonous man and a drunkard, and a friend of tax collectors and sinners!'
\v 35 But wisdom is justified by all of her children."

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * (Jesus continues speaking to the people. He explains why he compared them to children.)
    * **you say, 'He has a demon'** - Jesus was quoting what people were saying about John. It can be translated as an indirect quote: "you say that he has a demon" or "you accuse him of having a demon." (See: [[en:ta:vocabulary:quotation|Speech Quotations]])
    * **not eating bread** - "not eating food." This can be translated as "frequently fasting." It does not mean that John never ate food.
    *  **you say, 'Behold, he is a gluttonous man** - Jesus was quoting what the people were saying about the Son of Man. This can be translated as an indirect quote: "you say that he is a gluttonous man" or "you accuse him of being a gluttonous man."
    * **he is a gluttonous man**  -  "he is a greedy eater" or "he habitually eats too much food" 
    * **a drunkard**  - "a drunk" or "a habitual drunk"
    * **wisdom is justified by all of her children**  - This is probably a proverb that Jesus was applying to this situation, because the people who rejected both him and John were not being wise. (See: [[en:bible:notes:key-terms:proverb|proverb]]) It can be translated with an active clause. "All of wisdom's children justify her." (See: [[en:ta:vocabulary:active|Active or Passive]]) Wisdom is treated as if it were a woman who has children. Wisdom's children are people who follow wisdom. (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:personification|Personification]])
