\v 33 \add Similarly, you people are dissatisfied with both John the Baptizer and me!\add* When John came and \add preached to you\add*, he did not eat \add ordinary\add* food \f + \ft synecdoche \f* or drink wine, \add like most people do\add*. But you \add rejected him\add*, saying, 'A demon is controlling him!'
\v 34 In\add contrast\add*, \add I\add*, the one who came from heaven, eat \add the same food\add* and drink \add wine as others do\add*. But you \add reject me\add*, saying, 'Look! \add This man\add* eats too much food and drinks too much wine, and he associates with tax collectors and \add other\add* sinners!'
\v 35 But those who are \add truly God's\add* children \f + \ft personification \f* realize that \add what John and I do is truly\add* wise."

\v 33 Similarly, when John came to you and did not eat ordinary food or drink wine, you rejected him and said, 'A demon is controlling him!'
\v 34 But when the Son of Man came to you and he ate ordinary food and drink wine as others do, then you rejected him and said, 'Look! This man eats too much food and drinks too much wine, and he associates with tax collectors and other sinners!'
\v 35 But God's wisdom is proved right by those who follow it.

<usfm>
\v 33 For John the Baptist came eating no bread and drinking no wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.'
\v 34 The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, 'Look, he is a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!'
\v 35 But wisdom is justified by all her children."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **eating no bread** - Possible meanings are 1) "frequently fasting" or 2) "not eating normal food."
  * **you say, 'He has a demon.'** - Jesus was quoting what people were saying about John. This can be stated without the direct quote. AT: "you say that he has a demon." or "you accuse him of having a demon." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **The Son of Man** - Jesus expected the people to understand that he was referring to himself. AT: "I, the Son of Man" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **you say, 'Look, he is a gluttonous man and a drunkard ... sinners!'** - This can be translated as an indirect quote. AT: "you say that he is a gluttonous man and a drunkard ... sinners." or "you accuse him of eating and drinking too much and of being ... sinners." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **you say, 'Look, he is a gluttonous man and a drunkard ... sinners!'** - If you translated "The Son of Man" as "I, the Son of man," you can state this as an indirect statement and use the first person. AT: "you say that I am a gluttonous man and a drunkard ... sinners." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **he is a gluttonous man** - "he is a greedy eater" or "he continually eats too much food"
  * **a drunkard** - "a drunk" or "he continually drinks too much alcohol"
  * **wisdom is justified by all her children** - This appears to be a proverb that Jesus applied to this situation. It probably means that wise people would understand that the people should not have rejected Jesus and John. (See: [[:en:obe:other:proverb]])
