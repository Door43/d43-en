\v 11 And some time after that, it happened that Jesus was traveling to a city called Nain, and His disciples were going with him, along with a large crowd of people. 
\v 12 And as he came near to the city gate, behold, a dead man was being carried out, an only son to his mother, and she was a widow, and a sizeable crowd from the city was with her.
\v 13 And seeing her, the Lord was deeply moved with compassion for her and said to her, "Do not cry."
\v 14 And coming forward, he touched the funeral couch, and those carrying it stood still. And he said, "Young man, I say to you , arise."
\v 15 And the dead man sat up, and began to speak. And Jesus gave him to his mother.
