\v 11 Soon after that, Jesus traveled to the town of Nain. His disciples and a large crowd went with him.

\v 11 Soon after that Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a great crowd went with him.
\v 12 As he came near to the gate of the town, behold, a man who had died was being carried out, the only son of his mother (who was a widow), and a rather large crowd from the town was with her.
\v 13 When the Lord saw her, he was deeply moved with compassion for her and said to her, "Do not cry."
\v 14 Then he went up and touched the wooden frame on which they carried the body, and those carrying it stood still. He said, "Young man, I say to you, arise."
\v 15 The dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him to his mother.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus goes to the city of Nain, where he heals a man who had died.


  * **Nain** - the name of a city (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **the city gate** - "the entrance to the city"
  * **behold, a man who had died** - The word "behold" alerts us to the introduction of the dead man into the story. Your language may have a way of doing this. AT: "there was a dead man who" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_participants]])
  * **a man who had died was being carried out** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "people were carrying out of the city a man who had died" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the only son of his mother (who was a widow)** - "He was his mother's only son, and she was a widow." This is background information about the dead man and his mother. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **widow** - a woman whose husband has died
  * **was deeply moved with compassion for her** - "felt very sorry for her"
  * **he went up** - "he went forward" or "he approached the dead man"
  * **the wooden frame on which they carried the body** - This was a stretcher or bed used to move the body to the burial place. It did not have to be something in which the body was buried. Other translations may have the less common "bier" or "funeral couch."
  * **I say to you** - Jesus said this to emphasize his authority. AT: "Listen to me!"
  * **The dead man** - The man was not still dead; he was now alive. It may be necessary to state this clearly. AT: "The man who had been dead"
