\v 11 Some time after that, it happened that Jesus was traveling to a city called Nain. His disciples were going with him, along with a large crowd of people. 
\v 12 As he came near to the city gate, behold, a dead man was being carried out, an only son to his mother. She was a widow, and a sizeable crowd from the city was with her.
\v 13 Seeing her, the Lord was deeply moved with compassion for her and said to her, "Do not cry."
\v 14 Then he came forward and touched the funeral couch, and those carrying it stood still. He said, "Young man, I say to you, arise."
\v 15 The dead man sat up and began to speak. Then  Jesus gave him to his mother.
