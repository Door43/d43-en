===== Translation Notes: =====
Luke, the author of this book, comments on how people responded to John and Jesus.

    * **they declared that God is righteous**  - "they said that God had shown himself to be righteous" or "they declared that God had acted righteously"
    * **who had been baptized with the baptism of John**  - "who had been baptized by John" or "whom John had baptized"
    * **who were not baptized by him** - "whom John had not baptized" or "who had refused to be baptized by John" or "who had rejected John's baptism"
    * **Who were not baptized by him, rejected God's wisdom for themselves** - This seems to imply that because they had rejected John's baptism, were not spiritually prepared to accept God's will for them.
    * **rejected God's wisdom for themselves** -  "chose to disobey what God told them" or "chose not to believe God's will" 
    * **God's wisdom for them** - "God's purpose for them" or "God's plan for them" or "what God wanted them to do"
