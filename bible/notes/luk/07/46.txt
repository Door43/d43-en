\v 46 You did not anoint my head with olive oil, but she has anointed my feet with fragrant perfume.
\v 47 So I tell you that she has been forgiven for her many sins and that is why she loves me very much. But a person who thinks he has only a few sins, and has been forgiven, will love me only a little bit."

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * (Jesus continues speaking to Simon.)
    * **anoint my head with oil** - "put oil on my head." This was a way of welcoming an honored guest. It could be translated as "welcome me by anointing my head with oil."
    * **anointed my feet**  - Though this was probably not a common practice, the woman greatly honored Jesus by doing this.
    * **has been forgiven much** - This can also be translated in the active voice with "who has received much forgiveness" or "whom God has forgiven much."
    * **has also loved much** - "has also loved much the one who forgave her" or "has also love God much." Some languages require that the object of "love" be stated. 
    * **He who is being forgiven only a little** - "He who is forgiven little" or "Anyone who is forgiven little." In this sentence Jesus states a general principle. However, Simon was expected to understand that Jesus was saying that Simon had loved little.
