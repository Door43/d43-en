\v 46 You did not \add follow our custom of welcoming guests by\add* anointing my head with \add olive\add* oil, but she has anointed my feet with fragrant perfume.

\v 46 You did not anoint my head with olive oil, but she has anointed my feet with fragrant perfume.
\v 47 So I tell you that she has been forgiven for her many sins and that is why she loves me very much. But a person who thinks he has only a few sins, and has been forgiven, will love me only a little bit."

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues speaking to Simon.

  * **anoint my head with oil** - "put oil on my head." This was a way of welcoming an honored guest. AT: "welcome me by anointing my head with oil."
  * **anointed my feet** - Though this was probably not a common practice, the woman greatly honored Jesus by doing this.
  * **has been forgiven much** - AT: "who has received much forgiveness" or "whom God has forgiven much" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **has also loved much** - Some languages require that the object of "love" be stated. AT: "has also loved much the one who forgave her" or "has also loved God much."
  * **he who is forgiven only a little** - "anyone who is forgiven little." In this sentence Jesus states a general principle. However, Simon was expected to understand that Jesus was saying that Simon had loved little. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
