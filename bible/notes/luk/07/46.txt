\v 46 You did not \add follow our custom of welcoming guests by\add* anointing my head with \add olive\add* oil, but she has anointed my feet with fragrant perfume.
\v 47 So I will tell you that even though she has sinned very much, she has been forgiven \f + \ft Or:\add I\add* have forgiven her \f*. \add By what she has done she has shown that\add* she loves \add me\add* very much. But a person who has \add sinned\add* just a little bit, but whom \add I\add* have forgiven, will love \add me just a little bit\add*."

<usfm>
\v 46 You did not anoint my head with olive oil, but she has anointed my feet with fragrant perfume.
\v 47 So I tell you that she has been forgiven for her many sins and that is why she loves me very much. But a person who thinks he has only a few sins, and has been forgiven, will love me only a little bit."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 46 You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with perfumed oil.
\v 47 Therefore I say to you, her sins, which were many, have been forgiven—for she loved much. But the one who is forgiven little, loves little."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **You did not ... but she** - Jesus continues to contrast Simon's poor hospitality with the actions of the woman.
  * **anoint my head with oil** - "put oil on my head." This was the custom to welcome an honored guest. AT: "welcome me by anointing my head with oil" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **anointed my feet** - The woman greatly honored Jesus by doing this. She demonstrated humility by anointing his feet instead of his head.
  * **I say to you** - This emphasizes the importance of the statement that follows.
  * **her sins, which were many, have been forgiven** - This can be stated in active form. AT:  "God has forgiven her many sins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **for she loved much** - Her love was the evidence that her sins were forgiven. Some languages require that the object of "love" be stated. AT: "for she greatly loves the one who forgave her" or "for she loves God very much"
  * **the one who is forgiven little** - "anyone who is forgiven only a few things." In this sentence Jesus states a general principle. However, he expected Simon to understand that he showed very little love for Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
