\v 36 Now one of Pharisees invited Jesus to eat with him. So after Jesus entered into the Pharisee's house and he reclined at the table to eat.
\v 37 Behold, there was a woman in the city, who was a sinner. When she found out that he was reclining at the table in the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster jar of perfumed oil.
\v 38 As she stood behind him near his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and she wiped them with the hair of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with perfumed oil.
