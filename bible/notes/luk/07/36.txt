\v 36 Now a certain Pharisee was requesting that Jesus eat with him. So after Jesus entered into the Pharisee's house, he reclined at the table to eat. 
\v 37 Behold, there was a certain woman in the city who was a sinner. She found out that he was reclining in the Pharisee's house, and she brought an alabaster flask of perfume. 
\v 38 She stood behind him near his feet and wept. Then she began to wet his feet with her tears, and was wiping them with the hairs of her head, kissing his feet, and anointing them with perfume.
