He said to them, "\add Think about\add* what sort of person you went to see in the desolate area \add when you went there to see John\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. \add You did not go there to listen to a man who constantly changed the nature of his message\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add like\add* a reed that is blown back and forth by the wind \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*.
\v 25 Then what kind of man did you go there to see \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? Was he \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* a man who wore expensive clothes? No! \add You know very well that\add* people who wear beautiful clothes and live in luxury are in kings' palaces, \add not in the desolate areas\add*!
\v 26 Then what \add kind of person\add* did you go to see? \add Did you\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add go there to see John because he was\add* a prophet? Yes! But I will tell you that \add John is\add* more \add important\add* than an \add ordinary\add* prophet.

\v 24 When the men whom John had sent left, Jesus began to talk to the crowd of people about John. He said, "What did you go into the wilderness to see? A thin stalk of a plant shaken by the wind?
\v 25 But what did you go out to see? A man in fancy clothing? Look, those who wear splendid clothes and who have the best of everything live in kings' palaces.
\v 26 Then what did you go out there to see? A prophet? Yes! But I tell you that John is more important than an ordinary prophet.

\v 24 And after John's messengers had gone away, Jesus began to say to the crowds about John, "What did you go out into the desert to see -- a reed being shaken by the wind?
\v 25 But what did you go out to see -- a man dressed in soft clothes? Behold, people who dress in splendid clothing and live in luxury are in kings' palaces.

\v 26 But what did you go out to see -- a prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **a reed shaken by the wind** - That is "Did you go out to see a reed shaken by the wind? Reeds are a water plant. When they die, a hollow rigid stalk remains standing out of the water or swampy area. When the wind blows through the dead reeds, they make a lot of noise, but are very fragile and fairly useless. A reed is a frequent metaphor for a useless or false hope. (See: en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor|Metaphor)
    * **dressed in** -  "wearing"
    * **king's palaces** - 
    * **and much more than a prophet** - That is, "You went out to see someone who is much more important than a prophet."
