He said to them, "\add Think about\add* what sort of person you went to see in the desolate area \add when you went there to see John\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. \add You did not go there to listen to a man who constantly changed the nature of his message\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add like\add* a reed that is blown back and forth by the wind \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*.
\v 25 Then what kind of man did you go there to see \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? Was he \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* a man who wore expensive clothes?

\v 24 When the men whom John had sent left, Jesus began to talk to the crowd of people about John. He said, "What did you go into the wilderness to see? A thin stalk of a plant shaken by the wind?
\v 25 But what did you go out to see? A man in fancy clothing? Look, those who wear splendid clothes and who have the best of everything live in kings' palaces.
\v 26 Then what did you go out there to see? A prophet? Yes! But I tell you that John is more important than an ordinary prophet.

\v 24 After John's messengers had gone away, Jesus began to say to the crowds about John, "What did you go out into the desert to see, a reed being shaken by the wind?
\v 25 But what did you go out to see, a man dressed in soft clothes? See, people who dress in splendid clothing and live in luxury are in kings' palaces.

\v 26 But what did you go out to see, a prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus talks to the people about John the Baptist.

  * **what did you go out to see** - "did you go out to see"or "surely you did not go out to see." Jesus used this phrase three times with three questions to cause the people to think about what kind of person John the Baptist was. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **a reed being shaken by the wind** - This has two possible interpretations. 1) Reeds are easily moved by the wind, so it could refer to a person who is easily motivated to change his mind. 2) Reeds make noise when the wind rattles them, so it could refer to a person who talks a lot but his speech does not result in anything important. AT: "a man who was like a reed being shaken by the wind." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]).
  * **dressed in soft clothes** - Rich people wore this kind of clothing. AT: "wearing expensive clothing."
  * **kings' palaces** - large, expensive houses in which a king lives
  * **But** - AT: "If you did not go out to see that, then"
  * **I say to you** - Jesus said this to emphasize the importance of what he would say next.
  * **much more than a prophet** - AT: "not an ordinary prophet" or "more important than a normal prophet"
