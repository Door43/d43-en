\v 24 When the men whom John had sent left, Jesus began to talk to the crowd of people about John. He said, "What did you go into the wilderness to see? A thin stalk of a plant shaken by the wind?
\v 25 But what did you go out to see? A man in fancy clothing? Look, those who wear splendid clothes and who have the best of everything live in kings' palaces.
\v 26 Then what did you go out there to see? A prophet? Yes! But I tell you that John is more important than an ordinary prophet.

\v 24 After John's messengers had gone away, Jesus began to say to the crowds about John, "What did you go out into the desert to see -- a reed being shaken by the wind?
\v 25 But what did you go out to see -- a man dressed in soft clothes? Behold, people who dress in splendid clothing and live in luxury are in kings' palaces.

\v 26 But what did you go out to see -- a prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Jesus talks to the people about John the Baptist.)
  * **What did you go out to see**  - This phrase is used in three rhetorical questions cause the people to think about what kind of person John the Baptist was. It could be translated as "Did you go out to see a…? Of course not!" or "Surely you did not go out to see a…!" (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Questions]])
  * **a reed shaken by the wind**  - This metaphor has two possible interpretations. Reeds are easily moved by the wind, so it could refer to a person who is easily motivated to change his mind. Reeds also make noise when the wind rattles them, so it could also refer to a person who talks a lot, but his speech does not result in anything important (See: en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor|Metaphor). It could also be translated as a simile: "Did you go out to see a man who was like a reed shaken by the wind?"
  * **dressed in soft clothes**  - "wearing expensive clothing." Rich people wore this kind of clothing.
  * **kings' palaces**  - A palace is a large, expensive house that a king lives in.
  * **But**  - "If you did not go out to see that, then"
  * **Behold**  - "Look" or "Listen." Jesus used this word here to emphasize what he would say next.
  * **I say to you**  - Jesus said this to emphasize the importance of what he would say next.
  * **much more than a prophet**  - "not an ordinary prophet" or "more important than a normal prophet"
