\v 44 Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, "Think about what this woman has done! When I entered your house, you did not do what hosts usually do to welcome their guests. You did not give me any water to wash my feet, but this woman has washed my feet with her tears and then wiped them with her hair!
\v 45 You did not greet me with a kiss, but from the moment I came in she has not stopped kissing my feet!

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **And having turned to the woman** - "facing the woman." Jesus directed Simon's attention to the woman by turning to her.
    * **water for my feet â€¦ a kiss**  - These were ways of showing of basic courtesy to an invited guest. Jesus is contrasting Simon's lack of courtesy with the woman's extreme actions of gratitude.
    * **did not stop kissing my feet** - This could be expressed positively as "has continued to kiss my feet."
