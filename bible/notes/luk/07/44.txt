\v 44 Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, "Think about what this woman has done! When I entered your house, you did not do what hosts usually do to welcome their guests. You did not give me any water to wash my feet, but this woman has washed my feet with her tears and then wiped them with her hair!
\v 45 You did not greet me with a kiss, but from the moment I came in she has not stopped kissing my feet!

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Jesus turned to the woman** - "Jesus faced the woman." Jesus directed Simon's attention to the woman by turning to her.
  * **You gave me no water for my feet** - It was a basic responsibility of a host to provide water and a towel for guests to wash and dry their feet after walking on dusty roads. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **You ... but she** - Jesus twice uses these phrases to contrast Simon's lack of courtesy with the woman's extreme actions of gratitude.
  * **she has wet my feet with her tears** - The woman used her tears in place of the missing water.
  * **wiped them with her hair** - The woman used her hair in place of the missing towel.
  * **You did not give me a kiss** - A good host in that culture would greet his guest with a kiss on the cheek. Simon did not do this. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **did not stop kissing my feet** - "has continued to kiss my feet"
  * **kissing my feet** - The woman kissed the feet of Jesus rather than his cheek as a sign of extreme repentance and humility.
