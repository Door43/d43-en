===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **And having turned to the woman** - "facing the woman." Jesus directed Simon's attention to the woman by turning to her.
    * **water for my feet … a kiss**  - These were ways of showing of basic courtesy to an invited guest. Jesus is contrasting Simon's lack of courtesy with the woman's extreme actions of gratitude.
    * **did not stop kissing my feet** - This could be expressed positively as "has continued to kiss my feet."
