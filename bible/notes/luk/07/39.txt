    * **he thought to himself saying**  - "he said to himself"
    * **If Jesus were a prophet, then he would know**  - The Pharisee thought that Jesus  was not a prophet because he allowed the sinful woman to touch him. This could be translated as "Evidently Jesus is not a prophet. If he were, he would know."
    * **Simon** - This was the name of the Pharisee who invited Jesus into his home. This was not Simon Peter.
