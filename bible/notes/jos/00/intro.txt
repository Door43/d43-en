=== What is the Book of Joshua about? ===

The Book of Joshua is about how God fulfilled his promise that the Israelites would enter the [[:en:obe:kt:promisedland|Promised Land]] and occupy it. This was done as they united in obedience to God and as they fought battles under his direction through Joshua, the leader who took the place of Moses. This book also tells how the twelve tribes received their various portions of the land when it was shared out it them.

=== How should the title of this book be translated? ===

It is suggested that translators create a short title such as, "The Book about the Things that Happened when Joshua Led Israel" or "The Book about When Joshua Led Israel." Translators should avoid a title that points to Joshua as the writer of the book.

=== Who wrote the Book of Joshua? ===

There is no indication in the book about who wrote it, although there are several references in it to Joshua writing some things down. It became traditional in Judaism, however, to think that Joshua wrote most of the book.



===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== What concept of history begins to be presented in the Book of Joshua? ===

It was common in the Ancient Near East to assume that, although human beings made some choices that affected historical outcomes, it was mostly up to the gods to determine the world events that would occur. The Book of Joshua has some similarities with this view, but there are important differences as well. In Joshua, historical events occur because of Yahweh's promises to his people of Israel. They also occur in the context of Israel's response of trust and obedience to Yahweh. Israel's trust in Yahweh was all the more remarkable because it was normally assumed in the Ancient Near East that gods had no power outside of the territories that they controlled. 


===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== What is the meaning of the phrase "to this day"? ===

This phrase often occurs in the Book of Joshua. It marks passages that describe events that led to conditions still existing at the time that this book was either initially written or revised. The first such example concerns the twelve stones placed in the Jordan River to mark where the Israelites crossed it ([[:en:bible:notes:jos:04:08]]): "And the memorial is there to this day."

This phrase suggests that there was a significant period of time between the events of the book and when they were written. The translator must avoid giving the impression that the present day of the translation's readers is meant.  

=== What does the phrase "all Israel" mean? ===

This phrase appears many times in the Book of Joshua, but it does not always mean the entire Israelite nation, that is, literally all Israelites. At times it means the Israelite army; at other times it means the representatives of the twelve tribes of Israel. In still other passages it probably means many people throughout the nation of Israel.

=== When should Joshua be translated ===

The Book of Joshua should probably not be translated before Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy are translated. This is because the overall historical context of Judges will not be understood without the context provided by these previous books.
