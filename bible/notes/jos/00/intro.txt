=== What is the Book of Joshua about? ===

The Book of Joshua is about how God fulfilled his promise that the Israelites would enter the Promised Land and occupy it. They did this as they united in obedience to God and as they fought battles under his direction through Joshua, the leader who took the place of Moses. This book also tells how each of the twelve tribes received its portion of the land when it was divided among them. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:promisedland]])

=== How should the title of this book be translated? ===

Translators may create a short title such as "The Book About When Joshua Led Israel." Translators should avoid a title that points to Joshua as the writer of the book.

=== Who wrote the Book of Joshua? ===

The book does not indicate who wrote it, although there are several references in it to Joshua writing some things down. Traditional Judaism believes that Joshua wrote most of the book.

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== What concept of history begins to be presented in the Book of Joshua? ===

Although humans made choices that affected historical events, it was common in the ancient Near East to assume that the gods determined most world events. The Book of Joshua has some similarities with this view, but there are important differences. In Joshua, historical events occur because of Yahweh's promises to his people, Israel. They also occur because of Israel's response of trust and obedience to Yahweh, or lack of faith and disobedience. Israel's trust in Yahweh was all the more remarkable because it was normally assumed that gods had no power outside of the territories that they controlled. 


===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== What does the phrase "to this day" mean? ===

This phrase was used by the writer to refer to the time when he was writing. The translator should be aware that "to this day" refers to a time which has already passed. He must avoid giving the impression to readers that "to this day" means the present day. The translator might decide to say "to this day, at the time when this was being written," or "to this day, at the time of writing." This Hebrew phrase occurs in Joshua 4:9; 6:25; 7:26; 8:28, 29; 10:27; 13:13; 14:14; 15:63; 16:10.

=== What does the phrase "all Israel" mean? ===

This phrase appears many times in the Book of Joshua, but it does not always mean the entire Israelite nation, that is, literally every Israelite. At times it means the Israelite army; at other times it means the representatives of the twelve tribes of Israel. In still other passages it probably means many people in the nation of Israel.

=== When should Joshua be translated? ===

The Book of Joshua should probably not be translated before Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. This is because the historical events of Joshua will not be understood without the information provided by these previous books.
