===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking to Joshua.

  * **your land**  - The word "your" refers to the tribes of Israel, and not Joshua only.  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **to stand before you** - In verse 5 the words "you" and "your" refer to Joshua. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **I will not abandon you or leave you** - The words "abandon" and "leave" mean basically the same thing. Yahweh combines them to emphasize that he will not do these things. AT: "I will certainly stay with you always" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
