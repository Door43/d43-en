\v 14 Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall abide in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan; but you shall pass over before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valor, and shall help them;
\v 15 until Jehovah have given your brethren rest, as he has given you, and they also have possessed the land which Jehovah your God gives them: then you shall return to the land of your possession, and possess it, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising.
