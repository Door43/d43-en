\v 14 Your wives and your little children and your livestock may stay here in this land on the east side of the Jordan River, but all your soldiers and your brothers must cross the river, ahead of the people of the other and help them
\v 15 until Yahweh gives you this place of rest to your brothers just as he gives that rest to you. And they will take the land the Yahweh your God gives them, and then each of you will take the land where you will live and you will live there—that land that Moses, Yahweh's servant, gave you here on the east side of the Jordan River."
