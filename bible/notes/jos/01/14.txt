\v 14 Your wives, your little children, and your livestock may stay here in this land on the east side of the Jordan River, but all your soldiers and your fellow tribesmen must cross the river, ahead of your other fellow Israelites, in order to help them.
\v 15 You must help them in battle until Yahweh has enabled your fellow Israelites to permanently settle in the land there, the land that they will capture, the land that Yahweh your God is giving to them. Then each of you will come back to the land that you will settle in, and you will live there—I mean the land that Moses, Yahweh's servant, gave you here on the east side of the Jordan River."

\v 14 Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock will stay in the land that Moses gave you beyond the Jordan. But your fighting men will go over with your brothers and help them
\v 15 until Yahweh has given your brothers rest just as he has given it to you. And they also will take possession of the land Yahweh your God gives them. Then you will return to your own land and possess it, the land that Moses the servant of Yahweh gave you beyond the Jordan, where the sun rises."

===== Translation Notes: =====

Joshua continues speaking to the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh.

  * **your little ones** - "your little children"
  * **beyond the Jordan** - This refers to the east side of the Jordan River. Later most of the Israelites would live west of the Jordan, so they called the east side  "beyond the Jordan." But at this time they were all still on the east side. AT: "east of the Jordan River"
