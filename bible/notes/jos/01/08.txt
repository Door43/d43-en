===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking to Joshua.

  * **You will always speak** - This means that Joshua should speak of the book of the Law often. The word "always" adds emphasis or intensity. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **be successful** - AT: "achieve your goal" or "reach your goal"
