\v 32 Moses had allotted to those tribes the land that was on the plain of the Moab \add region\add*, on the east side of the Jordan \add River\add*, across from Jericho.

\v 32 These were the lands that Moses distributed to the people of Israel on the plains of Moab, when they were beyond the Jordan just east of Jericho.
