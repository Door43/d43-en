\v 15 The southern border of their land started near Kiriath-Jearim and extended west to Nephtoah Springs.
\v 16 From there it extended south to the bottom of the hill, near Ben-Hinnom Valley, on the north side of Repha Valley. The border extended south along the Hinnom Valley, south of the city where the Jebus people-group lived, to En-Rogel.

\v 15 The south side began just outside of Kiriath Jearim. The border went from there to Ephron, to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah.
\v 16 The boundary then went down to the border of the mountain which was opposite the valley of Ben Hinnom, which was at the northern end of the valley of Rephaim. It then went down to the valley of Hinnom, south of the slope of the Jebusites, and continued down to En Rogel.
