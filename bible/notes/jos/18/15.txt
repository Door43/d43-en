\v 15 The south side began just outside of Kiriath-jearim. The border goes from there to Ephron, to the waters of spring of Nephtoah.
\v 16 The boundary then went down to the border of the mountain that overlooks the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, which was at the north end of the Valley of Rephaim. It then went down to the Valley of Hinnom, south of the slope of the Jebusites, and continued down to En-rogel.
