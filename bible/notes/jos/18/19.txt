\v 19 The border passed on to the north shoulder of Beth Hoglah. The border ended at the north bay of the Salt Sea, at the southern end of the Jordan. This was the boundary on the south.
\v 20 The Jordan formed its border on the eastern side. This was the inheritance of the tribe of Benjamin, and it was given to each of their clans, border after border, all around.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **the Jordan** - Refers to the Jordan River when 'the' is present and the area of the river without 'the'. (See: [[en:obe:other:jordanriver]])
    * **Salt Sea**  - This sea was at the end of the Jordan River, far below sea level and has no outflow. The salt content is so high that nothing lives in it. It is also known as the Dead Sea. It is the location of the former cities of Sodom & Gomorrah, which God destroyed by fire from heaven during the time of Abraham.    
    * **This was the inheritance** - "This" refers back to the entire description beginning in verse 12.
