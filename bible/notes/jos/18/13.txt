\v 13 From there the border passed along southward in the direction of Luz (the same as Bethel), then the border went down to Ataroth-addar,
\v 14 by the mountain that lay south of Beth-horon. Then the border turned in another direction, turning on the western side, southward from the mountain that lay to the south, opposite Beth-horon and it ended at Kiriath-baal (the same as Kiriath-jearim), a city that belonged to the people of Judah. This formed the western side.
