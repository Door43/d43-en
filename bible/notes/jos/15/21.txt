===== translationNotes: =====


  * **General Information:** - The writer lists the cities of which Judah took possession. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])

  * **Ziph, Telem, Bealoth.** - "Ziph, Telem, Bealoth," Since the list of cities continues through [[:en:bible:notes:jos:15:29|15:32]], you may need to end this verse with a comma.
