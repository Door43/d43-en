\v 7 From there the border continued west through Achor Valley to Debir \add city\add*. From there it turned north to Gilgal \add city\add*. Gilgal is north of the road that goes through Adummim Pass, on the south side of the valley. From Gilgal the border extended west to the springs at En-Shemesh, and from there to En-Rogel. From there it extended through Ben-Hinnom Valley, south of the city where the Jebus people-group lived. (That city is now named Jerusalem.)
\v 8 From there the border extended to the top of the hill on the west side of Hinnom Valley, at the northern end of the valley where the Repha \add giants\add* lived.

\v 7 And the border goes up to Debir from the Valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the river. And the border passes along to the waters of En-shemesh and ends at En-rogel.
\v 8 Then the border goes up the Valley of the Son of Hinnom to the side of the Jebusite city (that is Jerusalem). And the border goes up to the top of the hill that lies over the Valley of Hinnom, on the west, which is at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim.
