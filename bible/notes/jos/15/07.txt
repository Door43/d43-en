\v 7 From there the border continued west through Achor Valley to Debir \add city\add*. From there it turned north to Gilgal \add city\add*. Gilgal is north of the road that goes through Adummim Pass, on the south side of the valley. From Gilgal the border extended west to the springs at En-Shemesh, and from there to En-Rogel. From there it extended through Ben-Hinnom Valley, south of the city where the Jebus people-group lived. (That city is now named Jerusalem.)
\v 8 From there the border extended to the top of the hill on the west side of Hinnom Valley, at the northern end of the valley where the Repha \add giants\add* lived.

\v 7 and the border went up to Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is over against
the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the river; and the border passed along to the waters of En-shemesh, and
the goings out thereof were at En-rogel;
\v 8 and the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom to the side of the Jebusite southward (the same is Jerusalem);
and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lies before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the uttermost
part of the vale of Rephaim northward;
