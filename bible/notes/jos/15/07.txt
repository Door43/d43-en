\v 7 From there the border continued west through Achor Valley to Debir \add city\add*. From there it turned north to Gilgal \add city\add*. Gilgal is north of the road that goes through Adummim Pass, on the south side of the valley. From Gilgal the border extended west to the springs at En-Shemesh, and from there to En-Rogel. From there it extended through Ben-Hinnom Valley, south of the city where the Jebus people-group lived. (That city is now named Jerusalem.)
\v 8 From there the border extended to the top of the hill on the west side of Hinnom Valley, at the northern end of the valley where the Repha \add giants\add* lived.
