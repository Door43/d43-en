\v 7 From there the border continued west through Achor Valley to Debir \add city\add*. From there it turned north to Gilgal \add city\add*. Gilgal is north of the road that goes through Adummim Pass, on the south side of the valley. From Gilgal the border extended west to the springs at En-Shemesh, and from there to En-Rogel. From there it extended through Ben-Hinnom Valley, south of the city where the Jebus people-group lived. (That city is now named Jerusalem.)
\v 8 From there the border extended to the top of the hill on the west side of Hinnom Valley, at the northern end of the valley where the Repha \add giants\add* lived.

\v 7 Then the border went up to Debir from the Valley of Achor, and so northward, turning toward Gilgal, which is opposite the hill of Adummim, which is on the south side of the river. Then the border passed along to the springs of En Shemesh and went to En Rogel.
\v 8 Then the border went up the Valley of Ben Hinnom to the south side of the Jebusites' city (that is, Jerusalem). Then it went up to the top of the hill that lies over the Valley of Hinnom, on the west, which is at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim.
