\v 5 The eastern border of the land of the tribe of Judah was the Dead Sea. It extended north to the end  of the Jordan River, where it empties into the Dead Sea.
\v 6 The northern border continued from that point, and extended north to Beth Hoglah. From there it went further north of Beth Arabah to the Stone of Bohan (a stone that had been set up by Bohan, son of Reuben).
