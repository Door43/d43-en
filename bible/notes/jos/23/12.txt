===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 If you turn away from doing what Yahweh desires and you associate with the people who are not Israelites, and if you marry them,
\v 13 then you can be sure that Yahweh our God will not help you to expel those people-groups from your land. They will be \add like\add* traps \f + \ft doublet, metaphor \f* \add that will catch you\add*. They will be like whips \add that strike\add* your backs, and like thorns \add that will scratch\add* your eyes. As a result, none of you will be left in this good land that Yahweh our God is giving to you.

\v 12 But if you turn back and cling to the survivors of these nations that remain among you, and you intermarry with them, and you associate with them and they with you,
\v 13 know for certain that Yahweh your God will no longer drive these nations out from among you. Instead, they will be a snare and a trap for you, whips on your backs and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land that Yahweh your God has given you.
