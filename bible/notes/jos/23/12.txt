====== Joshua 23:12-13 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 If you turn away from doing what Yahweh desires and you associate with the people who are not Israelites, and if you marry them,
\v 13 then you can be sure that Yahweh our God will not help you to expel those people-groups from your land. They will be \add like\add* traps \f + \ft doublet, metaphor \f* \add that will catch you\add*. They will be like whips \add that strike\add* your backs, and like thorns \add that will scratch\add* your eyes. As a result, none of you will be left in this good land that Yahweh our God is giving to you.

<usfm>
\v 12 However, if you turn away from doing what Yahweh desires; if you come close to any of those people groups who survived the wars with our people, or if you marry them and become their friends, and they become friends with you,
\v 13 then you can be sure that Yahweh our God will not help you force them out of your land. They will become like traps that will catch you. They will be like whips that strike your backs, and like thorns that will stick you in the eye. Your people group will become weaker and weaker until you die out in this land, this very good land that Yahweh our God has given to us.

<usfm>
\v 12 But if you turn back and cling to the survivors of these nations who remain among you, or if you intermarry with them, or if you come together with them and they with you,
\v 13 then know for certain that Yahweh your God will no longer drive these nations out from among you. Instead, they will become a snare and a trap for you, whips on your backs and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land that Yahweh your God has given you.
