\v 14 It is almost time for me to die, like everyone else does \f + \ft euphemism \f*. You know in your inner beings \f + \ft doublet \f* that Yahweh has done for you \f + \ft litotes \f* everything that he promised to do.
\v 15 He has given to you all the good things that he promised. In the same way, the other things that he promised, \add things that are not good\add*, will also happen. He said that if you do what is evil, he will get rid of you and send you away from this good land that he has given to you.

\p
\v 14 And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and you know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not
one thing has failed of all the good things which Jehovah your God spoke concerning you; all are come to pass to you, not
one thing has failed thereof.
\v 15 And it shall come to pass, that as all the good things are come upon you of which Jehovah your God spoke to you, so
will Jehovah bring upon you all the evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which Jehovah your God
has given you.
