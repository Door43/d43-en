====== Joshua 23:4-5 ======

<usfm>
\v 4 But do not forget that he has given to you all this land, from the Jordan \add River in the east\add* to the Mediterranean Sea in the west, all this land that I have allotted to you.
\v 5 Yahweh our God will compel the people who are still living there to leave. He will push them out as you advance. Then the land will be yours, as Yahweh has promised you.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 I have given to you the nations that remain. Their lands will also be your permanent possession for the tribes of Israel, just as are the lands of the people groups that our people destroyed when I was leading themâ€”all those other nations that the Israelites destroyed from the Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea when I was the leader.
\v 5 Yahweh your God will force those people out from their lands. He will capture their lands from them, in order that you might settle down in those lands. This is what he has promised to do for you.

\v 4 Look! I have assigned to you the nations that remain to be conquered as an inheritance for your tribes, along with all the nations I have already destroyed, from the Jordan to the Great Sea in the west.
\v 5 Yahweh your God will drive them out. He will push them out from you. He will seize their land, and you will take possession of their land, just as Yahweh your God promised to you.
