\v 6 Therefore be very strong to keep and to do all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, turning aside from it neither to the right hand nor to the left,
\v 7 so you may not mix with these nations remaining among you or make mention of their names of their gods or swear by them or serve them or serve them, and you must not bow down to them,
\v 8 but you shall cling to Yahweh your God just as you have done to this day.
