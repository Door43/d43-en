\v 4 And this is the reason Joshua circumcised them: all the males who had come out of Egypt, including all the men of war, had died in the wilderness along the way, after they came out from Egypt.
\v 5 Though all the males who came out of Egypt were circumcised, still, none of the boys born in the wilderness on the way out of Egypt had been circumcised.
