===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Behold** - The word “behold” alerts us to a new person in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this. English uses “There was a man who was…” 
  * **he had drawn his sword and it was in his hand** - These two phrases share similar meanings and are combined for emphasis.(See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
