===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Behold** - The word “behold” alerts us to pay special attention to new information. Your language may have a way of doing this. English uses “There was a man who was…” 
  * **he had drawn his sword and it was in his hand** - Here the words "he" and "his" refer to the man who was standing in front of Joshua.
