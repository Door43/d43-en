\v 1 All the kings of the Amorites on the west of the Jordan River and all the kings of Canaanites, who lived close to the Mediterranean coast, heard about how Yahweh had dried up the water of the Jordan River until all the people of Israel had crossed over.

\v 1 As soon as all the kings of the Amorites on the west side of the Jordan, and all the kings of the Canaanites, who were along the coast of the Great Sea, heard that Yahweh had dried up the waters of the Jordan until the people of Israel had crossed over, their hearts melted, and there was no longer any spirit in them because of the people of Israel.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    *
    * **their hearts melted, and there was no longer any spirit in them** - These two phrases share similar meanings, combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]]) The phrase “their hearts melted” compares the hearts of the fearful kings of the Amorites and Canaanites to ice melting and flowing away. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
