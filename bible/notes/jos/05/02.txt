===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Gibeath Haaraloth** - This is a place name which commemorates Israel rededicating themselves to Yahweh. It means "the hill of the foreskins." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Joshua made himself flint knives ... he circumcised all the males** - There were over 600,000 males, so it is understood that while Joshua was in charge of this task, many other people helped him. If this would confuse your readers, you may want to make this explicit. AT: "Joshua and the Israelites made themselves flint knives ... they circumcised all the males" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
