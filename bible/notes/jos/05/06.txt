\v 6 Our Israelite ancestors traveled around in the desert for forty years, and all the men who were old enough to be soldiers had died. \add The women had also died\add*. They had not obeyed Yahweh, so Yahweh solemnly said that they would not arrive at the land that he had promised to our ancestors that he would give to us, a land that was very fertile \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 7 The sons of those who had disobeyed Yahweh were the ones whom Joshua circumcised at Gilgal. They were circumcised because they had not been circumcised \add while they were traveling in the desert\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 The people of Israel walked through the desert for forty years, until all the people, including all the men who were old enough to be soldiers, they all had died. They had not obeyed Yahweh, so Yahweh said that they would not see the land that he had promised to them—a land that was very fertile—the land was so fertile that they said it had milk and honey flowing through it, just as rivers flow with water.
\v 7 It was the children of those who had died that  Yahweh raised up in their place. He circumcised them because they had not been circumcised when they were walking through the wilderness.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 For the people of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness until all the people, that is, all the men of war who had come out of Egypt, died, because they did not obey the voice of Yahweh. Yahweh swore to them that he would not let them see the land that he had sworn to their ancestors that he would give to us, a land flowing with milk and honey.
\v 7 It was their children that Yahweh raised up in their place that Joshua circumcised, because they had not been circumcised on the way.
