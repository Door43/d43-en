====== Joshua 05 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Circumcision ==

It would have been very unusual to be circumcised in a time of war. When men are circumcised they are unable to move without pain or to defend themselves in battle for several days. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:circumcise]])

== Manna ==

Yahweh stops providing manna in this chapter and will no longer provide them with their daily allotment of food. This does not mean Yahweh's care and provision will stop.
