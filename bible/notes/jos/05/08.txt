====== Joshua 05:8-9 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 After all the Israelite males had been circumcised, they remained in the camp and rested until their wounds were healed.
\v 9 Then Yahweh said to Joshua, "Because your forefathers were wandering without divine help in the desert for forty years \f + \ft Or: \add Because your forefathers were slaves in Egypt\add* \f*, the Egyptians felt disgusted toward you. But today I have taken away the reproach the Egyptians have had toward you." Because of that, the people called the place 'Gilgal,' \add which sounds like the Hebrew word 'taken away,'\add* and it still has that name.
