===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **He struck its king with the sword** - This a more polite way to say "killed." AT: "Joshua killed the king of Hazor with his sword." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
    * **Hazor**  - This is the name of the most prominent city of all of the enemy armies (See:[[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
    * **They attacked with the sword every living creature that was there... so there was not any living creature left alive** - These two phrases share similar meanings and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
