====== Joshua 11 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Yahweh overcomes the united forces of the northern kingdoms ==

Yahweh said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid in their presence, because tomorrow at this time I am giving them all to Israel as dead men." Even when the kingdoms of Canaan joined forces, they were not able to overcome the power of Yahweh. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===
== "Yahweh gave the enemy into the hand of Israel" ==
This phrase may present difficulties in translation. The translator should ensure that Yahweh receives credit for Israel's victory. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
