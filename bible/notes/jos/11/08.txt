===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Yahweh gave the enemy into the hand of Israel** - Here the word "hand" represents power. Yahweh enabling the army of Israel to conquer their enemy is spoken of as if Yahweh had put the enemy army into Israel's hand. AT: "Yahweh enabled Israel to conquer the enemy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **struck them with the sword ... attacked them with the sword** - "attacked them with their weapons ... attacked them with their weapons"
  * **Misrephoth Maim** - This is the name of a place. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **hamstrung** - Translate this word in the same way you did in [[:en:bible:notes:jos:11:06|11:6]].
