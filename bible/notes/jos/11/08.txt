  * **Yahweh gave the enemy into the hand of Israel** - Here the word "hand" represents power. Yahweh enabling the army of Israel to conquer their enemy is spoken of as if Yahweh had put the enemy army into Israel's hand. AT: "Yahweh enabled Israel to conquer the enemy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **struck them with the sword ... struck them** - Here the word "sword" represents all of the weapons that they used to attack their enemies. AT: "attacked them with their weapons ... attacked them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Misrephoth Maim** - This is the name of a place. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **hamstrung** - This is a practice where the tendons in the backs of the legs are cut so that the horses cannot run. See how you translated this word in [[:en:bible:notes:jos:11:06|11:6]].
