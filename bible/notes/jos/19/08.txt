\v 8 These were together with the villages around these cities as far as Baalath Beer (the same as Ramah in the Negev). This was the inheritance of the tribe of Simeon, given to their clans.
\v 9 The inheritance of the tribe of Simeon formed part of the territory of the tribe  of Judah. Because the portion of land assigned to the tribe of Judah was too large for them, the tribe of Simeon received their inheritance out of the middle of their portion.
