===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **fourth casting**  - number four in a series (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **Jezreel**  - Translate this name the same way as in Joshua 15:56 and 17:16. Also found repeatedly in 1 & 2 Samuel, 1 & 2 Kings and Hosea. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Kesulloth, Shunem, Hapharaim, Shion, and Anaharath**  - names of cities given to Issachar's tribe (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Kesulloth (UDB) and Chesulloth (ULB)** - are two ways to spell the same beginning sound.
