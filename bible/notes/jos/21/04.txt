\v 4 First Israelite leaders threw lots to assign some cities to the descendants of Kohath. These were clans that were the descendants of Aaron. They assigned thirteen cities in areas that the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin possessed.
\v 5 To the other clans descended from Kohath, Israelite leaders assigned ten cities in areas that the tribes of Ephraim and Dan possessed, as well as the part of the tribe of Manasseh that lives on the west side of the Jordan River.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **casting of lots**  - A random method of choosing to remove the choice from the leader's will, often done with the idea that God will decide the outcome.
    * **Kohathites**  - Translate the same way as in Numbers 3:27, 30, 4:18, 34, 37, 10:21, 26:57, 1 Chron. 6:33, 54, 61, 9:32, 2 Chron. 20:19, 29:12 and 34:12. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
    * **thirteen cities, ten cities**  - A number of cities. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
    * **half tribe**  - Half the tribe because the other half received their inheritance before crossing the Jordan River.
