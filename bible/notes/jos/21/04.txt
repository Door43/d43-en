===== translationNotes: =====

  * **casting of lots** - A random method of choosing to remove the choice from the leader's will, often done with the idea that God will decide the outcome. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jos:19:01|19:1]].
  * **Kohathites** - This priests in this group were descendants of Levi's son Kohath. A portion of them were also descendants of Aaron, Kohath's grandson. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **thirteen cities ... ten cities** - numbers of cities (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **half tribe** - Half the tribe because the other half received their inheritance before crossing the Jordan River.
