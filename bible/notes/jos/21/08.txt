  * **Yahweh had commanded by the hand of Moses** - The phrase "by the hand of" here means that Yahweh used Moses as the agent to deliver his command. AT: "Yahweh had told Moses to command" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **clans of the Kohathites** - This priests in this group were descendants of Levi's son Kohath. A portion of them were also descendants of Aaron, Kohath's grandson. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jos:21:04|21:2]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **casting of lots** - A random method of choosing to remove the choice from the leader's will, often done with the idea that God will decide the outcome. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jos:19:01|19:1]].
