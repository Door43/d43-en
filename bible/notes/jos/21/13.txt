\v 13 In this way, the Israelite leaders assigned Hebron to the descendants of Aaron, the priest. Hebron was one of the cities to which people could run if they accidentally killed a person. To Aaron's descendants they also gave the cities of Libnah,
\v 14 Jattir, Eshtemoa,
\v 15 Holon, Debir,
\v 16 Ain, Juttah, and Bethshemesh—nine cities with all their pasturelands. These cities were located in the areas that the tribes of Judah and Simeon had possessed.
