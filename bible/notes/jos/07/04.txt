\v 4 So about three thousand Israelite men went to attack Ai. But they did not defeat them. Instead, they had to run for their lives.
\v 5 The enemy killed about thirty-six Israelites and chased the rest from the city gate to the bottom of the hill, and then to a place where people had cut stone out from a hill. When the people of Israel saw this, they were very afraid and lost all their courage.
