\v 4 So about three thousand Israelite men went to attack Ai. But they did not defeat them. Instead, they had to run for their lives.
\v 5 The enemy killed about thirty-six Israelites and chased the rest from the city gate to the bottom of the hill, and then to a place where people had cut stone out from a hill. When the people of Israel saw this, they were very afraid and lost all their courage.

===== Translation Notes: =====
Joshua sends soldiers to Ai and is defeated.
    * **three thousand men** - The word "men" here refers to "soldiers." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **three thousand men... thirty-six men**  - These refer to the number of men (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
    * **the hearts of the people were afraid and their courage left them** - The word "people" refers to Israel. These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize the intensity of their fear. AT: "the people of Israel were terrified" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
