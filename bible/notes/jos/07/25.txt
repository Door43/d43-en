\v 25 Then Joshua said, "Why have you troubled us? Yahweh will trouble you this day." All Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned them with fire and stoned them with stones.
\v 26 They set up over him a great heap of stones that is here until this day. Yahweh turned away his burning anger. Therefore the name of the place is called the Valley of Trouble until this day.
