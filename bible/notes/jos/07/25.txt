===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 25 Then Joshua said, "Why have you troubled us? Yahweh will trouble you today." All Israel stoned him with stones. And they burned them all, and they stoned them.
\v 26 They set up over him a great heap of stones that is here until this day. Yahweh turned away his burning anger. Therefore the name of the place is the Valley of Achor until this present day.

  * **Valley of Achor** - The name means "Valley of Trouble," but it is best to translate this the way it sounds. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
