\v 25 And Joshua said, Why have you troubled us? Jehovah shall trouble you this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones;
and they burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones.
\v 26 And they raised over him a great heap of stones, to this day; and Jehovah turned from the fierceness of his anger.
Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, to this day.
