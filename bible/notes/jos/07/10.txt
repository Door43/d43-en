\v 11 You Israelites have sinned! You have disobeyed the commands that I told you to obey. \add One of\add* your men has taken some of the things that I told you to destroy. He has stolen them and taken them for himself and lied \add about it\add*.
\v 12 That is why you Israelites have been unable to be strong when you went to attack your enemies. That is why you have run away from them. And now you yourselves may be destroyed. If you do not do as I commanded you and destroy everything \add that you captured in Jericho\add* I will not help you anymore!"

\v 10 But Yahweh said to Joshua, "Stand up! Stop lying there with your face on the ground!
\v 11 Israel has sinned. You have disobeyed the commands that I told you to obey. They have lied, they have stolen, and they have taken what they stole and put them in with their own gear, to hide it.
\v 12 That is why the people of Israel have been unable to stand against their enemies. That is why they have run away and now you yourselves will be destroyed. If you do not do as I commanded you and destroy everything that you took from Jericho I will not help you anymore!"

\v 10 Yahweh said to Joshua, "Get up! Why have you fallen on your face?
\v 11 Israel has sinned. They have violated my covenant which I commanded them. They have taken from the devoted things. They have stolen and also they have hidden their sin by putting what they have taken among their own belongings.
\v 12 As a result, the people of Israel cannot stand before their enemies. They turned their backs from their enemies because they have become devoted to destruction. I will not be with you any more unless you destroy the devoted things that are among you.
