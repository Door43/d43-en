\v 10 And Jehovah said to Joshua, Get you up; wherefore are you thus fallen upon your face?
\v 11 Israel has sinned; yea, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: yea, they have even taken of the
devoted thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also; and they have even put it among their own stuff.
\v 12 Therefore the children of Israel cannot stand before their enemies; they turn their backs before their enemies, because
they are become accursed: I will not be with you any more, except you destroy the devoted thing from among you.
