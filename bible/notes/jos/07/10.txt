\v 10 But Yahweh said to Joshua, "Stand up! Stop lying there with your face on the ground \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*!
\v 11 You Israelites have sinned! You have disobeyed the commands that I told you to obey. \add One of\add* your men has taken some of the things that I told you to destroy. He has stolen them and taken them for himself and lied \add about it\add*.
\v 12 That is why you Israelites have been unable to be strong when you went to attack your enemies. That is why you have run away from them. And now you yourselves may be destroyed. If you do not do as I commanded you and destroy everything \add that you captured in Jericho\add* I will not help you anymore!"

\v 10 But Yahweh said to Joshua, "Stand up! Stop lying there with your face in the dirt!
\v 11 Israel has sinned. You have disobeyed the commands that I told you to obey. They have lied, they have stolen, and they have taken what they stole and put them in with their own possessions, in order to hide it.
\v 12 That is why the people of Israel have been unable to defeat their enemies. That is why they have run away, and now you yourselves will be destroyed. If you do not do as I commanded you and destroy everything that you took from Jericho, I will not help you anymore!

\v 10 Yahweh said to Joshua, "Get up! Why are you lying there on your face?
\v 11 Israel has sinned. They have violated my covenant which I commanded them. They have stolen some of the reserved things. They have stolen and then also hidden their sin by putting what they have taken among their own belongings.
\v 12 As a result, the people of Israel cannot stand before their enemies. They turned their backs from their enemies because they themselves have been given over for destruction. I will not be with you any more unless you destroy the things that should have been destroyed, but are still among you.
