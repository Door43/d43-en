\v 1 But the people of Israel acted unfaithfully regarding the things that were given over to destruction. Achan, son of Carmi (the son of Zimri, the son of Zerah), from the tribe of Judah, took some things that were dedicated for destruction, and Yahweh's anger burned against the people of Israel.
