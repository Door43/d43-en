===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Joshua expresses frustration to God.

  * **what can I say, after Israel has turned their backs before their enemies?** - Joshua said this to show how upset he was that he did not even know what to say. AT: "I do not know what to say. Israel has turned their backs before their enemies!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Israel has turned their backs before their enemies** - Doing this represents running away from their enemies. AT: "Israel has run away from their enemies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **They will surround us and make the people of the earth forget our name** - Making people forget the name of the Israelites represents making them forget the Israelites. In this case they would do it by killing the Israelites. AT: "They will surround us and kill us, and the people of the earth will forget about us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **for your great name** - The phrase "your great name" here represents God's reputation and power. AT: "And so what will you do so that people will know that you are great" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **What will you do for your great name?** - Joshua uses this question to warn God that if the Israelites are destroyed, then the other people will think that God is not great. AT: "Then there will be nothing you can do for your great name." or "Then people will not know that you are great." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
