<usfm>
\v 14 Tomorrow morning you must present yourselves before Yahweh, tribe by tribe. Then Yahweh will indicate to which tribe \add the man who took those things belongs\add*. Then Yahweh will indicate to which clan from that tribe \add the guilty man belongs\add*. Then Yahweh will indicate to which family he belongs. And then he will indicate which person \add in that family took them\add*.
\v 15 Then the one who has taken some of the things that should have been destroyed will be destroyed in a fire. And everything he owns will be destroyed with him, because he has disobeyed the command that Yahweh gave us and has done something that is disgraceful to us Israelite people.'~"

<usfm>
\v 14 Tomorrow morning you must present yourselves before me, tribe by tribe. Then the tribe that I select will come before me by each of their families. The family that I select will come near by each of their households. The household that I select will come before me each one, one at a time.
\v 15 Then the one who has taken some of the things that should have been given to me—he will be destroyed in a fire. He and everything he owns will be burned, because he has disobeyed the promise and agreement that Yahweh made with us, and he has committed a disgraceful sin among the people of Israel."

\v 14 In the morning, you must present yourselves by your tribes. The tribe that Yahweh selects by lot, will come near by their clans. The clans that Yahweh takes must come near by each household. The household that Yahweh takes must come near one by one.
\v 15 It will happen that the one who is caught and who has the things that were given over to destruction, they will be burned, he and all he has, because he had broken the covenant of Yahweh and because he has done a disgraceful thing in Israel.'"
