<usfm>
\v 5 If some relative of the one who was killed comes to that city to get revenge, the leaders of that city must not allow the relative to take the killer, because what happened was accidental. He did not deliberately hate that person and as a result deliberately kill him.
\v 6 But the person who killed someone else must stay in that city until the city judges put him on trial. \add Only\add* if the judges decide \add that the person who has run\f + \ft Or: escaped \f* to their city did not deliberately kill the other person will they allow him to stay in that city\add*, and he must stay there until the supreme priest dies. Then he may safely go back to his own town, \add because the death of the supreme priest will be considered to atone\f + \ft Or: pay \f* for the death of the person who was killed\add*."

Then he may safely go back to his own town, because the death of the Supreme Priest will be considered to atone for the death of the person who was killed.”

<usfm>
\v 5 And if one comes who seeks to avenge the blood of the person who was killed, then they shall not deliver up the one who killed him; because he killed his neighbor unintentionally and had no hatred toward him beforehand.
\v 6 He shall live in that city until he has stood before the congregation for judgment, until the death of the one who was serving as high priest in those days. Then the one who had accidentally killed the person may return to his own town and his own home, to the town from which he fled.'"
