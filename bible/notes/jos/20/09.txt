<usfm>
\v 9 Any Israelite or any foreigner who lived among them, anyone who had killed someone accidentally, was allowed to run to one of those cities. There he would be safe from some relative of the person who died coming there and killing him to get revenge. He could stay in that city until he was put on trial to decide whether he was telling the truth when he said that he did not kill that person on purpose.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 These were the cities selected for all the people of Israel and for the foreigners residing among them, so that anyone who killed a person unintentionally could run to them for safety. This person would not die by the hand of the one who wanted to avenge the blood that was shed, until the accused person would first stand before the assembly.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **would not die by the hand of the one** - Here "by the hand" means that this person would be the direct agent who killed the fugitive. AT: "would not be killed by the one" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **avenge the blood that was shed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "avenge a person's death." See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:jos:20:01|20:3]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
