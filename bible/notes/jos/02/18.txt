\v 18 unless, when we come into the land, you will put this scarlet rope in the window that you let us down by, and you gather all your family into the house.
\v 19 Whoever goes out of the doors of your house into the street will be responsible for their own lives. We will not be responsible if they are killed. Whoever stays with you in the house, we will be responsible for their lives if any one tries to kill them.
