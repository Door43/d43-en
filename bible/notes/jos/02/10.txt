<usfm>
\v 10 We have heard about how Yahweh dried up the water of the Red Sea for you to cross it when you left Egypt. And we have heard how you killed Sihon and Og, the two kings of the tribe of Amor who lived east of the Jordan \add River\add*. You \add Israelites\add* totally destroyed everyone and \add everything in their kingdom\add*.
\v 11 When we heard about those things, we were very dismayed. We no longer have courage to fight against you, because we know that Yahweh, the God \add whom you worship\add*, is helping you. \add And we know that\add* he rules everything up in heaven and here on earth.

\v 10 We have heard about how Yahweh dried up the water of the Red Sea for you to cross when you left Egypt. We heard what you did to Sihon and Og, the two kings of the Amorites who lived on the other side of the Jordan River, and how you totally destroyed everyone and everything in their kingdom.
\v 11 When we heard about those things, we were terrified. We no longer have courage to fight against you, for Yahweh is God, and he rules everything up in heaven and down here on earth.

\v 10 We have heard how Yahweh dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt. And  we heard what you did to the two kings of the Amorites on other side of the Jordan—Sihon and Og—whom you completely destroyed.
\v 11 As soon as we had heard it, our hearts melted and there was no courage left in anyone—for Yahweh your God, he is God in heaven above and on the earth below.
