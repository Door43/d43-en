===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **I know that Yahweh has given you the land** - The word "you" refers to the all the Israelite people.
  * **will melt away before you**  - This compares the fearful people to ice melting and flowing away. Possible meanings are 1) "will be weak in your presence" or 2) "will scatter away from you." AT: "will be so afraid that they will not resist you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
