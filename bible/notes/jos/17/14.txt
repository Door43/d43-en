\v 14 Then the people of Joseph said to Joshua, saying, "Why have you given us only one allotment and one portion for an inheritance, since we are a people great in number, and all along Yahweh has blessed us?"
\v 15 Joshua said to them, "If you are a people great in number, go up by yourselves to the forest and and there clear the ground for yourselves in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim. Since the hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for you."
