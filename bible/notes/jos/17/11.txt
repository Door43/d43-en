\v 11 But there are cities inside the area allotted to the tribes of Issachar and Asher, that along with their surrounding villages, were allotted to people from the tribe of Manasseh. These cities are Beth-Shan, Ibleam, Dor (which is also named Naphoth-Dor,) Endor, Taanach, and Megiddo.
\m
\v 12 The men of the tribe of Manasseh were not able to force the people who lived in those cities to leave, so the people of the Canaan people-group continued to live in those cities.

\v 11 But there were cities inside the territory assigned to the tribes of Issachar and Asher, that, along with their surrounding villages, were in fact assigned to people from the tribe of Manasseh. These cities were Beth Shean, Ibleam, Dor, Endor, Taanach, and Megiddo (and the third city in the list is Napheth).
\m
\v 12 The men of the tribe of Manasseh were not able to force the people who lived in those cities to leave, so the people of the Canaanites continued to live in their land.
