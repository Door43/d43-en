\v 16 The people of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh replied, "It is true that the land in the hilly area is not big enough for us, but the Canaan people-group who live in the lowlands, in Beth-Shan and the surrounding villages in that area, and in the Jezreel Valley, have iron chariots, \add so we will not be able to defeat them\add*!"
\p
\v 17 Joshua replied to them, "Your tribe is very numerous and very powerful. So I will allot more land for you in the hilly area,
\v 18 but you will have to cut down the trees in order to make a place for you to live. \add It is true that\add* the Canaan people-group are strong and have iron chariots, but you will be able to force them to leave that valley."

\v 16 The people of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh replied, "The hill country is not big enough for us and for all the Canaanites who live in the valley. Those who are in Beth Shean and the surrounding villages have chariots with iron wheels."
\p
\v 17 Joshua replied to the house of Joseph, that is, to Ephraim and Manasseh; he said, "Your people are indeed very numerous and very powerful. So I will make one more assignment of land for you:
\v 18 the hill country will belong to you, too. You will have to cut down the trees in order to make it your own, and to make a place for you to live. You will drive out the Canaanites, even though they are strong and have chariots with iron wheels."

\v 16 The descendants of Joseph said, "The hill country is not enough for us and all the Canaanites who live in the valley have chariots of iron, both those who are in Beth Shean and its villages, and those who are in the Valley of Jezreel."
\v 17 Then Joshua said to the house of Joseph—to Ephraim and Manasseh, "You are a people great in number, and you have great power. You must not have only one piece of land assigned to you.
\v 18 The hill country will also be yours. Though it is a forest, you will clear it and take possession of it to its farthest borders. You will drive out the Canaanites, even though they have chariots of iron, and even though they are strong."
