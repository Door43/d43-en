\v 16 The people of Joseph said, "The hill country is not enough for us and all the Canaanites that live in the valley have chariots of iron, both those who are in Beth-shean and its villages, and those who are in the valley of Jezreel."
\v 17 Then Joshua said to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and to Manasseh, "You are a people great in number, and you have great power. You shall not have only one allotment.
\v 18 but the hill country shall be yours. Though it is a forest, you shall clear it and possess it to its farthest borders. You will drive out the Canaanites, though they have chariots of iron, and even though they are strong."
