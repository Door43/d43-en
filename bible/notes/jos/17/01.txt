\v 1 This is a list of the land that was allotted to the tribe of Manasseh. Manasseh's oldest son was Makir, and his grandson was Gilead. Their descendants were assigned the lands in the regions of Gilead and Bashan,  in honor of Makir, who had been a great soldier.

\c 17
\p
\v 1 This was the assignment of land for the tribe of Manasseh, (who was the firstborn of Joseph)—that is, for Makir, who was Manasseh's firstborn and who himself was the father of Gilead. Makir's descendants were assigned the land of Gilead and Bashan, because Makir had been a man of war.
\v 2 Land was assigned to the rest of the tribe of Manasseh, given to their clans—Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida. These were the male descendants of Manasseh, son of Joseph, given to their clans.
