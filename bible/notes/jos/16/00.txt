====== Joshua 16 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Drive them out ==
The Israelites were to completely drive out the Canaanites. If they did not drive them out completely, the Canaanites would cause the Israelites to worship other gods. It was sinful to allow the Canaanites to remain in the land. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

This chapter is about the land given to the tribe of Ephraim, one of Joseph's sons. It will be difficult to fully understand their location without a map. Further research may be needed to understand the location of their land. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
