  * **They killed every living creature in it, leaving no survivors... He completely destroyed it, and every living creature in it.** -  These two sentence are saying basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. Together they emphasize the completeness of the destruction of Hebron. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
