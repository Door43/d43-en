\v 36 Then Joshua and all Israel passed on from Eglon to Hebron. They waged war against it:
\v 37 They captured it and struck everyone in it, including the king and all its surrounding towns, with the sword. Every living creature living it they killed,  they did not leave a survivor, just as he had done to Eglon—he completely destroyed it, and every living creature that was in it.
