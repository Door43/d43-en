\v 24 And it came to pass, when they brought forth those kings to Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and
said to the chiefs of the men of war that went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they
came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.

your enemies against whom you fight.
