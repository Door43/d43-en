\v 38 Then Joshua turned, and all the army of Israel with him, and they passed on to Debir and waged war against it.
\v 39 He captured it and its king, and all its nearby villages. They struck them with the sword and completely destroyed every living creature that was in it. Joshua left no survivors, just as he had done to Hebron and its king, and just as he had done to Libnah and its king.
