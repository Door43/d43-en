====== Joshua 10:13-14 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 And that is what happened. The sun stood still, and the moon did not move, until the Israelite army defeated their enemies. That is what has been written in the book that Jashar wrote. The sun stopped while it was in the middle of the sky, and did not set\f + \ft Or: go down \f* for about a whole day.
\v 14 On that day Yahweh did a great miracle that someone asked him to do. There was never a day like that previously, and there has never been a day like that since. Yahweh was certainly fighting for the Israelite people!

\v 13 And the sun stood still and the moon did not move, until the Israelite army killed their enemies. Was this not written in the Book of Jashar?
\q "The sun stopped while it was in the middle of the sky, 
\q and did not set for about a whole day."
\p
\v 14 On that day, Yahweh performed a great miracle. There was never a day like that previously, and there has never been a day like that since, when Yahweh did this kind of thing because a human being asked him to. On that day, Yahweh truly went to war for Israel.

\q
\v 13 The sun stood still, and the moon stopped moving 
\q until the nation took vengeance on their enemies.
\p Is this not written in the Book of Jashar? 
\q The sun stayed in the middle of the sky; 
\q it did not go down for about a whole day.
\p
\v 14 There has been no other day like it before or after it, when Yahweh obeyed the voice of a human being. For Yahweh was waging war on behalf of Israel.
