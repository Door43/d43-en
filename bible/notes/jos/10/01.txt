<usfm>
\v 1 Later, Adonizedek, the king of Jerusalem, heard that Joshua's army had captured Ai town and had destroyed everything in the town. He heard that they had done to the people of Ai and to their king the same thing that they had done to the people of Jericho and their king. He also heard that the people of Gibeon \add city\add* had made a peace treaty with the Israelite people, and that the people of Gibeon were now living near the Israelites and being protected by them.
\v 2 Because of that, he and the people whom he ruled became very afraid, because Gibeon was an important city, like the other cities that had kings. And even though Gibeon was a larger city than Ai and all its soldiers were good fighters, they thought Joshua's army might defeat them.

\c 10
\p
\v 1 Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it (as he
had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king), and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with
Israel, and were among them;
\v 2 that they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai,
and all the men thereof were mighty.
