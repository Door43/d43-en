Some translations prefer to set apart extended or important quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 10:12-13, which is a quotation.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "For Yahweh was waging war on behalf of Israel" ==
Israel's conquest of the Promised Land was Yahweh's war on the ungodly Canaanites more than Israel's war. This type of war was different from other wars and God gave Israel special instructions. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:promisedland]] and [[:en:obe:kt:ungodly]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Idiom ==
 
The people of Gibeon used an idiom when they called for help from Israel: "Do not withdraw your hands," meaning "do not stop protecting." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
