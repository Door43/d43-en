\v 29 Joshua and all Israel passed on from Makkedah to Libnah. He went into battle against Libnah.
\v 30 Yahweh also gave it into the hand of Israelâ€”along with their king. Joshua struck it with the edge of the sword and every person in it; he left no survivor in it. And he did to its king just as he had done to the king of Jericho.
