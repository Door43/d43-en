\v 29 Joshua and all Israel passed on from Makkedah to Libnah. He went into battle against Libnah.
\v 30 Yahweh also gave it into the hand of Israel—along with their king. Joshua attacked every living creature in it with the sword. He did not leave a survivor alive in it. He did to the king just as he had done to the king of Jericho.
