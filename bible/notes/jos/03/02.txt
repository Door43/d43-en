\v 4 You have not been here\f + \ft Or: along this road \f* before, so you must follow the priests. But do not walk close to the chest. Stay 1,000 yards, Or: meters from the chest. The chest is sacred, so God will punish you\f + \ft Or: you will be punished \f* if you come close to it."

\v 2 After three days, the officers went through the middle of the camp.
\v 3 They instructed the people, "As soon as you see the priests, some of the descendants of Levi, carrying the sacred chest of Yahweh your God, then you will know it is time to leave this place and follow the sacred chest.
\v 4 Keep about nine hundred meters away from it. Do not come closer than that to it. You do not know the way you should go, since you have not gone this way before."

\v 2 After three days, the officers went through the middle of the camp;
\v 3 they commanded the people, "When you see the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your God, and the priests from the Levites carrying it, you must leave this place and follow it.
\v 4 There must be a distance between you and it of about two thousand cubits. Do not come close to it, so that you can see which way to go, since you have not gone this way before."
