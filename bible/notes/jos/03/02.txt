\v 4 You have not been here\f + \ft Or: along this road \f* before, so you must follow the priests. But do not walk close to the chest. Stay 1,000 yards, Or: meters from the chest. The chest is sacred, so God will punish you\f + \ft Or: you will be punished \f* if you come close to it."

\v 2 And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the midst of the camp;
\v 3 and they commanded the people, saying, When you see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then you shall remove from your place, and go after it.
\v 4 Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near to it, that you may know the way by which you must go; for you have not passed this way heretofore.
