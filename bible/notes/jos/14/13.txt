\v 13 Then Joshua blessed him and he gave Caleb son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance.
\v 14 Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day because he completely followed Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\v 15 Now the name of Hebron formerly was Kiriath-arba. (Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim.) The land had rest from war.
