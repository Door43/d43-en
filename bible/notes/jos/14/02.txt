====== Joshua 14:2-5 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 2-5 Yahweh had told Moses many years previously in what way he wanted the division of the land to be decided. Moses had already declared that two and a half tribes would be allotted land on the east side of the Jordan \add River\add*. Joseph had two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. \add Half of the tribe descended from Manasseh was allotted land on the east side of the Jordan, along with the tribes of Reuben and Gad\add*. The people belonging to the nine and a half other tribes \add on the west side of the Jordan River\add* threw lots\f + \ft Or: stones that had been marked \f* to decide which land each tribe would receive. The tribe of Levi was not allotted any land. They received only towns \add that already existed\add*, towns in which to live, and pastures\f + \ft Or: fields of grass \f* for their animals.

\v 2 The assignments were made by casting lots for each one of the nine and one half tribes. This was just as Yahweh had commanded Moses to do, so that the land could be assigned to each of the tribes and their clans.
\v 3-4 Now Moses had given land as a permanent possession to two and one half tribes before Israel crossed over the Jordan River. But to the Levites he gave no inheritance; they were treated differently because of their priestly duties. No portion of the land was given to the Levites. They were, however, given cities in which to live, including pastureland for their livestock so they could sustain their families. And the people of Joseph were divided into two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim.
\v 5 The people of Israel did as Yahweh commanded Moses: they gave out portions of the land as permanent possessions.

\v 2 Their inheritance was selected by lot for the nine and one half tribes, just as Yahweh had commanded by the hand of Moses,
\v 3 For Moses had given the inheritance of the two and one half tribes beyond the Jordan, but to the Levites he gave no inheritance.
\v 4 The tribe of Joseph was actually two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. And no portion of the inheritance was given to the Levites in the land, but only certain cities to live in, with their pasturelands for livestock and for their own material resources.
\v 5 The people of Israel did as Yahweh commanded Moses, so they assigned the land.
