====== Joshua 04 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== God's war ==
The conquering of the Promised Land was a special war. It was God's war against the people of Canaan and Joshua recognized that they would only be victorious through Yahweh's power. This is why their first act after crossing the Jordan River was to build an altar. This war was a witness to Yahweh's power. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:promisedland]])
