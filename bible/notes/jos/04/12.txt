\v 14 On that day, all the people of Israel saw that Yahweh had made Joshua to be a great leader. And they honored Joshua for the rest of his life, just as they had honored Moses.

\v 12 The soldiers of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and of half of the soldiers of the tribe of Manasseh, crossed over ahead of the rest of the Israelite people. As Moses had ordered them to do, they marched in the formation of an army.
\v 13 About forty thousand men were marching before Yahweh. These men were armed and prepared for war, and they were heading for the plains of Jericho where they would fight a battle.
\v 14 On that day, all the people of Israel saw that Yahweh had made Joshua a great leader. And they honored Joshua just as they had honored Moses—all the days of his life.
