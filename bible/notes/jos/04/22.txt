\v 22 Tell them, 'This is where Israel crossed the Jordan River on dry ground.'
\v 23 Yahweh, your God, dried up the river for you, until you had all crossed over. Yahweh, the God you worship, did to the Jordan River just as  he did to the Sea of Reeds, when he caused it to become dry until we had all crossed over it, just as he did here.

\v 24 so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of Yahweh is mighty, and that you will honor Yahweh your God forever."
