\v 24 Yahweh did that in order that all the people-groups of the earth may know that he \f + \ft metonymy \f* is very powerful, and in order that you may always be in awe of\f + \ft Or: respect \f* Yahweh, your God.'~"

<usfm>
\v 22 Tell them, 'This is where Israel crossed the Jordan River on dry ground.'
\v 23 Yahweh, your God, dried up the river for you, until you had all crossed over. Yahweh, the God you worship, did to the Jordan River just as he did to the Sea of Reeds, when he caused it to become dry until we had all crossed over it, just as he did here.
\v 24 Yahweh did that in order that all the peoples of the earth may know that he is powerful, and so you may forever give him the honor he deserves."

\v 22 Tell your children, 'This is where Israel crossed over the Jordan on dry ground.'
\v 23 Yahweh your God dried up the waters of the Jordan for you, until you had crossed over, just as Yahweh your God did to the Sea of Reeds, which he dried up for us until we passed over, 
\v 24 so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of Yahweh is mighty, and that you will honor Yahweh your God forever."
