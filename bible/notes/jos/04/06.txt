\v 6 These stones will be a monument for you to see. In the future, your children will ask, 'What do these stones mean?'
\v 7 Tell them that the water in the Jordan River was blocked off when the priests were carrying the sacred chest that Yahweh gave us. When the chest was carried into the Jordan River, the water was blocked off so that we were able to cross the Jordan on dry ground. Where we leave these stones is the place for the people of Israel to forever remember what Yahweh has done."

\v 6 This will be a sign in your midst for you when your children ask in days to come, 'What do these stones mean to you?'
\v 7 Then you will say to them, 'The waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh. When it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. So these stones will be a memorial to the people of Israel forever.'"
