\v 6 These stones will be a monument for you to see. In the future, your children will ask, 'What do these stones mean?'
\v 7 Tell them that the water in the Jordan River was blocked off when the priests were carrying the sacred chest that Yahweh gave us. When the chest was carried into the Jordan River, the water was blocked off so that we were able to cross the Jordan on dry ground.
