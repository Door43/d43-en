\v 8 So the people of Israel did what Joshua commanded them to do. They went and picked up twelve large stones from the middle of the Jordan riverbed, one stone for each of the tribes of Israel, just as Yahweh had told Joshua, and they carried the stones to where they were staying, and they put the stones down there.
\v 9 Then Joshua took twelve other stones and stacked them up in the middle of the Jordan River, where the priests who carried the sacred chest of Yahweh were standing. And that monument is still there to this day..

\v 8 The people of Israel did just as Joshua commanded, and they picked up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, as Yahweh said to Joshua, they were set up in the same number as the tribes of the people of Israel.  They carried them over with them to the place where they had spent the night and they set them down there.
\v 9 Then Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests that carried the ark of the covenant stood. And the memorial is there to this day.
