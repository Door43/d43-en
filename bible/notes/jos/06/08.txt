\v 8 Just as Joshua commanded his army, the seven priests, each carrying a trumpet, started began moving forward as Yahweh had directed. Each walked ahead and then gave a blast on his trumpet. The ones who carried Yahweh's sacred chest followed them.
\v 9 The armed soldiers marched in front of the priests who were blowing on their trumpets. When the rest of the soldiers followed the chest, while they were all marching, the priests kept blowing their trumpets.

\v 8 Just as Joshua had said to the people, the seven priests carried the seven trumpets of rams' horns before Yahweh. As they advanced, they gave a blast on the trumpets. The ark of the covenant of Yahweh followed after them.
\v 9 Armed men walked before the priests, and they made a blast on their trumpets, but then the rear guard walked up behind the ark, and the priests blew their trumpets continually.
