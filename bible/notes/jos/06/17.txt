<usfm>
\v 17 Yahweh has declared that you must destroy [IDI] the city and everything in it \add to show that it belongs to him\add*. You must spare only Rahab the prostitute and the others who are in her house, because she hid the spies whom we sent there.
\v 18 And because Yahweh has declared that everything must be destroyed [IDI], you must not take \f + \ft euphemism \f* any of the things in the city. If you take anything, you will cause Yahweh to destroy our own camp and cause terrible things to happen to us.
\v 19 But all the silver and gold and articles made from iron and bronze that you find, you must set apart for Yahweh. You must put those things in his treasury."

\v 17 Yahweh has declared that you must destroy the city and everything in it to show that it belongs to him. Only Rahab the prostitute will live—and all who are in her house with her—because she hid the spies we sent.
\v 18 And because Yahweh has declared that everything must be destroyed, you must not take any of the things in the city. If you take anything, you will cause Yahweh to destroy the camp of Israel and bring trouble to it.
\v 19 But all the silver and gold and articles made from iron and bronze that you find, you must set apart for Yahweh. You must put those things in his treasury."

<usfm>
\v 17 The city and all that is in it will be reserved to Yahweh for destruction. Only Rahab the prostitute will live—she and all the ones with her in her house—because she hid the men we sent.
\v 18 But as for you, be on guard about taking the things reserved for destruction, so that after you mark them for destruction, you do not then take any of them. If you do this, you will make the camp of Israel something that must be destroyed and you will bring trouble on it.
\v 19 All the silver, gold, and the things made of bronze and iron are holy to Yahweh. They must brought into the treasury of Yahweh."
