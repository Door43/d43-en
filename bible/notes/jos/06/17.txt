\v 17 Yahweh has declared that you must destroy [IDI] the city and everything in it \add to show that it belongs to him\add*. You must spare only Rahab the prostitute and the others who are in her house, because she hid the spies whom we sent there.
\v 18 And because Yahweh has declared that everything must be destroyed [IDI], you must not take \f + \ft euphemism \f* any of the things in the city. If you take anything, you will cause Yahweh to destroy our own camp and cause terrible things to happen to us.
\v 19 But all the silver and gold and articles made from iron and bronze that you find, you must set apart for Yahweh. You must put those things in his treasury."

<usfm>
\v 17 And the city shall be devoted, even it and all that is therein, to Jehovah: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all
that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.
\v 18 But as for you, only keep yourselves from the devoted thing, lest when you have devoted it, you take of the devoted thing;
so would you make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it.
\v 19 But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are holy to Jehovah: they shall come into the treasury of
Jehovah.
