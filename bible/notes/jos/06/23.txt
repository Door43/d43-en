<usfm>
\v 23-25 So those two spies\f + \ft Or: men \f* went into Rahab's house and brought her out. They also brought out her father and mother and her brothers, and all the rest of her family. Joshua's men spared Rahab the prostitute. They also did not kill all her relatives, because she had hidden and protected the spies\f + \ft Or: men \f* whom Joshua had sent to Jericho. The two men brought them all out and put them in a place outside the camp of the Israelites. Rahab still lives among us Israelite people. Then the soldiers gathered the articles made from silver, gold, bronze, and iron that they found and put them all into Yahweh's treasury. But they burned everything else that was in the city.
