====== Joshua 22:25 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 25 Yahweh caused the Jordan River to be a boundary between us and you people of the tribes of Reuben and Gad. So you are not allowed to worship Yahweh.' We were worried that your descendants would force our descendants to stop worshiping Yahweh.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 25 We are afraid that they will say to our children, "Yahweh made the Jordan River to be a boundary between us and you people of Reuben and you people of Gad. You have nothing to do with Yahweh.' And your children might try to stop our children from worshiping Yahweh.

  * **For Yahweh has made the Jordan ... nothing to do with Yahweh** - This is the continuation of the hypothetical accusation that the three tribes think the children of the other tribes may make sometime in the future. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **the Jordan** - This is a short name for the Jordan River.
  * **So your children might make our children cease to worship Yahweh** - The three tribes built the altar to avoid this hypothetical situation from happening in the future. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
