<usfm>
\v 19 If \add you think that Yahweh considers that\add* your land here is not suitable for worshiping him, come back to our land where Yahweh's Sacred Tent is. We can share our land with you. But do not rebel against Yahweh and against us by building another altar for Yahweh our God.
\v 20 Do you remember what happened when Zerah's son Achan refused to obey \add Yahweh's command to destroy everything in Jericho\add*? That one man disobeyed God's command, but many \f + \ft hyperbole \f* other Israelites were punished. Achan died because of his sin, but other Israelites also died."

\v 19 "If you think that Yahweh considers your land here is not suitable for worshiping him, come back to our land, where Yahweh's sacred tent is. We can share our land with you. But do not rebel against Yahweh or against us by building another altar for Yahweh our God.
\v 20 Surely you remember what happened when Zerah's son Achan refused to obey Yahweh's command to destroy everything in Jericho? That one man disobeyed God's command, but many other Israelites were punished for what he did."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 If the land that you possess is defiled, then you should pass over into the land where Yahweh's tabernacle stands and take for yourselves a possession among us. Only do not rebel against Yahweh, nor rebel against us by building an altar for yourselves other than the altar of Yahweh our God.
\v 20 Did not Achan, the son of Zerah, break faith in the matter of those things that had been reserved for God? And did not wrath fall on all the people of Israel? That man did not perish alone for his iniquity.'"
