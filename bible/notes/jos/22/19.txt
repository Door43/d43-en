\v 19 Howbeit, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass you over to the land of the possession of Jehovah, wherein
Jehovah’s tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against Jehovah, nor rebel against us, in building
you an altar besides the altar of Jehovah our God.
\v 20 Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing, and wrath fell upon all the congregation of
Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.
