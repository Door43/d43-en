== The tribes east of the Jordan River build a monument ==

The tribes east of the Jordan River said, "Let us now build an altar, not for burnt offerings nor for any sacrifices, but to be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we will perform the service of Yahweh before him, with our burnt offerings and with our sacrifices and with our peace offerings, so that your children will never say to our children in time to come, 'You have no share in Yahweh.'" They went home even though the Israelites had not fully conquered the land.
