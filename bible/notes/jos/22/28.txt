====== Joshua 22:28-29 ======

<usfm>
\v 28 In the future, if your descendants say that, our descendants can say, 'Look at the altar that our ancestors made! It is exactly like Yahweh's altar \add at Shiloh\add*, but we do not burn sacrifices on it. It only shows that we are Israelites!'
\v 29 We certainly do not want to rebel against Yahweh or stop doing what he desires, by building an altar for completely burning some sacrifices and burning grain offerings and making \add other\add* sacrifices. \add We know that\add* there is only one true altar for Yahweh our God, and it is in front of the Sacred Tent \add at Shiloh\add*."

\v 28 In the future, if your descendants say that, our descendants can say, 'Look at the altar that our ancestors made! It is exactly like Yahweh's altar at Shiloh, but we do not burn sacrifices on it. It is a monument which means that we and you together worship Yahweh!'
\v 29 We certainly do not want to rebel against Yahweh or stop doing what he desires. This altar was never intended to be used for the sacrifices, for burning flour offerings or for making other sacrifices. We know that there is only one true altar for Yahweh our God and that it is in front of the sacred tent."

\v 28 So we said, 'If this should be said to us or to our descendants in time to come, we would say, "Look! This is a copy of the altar of Yahweh, which our ancestors made, not for burned offerings, nor for sacrifices, but as a witness between us and you."
\v 29 May it be far from us that we should rebel against Yahweh, and today turn away from following him by building an altar for burnt offering, for grain offering, or for sacrifice, other than the altar of Yahweh our God that is before his tabernacle.'"
