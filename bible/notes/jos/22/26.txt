\v 26 So we said, 'Let us now build an altar, not for burned nor for any sacrifices,
\v 27 but to be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we do perform the service of Yahweh before him, with our burnt offerings and with our sacrifices and with our peace offerings, so that your children would not say to our children in time to come, 'You have nothing to do with Yahweh.'
