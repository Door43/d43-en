====== Joshua 22:26-27 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 26 That is the reason that we decided to build that \add new\add* altar. But it is not an altar for completely burning sacrifices of animals and \add burning other\add* sacrifices.
\v 27 We built that new altar to prove\f + \ft Or: show \f* to you and to us and to all of our descendants that we worship Yahweh by completely burning animal sacrifices and offerings of grain and offerings to restore fellowship with Yahweh \add only at Shiloh\add*. We do not want your descendants to say to our descendants, 'You do not belong to Yahweh.'

</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 26 So we said, 'Let us now build an altar, but not for bringing sacrifices nor for any offerings.
\v 27 Instead, we want it to be a monument to prove to you, to ourselves, and to all of our descendants after us, that we truly worship Yahweh. We indeed worship him by our burned sacrifices and our offerings, and our offerings to promise friendship with him. We built this altar so your descendants may never say to our descendants in the future, "Yahweh never gave you any portion of this land; you do not belong here."'

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 26 So we said, 'Let us now build an altar, not for burnt offerings nor for any sacrifices,
\v 27 but to be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we will perform the service of Yahweh before him, with our burnt offerings and with our sacrifices and with our peace offerings, so that your children will never say to our children in time to come, "You have no share in Yahweh."'
