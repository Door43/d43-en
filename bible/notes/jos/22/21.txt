\v 21 The \add leaders of\add* the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh replied,
\v 22 "Yahweh, the almighty God, knows \add why we did that\add*, and we want you to know, too. If we have done something wrong \add against Yahweh\add*, you may kill us.
\v 23 If we have disobeyed one of Yahweh's laws, we request that he should punish us. We did not build that new altar to completely burn animals as sacrifices to Yahweh, or to offer on it sacrifices of grain or sacrifices to restore fellowship with God.

\v 21 The leaders of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh replied,
\v 22 "Yahweh, the almighty God, knows why we did that, and we want you to know, too. If we have not been faithful to our promise to serve Yahweh, do not have any mercy on us, but take our lives.
\v 23 If we have built this altar so we can turn away from obeying Yahweh, or if we have built this altar to offer sacrifices, grain offerings, or sacrifices to promise friendship with him, in violation of the law, may Yahweh punish us and even take our lives.

\v 21 Then the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh replied in answer to the heads of the clans of Israel:
\v 22 "The Mighty One, God, Yahweh! The Mighty One, God, Yahweh!â€”He knows, and let Israel itself know! If it was in rebellion or in breach of faith against Yahweh, do not spare us on this day
\v 23 for having built an altar to turn ourselves away from following Yahweh. If we built that altar in order to offer on it burnt offerings, grain offerings, or peace offerings, then let Yahweh make us pay for it.
