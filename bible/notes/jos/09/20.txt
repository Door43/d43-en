\v 20 If we kill them, God will be very angry with us and punish us because we did not keep our promise to them, a promise that binds us by solemn oath. But this is what we can do:
\v 21 We will allow them to live, but they will become our servants; they will cut wood and  carry water for all the people." This is what happened, just as the leaders planned.
