\v 3 But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,
\v 4 they also did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and
wine-skins, old and tore and bound up,
\v 5 and old and patched shoes upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and
was become mouldy.
