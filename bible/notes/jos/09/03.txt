\v 3 When the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,
\v 4 they acted with a cunning plan. They supplied  themselves with provisions and took worn out sacks and put them on their donkeys. They also took old wine skins that were worn, torn, and had been repaired. 
\v 5 They put old and patched sandals on their feet, and dressed in old, worn out  clothing. All the bread in their food supply was dry and moldy.
