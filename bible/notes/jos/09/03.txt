\v 3 When the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,
\v 4 they acted with a cunning plan. They supplied  themselves with provisions and took worn-out sacks and put them on their donkeys. They also took old wine skins that were worn, torn, and had been repaired. 
\v 5 They put old and patched sandals on their feet, and dressed in old, worn-out  clothing. All the bread in their food supply was dry and moldy.
