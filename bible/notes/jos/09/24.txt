\v 24 The men from Gibeon replied, "We lied to you because we were afraid that you would kill us. We heard that Yahweh, your God, declared to his servant Moses that he would enable you to conquer all the people in this land and to kill all the people who lived in it.
\v 25 So now you can decide what you will do with us. Do what you think is right."

\v 24 They answered Joshua and said, "Because it was told to your servants that Yahweh your God commanded his
servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land before you—so we were very afraid for our lives because of you. That is why we did this thing.
\v 25 Now, look, we are in your hand.  Whatever seems good and right for you to do to us, do it."
