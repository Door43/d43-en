\v 11 Our elders and all the inhabitants of our country said to us, 'Take provisions in your hand for the journey. Go to meet them and say to them, "We are your servants.  Make a treaty with us."
\v 12 This is our bread, it was still warm when we took it from our houses on the day we set out to come to you. But now, see, it is dry and moldy.
\v 13 These wineskins were new when we filled them, and look, they have burst. Our garments and our sandals are worn out from a very long journey.'"
