\v 22 And Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, Wherefore have you beguiled us, saying, We are very far from
you; when you dwell among us?
\v 23 Now therefore you are cursed, and there shall never fail to be of you bondmen, both hewers of wood and drawers of water
for the house of my God.
