\v 22 Then Joshua summoned the men from Gibeon and asked them, "Why did you lie to us? Your land was near to where we had set up our tents, but you told us that you were from a distant land!
\v 23 So now you will become our slaves. You will always be forced to cut wood and carry water for \add us Israelite people who worship in\add* the temple of our God." That fulfilled \add what Noah\add* predicted \add when he said that the descendants of Canaan would be\add* cursed \add by being the slaves of the descendants of Shem\add*.

\v 22 Then Joshua summoned the men from Gibeon and asked them, "Why did you lie to us? Your homes are near to us, close to our homes, but you told us that you were from a distant land!
\v 23 Now you are going to live under a curse. You will become our slaves. You will always be forced to cut wood and carry water for the house of my God."

\v 22 Joshua called for them and said, "Why did you deceive us when you said, 'We are very far from you', when you live among us?
\v 23 Now, because of this, you are cursed. Some of you will always be slaves and those who cut wood and draw water
for the house of my God."
