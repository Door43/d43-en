\v 13 So they set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers-in-wait that were on the
west of the city; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.
\v 14 And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out
against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed, before the Arabah; but he knew not that there was an
ambush against him behind the city.
