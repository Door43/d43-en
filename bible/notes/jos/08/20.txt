===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The men of Ai turned ... they saw ... Joshua and all Israel ... turned around ... they killed** - These are the main events in the story. If your language has a way of marking that the writer adds all the words from "they saw the smoke from the city rising" to "with the smoke rising" so the reader understands why "they turned around and they killed," you may want to use it here.
