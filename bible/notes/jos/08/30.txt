\v 31 They built it just like Moses, the man who served God \add well\add*, had written previously in the laws \add that God had given to him\add*. They made it from stones that had not been cut, stones on which \add they had done no work\add* using iron tools.

\p
\v 30 Then Joshua built an altar to Yahweh, the God of Israel, on Mount Ebal,
\v 31 just as Moses, the servant of Yahweh had commanded the people of Israel, as it was written in the book of the law of Moses: "An altar from uncut stones, on which no one has wielded an iron tool." And he offered on it burnt offerings to Yahweh, and they sacrificed peace offerings.
\v 32 And there in the presence of the people of Israel, he wrote on the stones a copy of the law of Moses.
