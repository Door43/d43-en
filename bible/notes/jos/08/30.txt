\p
\v 30 Then Joshua built an altar to Jehovah, the God of Israel, in mount Ebal,
\v 31 as Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an
altar of unhewn stones, upon which no man had lifted up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings to Jehovah, and
sacrificed peace-offerings.
\v 32 And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote, in the presence of the children of Israel.
