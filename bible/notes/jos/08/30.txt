\v 30 Then Joshua built an altar to Yahweh, the God of Israel, on Mount Ebal,
\v 31 just as Moses, the servant of Yahweh had commanded the people of Israel, as it was written in the book of the Law of Moses: "An altar from uncut stones, on which no one has wielded an iron tool." And he offered on it burnt offerings to Yahweh, and they sacrificed peace offerings.
\v 32 And there in the presence of the people of Israel, he wrote on the stones a copy of the Law of Moses.
