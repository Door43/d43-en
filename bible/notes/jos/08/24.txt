\v 24 It came about when Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field near the wilderness where they pursued them, and when all of them, to the very last one, had fallen by the edge of the sword, all Israel returned to Ai. They attacked it with the edge of the sword. 
\v 25 All those who fell that day, both men and women, were twelve thousand, all the people of Ai.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **when Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants ... when all of them ... had fallen by the edge of the sword** - The writer uses both of these sentences, which mean almost the same thing, to strongly say that the Israelites had obeyed God's command to kill everyone in Ai. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **had fallen by the edge of the sword** - "had been killed with swords by the army of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
