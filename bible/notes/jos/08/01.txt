\v 1 Then Yahweh said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid or discouraged \add because of what happened\add* at Ai. Lead all of your soldiers and go there again. I will help you to defeat the king of Ai, his people, and his city, and \add enable you to take\add* his land.
\v 2 Your army will do the people of Ai and their king like what you did to the people of Jericho and their king. But this time \add I will permit\add* you to take all their possessions and keep them for yourselves. But first, tell some of your soldiers to \add hide behind\add* the city and prepare to suddenly attack it."

\p
\v 1 And Jehovah said to Joshua, Fear not, neither be you dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up
to Ai; see, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land;
\v 2 And you shall do to Ai and her king as you did to Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle
thereof, shall you take for a prey to yourselves: set you an ambush for the city behind it.
