\v 1 Then Yahweh said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid or discouraged \add because of what happened\add* at Ai. Lead all of your soldiers and go there again. I will help you to defeat the king of Ai, his people, and his city, and \add enable you to take\add* his land.
\v 2 Your army will do the people of Ai and their king like what you did to the people of Jericho and their king. But this time \add I will permit\add* you to take all their possessions and keep them for yourselves. But first, tell some of your soldiers to \add hide behind\add* the city and prepare to suddenly attack it."

\v 2 Your army will do to the people of Ai and their king like what you did to the people of Jericho and their king. But this time I will permit you to take all their possessions and keep them for yourselves. But first, tell some of your soldiers to hide behind the city and prepare to attack it."

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **Do not fear; do not be discouraged** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Yahweh combines them to emphasize that there is no reason to be afraid. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
