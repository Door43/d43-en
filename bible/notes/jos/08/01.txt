\v 1 Then Yahweh said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid or discouraged \add because of what happened\add* at Ai. Lead all of your soldiers and go there again. I will help you to defeat the king of Ai, his people, and his city, and \add enable you to take\add* his land.
\v 2 Your army will do the people of Ai and their king like what you did to the people of Jericho and their king. But this time \add I will permit\add* you to take all their possessions and keep them for yourselves. But first, tell some of your soldiers to \add hide behind\add* the city and prepare to suddenly attack it."

\v 1 Then Yahweh said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid or discouraged. Take with you all the soldiers you have and go there again. Go up to Ai. See! I am giving you victory over the king of Ai, and you will capture his people, and his city, and his land.
\v 2 Your army will do to the people of Ai and their king like what you did to the people of Jericho and their king. But this time I will permit you to take all their possessions and keep them for yourselves. But first, tell some of your soldiers to hide behind the city and prepare to attack it."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Do not fear; do not be discouraged** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Yahweh combines them to emphasize that there is no reason to be afraid. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **I have given** - God speaks of what he promises to do as though he had already done it, because he will certainly do it. AT: "I will certainly give" or "I am giving" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pastforfuture]])
  * **I have given into your hand the king of Ai ... and his land** - Giving them into Israel's hand represents giving Israel victory and control over them. AT: "I have given you victory over the king of Ai and his people, and I have given you control over his city and his land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **her king** - The word "her" refers to the city of Ai. Cities were often spoken of as if they were women. AT: "its king" or "their king" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
