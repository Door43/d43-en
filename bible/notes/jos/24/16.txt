\v 16 The Israelite people answered, "We will always worship Yahweh! We promise that we will never worship or bow down to any other gods!
\v 17 It was Yahweh who brought our ancestors up out of Egypt. He rescued us from that land, where they were slaves. We saw him perform great miracles, and he protected us when we were traveling. He protected us wherever we went; he kept us safe from the armies of many kings. We became a great nation, and we have entered this land.
\v 18 Yahweh drove out all the people before us. He defeated the Amorites, who lived in the land. So we will worship and bow down to Yahweh, for he is our God."

\v 16 The people answered and said, "We would never  forsake Yahweh to serve other gods,
\v 17 for it is Yahweh our God who brought us and our ancestors up from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, and who did those great signs in our sight, and who preserved us in all the way that we went, and among all the nations through whom we passed.
\v 18 And Yahweh drove out before us all the peoples, the Amorites who lived in this land. So we also will worship Yahweh, for he is our God."
