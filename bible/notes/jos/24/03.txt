<usfm>
\v 3 But I took your ancestor Abraham from that land east of the Euphrates River, and I led him as he lived in various places in this land of Canaan, and I enabled him to have many descendants. First, I enabled him to have a son, Isaac.
\v 4 When Isaac grew up, I enabled him to have twin sons, Jacob and Esau. I enabled Esau to live in the hilly area in Seir region, but many years later Jacob and his sons and their families went down to live in Egypt.

    * **Seir**  - name of a place or location. Be sure to translate the same way as in Genesis 14:6, 32:3, 33:14,16, 36:8-9, 20-21, 30, Numbers 24:18, and many more. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
