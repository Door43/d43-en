===== Translation Notes: =====

Joshua continues quoting what Yahweh said about his dealings with his people.

    * **Balak**  - Be sure to translate the same way as throughout Numbers 22-24, Judges 11:25, Micah 6:5 and Revelation 2:14. Translate his father's name Zippor the same way in all theses places also. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
