\v 15 But if you do not want to serve\f + \ft Or: worship \f* Yahweh, you should decide today what \add gods\add* you will serve\f + \ft Or: worship \f*. You should decide whether you will serve\f + \ft Or: worship \f* the gods that your ancestors who lived on the other\f + \ft Or: east \f* side of the Euphrates River served, or whether you will serve\f + \ft Or: worship \f* the gods that the descendants of Amor, who previously lived in the land where you are now living, \add serve\f + \ft Or: worship \f*\add*.

\v 14 Joshua continued to speak: "Now be afraid and be in awe of Yahweh. Worship him sincerely, and be faithful when you make promises to him. Throw away the idols that your ancestors worshiped when they lived on the far side of the Euphrates River, and when they lived in Egypt. Worship Yahweh alone.
\v 15 If you do not want to worship Yahweh, then decide today what gods you will worship. In that case, you must decide whether you will worship the gods of your ancestors, the gods that they worshiped when they lived on the other side of the Euphrates River, or whether you will worhsip the gods of the Amorites, the gods that those people worshiped in this land where you now live. But as for me and my family, we will worship Yahweh."

\v 14 Now fear Yahweh and worship him with all integrity and faithfulness; get rid of the gods that your ancestors worshiped beyond the Euphrates and in Egypt, and worship Yahweh.
\v 15 If it seems wrong in your eyes for you to worship Yahweh, choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your ancestors worshiped beyond the Euphrates, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you live. But as for me and my house, we will worship Yahweh."
