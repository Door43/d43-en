\v 7 Then \add your ancestors\add* pleaded with me to help them.

I separated the water so that your ancestors could cross it, but when the Egyptian army tried to cross in the same way to pursue them, I caused the water to come back and cover them, and the Egyptian soldiers all drowned, as your ancestors watched and were amazed [IDI]. But after that, you lived in the desert for many years.
