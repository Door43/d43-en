\v 6 The people who heard me say that replied to me,
\q2 "Do not prophesy such things!
\q2 Do not say that Yahweh is going to humiliate us by causing us to experience disasters!"
\q1
\v 7 But you people talk like that!
\q2 You say that Yahweh never gets angry,
\q2 and that he never really punishes us."
\q1
\v 8 But Yahweh says,
\q2 "Recently my people have been acting toward me like an enemy.
\q1 You rich people refuse to return the coats of those who have borrowed money from you, 
\q2 the coats they gave you to promise that they would repay their debts.
\q2 You take their coats without warning, surprising them as much as soldiers returning from war would be surprised by attacks instead of safety at home.

\v 6 "Do not prophesy,"
\q they say.
\q "They must not prophesy these things;
\q reproaches must not come."
\q
\v 7 Should it really be said, house of Jacob,
\q "Is the Spirit of Yahweh angry?
\q Are these really his deeds?"
\q Do not my words do good
\q to anyone who walks uprightly?
\q
\v 8 Yahweh says, "Lately my people have risen up like an enemy.
\q You strip the robe, the garment from those who pass by unsuspectedly,
\q as soldiers return from war to what they think is safety.
