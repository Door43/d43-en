\v 7 But you people \f + \ft metonymy \f* of Israel should not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* talk like that!
\q2 The Spirit of Yahweh will certainly not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* be \add patient with people who say such things\add*!

\v 6 The people who heard me say that replied to me,
\q2 "Do not prophesy such things!
\q2 Do not say that Yahweh is going to humiliate us by causing us to experience disasters!"
\q1
\v 7 But you people talk like that!
\q2 You say that Yahweh never gets angry,
\q2 and that he never really punishes us."
\q1 Of course, what I say certainly helps those who live in the right way.
\q1
\v 8 But Yahweh says,
\q2 "Recently my people have been acting toward me like an enemy.
\q1 You rich people refuse to return the coats of those who have borrowed money from you,
\q2 the coats they gave you to promise that they would repay their debts.
\q2 You take their coats without warning, surprising them as much as soldiers returning from war would be surprised by attacks instead of safety at home.

\q
\v 6 "Do not prophesy,"
\q they say.
\q "They must not prophesy these things;
\q reproaches must not come."
\q
\v 7 Should it really be said, house of Jacob,
\q "Is the Spirit of Yahweh angry?
\q Are these really his deeds?"
\q Do not my words do good
\q to anyone who walks uprightly?
\q
\v 8 Lately my people have risen up like an enemy.
\q You strip the robe, the garment, from those who pass by unsuspectingly,
\q as soldiers return from war to what they think is safety.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Micah speaks to false prophets, as well as to the rich who have abused their power.

  * **Do not prophesy** - The speakers are speaking to Micah and to others, so this is plural. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **they say** - "the people of Israel say"
  * **They must not prophesy** - "The prophets must not prophesy"
  * **reproaches must not come** - Reproach is spoken of as if it were a robber chasing a person. It can be translated as a verb. AT: "we will not allow you to reproach us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Should it really be said ... "Is the Spirit ... his deeds?"** - Micah is scolding the Israelites by using this question. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "You know that you do not need to ask ... 'Is the Spirit ... his deeds?'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **house of Jacob** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house. In this case it refers to Jacob's descendants. AT: "descendants of Jacob" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **said ... "Is the Spirit of Yahweh angry? Are these really his deeds?"** - Possible meanings are 1) the people really do not know if they are seeing Yahweh act. AT: "asked ... 'Is the Spirit of Yahweh angry? Are these really his deeds?'" or 2) the people do not believe that Yahweh is really punishing them. These rhetorical questions can be translated as statements. AT: "said ... 'The Spirit of Yahweh is not really angry. These are not really his deeds.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Do not my words do good to anyone who walks uprightly?** - Micah uses a question to teach the people. It can bee translated as a statement. AT: "My message does good to those who walk uprightly." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **my people** - This refers to either 1) Micah's people or 2) Yahweh's people.
  * **You strip the robe, the garment, from those who pass by unsuspectingly** - Possible meanings are 1) the wicked rich people are literally stealing robes from the poor or 2) creditors are keeping the outer garments of the poor who come to borrow money and give the garment as assurance they will repay. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
