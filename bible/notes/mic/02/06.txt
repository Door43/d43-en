\v 6 The people who heard me say that replied to me,
\q2 "Do not prophesy such things!
\q2 Do not say that Yahweh is going to humiliate us by causing us to experience disasters!"
\q1
\v 7 But you people talk like that!
\q2 You say that Yahweh never gets angry,
\q2 and that he never really punishes us."
\q1 Of course, what I say certainly helps those who live in the right way.
\q1
\v 8 But Yahweh says,
\q2 "Recently my people have been acting toward me like an enemy.
\q1 You rich people refuse to return the coats of those who have borrowed money from you, 
\q2 the coats they gave you to promise that they would repay their debts.
\q2 You take their coats without warning, surprising them as much as soldiers returning from war would be surprised by attacks instead of safety at home.

\v 6 "Do not prophesy,"
\q they say.
\q "They must not prophesy these things;
\q reproaches must not come."
\q
\v 7 Should it really be said, house of Jacob,
\q "Is the Spirit of Yahweh angry?
\q Are these really his deeds?"
\q Do not my words do good
\q to anyone who walks uprightly?
\q
\v 8 Lately my people have risen up like an enemy.
\q You strip the robe, the garment, from those who pass by unsuspectingly,
\q as soldiers return from war to what they think is safety.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Micah 2:6-11 addresses prophets who have not preached correctly, ones who have rejected Micah, and more ways the rich have abused their power.

  * **they say** - "the people of Israel say"
  * **They must not prophesy** - "The prophets must not prophesy"
  * **Is the Spirit of Yahweh angry? Are these really his deeds?** - The people use questions to emphasize that they have misunderstood and do not believe God would really punish them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Do not my words do good to anyone who walks uprightly?** - Micah uses a question to teach the people. AT: "My message is good to those who are concerned with doing what is right."
  * **my people** - Here "my" refers to Yahweh.
  * **You strip the robe, the garment, from those who pass by unsuspectingly** - Possible meanings are 1) Micah means the wicked rich people are literally stealing robes from the poor, but this is unlikely. Or 2) Micah is referring to creditors keeping the outer garments of the poor who come to borrow money and give the garment as assurance they will repay. According to the law in Exodus, they were to return the garment before nightfall because it might be the only thing the poor man has to keep warm at night. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
