\q
\v 9 You drive the women belonging to my people from their pleasant houses;
\q you take my blessing from their young children forever.
\q
\v 10 Get up and leave,
\q for this is not a place where you can stay,
\q because of its uncleanness;
\q it is destroyed with complete destruction.
\q
\v 11 If someone comes to you in a spirit of falsehood and lies and says,
\q "I will prophesy to you about wine and strong drink,"
\q he would be considered to be a prophet for this people.
