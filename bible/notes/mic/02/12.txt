\v 12 I will surely assemble all of you, Jacob.
\q I will surely gather the remnant of Israel.
\q I will bring them together like sheep in a fold,
\q like a flock in the midst of their pasture.
\q There will be a loud noise because of the multitude of people.
\q
\v 13 Someone who breaks open their way for them will go ahead of them.
\q They break through the gate and go out;
\q their king will pass on before them.
\q Yahweh will be at their head.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking. At the end of this chapter, Yahweh shows himself to be a shepherd who protects his people. He may especially be addressing those in Jerusalem who have returned from Assyria.

  * **Someone who breaks open their way … Yahweh will be at their head.**  - This is a picture of the King leading his people out of an enclosed city.
