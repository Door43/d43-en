\v 12 I will surely assemble all of you, Jacob.
\q I will surely gather the remnant of Israel.
\q I will bring them together like sheep in a fold,
\q like a flock in the midst of their pasture.
\q There will be the loud noise because of the multitude of people.
\q
\v 13 Someone who breaks open their way for them will go ahead of them.
\q They break through the gate and go out;
\q their king will pass on before them.
\q Yahweh will be at their head.
