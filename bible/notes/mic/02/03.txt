\v 3 Therefore, this is what Yahweh says:
\q1 "I will cause you people to experience disasters,
\q2 and you will not be able to escape \f + \ft metonymy \f* from them.
\q1 You will no longer walk around proudly,
\q2 because when that happens, it will be a time of much trouble for you.
\q1
\v 4 At that time, \add your enemies\add* will make fun of you;
\q2 they will ridicule you by singing this sad song:
\q1 'We are completely ruined;
\q2 Yahweh is taking our land\f + \ft Or: fields \f* from us,
\q1 and he will give it to those who will capture us.'~"
\q1
\v 5 So \add when it is the time for the land to be given back to you\add* people who belong to Yahweh,
\q2 there will be no one \f + \ft metonymy \f* who will be able to cast lots\f + \ft Or: throw marked stones \f* to determine which land belongs to whom.

\v 3 Therefore, this is what Yahweh says:
\q1 "I will cause you people of Israel to experience disasters,
\q2 and you will not be able to escape from them.
\q1 You will no longer walk around proudly,
\q2 because when that happens, it will be a time of much trouble for you.
\q1
\v 4 At that time, your enemies will make fun of you rich people;
\q2 they will ridicule you by singing this sad song about you:
\q1 'We Israelites are completely ruined;
\q2 Yahweh is taking our land from us,
\q1 and he will give it to those who capture us.'"
\q1
\v 5 So when it is the time for the land to be given back to you people who belong to Yahweh,
\q2 there will be no one alive among you rich families to receive back any of that land.

\q
\v 3 Therefore Yahweh says this:
\q "Look, I am about to bring disaster against this clan,
\q from which you will not remove your necks.
\q You will not walk arrogantly,
\q for it will be an evil time.
\q
\v 4 In that day your enemies will sing a song about you,
\q and lament with a wailing lamentation.
\q They will sing, 'We Israelites are completely ruined;
\q Yahweh changes the territory of my people.
\q How can he remove it from me?
\q He portions out our fields to traitors!'"
\q
\v 5 Therefore, you rich people will have no descendants to divide up the territory by lot
\q in the assembly of Yahweh.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **this clan**  - This "clan" refers to the entire community of Israel, whose rich people are oppressing the poor. The sins of the leaders are coming back on the whole nation.
  * **from which you will not remove your necks**  - Yahweh means his punishment is like a yoke around their necks. It is something that will bring down the pride of the rich. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **lament with a wailing lamentation**  - "they will cry loudly"
  * **How can he remove it from me?**  - The enemy uses a question in their song to express the surprise the rich leaders of Israel felt because God had taken their land and given it to someone else just as they had taken the land from the poor. AT: "He has taken it from me!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **Therefore, you rich people will have no descendants to divide up the territory by lot in the assembly of Yahweh. **- Those who took land from the poor will not receive the inheritance they denied others.
