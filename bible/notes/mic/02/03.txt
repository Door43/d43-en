\v 3 Therefore, this is what Yahweh says:
\q1 "I will cause you people to experience disasters,
\q2 and you will not be able to escape \f + \ft metonymy \f* from them.
\q1 You will no longer walk around proudly,
\q2 because when that happens, it will be a time of much trouble for you.
\q1
\v 4 At that time, \add your enemies\add* will make fun of you;
\q2 they will ridicule you by singing this sad song:
\q1 'We are completely ruined;
\q2 Yahweh is taking our land\f + \ft Or: fields \f* from us,
\q1 and he will give it to those who will capture us.'~"
\q1
\v 5 So \add when it is the time for the land to be given back to you\add* people who belong to Yahweh,
\q2 there will be no one \f + \ft metonymy \f* who will be able to cast lots\f + \ft Or: throw marked stones \f* to determine which land belongs to whom.

\v 3 Therefore thus says Jehovah: Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which you shall not remove your necks,
neither shall you walk haughtily; for it is an evil time.
\v 4 In that day shall they take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation,
and say, We are utterly ruined: he changes the portion of my people: how does he remove
it from me! to the rebellious he divideth our fields.
\v 5 Therefore you shall have none that shall cast the line by lot in the assembly of Jehovah.
