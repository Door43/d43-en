<usfm>
\v 3 Therefore, this is what Yahweh says:
\q1 "I will cause you people to experience disasters,
\q2 and you will not be able to escape \f + \ft metonymy \f* from them.
\q1 You will no longer walk around proudly,
\q2 because when that happens, it will be a time of much trouble for you.
\q1
\v 4 At that time, \add your enemies\add* will make fun of you;
\q2 they will ridicule you by singing this sad song:
\q1 'We are completely ruined;
\q2 Yahweh is taking our land\f + \ft Or: fields \f* from us,
\q1 and he will give it to those who will capture us.'~"
\q1
\v 5 So \add when it is the time for the land to be given back to you\add* people who belong to Yahweh,
\q2 there will be no one \f + \ft metonymy \f* who will be able to cast lots\f + \ft Or: throw marked stones \f* to determine which land belongs to whom.

\v 3 Therefore, this is what Yahweh says:
\q1 "I will cause you people of Israel to experience disasters,
\q2 and you will not be able to escape from them.
\q1 You will no longer walk around proudly,
\q2 because when that happens, it will be a time of much trouble for you.
\q1
\v 4 At that time, your enemies will make fun of you rich people;
\q2 they will ridicule you by singing this sad song about you:
\q1 'We Israelites are completely ruined;
\q2 Yahweh is taking our land from us,
\q1 and he will give it to those who capture us.'"
\q1
\v 5 So when it is the time for the land to be given back to you people who belong to Yahweh,
\q2 there will be no one alive among you rich families to receive back any of that land.

\q
\v 3 Therefore Yahweh says this,
\q "Look, I am about to bring disaster against this clan,
\q from which you will not remove your necks.
\q You will not walk arrogantly,
\q for it will be an evil time.
\q
\v 4 In that day men will sing a song about you,
\q and lament with a wailing lamentation.
\q They will sing, 'We Israelites are completely ruined;
\q Yahweh changes the territory of my people.
\q How can he remove it from me?
\q He portions out our fields to traitors!'"
\q
\v 5 Therefore, you rich people will have no descendants to divide up the territory by lot
\q in the assembly of Yahweh.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Look** - "Listen carefully" or "Pay attention"
  * **disaster** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mic:01:11|1:12]].
  * **this clan** - This "clan" refers to the entire community of Israel, whose rich people are oppressing the poor. The sins of the leaders are coming back on the whole nation.
  * **from which you will not remove your necks** - Yahweh speaks of punishing the people as if he were putting a yoke around their necks. AT: "from which you will not be able to escape" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **sing a song about you** - "sing a song to make fun of you"
  * **lament with a wailing lamentation** - "they will cry loudly." They are pretending to mourn, as if those they love have died. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **We Israelites ... to traitors** - This is the song that the enemies will sing to make fun of the Israelites and laugh as the Israelites suffer. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **How can he remove it from me?** - The enemy mocks the surprise the rich leaders of Israel feel because God has taken their land and given it to someone else just as they had taken the land from the poor. This question can be translated as a statement. AT: "How wrong he is to take it from me!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **Therefore, you rich people will have no descendants to divide up the territory by lot in the assembly of Yahweh** - Possible meanings are 1) Micah looks forward to a time after the exile when those who return will divide up the land or 2) he is speaking of a custom of his time when the tribe or clan would divide up their land and give it to individuals.
