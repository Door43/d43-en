===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh presents the imagery of the threshing floor. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:mic:04:11|4:12]])

  * **Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion ... your horn ... your hooves ... You will crush** - All instances of "your" and "you," as well as the commands, refer to the "daughter of Zion" and so are singular and feminine. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion, for I will make your horn to be iron, and I will make your hooves to be bronze** - Yahweh speaks of the people of Zion as if they were strong oxen about to thresh wheat and their enemies were the wheat. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **I will make your horn to be iron, and I will make your hooves to be bronze** - If your reader is not familiar with oxen or iron or bronze, you can remove the metaphor. AT: "for I will make you able to defeat and destroy every enemy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **their unjust wealth** - "the wealth they got by acting unjustly" or "the things they stole from other people"
  * **their possessions** - The abstract noun "possessions" can be translated as a verb. AT: "the things that they own" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
