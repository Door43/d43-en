===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh presents the imagery of the threshing floor. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:mic:04:11|4:12]])

  * **Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion**  - God will use the people of Zion to punish the people of the nations. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **I will make your horn to be iron, and I will make your hooves to be bronze**  - Yahweh is comparing the people of Zion to the strong oxen that would thresh the wheat. This means Yahweh will make the people of Israel strong again so they can defeat the other nations.
