\v 6 "On that day," says Yahweh,
\q "I will assemble the lame
\q and gather the outcast,
\q those whom I have afflicted.
\q
\v 7 I will turn the lame into a remnant,
\q and the ones driven away into a strong nation,
\q and I, Yahweh, will reign over them on Mount Zion,

\q hill of the daughter of Zion,
\q to you it will come—
\q the former rule will come,
\q the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.

Yahweh is describing the “last days” when people learn and obey Yahweh's law.

  * **On that day**  - "In the future"
  * **I will assemble the lame**  - "I will bring together those who are weak"
  * **and gather the outcast**  - "and gather those whom I cause to be forced out"
  * **and the ones driven away into a strong nation**  - AT: "and the ones I drove away I will make into a strong nation" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **watchtower for the flock**  - Yahweh uses this phrase to emphasize that the people of Jerusalem are supposed to guard and care for all the other people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **hill of the daughter of Zion**  - The "daughter" of a city means the people of the city. AT: "hill where the people of Zion live"
