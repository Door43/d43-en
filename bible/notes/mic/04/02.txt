\v 2 Many nations will go and say,
\q "Come, let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh,
\q And to the house of the God of Jacob.
\q He will teach us his ways,
\q And we will walk in his paths."
\q For out of Zion the law will go forth,
\q And the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem.
\q
\v 3 He will judge between many peoples,
\q And will decide concerning numerous nations far away.
\q They will beat their swords into plowshares
\q And their spears into pruning knifes.
\q Nation will not lift up sword against nation,
\q Neither will they learn war any more.
