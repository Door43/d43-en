\v 2 Many nations will go and say,
\q "Come, let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh,
\q to the house of the God of Jacob.
\q He will teach us his ways,
\q and we will walk in his paths."
\q For from Zion the law will go out,
\q and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem.
\q
\v 3 He will judge among many peoples
\q and will decide concerning numerous nations far away.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh, to the house of the God of Jacob** - Both the mountain and the house are references to the temple in Jerusalem. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **He will teach us his ways, and we will walk in his paths** - Here "his ways" and "his paths" refer to what God wants the people to do. Also, "walk" means they will obey what he says.
  * **For from Zion the law will go out, and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem** - Here the words "law" and "word" are speaking of the same thing. The nations of the world will hear God's law in Jerusalem.
  * **plowshares** - A plowshare is a blade that people use to dig into soil so they can plant seeds.
  * **They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks** - Both of these phrases mean that they will turn their weapons of war into tools that they will use to provide food. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **pruning hooks** - A pruning hook is used to cut off branches or stems from a plant to make it produce better.
