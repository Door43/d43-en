\v 2 Many nations will go and say,
\q "Come, let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh,
\q to the house of the God of Jacob.
\q He will teach us his ways,
\q and we will walk in his paths."
\q For from Zion the law will go out,

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh, to the house of the God of Jacob**  - Both the mountain and the house are references to the temple in Jerusalem. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet|Doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Explicit and Implicit]])
  * **He will teach us his ways, and we will walk in his paths**  - Here "his ways" and "his paths" refer to what God wants the people to do. Also, "walk" means they will obey what he says.
  * **For from Zion the Law will go out, and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem**  - Here the words "Law" and "word" are speaking of the same thing. The nations of the world will hear God's Law in Jerusalem.
  * **plowshares**  - A plowshare is a blade that people use to dig into soil so they can plant seeds.
  * **They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning knives.**  -****  The two parts of this sentence mean the same thing: weapons for war will be changed to tools to provide food. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]])
