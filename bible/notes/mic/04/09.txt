\v 9 Now, why do you cry out aloud?
\q Is there no king in you,
\q is your counselor perished,
\q that pangs have taken hold of you like a woman in labor?
\q
\v 10 Be in pain
\q and labor to give birth,
\q daughter of Zion,
\q like a woman in labor.
\q For now you will you go out of the city,
\q live in the field,
\q and go to Babylon.
\q There you will be rescued.
\q There Yahweh will rescue you
\q from the hand of your enemies.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Now, why do you cry out aloud? **- Micah is mocking the people, trying to make them think about why God is dealing with them in this way. AT: “Now, you cry out.”(See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]]and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
  * **Is there no king in you, is your counselor perished, that pangs have taken hold of you like a woman in labor?**  - Micah continues to address the people in a mocking tone. The answer to these questions is no. The king and counselors are still there, but they are as useless and helpless. AT: "So why are you wailing now? Is it because you have no king? Have all your wise people died? You are weeping loudly like a woman who is giving birth to a baby." (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
  * **Be in pain and labor to give birth, daughter of Zion, like a woman in labor**  - Micah uses the image of a woman in labor to emphasize the agony of exile. He means that they //should//  be in pain because God is punishing them by sending them away from Israel. Many of them will never come home again.
  * **There you will be rescued. There Yahweh will rescue you**  - AT: "There Yahweh will rescue you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
