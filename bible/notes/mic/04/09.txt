\v 9 Now, why do you cry out aloud?
\q Is there no king in you,
\q is your counsellor perished,
\q that pangs have taken hold of you like a woman in labor?
\q
\v 10 Be in pain
\q and labor to give birth,
\q daughter of Zion,
\q like a woman in labor.
\q For now you will you go out of the city,
\q live in the field,
\q and go to Babylon.
\q There you will be rescued
\q There Yahweh will rescue you
\q from the hand of your enemies.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Why do you cry out aloud?**  - God is emphasizing that there are consequences to ones actions. (see:[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **Is there no king in you, is your counsellor perished, that pangs have taken hold of you like a woman in labor?**  - This question is again used to emphasize that Judah is having to live with the choices that it makes. (see:[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **Be in pain, and labor to give birth, daughter of Zion, like a woman in labor**  - The labor metaphor is appropriately used. For Judah's deeds were often sexual in nature, so likely the consequence would bring for a child.  (see:[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
    * **For now you will go out of the city, live in the field, and go to Babylon** - Here is what Judah birth pains shall look like. Much like labor many die, so to will many die in the journey to Babylon.
