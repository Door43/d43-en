\v 9 Now, why do you cry out aloud?
\q Is there no king in you,
\q Is your counsellor perished,
\q That pangs have taken hold of you as a woman in travail?
\q
\v 10 Be in pain
\q And labor to bring forth,
\q O daughter of Zion,
\q Like a woman in travail.
\q For now you will you go out of the city,
\q Dwell in the field,
\q And come to Babylon.
\q There you will be rescued,
\q There Yahweh will redeem you
\q From the hand of your enemies.
