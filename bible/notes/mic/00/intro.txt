=== What is the Book of Micah about? ===

The Book of Micah is a collection of many prophetic pronouncements. Micah repeated many of the great prophetic themes in the Book of Isaiah. Micah warned of the impending attacks of Assyria and the coming fall of both the southern and northern kingdoms. Micah condemned injustice and immorality, and he denounced the false prophets who were lying to Israel and Judah by telling them that they were safe and that Yahweh would protect them.
 
Micah pleaded with the people to live righteous and holy lives because Yahweh was their God. Their sins were evidence that they were not worshiping and serving Yahweh. 

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may decide to translate this traditional title "The book of Micah" in a way that is more clear to the readers. They may decide to call it, "The sayings of Micah." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]).

=== Who wrote the Book of Micah? ===

The messages in this book came from God to Micah, who lived at the same time as Isaiah and Hosea (in the mid to late 8th century BC) during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. It may have been Micah himself who combined combined the prophecies into one book.


===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== Who is the deliverer whom Micah mentions? ===

Micah frequently mentions a king who will deliver the people. While he does not directly call this king the [[:en:obe:kt:christ|messiah]], it becomes clear that this person is the Messiah, the descendant of David, who will rule forever.

=== Were the Israelites required to offer sacrifices or live holy lives to please Yahweh? ===

While much of the Old Testament focuses on offering sacrifices according to the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|law of moses]], Micah explains to the people that Yahweh is only pleased when the people offer these sacrifices in [[:en:obe:kt:faith|faith]]. Without faith sacrifices become empty religious practices. True faith will result in the people living [[:en:obe:kt:justice|just]] lives. 

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== What does a translator need to know before translating Micah? ===

Micah does not frequently explain the historical context of his [[:en:obe:kt:prophet|prophecies]]. This may result in translators failing to understand this implicit information unless they have a good understanding of the time of Micah's work. 

=== How should one translate passages where the speaker or addressee is not mentioned explicitly? ===
 
Micah often fails to mention who is speaking or who is being addressed. The context of the quote will often help the reader to understand who is speaking or being addressed. It is acceptable to make this information explicit so the reader can more easily understand. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
