===== Translation Notes: =====

These verses continue describing the ruler from Bethlehem.

  * **He will stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of Yahweh**  - AT: "He will lead his people in the strength of Yahweh." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **in the majesty of the name of Yahweh his God**  - AT: "in the powerful authority of Yahweh his God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
  * **They will remain**  - Here "they" refers to the people of Israel. The word "Israel" or "Jerusalem" is implied. AT: "The people will remain in Israel" or "The people will remain in Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis|Ellipsis]])
  * **for then he will be great to the ends of the earth**  - This means that in the future all people from every nation will give honor to Israel's ruler.
  * **He will be our peace**  - Here "our" refers to Micah and the people of Israel. AT: "He will be a man of peace" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive|Inclusive]])
  * **seven shepherds and eight leaders over men**  - Here "shepherds" mean "rulers." Also, you might want to add a footnote that says, "The numbers 'seven' and 'eight' combined mean that there will be more than enough leaders to meet the need."
