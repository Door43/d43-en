===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **It will happen in that day**  - This refers to an indefinite time in the future, probably during the exile.
  * **I will destroy your horses among you and will demolish your chariots**  - The people of Israel used horses and chariots in only in battle. It also may have involved alliances with foreign, godless countries. God did not want the people to trust in their weapons of war to protect them more than they trusted in him.
