====== Micah 05 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Messiah ==
This chapter contains a prophecy explaining that the messiah was to be born in Bethlehem. This meaning is made clear in the New Testament. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:mic:05:02|5:2]], [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:obe:kt:christ]]) 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Change in Personal Pronouns ==
Extra care must be taken in translating pronouns in this chapter. Sometimes "I" is a reference to the author and other times it is a reference to Yahweh. There is also a noticable shift where the author stops speaking about the people as "you" and begins speaking about them as "we" or "us."
