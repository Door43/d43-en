\v 6 They will shepherd the land of Assyria with the sword,
\q and the land of Nimrod in its entrances.
\f + \ft The Hebrew text has \fqa in its entrances \fqa* , that is, at its gates. However, some modern versions suppose that a different Hebrew word was intended: \fqa with a drawn sword \fqa* . \f* 
\q He will rescue us from the Assyrians,
\q when they come into our land,
\q when they march inside our borders.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **They will shepherd the land of Assyria** - Here defeating the Assyrians is spoken of as if it were herding sheep. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **land of Nimrod** - This is another name for the land of Assyria. Nimrod was a hunter and early leader. Translators may add this footnote: "The name 'Nimrod' means 'rebellion.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **in their entrances** - This expression can be understood as "in their gates." City gates were the places where leaders often made important decisions.
  * **He will rescue** - "The ruler will rescue"
  * **like dew from Yahweh, like showers on the grass** - This emphasizes that the people of Judah will be a refreshing, a blessing, to the nations. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **that do not wait for a man, and they do not wait for the children of mankind** - AT: "and they will wait for and depend on God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
