===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I will again bring** - Here "I" refers to Yahweh.
  * **Mareshah** - You may want to make a footnote saying, "There is a play-on-words here with the name of this village and the Hebrew word for 'conquerer.'" This term was used in Israel's conquering Canaan; now Israel will be conquered. This village is probably near Micah's home village of Moresheth Gath. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Adullam** - This refers to a royal city of the Philistines. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Shave your head and cut off your hair** - Shaving one's head was a sign of mourning for the Israelites.
