===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Lachish**  - There is wordplay here as Lachish sounds like "to the chariots" in Hebrew. The people are hitching their chariots to flee, not fight. Lachish was second to Jerusalem in importance in Judah. (see: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])
  * **the daughter of Zion**  - The ”daughter” of a city means the people of the city. Alternate translations: “the people of Zion” or ”the people who live in Zion.”
  * **for the transgressions of Israel were found in you**  - AT: "for you disobeyed like the people of Israel did" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **Moresheth Gath**  - You may want to add a footnote saying “The name ‘Moresheth’ means ‘to depart’ and is similar in sound to the word for ‘fiancee.’" It is like Moresheth is the bride that Assyria takes and the "parting gifts" are the dowry. Moresheth Gath was Micah's home village.
  * **Achzib**  - You may want to add a footnote saying "The name of this town sounds almost the same as the Hebrew expression for 'deceitful thing.'"
