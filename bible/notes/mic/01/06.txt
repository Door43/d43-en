\v 6 I will make Samaria a heap in the field,
\q As places for planting vineyards.
\q I will pull down her stones to the valley,
\q I will uncover her foundations.
\q
\v 7 All her carved figures I will crush in pieces,
\q And all her wages I will burn with fire.
\q All her idols I will make a waste.
\q For from the wages of a prostitute she gathered them,
\q And to the wages of a prostitute they will return.
