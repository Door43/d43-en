===== translationNotes: =====


  * **because of the sins of the house of Israel** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the people of Israel. AT: "because the people of Israel have sinned against me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **All this is** - "The Lord will come and judge"
  * **What is Jacob's transgression?** - The name "Jacob" is a metonym for those of his descendants who live in the northern kingdom of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Is it not Samaria?** - Here "Samaria" is a metonym for the evil activities that take place there. Micah uses a question to emphasize that the people know what the truth is.
