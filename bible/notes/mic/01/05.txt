===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **All this is because of the rebellion of Jacob, and because of the sins of the house of Israel** - These phrases mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **All this is** - "The Lord will come and judge"
  * **What was the reason for Jacob's rebellion? Was it not Samaria?** - Here "Jacob" refers to the northern kingdom of Israel. Micah uses questions to emphasize that the people of Samaria are the reason God will come to judge the kingdom of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **What was the reason for Judah's shrines? Was it not Jerusalem?** - Micah uses questions to emphasize that the people of Jerusalem are the reason God is coming to judge the kingdom of Judah.
