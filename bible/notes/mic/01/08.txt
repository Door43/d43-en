\q2 and screech like an owl,
\q1
\v 9 because Samaria will be completely destroyed \f + \ft metaphor \f*;
\q2 nothing can save that city.
\q1 But the same thing will happen to Judah!
\q2 \add It is as though\add* the enemy army has already reached the city gates of Jerusalem,

\q2 It is as though the enemy army had already reached the city gates of Jerusalem,
\q2 the main city where my people live.
\q1
\v 10 Do not tell that to our enemies in the city of Gath in Philistia!
\q2 Do not cry, or the people there will find out what is happening.
\q1 Instead, just roll on the ground in Beth Leaphrah.

\v 8 For this reason I will lament and wail;
\q I will go barefoot and naked;
\q I will wail like the jackals
\q and mourn like owls.
\q
\v 9 For her wound is incurable,
\q for it has come to Judah.
\q It has reached the gate of my people,
\q to Jerusalem.
\q
\v 10 Do not tell about it in Gath;
\q do not weep at all.
\q At Beth Leaphrah I roll myself in the dust.

  * **General Information:** - Micah 1:8-16 is about God's judgment on Judah.

  * **I will lament** - Here "I" refers to Micah.
  * **I will go barefoot and naked** - This is a sign of extreme mourning and distress.
  * **naked** - Most likely, Micah was not entirely naked. He was probably wearing a loincloth.
  * **I will wail like the jackals and mourn like owls** - These are animals that are known for their loud and harsh cries. And they are found in wastelands. AT: "You shall wail and mourn like the animals of the night" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **For her wound is incurable** - Here "her" refers to the city of Samaria. This means nothing can stop the enemy army that is coming to destroy the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **for it has come to Judah** - Here "it" refers to the "wound," that is, to the army that God will use to punish Samaria.
