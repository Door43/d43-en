\v 8 For this reason I will lament and wail;
\q I will go barefoot and naked;
\q I will wail like the jackals
\q and mourn like owls.
\q
\v 9 For her wounds are incurable,
\q for they have come to Judah.
\q They have reached the gate of my people,
\q to Jerusalem.
\q
\v 10 Do not tell about it in Gath;
\q do not weep  at all.
\q At Beth Leaphrah I roll myself in the dust.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Micah 1:8-16 is about God's judgment on Judah.

  * **I will lament**  - Here "I" refers to Micah.
  * **I will go barefoot and naked**  - This is a sign of extreme mourning and distress.
  * **naked**  - Most likely, Micah was not entirely naked. He was probably wearing a loincloth.
  * **I will wail like the jackals and mourn like owls**  - These are animals that are known for their loud and harsh cries. And they are found in wastelands. AT: "You shall wail and mourn like the animals of the night" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
  * **For her wounds are incurable**  - Here "her" refers to the city of Samaria. This means nothing can stop the enemy army that is coming to destroy the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **for they have come to Judah**  - Here "they" refers to the army that God used to punish Samaria.
  * **Beth Leaphrah**  - You may want to make a footnote saying, " The name of this city means 'house of dust.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])
  * **I roll myself in the dust **  - People under God's judgment are expressing their grief in a strong way.
