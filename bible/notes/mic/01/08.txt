\q2 and screech like an owl,
\q1
\v 9 because Samaria will be completely destroyed \f + \ft metaphor \f*;
\q2 nothing can save that city.

\v 8 For this reason I will lament and wail;
\q I will go barefoot and naked;
\q I will wail like the jackals
\q and mourn like owls.
\q
\v 9 For her wounds are incurable,
\q for they have come to Judah.
\q They have reached the gate of my people,
\q to Jerusalem.
\q
\v 10 Do not tell about it in Gath;
\q do not weep  at all.
\q At  Beth-le-aphrah I roll myself in the dust.
