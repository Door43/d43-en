====== Micah 01 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Micah is written mainly in a poetic form. Most of the prophets wrote to either the Northern Kingdom or the Southern Kingdom. Micah wrote to both of them at times without clear distinction, as he did in this chapter.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== City Names ==

This passage sounds unusual in English because of its construction in Hebrew. It contains several "puns" or "plays on words." The names of the cities are used to describe their destruction. "Lachish will be lashed" is an example of this type of construction. This poetic element might metaphors describing the actual way they will be punished. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
