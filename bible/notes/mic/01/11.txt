  * **in nakedness and shame**  - Enemy armies often made their prisoners walk totally naked. And there was shame in being a conquered people.(See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Explicit and Implicit]])
  * **Zaanan**  - The name of this city means "go out." They are too afraid to go out and help.
  * **Beth Ezel**  - The name of this city means "house of taking away."
  * **for their protection is taken away**  - AT: "for I have taken away everything that might protect them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
