===== Translation Notes: =====

For the meanings of the names of villages and towns, you may want to include that information in a footnote.

  * **Shaphir** - The name of this city sounds like one meaning "beautiful." It contrasts with "nakedness and shame." (See:[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **in nakedness and shame** - Enemy armies often made their prisoners walk totally naked. And there was shame in being a conquered people.(See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Zaanan** - The name of this city means "go out." They are too afraid to go out and help.
  * **Beth Ezel** - The name of this city means "house of taking away."
  * **for their protection is taken away** - AT: "for I have taken away everything that might protect them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Maroth** - The name of this city means "bitterness."
  * **because disaster has come down from Yahweh** - "Disaster" is an important word in Micah that will reoccur.
