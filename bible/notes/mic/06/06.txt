\q
\v 6 What should I bring to Yahweh,
\q as I bow down to the high God?
\q Should I come to him with burnt offerings,
\q with calves a year old?
\q
\v 7 Will Yahweh be pleased with thousands of rams,
\q or with ten thousand rivers of oil?
\q Should I give my firstborn for my transgression,
\q the fruit of my body for my own sin?
\q
\v 8 He has told you, man,
\q what is good,
\q and what Yahweh requires from you:
\q Act justly,
\q love kindness,
\q and walk humbly with your God.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **What should I bring to Yahweh ... God? Should I come ... old? Will Yahweh be pleased ... oil? Should I give ... sin?** - Micah speaks as if he were a person who truly wanted to know what God expects him to do. Possible meanings are 1) he asks questions and then in verse 8 answers the questions he has asked or 2) he is using questions to teach the people. AT: "I know that I do no need to bring to Yahweh ... God, or come ... old, and that Yahweh will not be pleased ... oil or if I give ... sin." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **thousands of rams ... ten thousand rivers of oil** - "rams in groups of 1,000 ... 10,000 rivers of oil" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **He has told you** - "Yahweh has told you"
  * **good, and what Yahweh requires from you: Act ... God** - Many versions read, "good. And what does Yahweh require from you? He wants you to act ... God." or "good. And what does Yahweh require from you but to act ... God?"
  * **love kindness** - The abstract noun "kindness" can be translated using the adjective "kind." AT: "love being kind to people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
