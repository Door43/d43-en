\q
\v 9 The voice of Yahweh is making a proclamation to the city—
\q even now wisdom acknowledges your name:
\q "Pay attention to the rod,
\q and to the one who has put it in place.
\f + \ft Instead of the Hebrew text's reading of \fqa Pay attention to the rod and to the one who has put it into place \fqa* , some modern versions have \fqa Listen, tribe, and those assembled together in the city \fqa* . \f*
\q
\v 10 There is wealth in the houses of the wicked that is dishonest,
\q and false measures that are abominable.
