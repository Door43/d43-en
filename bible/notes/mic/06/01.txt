\q2 And allow the hills and mountains to hear what you will say.
\q1
\v 2 But then you mountains must also listen carefully \f + \ft doublet \f* to what I, Yahweh, am complaining \add about my people\add*.
\q2 I have something to say about what \f + \ft doublet \f* my Israelite people are doing that displeases me.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Arise and state your case...he will fight in court against Israel** - In 6:1-5 Micah uses courtroom imagery. Yahweh speaks before the witnesses to determine why the people of Israel have abandoned God and started worshiping idols.
    * **the mountains...the hills...enduring foundations of the earth** - Micah is speaking to these things as if they are humans. Micah is using the mountains, hills, and foundations of the earth as an eternal witness against his people's idolatry. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
