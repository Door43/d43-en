===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues Yahweh's lawsuit against the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:mic:06:01|6:1-2]])

  * **My people, what have I done to you? How have I wearied you? Testify against me!**  - God uses questions to emphasize that he is a good God, and he has done nothing to cause the people to stop worshiping him. AT: "My people, I have been good to you. I have done nothing to make you tired of me. If you think I have, testify against me, now." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **house of bondage**  - AT: "the place where you were slaves"
  * **call to mind**  - "remember"
  * **Balak king of Moab devised, and what Balaam son of Beor answered him**  - This refers to an event in the past when King Balak hired Balaam to curse the people of Israel. However, God allowed Balaam to only bless the people.
  * **Beor**  - This is the name of Balaam's father. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])
  * **Shittim**  - This is the name of a place in Moab.
  * **that you may know the righteous acts of me, Yahweh**  - "so that you may remember who I am, and what I have done for you"
