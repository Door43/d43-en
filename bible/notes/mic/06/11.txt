===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Should I consider a person to be innocent if he uses fraudulent scales, with a bag of deceptive weights**  - Yahweh uses a question to emphasize that he considers guilty the person who deceives others in order to make more money. AT: "I certainly will consider a person guilty if he uses unfair scales and weights in order to cheat others and makes more money for himself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **The rich men are full of violence**  - "The rich men take advantage of the poor"
  * **the inhabitants have spoken lies, and their tongue in their mouth is deceitful**  - Both of these clauses mean the same thing and are combined for emphasis. AT: "all of you are liars" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]]) This should make an emotional impact on readers.
