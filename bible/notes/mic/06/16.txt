\q2 and \add you do the terrible things that wicked King\add* Ahab and his descendants commanded.
\q1 So, I will destroy your country,
\q2 and I will cause your people to be despised;
\q2 people of other nations will insult you.'~"

\v 16 Those things will happen to you because you obey only the wicked laws of King Omri,
\q2 and you do the terrible things that King Ahab and his descendants commanded.
\q1 So I will destroy your country,
\q2 and I will cause the other people groups to despise you, my own people."

<usfm>
\q
\v 16 The regulations made by Omri have been kept,
\q and all the deeds of the house of Ahab.
\q You walk by their advice.
\q So I will make you, city, a ruin,
\q and you inhabitants an object of hissing,
\q and you will bear the reproach of my people."
\f + \ft The Hebrew text has \fqa you will bear the reproach of my people \fqa* , but an ancient Greek version has \fqa you will bear the scorn of the nations \fqa* . Some modern versions follow this reading. \f*

AT: "You have done what Omri commanded, and you have done the same things the house of Ahab did" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
