===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.
  * **The statutes of Omri have been kept** - AT: "You have done what Omri commanded" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Omri...Ahab** - Both of these men were kings over the northern kingdom of Israel. God considered both of them to be very wicked. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **You walk by their advice** - AT: "you have done the evil things that Omri and Ahab told the people to do"
  * **and you will bear the scorn of my people** - AT: "and my people will be ashamed of you." Possible meaning are 1) the Israelites who obey God will be ashamed of the rich people who are wicked, or 2) the people of other nations will mock and be disrespectful to the Israelites when the enemy army defeats them.
