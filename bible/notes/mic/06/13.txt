<usfm>
\v 13 Therefore I also have struck you with a grievous wound; I have made you desolate because of your sins.
\v 14 You shall eat, but not be satisfied; and your humiliation shall be in the midst of thee: and you shall put away, but
shall not save; and that which you save will I give up to the sword.
\v 15 You shall sow, but shall not reap; you shall tread the olives, but shall not anoint you with oil; and the vintage, but
shall not drink the wine.
