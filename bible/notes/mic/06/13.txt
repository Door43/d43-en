\q
\v 13 Therefore I have struck you with a severe wound,
\q I have made you a ruin because of your sins.
\q
\v 14 You will eat but not be satisfied;
\q your emptiness will remain inside you.
\q You will store goods away but not save,
\q and what you do save I will give to the sword.
\q
\v 15 You will sow but not reap;
\q you will tread the olives but not anoint yourselves with oil;
\q you will press grapes but drink no wine.
