====== Micah 03 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===
== Justice ==
An unjust society was considered sinful. It was considered to be against the law of Moses. If these kingdoms did not have justice, they were not obedient to Yahweh. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:unjust]], [[:en:obe:kt:sin]], [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses]] and [[:en:obe:kt:justice]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphors ==
There are vivid pictures used in this chapter which show how the leaders of the people were treating the Israelites. These situations are absurd unless taken as a metaphor. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
