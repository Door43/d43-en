\v 1 And I said, "Listen, please,
\qYou leaders of Jacob,
\qAnd rulers of the house of Israel.
\qIs it not for you to know justice?
\q
\v 2 You who hate good
\qAnd love evil,
\qWho tear off their skin,
\qAnd flesh from their bones.
\q
\v 3 Who also eat the flesh of my people,
\qPeal their skin off,
\qBreak their bones,
\qAnd chop them in pieces,
\qAs for the pot,
\qAs flesh in the caldron.
