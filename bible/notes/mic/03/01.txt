\v 1 I said, "Now listen,
\q you leaders of Jacob
\q and rulers of the house of Israel:
\q Is it not right for you to understand justice?
\q
\v 2 You who hate good
\q and love evil,
\q you who tear off their skin,
\q their flesh from their bones—
\q
\v 3 you who also eat the flesh of my people,
\q and tear their skin off,
\q break their bones,
\q and chop them in pieces,
\q just like meat for a pot,
\q just like meat in a cauldron.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Chapter 3 focuses on the corrupt leaders in Israel.

  * **I said**  - Here "I" refers to Micah.
  * **Is it not right for you to understand justice?**- Micah uses a question to scold the leaders because they were not protecting the people or treating them fairly. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **You who tear off their skin, their flesh from their bones—you who also eat the flesh of my people, and tear their skin off, break their bones, and chop them in pieces, just like meat for a pot, just like meat in a cauldron.**  - Micah uses this terrible imagery to emphasize how upset God is with the leaders because of how cruel they are to those they should be protecting. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
