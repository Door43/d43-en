\p
\v 9 Hear this, I pray you, you heads of the house of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel, that abhor justice, and pervert
all equity.
\v 10 They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.
\v 11 The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money:
yet they lean upon Jehovah, and say, Is not Jehovah in the midst of us? no evil shall come upon us.
