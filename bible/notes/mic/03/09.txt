\v 9 Now listen to this,
\q You leaders of the house of Jacob,
\q And rulers of the house of Israel,
\q Who detest justice,
\q And pervert everything right.
\q
\v 10 They build Zion with blood,
\q And Jerusalem with iniquity.
\q
\v 11 Her leaders judge for a bribe,
\q Her priests teach for a price,
\q And her prophets do divination for money.
\q Yet they rely upon Yahweh, and say,
\q "Is not Yahweh with us?
\q No evil will come on us."
