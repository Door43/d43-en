===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **But as for Me**  - The "me" here refers to Micah, a true prophet, setting himself apart from the false prophets.
  * **I am full of power by the Spirit of Yahweh, and am full of justice and might**  - The Spirit of Yahweh has chosen to give Micah power, justice, and might in a strong, special way. AT: "the Spirit of Yahweh has filled me with power, justice, and might" or  "the Spirit of Yahweh has granted me power, justice, and might"
  * **to declare to Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin**  - Both of these phrases mean the same thing and are combined for emphasis. The true prophet denounces sin. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]])
