\v 5 Yahweh says this about the prophets
\q who make my people wander:
\q "For those who feed them
\q they announce, 'There will be prosperity.'
\q But for those who put nothing in their mouths,
\q they announce war against him.
\q
\v 6 Therefore, it will be night for you with no vision for you;
\q it will be dark so that you will do no divination.
\q The sun will go down on the prophets,
\q and the day will be dark on them.
\q
\v 7 The seers will be put to shame,
\q and the diviners will be confused.
\q All of them will cover their lips,
\q for there is no answer from me."
