\v 5 Yahweh says this about the prophets
\q who make my people wander:
\q "For those who feed them
\q they announce, 'There will be prosperity.'
\q But for those who put nothing in their mouths,
\q they announce war against him.
\q
\v 6 Therefore, it will be night for you with no vision for you;
\q it will be dark so that you will do no divination.
\q The sun will go down on the prophets,
\q and the day will be dark on them.
\q
\v 7 The seers will be put to shame,
\q and the diviners will be confused.
\q All of them will cover their lips,
\q for there is no answer from me."

===== Translation Notes: =====

Micah continues to speak judgment against false prophets.

  * **it will be night for you…the day will be dark on them**  - Yahweh is saying in 3:6 these false prophets will no longer receive God's message to the people of Israel. Prophets sometimes got messages from God through visions, or dreams at night. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **The seers will be put to shame, and the diviners will be confused**  - AT: "I will cause the seers to be ashamed, and I will confuse the diviners" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **All of them will cover their lips**  - AT: "They shall no longer speak" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
  * **for there is no answer from me**  - This means God will be silent as part of their punishment.
