\q
\v 5 Yahweh says this,
\q "As for the prophets who lead my people astray,
\q if one gives them something to eat,
\q they proclaim, 'Peace.'
\q But if he puts nothing in their mouths,
\q they dedicate themselves to wage war on him.
\q
\v 6 Therefore, it will be night for you with no vision for you;
\q it will be dark so that you will do no divination.
\q The sun will go down on the prophets,
\q and the day will be dark on them.
\q
\v 7 The seers will be put to shame,
\q and the diviners will be confused.
\q All of them will cover their lips,
\q for there is no answer from me."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Micah continues to speak judgment against false prophets.

  * **who lead my people astray** - Walking on a good path is a metaphor for obeying God. Going astray from the path is a metaphor for disobeying God, in this case perhaps without knowing it. AT: "who lead my people to disobey me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **if one gives them something to eat, they proclaim, 'Peace.'** - Micah is using a metaphor to describe a situation that actually happens. The phrase "something to eat" is an ironic way of speaking of a small payment. AT: "they tell people who pay them even a small amount that things will go well for those people." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **if he puts nothing in their mouths, they dedicate themselves to wage war on him** - Micah is using a metaphor to describe a situation that actually happens. The phrase "puts nothing in their mouths" is an ironic exaggeration for not giving what they want. AT: "they do all they can to destroy people who pay them too little" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **it will be night for you ... the day will be dark on them** - Darkness is a metaphor for Yahweh not speaking to the prophets. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **no vision for you** - "you will no longer see visions"
  * **The seers will be put to shame, and the diviners will be confused** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "I will cause the seers to be ashamed, and I will confuse the diviners" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **All of them will cover their lips** - Here "lips" represents speaking. AT: "They shall no longer speak" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **there is no answer from me** - "I will be silent"
