===== translationNotes: =====

  * **You will** - Here "you" refers to Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **on us** - Here "us" refers to Micah and the people, but not to Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **you will trample our iniquities under your feet. You will throw all our sins into the depths of the sea** - Iniquity and sin are spoken of as if they were solid objects. AT: "You will treat our iniquities and sins as if they were not important" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **give truth to Jacob and covenant faithfulness to Abraham** - Here the names of Jacob and Abraham are metonyms for their descendants, the people of Israel to whom Micah was speaking. AT: "give truth to Jacob and covenant faithfulness to Abraham" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **give truth ... and covenant faithfulness** - Micah speaks of truth and covenant faithfulness as if they were solid objects. Giving here is an idiom for showing. You may need to supply the words omitted by the ellipsis. AT: "show yourself to be true ... and show that you are faithful to the covenant" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
