===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Because I sinned**  - Micah is not only referring to himself. He means all the people of Israel have sinned. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
  * **until he pleads my cause, and executes judgment for me**  - This refers to when God decides he has punished his people enough. Then he will punish the people of the other nations who harmed the people of Israel.
  * **He will bring me to the light**  - AT: "He will come and save us from our enemies. It will be like bringing a person in the dark into the light" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
