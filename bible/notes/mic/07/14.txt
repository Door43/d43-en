\v 14 Shepherd your people with your rod,
\q the flock of your inheritance.
\q They live alone in a forest, 
\q in the midst of a plantation.
\q Let them graze in Bashan and Gilead
\q like in the old days.
\q
\v 15 As in the days when you came out of the land of Egypt,
\q I will show them wonders.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Shepherd your people with your rod, the flock of your inheritance** - Micah is praying to Yahweh, asking him to protect his people of Israel again. Here "rod" refers to God's leadership and guidance, as a shepherd uses a stick to guide and protect his sheep. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **They live alone in a forest** - Micah means that some of the people are living where the ground is poor and they are isolated and cannot easily obtain needed goods.
  * **Let them graze in Bashan and Gilead** - These regions are known as rich land for growing food. So Micah is asking for further extension of the territory, one that had been lost by invaders years before.
  * **like in the old days** - This may refer to when Solomon was king.
  * **I will show** - Here "I" refers to Yahweh.
