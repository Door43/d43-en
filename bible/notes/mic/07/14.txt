===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Shepherd your people with your rod, the flock of your inheritance**  - Micah is praying to Yahweh, asking him to protect his people of Israel again. Here "rod" refers to God's leadership and guidance, as a shepherd uses a stick to guide and protect his sheep. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **Even though they are living alone**  - Micah means that some of the people are living where the ground is poor and they are isolated and cannot easily obtain needed goods.
  * **in a forest by Mount Carmel let them feed in Bashan and Gilead**  - These regions are known as rich land for growing food. So Micah is asking for further extension of the territory, one that had been lost by invaders years before.
  * **as in ancient days**  - This may refer to when Solomon was king.
  * **I will show**  - Here "I" refers to Yahweh.
