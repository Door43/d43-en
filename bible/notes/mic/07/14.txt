===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Shepherd your people with your rod** - This seems to be a prayer which Micah used, requesting God to take his people again under his protection. The "rod" here is being used as a metaphor for leadership and guidance. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **Even though they are living alone in a forest by Mount Carmel, let them feed in Bashan and Gilead as in ancient days** - These Regions are known as a rich land for growing food. So Micah is asking for further blessings for God's people.
