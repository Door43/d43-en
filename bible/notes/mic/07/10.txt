\v 10 Our enemies will also see that, and they will be disgraced
\q2 because they \add ridiculed us\add*, saying
\q1 "Why is \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* Yahweh, that God of yours, \add not helping you\add*?"
\q2 But with our own eyes we will see them when they are defeated;
\q2 we will see them trampled
\q2 like \f + \ft simile \f* mud in the streets.
