\q
\v 1 Woe is me!
\q For me it is like when the harvest of summer fruit is over,
\q and also even the gleaning of the left-over grapes in the vineyards:
\q There are no more clusters of fruit to be found,
\q but I still crave first ripe figs.
\q
\v 2 The godly man has perished from the earth;
\q there is no one left who is upright among the people.
\q They all lie in wait to shed others' blood;
\q everyone and his brother hunt someone with a net.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **For me it is like when the harvest of summer fruit … first ripe figs**  - Micah emphasizes that there are no longer any honest people, loyal to God, in Israel. AT: "For me the people of Israel are like a vineyard after the harvest and gleaning. The vines are bare. I can no longer find any fruit, but I still crave to eat a ripe fig. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **The godly man has perished … with a net **- Micah exaggerates to show how bad the situation is. He feels there is no one good left in Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole|Hyperbole]])
