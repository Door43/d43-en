\q
\v 1 Woe is me!
\q For I am like those who gather summer fruit,
\q Like the grape gleanings of the vineyard.
\q There is no cluster to eat,
\q My soul desires the first ripe fig.
\q
\v 2 The godly man perished from the earth,
\q There is none upright among men,
\q They all lie in wait for blood,
\q They hunt, every man his brother, with a net.
