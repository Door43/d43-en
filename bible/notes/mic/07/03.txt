<usfm>
\q
\v 3 Their hands are very good at doing harm:
\q the ruler asks for money,
\q the judge is ready for bribes,
\q and the powerful man is saying to others what he wants to obtain.
\q Thus they plot together.
\q
\v 4 The best of them is like a brier,
\q the most upright is worse than a thorn hedge.
\q It is the day foretold by your watchmen,
\q the day of your punishment.
\q Now is the time of their confusion.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Micah continues speaking about the people of Israel.

  * **Their hands are very good** - The hand is a synecdoche for the person. AT: "The people are very good" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **The best of them is like a brier, the most upright is worse than a thorn hedge** - Briers and thorns are good for nothing and harm those who touch them. The Israelite rulers and judges did nothing good and harmed people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **the most upright** - "those of them who try hardest to do what is good"
  * **It is the day foretold by your watchmen, the day of your punishment** - Micah speaks to the people of Israel, so both instances of "your" are plural. The word "watchmen" is a metaphor for prophets. AT: "Their prophets have told them that Yahweh would punish them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Now is the time of their confusion** - The abstract noun "confusion" can be translated as a verb. AT: "Now it when they do not understand what is happening" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
