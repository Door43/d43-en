<usfm>
\q
\v 3 Their hands are very good at doing harm:
\q the ruler asks for money,
\q the judge is ready for bribes,
\q and the powerful man is saying to others what he wants to obtain.
\q Thus they plot together.
\q
\v 4 The best of them is like briers,
\q the most upright is a hedge of thorns.
\q It is the day foretold by your watchmen,
\q the day of your punishment.
\q Now their confusion has arrived.

  * **The best of them is like briers, the most upright is a hedge of thorns**  - This means that even the best leaders in Israel caused harm and were worthless. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
  * **It is the day foretold by your watchmen, the day of your punishment**  - Here "your" still refers to the people of Israel.
