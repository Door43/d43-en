===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **But as for me** - Here "me" refers to Micah.
  * **Do not rejoice over me** - Micah is not referring only to himself. He means the enemy should not rejoice over what happens to all the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **When I sit in darkness, Yahweh will be a light for me** - Micah refers to the disaster that is coming to the people of Israel as "darkness." He means even though God will let the enemy come destroy them now, he will come and rescue them in the future. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
