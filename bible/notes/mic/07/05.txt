===== Translation Notes: =====

Micah continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **Do not trust any neighbor…people of his own house**  - Micah continues to show that there is no longer anyone good, honest, and loyal to God among God's people. Here he emphasizes that they cannot even trust friends or family.
