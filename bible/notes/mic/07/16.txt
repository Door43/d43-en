===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **They will put their hands on their mouths; their ears will be deaf**  - This shows how dismayed they are, so much so they cannot respond. See the UDB. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom|Idiom]])
  * **They will lick the dust like a snake, like creatures that crawl on the earth. **  - Both phrases mean about the same thing. God's enemies will be completely humiliated and come to him in fear after they see the powerful things he does. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
