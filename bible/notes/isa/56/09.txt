===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **All you wild beasts of the field, come and devour, all you beasts in the forest**  - God is calling armies of other nations to come and attack the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **All their watchmen are blind**  - This means Israel's leaders cannot or perhaps do not want to see what is going on in society.
  * **they are all dumb dogs**  - The leaders are supposed to open their mouths and warn the people, but they do not. Calling someone a dog in this society is a great insult.
  * **dreaming, lying down, loving to sleep**  - This means the leaders are not bringing God's word of warning to Israel.
