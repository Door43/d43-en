===== translationNotes: =====

  * **See, I am a dry tree** - This means eunuchs may have thought they could not be a part of God's people because they were deformed by castration (and for this reason could not have children). Israelites did not practice castration; foreigners did, sometimes for punishment. So eunuchs who had accepted the Hebrew faith knew that normally they were not allowed to worship in the temple (Deut. 23:1) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
