===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Isaiah continues to describe the time when God will save the people of Israel. Although these events will happen in the future ([[:en:bible:notes:isa:09:01|9:1-2]]), Isaiah describes them as if they have already happened. This emphasizes that they certainly will happen. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pastforfuture]])

  * **For the yoke of his burden ... his shoulder ... his oppressor** - Isaiah speaks of the people of Israel as if they were one man. AT: "For the yoke of their burden ... their shoulders ... their oppressor" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the yoke of his burden ... you have shattered** - Isaiah speaks of the Israelites, who are the Assyrians' slaves, as if they were an ox wearing a yoke. This will happen in his future, but he speaks as if it has already happened. AT: "You will set the people of Israel free from being slaves like a person removing a yoke from an ox" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pastforfuture]])
  * **the beam across his shoulder** - The beam is the part of the yoke that goes over the shoulders of the ox.
  * **beam** - Another possible meaning is "staff," a long piece of wood that a person uses to beat the oxen so they will work and a symbol of one person's power to rule other people.
  * **the rod of his oppressor** - Isaiah speaks of the power the oppressor has over the people of Judah as if it were the piece of wood used by a person to beat oxen so they will work. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **as on the day of Midian** - The word "day" is an idiom that can refer to an event that takes more than one day to happen. AT: "as when you defeated the Midianites" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **every boot treading in the tumult and the garments rolled in blood will be burned** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "you will burn the boots of the soldiers and their clothes, which are covered with blood" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **burned, fuel for the fire** - This can be translated as a new sentence. AT: "burned. You will make the boots and the garments fuel for the fire"
