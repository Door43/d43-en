===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Yet the people will not turn to him who struck them, nor will they seek Yahweh of Hosts** - AT: "Still the people of Israel will not return to Yahweh of Hosts who punished them." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])  
  * **Yahweh of Hosts** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:isa:01:09|1:9]].
  * **head and tail, palm branch and reed** - the leaders of Israel. He uses words with opposite meanings to emphasize that Yahweh will remove all of the leaders of Israel. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
