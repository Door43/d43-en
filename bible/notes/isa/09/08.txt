  * **Jacob ... Israel ... Ephraim ... Samaria** - These names all refer to the people of the northern kingdom of Israel.
  * **All the people will know, even Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria** - What they will know can be made explicit. AT: "All the people will know that the Lord has judged them, even those in Ephraim and Samaria" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) 
  * **The bricks have fallen, but we will rebuild with chiseled stone; the sycamores have been cut down, but we will put cedars in their place** - The full meaning can be made explicit.
