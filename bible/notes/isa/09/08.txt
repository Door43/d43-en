===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **against Jacob**  - "against the descendants of Jacob"
  * **and it fell****on Israel**
 - This is a continuation of the punishment. (See: metaphor)
  * **<font 14px line-height: 19px;/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>who say in pride and with an arrogant heart</font> ******- This is saying the same thing in two ways for emphasize (See: doublet)
  * **<font 14px line-height: 19px;/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>but we will rebuild with chiseled stone; the sycamores have been cut down, but we will put cedars in their place</font> **- This seems to imply pride and arrogance that the rebuilding will be with even better material.
