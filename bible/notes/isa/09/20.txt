===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **They will slice meat off the right hand and still be hungry, they will eat of the left hand but will not be satisfied.**  - This is stating the same thing in two ways for emphasis. This can be translated as "Even though they kill their neighbors on the left and right and take their food, they will still be starving." (See: doublet)
  * **but his hand will still be stretched out to strike**  - Yahweh is not yet done with his punishment.
