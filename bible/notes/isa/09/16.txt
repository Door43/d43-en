\v 16 The leaders of the people have misled them;

\q1
\v 17 For that reason, Yahweh is not pleased with the young men \add of Israel\add*,
\q2 and he does not even act mercifully toward the widows and orphans,
\q1 because they are all ungodly and wicked,
\q2 and they all say things that are foolish.
\q1 But Yahweh still is angry with them;
\q2 he is ready to strike them with his fist again.

\q1
\v 16 Those who lead this people lead them astray, and those who are led by them are swallowed up
\q1
\v 17 Therefore the Lord will not rejoice over their young men nor will he have compassion on their fatherless and widows,
\q1
since every one is godless and an evildoer, and every mouth speaks foolish things. 
\q1 Because of all this his anger does not subside, but his
hand will still be raised to strike.
