<usfm> \q1 \v 16 Those who lead this people lead them astray, and those who are led by them are swallowed up \q1 \v 17 Therefore the Lord will not rejoice over their young men nor will he have compassion on their fatherless and widows, \q1 since every one is godless and an evil-doer, and every mouth speaks foolish things. \q1 Because of all this his anger does not subside, but his hand will still be stretched out to strike. </usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **those who are led by them are swallowed up**  - "they have caused the people that they are ruling to be confused." (UDB) The leaders have not made things clearer to the people, but more confusing and hard to understand.
  * **nor will he have compassion on their fatherless and widows **- the fatherless and widows were often the objects of special mercy, but the punishment will extend to even these
  * **Because of all this his anger does not subside -**
  * **but his hand will still be stretched out to strike -**
