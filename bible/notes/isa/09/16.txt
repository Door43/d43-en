====== Isaiah 09:16-17 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 The leaders of the people have misled them;
\q2 they have caused the people that they are ruling to be confused.
\q1
\v 17 For that reason, Yahweh is not pleased with the young men \add of Israel\add*,
\q2 and he does not even act mercifully toward the widows and orphans,
\q1 because they are all ungodly and wicked,
\q2 and they all say things that are foolish.
\q1 But Yahweh still is angry with them;
\q2 he is ready to strike them with his fist again.

\q1
\v 16 Those who lead this people lead them astray, and those who are led by them are swallowed up.
\q1
\v 17 Therefore the Lord will not rejoice over their young men nor will he have compassion on their fatherless and widows,
\q1 since every one is godless and an evildoer, and every mouth speaks foolish things.
\q1 In all these things, his anger does not subside; instead, his hand is still stretched out.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Those who lead this people lead them astray** - The leaders causing people to disobey is spoken of as if the leaders led them on the wrong path. AT: "The leaders of Israel have caused the people to disobey God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **those who are led by them are swallowed up** - This is a metaphor that can be stated in active form. Possible meanings are 1) AT: "those that they lead become confused" or 2) AT: "Yahweh destroys those that they lead" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) 
  * **every mouth speaks foolish things** - The word "mouth" refers to the person. AT: "every person speaks foolish things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **In all these things, his anger does not subside; instead, his hand** - "Even though all these things have happened, he is still angry, and his hand." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:05:25|5:25]].
  * **his hand is still stretched out** - Isaiah speaks as if Yahweh were a person about to hit another person with his fist. This is a metaphor for Yahweh punishing Israel. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:05:25|5:25]]. AT: "he will still be ready to punish them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
