===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Therefore Yahweh will raise up against him Rezin, his adversary** - Here "Rezin" represents his army. AT: "Therefore, Yahweh will bring Rezin and his army against the people of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Rezin** - This is the name of a man. See how you translated Rezin in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:07:01|7:1]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **and will stir up his enemies** - The phrase "stir up" is an idiom that means to incite them to attack. AT: "and Yahweh will cause Israel's enemies to attack" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **They will devour Israel with open mouth** - "Devour" is how wild animals eat their prey. AT: "Like a wild beast eating its prey, the army of the enemy will destroy the people of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **In all these things, his anger does not subside; instead, his hand** - "Even though all these things have happened, he is still angry, and his hand." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:05:25|5:25]].
  * **his hand is still stretched out** - Isaiah speaks as if Yahweh were a person about to hit another person with his fist. This is a metaphor for Yahweh punishing Israel. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:05:25|5:25]]. AT: "he will still be ready to punish them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
