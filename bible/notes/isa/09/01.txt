===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The gloom will be dispelled from her who is in anguish** - The word "her" refers to the nation of Israel, which had split into the northern kingdom, also called Israel, and the southern kingdom called Judah.  As in the previous chapter, Isaiah compares Israel's suffering, resulting from her sin, to a land of darkness. Isaiah describes a future release from that darkness. Alternate translation: "The people of Judah have lived in sin, pain, and intense suffering, but the Lord will save them from this life of darkness." (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:figures:metaphor]] and [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:grammar:active]])   
  * **The gloom** - This word means "partial or total darkness." See how you translated "gloom" in [[en:bible:notes:isa:08:21|08:22]].  
  * **In an earlier time he humiliated the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali** - Zebulun and Naphtali were two of the twelve trives of Israel.  When Isaiah spoke this prophecy, these tribes had already been conquered by Assyrian armies. "In the past, the Lord humbled those living in Zebulun and Naphtali."  (See:[[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:figures:metonymy]])
  * **but in the later time he will make it glorious, the way to the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations** - "But in the future, the Lord will honor the nation of Israel, making the land of Galilee, which is the pathway between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River, the home to many foreigners." 
  * **The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who have lived in the land of the shadow of death, the light has shone on them.** - Here the verb tense shifts from the future to the past tense.  Often in prophecy things that will happen in the future are described as happening in the past.  This emphasizes that these things will certainly happen.  Isaiah again compares Israel's suffering, resulting from her sin, to a land of darkness, shadow, and death.  He compares her future obedience to living in great light and bright sunshine.  Alternate translation: "The people lived in darkness but now have seen a great light; this light has shined on those who lived in the land of shadow and death" (See [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor]]).  These two sentences express the same meaning. (See [[en:ta:translate:parallelism]])
