Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of chapter 26, which is an important quotation. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphors ==
There are many metaphors used to describe Yahweh's punishment as well as the sin of the people of Ephraim. They are described as drunk. Construction and weather metaphors are also used in this chapter. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "That day" ==
This is a common phrase in this section of Isaiah. This chapter appears to prophesy about a time of restoration when the messiah will reign. This chapter pictures a time of great peace and harmony in the world. The translator should not add explanation, but should try to maintain the tense of the original text, as a future or uncompleted action. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:fulfill]] and [[:en:obe:kt:lastday]])
