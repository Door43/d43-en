===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues to speak to the people of Jerusalem.
  * **For the bed is too short for a man to stretch out on, and the blanket too narrow for him to wrap himself in** - Yahweh is emphasizing that trusting in lies will always cause the people to be disappointed. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Yahweh will rise up** - Isaiah is now speaking.
  * **Mount Perazim...Valley of Gibeon** - These refer to times when God miraculously defeated enemy armies.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]) 
  * **his strange work...his strange deed** - This work is strange because God is using a foreign army to defeat the people of Jerusalem. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
