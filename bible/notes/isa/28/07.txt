===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But even these** - "But even the priests and prophets." Isaiah may now be speaking about the prophets and priests in Judah.
  * **reel with wine, and stagger with strong drink** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that the leaders cannot do their job because they are very drunk. AT: "stumble around because they are drunk" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **they are swallowed up by wine** - The priests and prophets drinking so much that they can no longer think properly is spoken of as if the wine swallowed them. This can be stated in active form. AT: "the wine is causing them to be confused" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **staggering in vision and reeling in decision** - Just like they are too drunk to walk correctly, they are too drunk to understand the visions God gives them or to make good decisions.
