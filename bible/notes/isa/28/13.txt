===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **So the word of Yahweh will be to them command upon command, command upon command; rule upon rule, rule upon rule; here a little, there a little** - See how you translated this in verse 10. The people complained that Yahweh repeated the same things over and over, so Yahweh will do just as they have said.
  * **so that they may go and fall backward, and be broken, ensnared, and captured** - "this will cause the people to be attacked, wounded, trapped, and captured"
