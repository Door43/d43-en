<usfm>
\v 27 Farmers never thresh caraway\f + \ft Or: dill \f* with a heavy sledge\f + \ft Or: club \f*;
\q2 instead, they beat it only with a stick.
\q1 Farmers never thresh cumin by driving a cart over it;
\q2 instead, they hit it only with a rod.
\q1
\v 28 And grain for baking bread is crushed easily,
\q2 so the farmers do not continue to pound it for a long time.
\q1 They sometimes cause their horses to pull a cart over it \add to thresh it\add*,
\q2 but doing that does not grind the grain.
