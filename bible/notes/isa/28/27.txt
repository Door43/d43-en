\q2 instead, they hit it only with a rod.
\q1
\v 28 And grain for baking bread is crushed easily,
\q2 so the farmers do not continue to pound it for a long time.
\q1 They sometimes cause their horses to pull a cart over it \add to thresh it\add*,

\v 28 Grain is ground for bread but not too finely,
\q1 and though the wheels of his cart and his horses scatter it, his horses do not crush it.
