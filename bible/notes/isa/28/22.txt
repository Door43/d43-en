===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Now** - This does not mean "at this moment," but is used to draw attention to the important point that follows. 
  * **your bonds will be tightened** - Yahweh punishing the people even more severely is spoken of as if he would tighten their bonds. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh will tighten your bonds" or "Yahweh will punish you even more severely" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Yahweh of hosts** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:01:09|1:9]].
  * **a decree of destruction on the earth** - This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "destruction" is expressed as the verb "destroy." AT: "that he is going to destroy people throughout the land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
