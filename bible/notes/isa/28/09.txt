\v 9 To whom will he teach knowledge, and to whom will he explain the message? 
\q1 To those who are weaned from milk or to 
those just taken from the breasts?
\q1
\v 10 For it is command upon command, command upon command; rule upon rule, rule upon rule; 
\q1 here a little, there a little.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **To whom will he teach knowledge, and to whom will he explain the message?**  - The people were not expecting an answer to this question. The question was used to scorn or ridicule Yahweh. (See: Rhetorical Question)
  * **To those who are weaned from milk or to those just taken from the breasts?**  - This is also a Rhetorical Question intended to ridicule Yahweh. Does Yahweh think that the people are little children who have recently been weaned?
  * **For it is command upon command, command upon command; rule upon rule, rule upon rule; **here a little, there a little ****- The people feel that Yahweh is repeating simple commands as if talking to a child.
