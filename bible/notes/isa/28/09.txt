====== Isaiah 28:9-10 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 They ridicule Yahweh saying, "Who does he think that he is teaching?
\q2 Why is he talking to us like this?
\q1 \add Does he think that\add* we are little children
\q2 who have recently been weaned?
\q1
\v 10 \add He continually tells us\add*, 'Do this, do that;'
\q2 first he tells us one rule, then another rule,
\q2 he tells us only one line at a time."

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 Who will he teach so that they can learn about knowledge?
\q2 Who will listen to him so that he can teach lessons to them so they can learn?
\q1 Does he think that we are like little children who no longer drink milk,
\q2 and that we are like babies who, not long ago, were weaned?
\q1
\v 10 He continually tells us, 'Do this, do that;'
\q2 first he tells us one rule, then another rule,
\q2 he tells us only one line at a time."


\q1

\q1
\v 9 To whom will he teach knowledge, and to whom will he explain the message?
\q1 To those who are weaned from milk or to those just taken from the breasts?
\q1
\v 10 For it is command upon command, command upon command; rule upon rule, rule upon rule;
\q1 here a little, there a little.

  * **To those who are weaned from milk or to those just taken from the breasts?** - The drunk prophets and priests use a question to criticize Isaiah, because they feel that he is treating them like babies.

  * **For it is command upon command, command upon command; rule upon rule, rule upon rule; here a little, there a little** - The drunk prophets and priests criticize Isaiah because they feel that Isaiah is repeating simple commands as if he were talking to a child.
