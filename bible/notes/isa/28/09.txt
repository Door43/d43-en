\v 9 To whom will he teach knowledge, and to whom will he explain the message? 
\q1 To those who are weaned from milk or to 
those just taken from the breasts?

\q1 here a little, there a little.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **To whom will he teach knowledge, and to whom will he explain the message?** - The drunk prophets and priests use a question to criticize Yahweh and the prophets who try to correct them. AT: "The drunk prophets and priests say, 'Isaiah should not be trying to teach us about Yahweh's message!'" (See: [[ en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **To those who are weaned from milk or to those just taken from the breasts?** - They use another question for the same reason. AT: "We are not babies!"
  * **For it is command upon command, command upon command; rule upon rule, rule upon rule; here a little, there a little** - The people feel that Isaiah is repeating simple commands as if talking to a child.
