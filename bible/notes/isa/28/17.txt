<usfm>
\v 17 I will test you people of Jerusalem to find out if you will act justly and righteously,
\q2 I will measure your character like a carpenter uses a plumb line to determine if a wall is straight and level.
\q1 And then the hail will fall! And it will destroy everything you have.
\q2 Your shelter will be destroyed because it is built on a foundation of lies,
\q2 and the water from the storm will wash your shelter away.


\q1

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to compare what he will do for the people in Jerusalem to a builder setting up a building. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:isa:28:16|28:16]])

  * **I will make justice the measuring stick, and righteousness the plumbline** - Yahweh testing according to his justice and righteousness to determine if the people are just and righteous is spoken of as if he were a builder using tools to determine that something is the correct length and perfectly level. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the measuring stick** - A builder uses a measuring stick to determine if something is the correct length. 
  * **the plumbline** - A builder uses a plumbline to determine if something is straight and level. 
  * **Hail will sweep away** - Yahweh causing a large amount of hail to fall is spoken of as if it would be an overwhelming flood. AT: "Hailstorms will destroy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Hail ... the floodwaters** - Possible meanings are 1) these are a synecdoche representing anything in general that will cause destruction or 2) these are a metaphor referring to the enemy army that Yahweh will send to destroy the people of Jerusalem. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Hail** - hard pieces of ice that fall from the sky
  * **the refuge of lies ... the hiding place** - This speaks about "lies" as if they were a place a person could go to hide. They represent what the leaders of Jerusalem trusted in to keep them safe from Yahweh's punishment. Possible meanings are 1) the leaders trust in their own lies that they have said in order to protect themselves or 2) the leaders trust that the covenant they have made with the false gods of the place of the dead will keep them safe or 3) the leaders trust that the agreement they have made with the Egyptians will keep them safe. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:28:14|28:15]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
