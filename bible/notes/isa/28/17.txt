===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to compare what he will do for the people in Jerusalem to a builder setting up a building. (See: [[en:bible:notes:isa:28:16|28:16]])

  * **I will make justice the measuring stick** - A builder uses a measuring stick to determine if something is the correct length. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and righteousness the plumbline** - A builder uses a plumbline to determine if something is straight upright and level. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, and floodwaters will overwhelm the hiding place**  - See how you translated the similar word "hailstorm" in [[en:bible:notes:isa:28:01|28:2]]. AT: "The enemy army will come like a hailstorm and a flood, and they will destroy you and everything you thought would protect you."
