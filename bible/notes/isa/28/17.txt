===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to compare what he will do for the people in Jerusalem to a builder setting up a building. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:isa:28:16|28:16]])

  * **I will make justice the measuring stick, and righteousness the plumbline** - Yahweh testing the people according to his justice and righteousness to determine if they are just and righteous is spoken of as if he were a builder using tools to determine that something is the correct length and perfectly level. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the measuring stick** - A builder uses a measuring stick to determine if something is the correct length. 
  * **the plumbline** - A builder uses a plumbline to determine if something is straight and level. 
  * **Hail will sweep away** - Yahweh sending an enemy army to destroy the people of Jerusalem is spoken of as if he would send so much hail that it would sweep away the people like a flood. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Hail** - hard pieces of ice that fall from the sky
  * **the refuge of lies ... the hiding place** - This speaks about "lies" as if they were a place a person could go to hide. The leaders of Jerusalem thought that they were safe from the Assyrian army since they had allied with the leaders of Egypt. But, Isaiah knew that the Egyptians would not be able to help the people of Jerusalem. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:28:14|28:15]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the floodwaters will overwhelm the hiding place** - Yahweh sending an enemy army to destroy to the people of Jerusalem is spoken of as if a flood will come sweep them away. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
