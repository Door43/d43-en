\q1
\v 14 So listen to the word of Yahweh, you who mock, 
\q1 who rule this people in Jerusalem.
\q1
\v 15 You have said, "We have made a covenant with death;
\q1 with sheol we have reached an agreement. So when the overflowing
judgment passes through, it will not reach us, 
\q1 for we have made a lie our refuge, and in  falsehood we have hidden."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **So listen to the word of Yahweh** - AT: "So listen to Yahweh's message." Isaiah now speaks to the leaders of Jerusalem.
  * **We have made a covenant with death; with Sheol we have reached an agreement** - Isaiah quotes the leaders who believe nothing bad will happen. They describe death and Sheol as a person that makes a covenant with them. AT: "Nothing bad will ever happen to us in Jerusalem. It is like we made a deal with death itself." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **So when the overflowing judgment passes through, it will not reach us** -  AT: "As a result when God judges the people, and the enemy army comes like a flood, it will not harm us." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **for we have made a lie our refuge, and in falsehood we have hidden** -  AT: "for we trust in a lie and it will protect us."
