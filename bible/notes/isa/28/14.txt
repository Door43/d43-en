====== Isaiah 28:14-15 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 Because of \add what will happen in Samaria\add*,
\q2 you rulers in Jerusalem who make fun of me,
\q2 listen to this message from Yahweh:
\q1
\v 15 You boast saying,
\q1 "We have made an alliance with \add the leaders of Egypt\add*,
\q2 so we will not be killed \add in battles\add*;
\q2 we will never go to the place where the dead people are.
\q1 When the \add army of Assyria\add* attacks us, they will never defeat us,
\q2 because we have made \add an agreement with Egypt\add* to protect us!"
\q1 \add But that agreement consists of\add* a lot of lies \f + \ft doublet \f*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 Listen to the word that Yahweh says, 
\q2 you who rule over the people of Jerusalem,
\q2 you who mock and make fun of me!
\q1
\v 15 You boast and say,
\q1 "We made a bargain with death to ensure that the power of death may not touch us,
\q2 and to be sure of our bargain, we also made an agreement with the powers that control the place where the spirits of the dead dwell. 
\q1 When the powerful armies comes to punish us for our sins, 
\q2 they will not touch us, and they will not punish us, 
\q2 because we trust in the lies we have told, and those lies make us safe; 
\q2 and our deceitful words will protect us because we put our trust in them.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\q1
\v 14 So listen to the word of Yahweh, you who mock,
\q1 you who rule over this people who are in Jerusalem.
\q1
\v 15 This will happen because you said, "We have made a covenant with death;
\q1 with Sheol we have reached an agreement. So when the overflowing judgment passes through, it will not reach us,
\q1 for we have made a lie our refuge, and in falsehood we have taken shelter."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **So listen to the word of Yahweh** - Isaiah now speaks to the leaders of Jerusalem. Here "word" represents a message. AT: "So listen to Yahweh's message" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **We have made a covenant ... in falsehood we have hidden** - The leaders of Jerusalem had allied with the leaders of Egypt. So, they were confident that the Egyptians could rescue them from the Assyrian army. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **We have made a covenant with death; with Sheol we have reached an agreement** - Both of these statements mean basically the same thing. Possible meanings are 1) the leaders of Jerusalem used magic or sorcery to try and make an agreement with the gods of the place of the dead so that these gods would protect them from dying or 2) this is a metaphor that speaks of the leaders making an agreement with the leaders of Egypt. The leaders of Jerusalem were so confident that the Egyptians would protect that it was like they made an agreement with the gods of the place of the dead. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **So when the overflowing judgment passes through, it will not reach us** - This speaks of Yahweh's judgment and punishment as if they were a flood. AT: "As a result when God judges the people, and the enemy soldiers comes like a flood, they will not harm us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **for we have made a lie our refuge, and in falsehood we have hidden** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. This speaks of a "lie" and a "falsehood" as if they are places a person can go to hide. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a lie our refuge ... falsehood we have hidden** - The leaders in Jerusalem would not have said they trust in a lie. They believed they were truly safe because of their agreement with the leaders of Egypt. But, Isaiah knows this will not keep them safe. You can state this clearly as in the UDB. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
