====== Isaiah 28:25-26 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 25 No, he makes the ground very level,
\q2 and then he plants seeds—
\q2 dill and cumin and wheat and barley.
\q1 He plants each kind of seed in the correct manner.
\q1
\v 26 He does that because God has taught him the correct way to do it.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 25 No, he makes the ground very level,
\q2 and then he plants seeds—
\q2 dill and cumin and wheat and barley.
\q1 He plants each kind of seed in the correct manner. He does not plant one kind of seed in the way that is not right for it.
\q1
\v 26 He does that because God has taught him the correct way to do it.


\q1

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q1
\v 25 When he has prepared the ground, does he not scatter caraway seed, sow the cumin,
\q1 put in the wheat in rows and the barley in the right place, and the spelt at its edges?
\f + \ft The identification of some of these spices is in doubt, so versions have a variety of translations. In addition, some versions give different interpretations to the expressions translated here as \fqa in rows \fqb and \fqa in the right place \fqb , because these expressions are uncertain in Hebrew. \f*
\q1
\v 26 His God instructs him; he teaches him wisely.
