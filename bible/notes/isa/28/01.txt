====== Isaiah 28:1-2 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Terrible things will happen to \add Samaria city, the capital of Israel\add*!
\q2 It is on a hill above a fertile valley;
\q1 the people who live there, who get drunk by drinking too much wine, are very proud;
\q2 it is a beautiful and glorious city,
\q2 but some day that beauty will disappear like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a flower that wilts and dries up.
\q1
\v 2 Listen to this: Yahweh will cause a great army to attack it.
\q2 Their soldiers will be like \f + \ft simile \f* a huge hailstorm or a very strong wind;
\q1 they will be everywhere, like the water of a huge flood,
\q2 and they will smash to the ground \add the buildings in Samaria\add*.

\q1
\v 1 Woe to the proud garland of the drunkards of Ephraim, and to the fading flower of his glorious beauty,
\q1 that is on the head of the lush valley of those who are overcome with wine!
\q1
\v 2 Behold, the Lord has a mighty and strong one; as a hailstorm,
\q1 a destroying storm, as a cloudburst of might and overwhelming,
\q1 he will strike the earth with his hand.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Woe to the proud garland of the drunkards of Ephraim** - A "garland" was a crown of flowers that people would give to victors and wear to parties. Here it is a metonym that represents the proud people wearing the garland. AT: "Terrible things will happen to the proud people of Ephraim who wear garlands on their heads and get drunk at parties" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **that is on the head of the lush valley of those who are overcome with wine** - "and to the people of Samaria who are drunk on wine and who are like a fading flower at the top of the lush valley" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Behold** - "Listen" or "Pay attention"
  * **the Lord has a mighty and strong one; as a hailstorm ... overwhelming** - A "hailstorm" is when hard pieces of ice fall from the sky. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **he will strike the earth with his hand** - The word "he" may refer to king of the enemy army. "hand" refers to the power of his army. AT: "his powerful army will throw them down to the ground" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
