====== Isaiah 28:1-2 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Terrible things will happen to \add Samaria city, the capital of Israel\add*!
\q2 It is on a hill above a fertile valley;
\q1 the people who live there, who get drunk by drinking too much wine, are very proud;
\q2 it is a beautiful and glorious city,
\q2 but some day that beauty will disappear like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a flower that wilts and dries up.
\q1
\v 2 Listen to this: Yahweh will cause a great army to attack it.
\q2 Their soldiers will be like \f + \ft simile \f* a huge hailstorm or a very strong wind;
\q1 they will be everywhere, like the water of a huge flood,
\q2 and they will smash to the ground \add the buildings in Samaria\add*.

\q1
\v 1 Woe to the proud garland of the drunkards of Ephraim, and to the fading flower of his glorious beauty, 
\q1 that is on the
head of the lush valley of those who are overcome with wine!
\q1
\v 2 Behold, the Lord has a mighty and strong one; as a hailstorm, 
\q1 a destroying storm, as a cloudburst of might and
overwhelming. He will strike the earth with his hand.
