===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues speaking to his people.

  * **I announce the end from the beginning, and beforehand what has not yet happened** - This basically repeats the same idea for emphasis. AT: "I know all things before they happen." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **I call a bird of prey from the east** - The "bird of prey" is a reference to Cyrus, King of Persia who is strong and powerful like an eagle. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I have spoken; I will also accomplish it; I have purposed, I will also do it.** - This basically repeats the same idea for emphasis.
