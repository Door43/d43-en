===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Bel bows down, Nebo stoops; their idols ... for weary animals** - Isaiah speaks of people placing the idols of Bel and Nebo into a cart for animals to transport as if these gods were made to "bow down" and "stoop." These are both postures of humiliation. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Bel ... Nebo** - These were the two primary gods whom the Babylonians worshiped. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **their idols** - the idols that represented Bel and Nebo
  * **they cannot rescue the images** - "Bel and Nebo cannot rescue their images"
  * **they themselves have gone off into captivity** - Isaiah speaks of people carrying off these idols as if the false gods whom they represent are being carried off to captivity. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
