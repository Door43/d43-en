===== Translation Notes: =====
This continues the prophecy about the people of Moab. God describes events that will happen in the future as if it happened in the past. (See: [[en:bible:notes:isa:15:01|15:1-2]])
  * **Heshbon** - See how you translated the name of this city in [[en:bible:notes:isa:15:03|15:4]].
  * **Sibmah…Jazer** - These are names of cities. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **The rulers of the nations have trampled the choice vines** - The land of Moab was known for its vineyards. Here God describes the land of Moab as one large vineyard. This emphasizes that the rulers, which refers to the armies, completely destroyed everything in Moab. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
