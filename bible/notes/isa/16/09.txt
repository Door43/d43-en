\q1
\v 9 Indeed I will weep along with Jazer for the vineyard of Sibmah. 
\q1 I will water you with my tears, Heshbon, and Elealeh. 
\q1 For on your fields of  summer fruits and harvest I have ended the shouts of joy.
\q1
\v 10 Gladness and joy disappear from the fruit tree groves; and in your vineyards there is no singing nor
joyful shouts. 
\q1 No treaders tread out wine in the presses; I have made the vintage shout to cease.

===== Translation Notes: =====
This continues to describe the land of Moab as one large vineyard (See: [[en:bible:notes:isa:16:08|16:8]]). God describes events that will happen in the future as if they are happening in the present.
  * **Indeed I will weep **- In 16:9-10 the word "I" refers to Yahweh.
  * **Jazer…Sibmah** - See how you translated the names of these cities in [[en:bible:notes:isa:16:08|16:8]].
  * **Heshbon…Elealeh** - See how you translated the names of these cities in [[en:bible:notes:isa:15:03|15:4]].
