===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This continues the prophecy about the people of Moab. God describes events that will happen in the future as if it is happening in the present. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:isa:15:01|15:1-2]])

  * **So my heart sighs like a harp for Moab** - The phrase "my heart" represents Yahweh and his sad feelings. He compares his sigh to the sound of a sad song played on a harp. AT: "I sigh like a sad song on a harp" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Moab ... himself ... his** - All of these words refer to the people of Moab. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **and my inward being for Kir Hereseth** - The phrase "my inward being" represents Yahweh. The word "sighs" is understood from the previous phrase. AT: "and my inward being sighs for Kir Hareseth" or "and I am very sad for the people of Kir Hareseth." See how you translated Kir Hareseth in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:16:06|16:7]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **his prayers will accomplish nothing** - "his prayers will not be answered"
