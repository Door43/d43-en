===== Translation Notes: =====
This continues the prophecy about the people of Moab. God describes events that will happen in the future as if it is happening in the present. (See: [[en:bible:notes:isa:15:01|15:1-2]])
  * **So my heart sighs like a harp for Moab** - The phrase "my heart" refers to Yahweh. He compares the sadness he feels to the sound of a sad song played on a harp. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Moab...himself...his** - All of these words refer to the people of Moab. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **and my inward being for Kir-hereseth** - "and I am sad for the people of Kir-hereseth." See how you translated Kir-hereseth in [[en:bible:notes:isa:16:06|16:7]].
