===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Yahweh stands up for an accusation; he is standing to accuse the people** - Isaiah speaks of Yahweh's decision to harm the people as if Yahweh were bringing a legal accusation in a courtroom against the people of Israel. The second part of this line means the same thing as the first part, but it says it a little more completely. AT: "It is as though Yahweh had taken his place in a courtroom and were ready to accuse the people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **will come with judgment** - Judgment is spoken of as if it were an object that one could bring to another person. AT: "will announce his judgment" or "will declare his judgment" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **You have ruined the vineyard** - Here "you" refers to the elders and rulers. Yahweh is speaking of his people as if they were a vineyard. Like someone who fails to care for a vineyard so that the vines give no more grapes, the elders and leaders are discouraging the Israelites from serving God. AT: "My people are like a vineyard, and you have ruined it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the plunder from the poor is in your houses** - "the things you have taken from the poor are in your houses"
  * **the poor** - This nominal adjective can be stated as an adjective. AT: "those who are poor" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]])
  * **Why do you crush my people and grind the faces of the poor?** - Yahweh asks this question in order to accuse the leaders of the people. This accusation can be expressed as a statement. AT: "I am angry with you evil men because you are crushing my people and grinding the faces of the poor!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **crush my people** - Making people suffer is spoken of as if it were crushing them with a very heavy weight. AT: "cruelly harm my people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **grind the faces of the poor** - Making people suffer is spoken of as if it were rubbing their faces into the ground. AT: "harm the poor and make them suffer" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
