===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah has fallen** - Often in prophecy things that will happen in the future are described as something that has already happened. This emphasizes that these things will certainly happen. This can be translated as "For Jerusalem will come to ruin, and Judah will fall" or "God will cause Jerusalem and Judah to be destroyed."
  * **The look on their faces witnesses against them** - "The prideful looks on their faces show that they oppose Yahweh."
  * **they tell of their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it** - Here God is comparing the people of Judah with the people of Sodom who showed no shame about their actions but instead committed sin out where everyone could see. This could be translated as "they sin without shame and let everyone see it." (See: [[en:ta:translate:simile]])
