===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah has fallen** - Often in prophecy things that will happen in the future are described as something that has already happened. This emphasizes that these things will certainly happen. AT: "For Jerusalem will certainly come to ruin, and Judah will certainly fall" or "God will cause people to destroy Jerusalem and Judah"
  * **The look on their faces witnesses against them** - "The prideful looks on their faces show that they oppose Yahweh"
  * **they tell of their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it** - Here God compares the people of Judah with the people of Sodom who were not ashamed of their sin. AT: "like the people of Sodom, they talk about their sins and let everyone see them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
