\v 8 The people in Jerusalem and the other towns in Judah have disobeyed God,

\q1 Because of their sins, terrible things will happen to them;
\q2 they will cause those disasters to come onto themselves.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah has fallen** - Disobeying God is spoken of as it were stumbling and falling. (See:   [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **The look on their faces witnesses against them** - Expressions of arrogance on people faces are spoken of as if they were persons who could testify against the proud people. AT: "The prideful looks on their faces show that they oppose Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **they tell of their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it** - Here the people of Judah are said to be like the people of Sodom, because they openly boasted about their sins. AT: "like the people of Sodom, they talk about their sins and let everyone know about them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **For they have brought a catastrophe upon themselves** - The catastrophe is still coming, but is spoken of as if it had already happened. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pastforfuture]])
