\q1
\v 16 Yahweh says that because the daughters of Zion are proud,
\q1 walk along with their heads high, and flirt with their eyes,
\q1 mincing along as they go and making a tinkling with their feet,
\q1
\v 17 therefore the Lord will form diseased scabs on the heads of the daughters of Zion, and Yahweh will make them bald.
