\q1
\v 24 Instead of sweet perfume there will be stench; and instead of a sash, a rope; 
\q1 instead of well-coiffed hair, baldness; and instead of a robe, a covering of sackcloth; 
\q1 and branding instead of beauty.
\q1
\v 25 Your men will fall by the sword, and your strong men will fall in war.
\q1
\v 26 Jerusalem's gates will lament and mourn; and she will be alone and sit upon the ground.
