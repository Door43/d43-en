===== translationNotes: =====

  * **See** - The word "see" here adds emphasis to what follows. It can also be translated as "Listen" or "Indeed."
  * **support and staff** - Both of these words refer to a walking stick, on which someone leans for support. This idea here stands for the things that people need the most in order to live: food and water. AT: "everything that supports you" or "everything that you depend on" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the mighty man ... the skillful enchanter** - This is a list of categories of people that others depend on. Since they do not refer to particular individuals, they can all be translated with plural nouns as in the UDB. AT: "the mighty men ... the skillful enchanters" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_genericnoun]])
  * **omen reader** - These are people who claim that they can tell the future by looking at things like animal parts and leaves. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:02:05|2:6]].
  * **the captain of fifty** - Possible meanings are 1) the word "fifty" represents the exact amount of soldiers that the captain led. AT: "the captains of 50 soldiers" or 2) the word translated as "fifty" does not represent an exact number, but is the name of a small military unit. AT: "the captain of a small military unit" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **fifty** - "50" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
