====== Isaiah 03 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter is a continuation of the material in the previous chapter. Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 2:2-3:26, which is a vision Isaiah receives. These are the words of Yahweh.

== Judgment ==
This chapter is structured as a judgment against the Jews. God is acting as a judge reading the list of convictions against them and then he reads the judgment. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:judge]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Exile ==
While the previous part of the prophecy in chapter 2 discussed the last days, this part of the prophecy predicts the exile of Judah to Babylon. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:obe:kt:lastday]])
