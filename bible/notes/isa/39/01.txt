\c 39
\p
\v 1 At that time Marduk-Baladan son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah; for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick and had recovered.
\v 2 Hezekiah was pleased by these things; he showed the messengers his storehouse of valuable things—the silver, the gold, the spices and precious oil, the storehouse of his weapons, and all that was found in his storehouses. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his kingdom, that Hezekiah did not show them.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Marduk-Baladan ... Baladan** - These are names of men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Hezekiah was pleased by these things** - This can be made more explicit. AT: "When the king's messengers arrived, Hezekiah was pleased with what they brought to him" ([[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **showed the messengers his storehouse of valuable things** - "he showed the messengers everything of value he had"
  * **storehouse** - a building where goods are kept
  * **all that was found in his storehouses** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "everything that was in his storehouses" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **There was nothing in his house, nor in all his kingdom, that Hezekiah did not show them** - This is a slight exaggeration as Hezekiah showed them many things, but not everything. Also, this can be expressed positively. AT: "Hezekiah showed them almost everything in his house and in his kingdom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
