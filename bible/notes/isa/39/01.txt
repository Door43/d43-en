\v 1 At that time Merodach Baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah; for he had heard
that Hezekiah had been sick and had recovered.
\v 2 Hezekiah was pleased by these things; he showed the messengers his storehouse of valuable things—the silver, the gold, the spices and precious oil, the storehouse of his weapons, and all that was found in his storehouses. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his kngdom, that Hezekiah did not show them.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Hezekiah rejoiced over them** - "Hezekiah welcomed the messengers with joy because of the letter and the gift the king had sent"
  * **showed them his treasury** - "he showed them everything he had of value"
  * **there was nothing in his house or his realm that Hezekiah did not show them**- This statement is made of negative phrases to strengthen a positive meaning. This is also a Hyperbole. Hezekiah probably did not show them "every" thing but it could mean "lots of things of value". This can be translated as "he showed them everything he had of value." (See: Litotes and Hyperbole)
