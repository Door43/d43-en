===== translationNotes: =====

  * **They have seen everything in my house. There is nothing among my valuable things that I have not shown them** - These two sentences mean the same thing and are used together to emphasize how much Hezekiah showed the men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **everything in my house** - This is a generalization, as Hezekiah showed them many things, but not necessarily everything in the palace. AT: "almost everything in my house" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **There is nothing among my valuable things that I have not shown them** - This can be expressed positively. AT: "I showed them all the valuable things in my palace" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
