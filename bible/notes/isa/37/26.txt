\v 26 Have you not heard how I determined it long ago 
\q1 and worked it out in ancient times? Now I am bringing it to pass.

===== Translation Notes: =====
This continues Yahweh's message to the king of Assyria.

  * **Have you not heard how...?** - Yahweh assumes Sennacherib should know this. AT: "Certainly you have heard how ...." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **They are plants in the field, green grass, the grass of the roof or of the field, before the east wind** - This emphasizes how weak the people are before the army of Assyria. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **before the east wind** - The east wind is hot and dry from the desert and plants die when it blows.
