===== Translation Notes: =====
This continues the king of Assyria's message to Hezekiah.
    * **So will you be rescued?** - The king of Assyria uses a questions in 37:11-13 to ridicule Hezekiah and his army. AT: "So you too will not be saved." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **Have the gods of the nations rescued them** - AT: "The gods of the nations have not rescued them"
    * **Gozan… Haran… Rezeph… Eden…Telassar…Hena… Ivvah** - These are towns and kingdoms which Assyria had conquered. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
    * **Where are the king** - AT: "We also conquered the king"
    * **Hamath...Arpad...Sepharvaim** - See how you translated these in [[en:bible:notes:isa:36:18|36:19]].
