\v 7 Listen to this: I will cause Sennacherib to hear a rumor \add that the armies of Babylon are about to attack his country\add*, and that will worry him. So he will return to his own country, and there I will cause him to be assassinated by \add men using\add* swords.'~"

fall by the sword in his own land.'"
