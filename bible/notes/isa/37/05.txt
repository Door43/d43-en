====== Isaiah 37:5-7 ======

<usfm>
\v 5 After those men gave me that message,
\v 6 I replied, "Tell the king, 'This is what Yahweh says: Those messengers from the king of Assyria have said evil things about me. But do not be disturbed about what they said.
\v 7 Listen to this: I will cause Sennacherib to hear a rumor \add that the armies of Babylon are about to attack his country\add*, and that will worry him. So he will return to his own country, and there I will cause him to be assassinated by \add men using\add* swords.'~"

\v 5 After those men gave Isaiah that message,
\v 6 he told them to say to the king that Yahweh says: "Those lackeys from the king of Assyria have said evil things about me. But do not let them worry you.
\v 7 Listen to this: I will make Sennacherib hear some news from his own country that will worry him very much. So he will go back there, and I will make other men to assassinate him with their swords."

\v 5 So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah,
\v 6 and Isaiah said to them, "Say to your master: 'Yahweh says, "Do not be afraid of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have insulted me.
\v 7 Look, I will put a spirit in him, and he will hear a certain report and go back to his own land. I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land."'"
