\q2 and they will not build high mounds of dirt against the walls of the city
\q2 \add to enable them to attack the city\add*.
\q1
\v 34 And their king will return \add to his own country\add*
\q2 on the same road on which he came here.

\v 33 This is what Yahweh says about the king of Assyria:
\q1 'His armies will not enter Jerusalem;
\q2 they will not even shoot a single arrow into it.
\q1 His soldiers will not bring one shield up to Jerusalem,
\q2 and they will not build high mounds of dirt against the walls of the city
\q2 to enable them to attack the city.
\q1
\v 34 Instead, their king will return to his own country
\q2 on the same road on which he came here.
\q1 He will not enter this city!

\v 33 Therefore Yahweh says this about the king of Assyria:
\q1 "He will not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow here. 
\q1 Neither will he come before it with shield or build up a siege ramp against it.
\q1
\v 34 The way by which he came will be the same way he will leave; he will not enter this city. This is the declaration of Yahweh.
