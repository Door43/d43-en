This continues Yahweh's message to the king of Assyria. 
  * **But I know your sitting down, your going out, your coming in, and your raging against me** - “I know everything you do and your words of anger against me”
  * **I will put my hook in your nose, and my bit in your mouth** - A person uses a hook and bit to lead an animal around. This emphasizes that God completely controls what the king of Assyria will do. (See:[[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
