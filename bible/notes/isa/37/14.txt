===== translationNotes: =====

  * **from hand of the messengers** - Here the messengers are referred to by their "hand" to emphasize that they personally gave it to the king. AT: "that the messengers gave him" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **he went up to the house of Yahweh** - The house of Yahweh was at the highest place in Jerusalem, so it is spoken of as "up." 
  * **spread it before him** - "spread out the letter in front of Yahweh" (UDB). Being in the house of Yahweh is considered the same as being in Yahweh's presence. The letter was a scroll that could be unrolled and spread out.   
  * **you who sit above the cherubim** - Here Hezekiah is speaking about Yahweh being present in the temple. AT: "you who are here with the cherubim" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **you are God alone** - "only you are God"
  * **over all the kingdoms** - This means to have authority and to rule over all the kingdoms. AT: "have authority over all the kingdoms" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **You made the heavens and the earth** - This means that he created everything. AT: "You made everything" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
