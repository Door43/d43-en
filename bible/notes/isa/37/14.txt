===== translationNotes: =====

  * **from hand of the messengers** - Here the messengers are referred to by their "hand" to emphasize that they personally gave it to the king. AT: "that the messengers gave him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **he went up to the house of Yahweh** - The house of Yahweh was at the highest place in Jerusalem, so it is spoken of as "up." 
  * **spread it before him** - "spread out the letter in front of Yahweh." Being in the house of Yahweh is considered the same as being in Yahweh's presence. The letter was a scroll that could be unrolled and spread out.   
  * **you who sit above the cherubim** - You may need to make explicit that the cherubim are those on the lid of the ark of the covenant. The biblical writers often spoke of the ark of the covenant as if it were Yahweh's footstool upon which he rested his feet as he sat on his throne in heaven above. AT: "you who sit on your throne above the cherubim on the ark of the covenant" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **you are God alone** - "only you are God"
  * **over all the kingdoms** - This idiom means to have authority and to rule over all the kingdoms. AT: "have authority over all the kingdoms" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **You made the heavens and the earth** - This means that he created everything. AT: "You made everything" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
