\v 3 He said to them, "Tell this to Isaiah: 'King Hezekiah says that this is a day when we have great distress. Other nations are causing us to be insulted and disgraced. We are like \f + \ft simile \f* a woman who is about to give birth to a baby, but she does not have the strength that she needs to do it.
\v 4 But perhaps Yahweh our God has heard what the official from Assyria said. Perhaps he knows that his boss, the king of Assyria, sent him to insult the all-powerful God, and that Yahweh will punish the king of Assyria for what he said. And he requests that you pray for the few of us who are still alive \add here in Jerusalem\add*.'~"

\v 3 They told him, "Say this to Isaiah: 'King Hezekiah says that this is a day when we have great distress. Other nations are insulting and shaming us. We are like a woman who is about to give birth to a baby, but she does not have the strength that she needs to do it.
\v 4 But perhaps Yahweh our God has heard what the official from Assyria said. Perhaps God knows that the king of Assyria has sent his official to insult him, the all-powerful God. Perhaps Yahweh will punish the king of Assyria for what he said. And I, Hezekiah, request that you pray for the few of us who are still alive here in Jerusalem.'"

\v 3 They said to him, "Hezekiah says, 'This day is a day of distress, rebuke, and disgrace, like when a child is ready to be born, but the mother has no strength to give birth to her child.
\v 4 It may be Yahweh your God will hear the words of the chief commander, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Yahweh your God has heard. Now lift up your prayer for the remnant that is still here.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **They said to him** - "The men sent by Hezekiah said to Isaiah"
  * **like when a child is ready to be born, but the mother has no strength to give birth to her child** - This comparison is made to emphasizes that they are in a time of extreme difficulty. AT: "It is as terrible as the day when a child is ready to be born, but the mother has no strength to give birth to her child" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **It may be Yahweh your God will hear the words** - Hezekiah is indirectly suggesting that if the people pray Yahweh may listen and act upon what the chief commander had said. The full meaning of this statement can be made clear. AT: "Maybe if you pray to Yahweh your God will hear the message" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the chief commander** - See how you translated this phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:36:01|36:2]].
  * **his master** - This phrase means that the king is the chief commander's master. 
  * **will rebuke the words which Yahweh your God has heard** - Here the phrase "the words which Yahweh your God has heard" refers to what the king of Assyria had said.

  * **lift up your prayers** - Praying to Yahweh is described this way to emphasize that Yahweh is in heaven. Prayers is spoken of as if they were objects that could be lifted high into the sky. AT: "pray" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
