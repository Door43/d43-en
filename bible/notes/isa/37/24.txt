\v 24 By your servants you have defied the Lord and have said, 'With the multitude of my chariots
\q1 I have gone up to the heights of the mountains, to the highest elevations of Lebanon.
\q1 I will cut down its tall cedars and choice cypress trees there,
\q1 and I will enter into its farthest high places, its most fruitful forest.
