<usfm>
\v 24 By your servants have you defied the Lord, and have said, With my many chariots  I have come up to the height of 
         the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon, 

        and I will cut down its tall cedars and the choice fir-trees
        and I will enter into its farthest height, its most fruitful forest.
\v 25 I dug wells and drank water 
         I dried up all the rivers of Egypt under the soles of my feet.
