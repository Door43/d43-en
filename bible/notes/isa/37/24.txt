<usfm>
\v 24 The messengers whom you sent made fun of me.
\q1 You said, "With my many chariots I have gone to the highest mountains,
\q2 even to the highest mountains in Lebanon.
\q1 We have cut down its tallest cedar trees
\q2 and its nicest pine\f + \ft Or: cypress \f* trees.
\q1 We have been to the most distant\f + \ft Or: remote \f* peaks
\q2 and to its densest forests.
\q1
\v 25 We have dug wells in many countries and drunk water from them.
\q1 And by marching through \f + \ft metonymy \f* the streams of Egypt,
\q2 we dried them all up \f + \ft hyperbole \f*!"~'

<usfm>
\q1
 \v 24 By your servants you have defied the Lord and have said, 'With the multitude of my chariots  
 \q1 I have gone up to the heights of the mountains, to the highest elevations of  Lebanon. 
\q1 I will cut down its tall cedars and choice fir trees there,
\q1 and I will enter into its farthest high places, its most fruitful forest.
\q1
\v 25 I have dug wells and drank foreign water; 
\q1 I dried up all the rivers of Egypt under the soles of my feet.'
