===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Hezekiah continues praying to Yahweh.

  * **which he has sent** - Hezekiah is referring to the letter from Sennacherib. The meaning of this can be made clear. AT: "in the message he has sent" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Turn your ear** - "Incline your ear" or "Turn your head." This means to turn your head so that you can hear something better. 
  * **Sennacherib** - See how you translated this man's name in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:36:01|36:1]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **all the nations and their lands** - This is a generalization. The kings had destroyed many of the nearby lands, but not necessarily all lands. AT: "many of the nations and their lands" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
