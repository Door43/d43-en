===== Translation Notes: =====
This continues Yahweh's message to Hezekiah.
  * **the house of Judah** - "the descendants of Judah"
  * **will again take root and bear fruit** - Yahweh compares the coming prosperity of the people of Judah to the plantings they will do. AT: "will prosper like a plant that takes root and produces fruit" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For from Jerusalem a remnant will come out; from Mount Zion survivors will come** - These mean the same thing and are used together for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
