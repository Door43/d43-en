===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking to Zion as if it were a person.

  * **Who has borne these children for me?**  - Zion uses a question to emphasize that she is surprised that so many children now belong to her. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **I was bereaved and barren**  - "I was mourning over my dead children and unable to have more"
  * **exiled and divorced**  - "I was sent away, without a husband"
  * **Who has raised these children? Look, I was left all alone; where did these come from?**  - Again, Zion uses questions to emphasize her surprise. AT: "Look, I was left all alone; now all of these children that I did not raise have come to me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
