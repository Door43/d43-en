  * **the captives will be taken away from the warrior, and spoils will be rescued**  - AT: "I will take the captives from the warrior, and I will get back the spoils" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **your adversary … your children**  - Here "your" refers to the city of Zion as if it were a person who has enemies and the people who live in Zion are her children. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification|Personification]])
