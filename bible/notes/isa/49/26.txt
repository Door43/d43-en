===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking to Zion as if it were a person.

  * **And I will feed your oppressors with their own flesh**  - This means Yahweh will cause the Babylonians to fight each other. Some will even join the enemies of Babylonia who are out to conquer them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **and they will get drunk on their own blood, as if it were wine**  - This means Yahweh will cause Israel's enemies to kill one another and that there will be much bloodshed and even enjoyment in it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
