===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking to Zion as if it were a person.

  * **I will raise my hand to the nations; I will raise my signal flag to the peoples**  - These clauses mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. AT: "I will call the people of the nations to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]])
  * **your sons â€¦ your daughters**  - This refers to the Israelites who will return from exile.
