===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But Zion said** - The word "Zion" is another name for Jerusalem. Isaiah speaks of the city as if it were a woman who complains that Yahweh has forgotten her. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **Can a woman forget her baby, nursing at her breast, so she does not have compassion on the son she has borne?** - Yahweh uses a question to help his people understand that he will never forget about them or stop caring for them. AT: "A woman would not forget her nursing baby or stop caring for her son. But, even if she did, I certainly will not forget you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
