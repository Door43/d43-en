===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Can a woman forget her baby, nursing at her breast, so she does not have compassion on the son she has borne? Yes, they may forget, but I will not forget you** - Yahweh uses a question to help his people understand that he will never forget about them or stop caring for them. AT: "A woman would not forget about her child or stop caring for her baby. But, even if she did, I certainly will not forget you" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
