===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Can a woman forget her baby, nursing at her breast, so she does not have compassion on the son she has borne?** - Yahweh uses this rhetorical question to respond to the people that he has definitely not forgotten them. Yahweh compares himself to a woman who is nursing her baby and will never forget the baby and will always be kind to the child she has given birth to. (See: Rhetorical Question)
