===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Listen to me** - Here "me" refers to Yahweh's servant.
  * **He has made my mouth like a sharp sword** - This means that his message has the power to save or destroy. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **he hid me in the shadow of his hand** - This means Yahweh has protected his servant and kept his purpose secret. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]]).
  * **he has made me into a polished arrow; in his quiver he has hidden me** - This also means Yahweh has protected his servant to be ready for attack later and kept his purpose secret. An arrow is used to attack an enemy. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
