\v 5 And now Yahweh has spoken, he who formed me from birth to be his servant,
\q1 to restore Jacob again to himself, and that Israel would be gathered to him—
\q1 for I am honored in the eyes of Yahweh, and my God has become my strength.
\q1
\v 6 He says, "It is too small a thing for you to be my servant to reestablish the tribes of Jacob,
\q1 and to restore the survivors of Israel. I will make you a light to the Gentiles,
\q1 that you may be my salvation to the ends of the earth."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh's servant continues speaking.

  * **that Israel would be gathered to him** - This part of the sentence means the same as the part before it. This can be stated in active form. AT: "to bring the people of Israel back to himself" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **I am honored in the eyes of Yahweh** - Here "eyes" represents Yahweh's thoughts or opinion. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh has honored me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **my God has become my strength** - God giving the servant strength is spoken of as if God himself were his strength. AT: "my God has given me strength" or "my God has strengthened me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will make you a light to the Gentiles** - The servant bringing Yahweh's message to the Gentiles and helping them to understand it is spoken of as if Yahweh made the servant a light that shines among the Gentiles. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:42:05|42:6]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to the ends of the earth** - The places on the earth that are very far away are spoken of as if they were the places where the earth ends. This phrase also forms a merism and refers to everywhere in between the ends. AT "to all the farthest places of the earth" or "to the entire earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
