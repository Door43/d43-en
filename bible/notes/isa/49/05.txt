\v 5 And now Yahweh has spoken, he who formed me from birth to be his servant, 
\q1 to restore Jacob again to himself, and that Israel be gathered to him. 
\q1 I am honored in the eyes of Yahweh, and my God has become my strength.
\q1
\v 6 He says, "It is too small a thing for you to be my servant to reestablish the tribes of Jacob, 
\q1 and to restore the survivors of Israel. I will make you a light to the Gentiles, 
\q1 that you may be my salvation to the ends of the earth."

===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh's servant continues speaking.
  * **that Israel be gathered to him** - This part of the sentence means the same as the part before it. AT: "to bring the people of Israel back to himself." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **I am honored in the eyes of Yahweh** - Here "eyes" means God's thoughts or opinion. AT: "Yahweh considers me honored" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I will make you a light to the Gentiles** - This means he will cause even those who are not Israelites to  understand and to worship Yahweh. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
