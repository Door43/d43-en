===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Zoan** - This is a city in northern Egypt. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]) 
  * **How can you say to Pharaoh** - Isaiah uses a question to mock those in Egypt who claim to be wise. AT: "You should not say to Pharaoh." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Where then are your wise men?** - Isaiah uses a question to mock the wise men. The word "your" refers to Pharaoh. AT: "Call for your wise men, O Pharaoh." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **Let them tell you and make known what Yahweh of Hosts plans concerning Egypt** - Isaiah is implying that wise men should be able to understand God's plans, but Isaiah does not really believe they are wise. AT: "But they will not be able to make known to you what Yahweh of Hosts plans concerning Egypt." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **Yahweh of Hosts** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:isa:01:09|1:9]].
