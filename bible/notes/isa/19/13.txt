  * **The princes of Zoan ... the princes of Memphis ... who are the cornerstones of her tribes** - The princes of Zoan and Memphis are spoken of as if they are the cornerstones of buildings because they are an important part of the community. AT: "who are the leaders of her tribes"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **made Egypt go astray** - The word "Egypt" represents the people of Egypt. Going astray represents doing what is wrong. AT: "made the people of Egypt go astray" or "made the people of Egypt do what is wrong" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Yahweh has mixed a spirit of distortion into her midst** - Isaiah speaks of Yahweh's judgment as if Egypt was a cup of wine. He speaks of Yahweh causing the leaders' thoughts to be distorted as if their distorted thoughts were a liquid that Yahweh mixed in with the wine. AT: "Yahweh has judged them by distorting their thoughts" or "Yahweh has judged Egypt by distorting its leaders' thoughts, as intoxicating drinks confuse people's thoughts" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **distortion** - "perverseness" or "confusion"
  * **into her midst** - Here "her" refers to Egypt. Nations are sometimes spoken of as if they were women. AT: "within Egypt" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **they have led Egypt astray** - Here, "they" refers to the leaders described in the previous verses. The word "Egypt" represents the people of Egypt. AT: "the princes have led the people of Egypt astray" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

  * **whether head or tail** - The "head," the part of an animal a person would want to be, represents the leader. The "tail" is the opposite and represents people who follow. AT: "whether leader or follower" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])  
  * **palm branch or reed** - The "palm branch" grows high on the tree and represents people who are wealthy and important. The "reed" grows in shallow water and represents people who are poor and unimportant. See how you translated similar phrases in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:09:13|9:14]]. AT: "whether they are important or unimportant" or "whether rich or poor" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
