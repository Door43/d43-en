===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The fishermen will wail and mourn, and all who cast a hook into the Nile will mourn like those who spread nets on the waters will grieve** - The reason they are grieving can be made explicit: "and the fishermen who try to catch fish with hooks or nets will cry in despair because all the fish in the Nile have died." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
