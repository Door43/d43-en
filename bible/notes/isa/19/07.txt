===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the sown fields of the Nile** - "the fields near the Nile where people have planted crops"
  * **The fishermen will wail and mourn, and all who cast a hook into the Nile will mourn, and those who spread nets on the waters will grieve** - These three phrases mean basically the same thing. If necessary, the reason they will grieve can be stated clearly. AT: "The fishermen who catch fish with hooks or nets will cry in despair because the fish in the Nile have died" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **cast a hook into the Nile** - In order to catch fish, some people put a little food on a hook, tie the hook to a string, and throw the hook into the water. When a fish tries to eat the food, its mouth gets stuck on the hook, and the person pulls the fish out of the water. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **cast** - "throw"
  * **spread nets on the waters** - In order to catch fish, some people toss a net on the water. When fish get caught in it, they pull the net with the fish out of the water. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
