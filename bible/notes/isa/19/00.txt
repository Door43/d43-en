====== Isaiah 19 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 19:1-18, which is an extended quotation.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Egypt ==
This chapter prophesied destruction against the nation of Egypt. Their destruction will come from internal division instead of being conquered by another nation. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Imagery ==
Some of the imagery used in this chapter may be connected to the worship of false gods. One important god the people of Canaan worshipped was Baal, the god of rain or storms. One of the important gods the Egyptians worshipped was Ra, the god of the sun. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "In that day" ==
This changes the reference from the time when Assyria comes to dominate the world and looks to a more distant future day.
