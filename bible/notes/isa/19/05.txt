  * **The waters of the sea will dry up, and the river will dry up and become empty** - Egyptians referred to the Nile River as "the sea." These two phrases mean basically the same thing. AT: "The Nile River will completely dry up" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **become foul** - "become foul-smelling" or "stink"
  * **dwindle** - "be low"
  * **the reeds and flags will wither away** - "Reeds" and "flags" refer to two similar kinds of water plants. AT: "the plants along the river will die and decay"
