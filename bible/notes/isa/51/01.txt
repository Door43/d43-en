===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Listen to me**  - Here "me" is Yahweh.
  * **look at the rock from which you were chiseled and to the quarry from which you were cut**  - Both phrases mean basically the same thing. This refers to a person cutting out smaller stones from a large rock to use for building. God compares this to Abraham and Sarah through whom he made the nation of Israel. AT: "Think about your ancestors who are like the rock from which I chiseled you and made you a nation." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
