===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **I have placed my words in your mouth** - Here "I" refers to Yahweh and "your" refers to his servant. AT: "I have told you what to say" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
    * **and I have covered you in the shadow of my hand** - AT: "and my power has kept you safe"
    * **that I may plant the heavens** - This means the same as "stretch out the heavens." Here it emphasizes God's power to restore the heavens in the future. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[en:bible:notes:isa:40:21|40:22]]. 
    * **lay the foundations of the earth** - This emphasizes God's power to restore the earth in the future. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[en:bible:notes:isa:24:17|24:18]].
