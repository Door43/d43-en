    * **and I have covered you in the shadow of my hand** - AT: "and my power has kept you safe"
    * **that I may plant the heavens** - This means the same as "stretch out the heavens." Here it emphasizes God's power to restore the heavens in the future. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[en:bible:notes:isa:40:21|40:22]].
