===== translationNotes: =====


  * **I have placed my words in your mouth** - This speaks of Yahweh telling Isaiah what to say as if his words were a physical object Yahweh placed in Isaiah's mouth. AT: "I have told you what to say" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and I have covered you in the shadow of my hand** - Yahweh's "hand" refers to his power. This speaks of Yahweh protecting Isaiah as if his hand were covering him to protect him. AT: "and my power has kept you safe" or "I have protected you and kept you safe" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **that I may plant the heavens** - The word "plant" here means to establish something in the ground. This speaks of Yahweh restoring the heavens as if they were tent pegs he was planting. AT: "that I may establish the heavens" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **lay the foundations of the earth** - The word "foundation" normally refers to a stone structure that gives support to a building from underneath. Here it describes a similar structure that was thought to support and hold the earth in place. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:24:17|24:18]].
