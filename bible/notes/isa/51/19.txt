\v 19 These two troubles happened to you—who will grieve with you?— 
\q1 desolation and destruction, and the famine and the sword. Who will console you?
\q1
\v 20 Your sons have fainted; they lie at every street corner, like an antelope in a net;

===== Translation Notes: =====
Isaiah continues speaking to the people of Israel.

    * **who will grieve with you...who will console you?** - Isaiah uses questions to emphasize that now there is no one to weep with them or comfort them. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **desolation and destruction** - "your enemies have left your city empty and ruined"
    * **and the famine and the sword** - "and many of you have died from hunger and war"
    * **like an antelope in a net** - This means their children are completely helpless like an animal in a trap. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
    * **antelope** - an animal with horns that runs very fast (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
