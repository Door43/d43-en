===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **Why have you forgotten Yahweh ... earth?** - Yahweh uses a question to emphasize that they should not forget Yahweh. This may be written as a statement. AT: "You should not have forgotten Yahweh ... earth." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Maker** - See how you translated this name for Yahweh in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:17:06|17:7]].
  * **who stretched out the heavens** - "who spread out the sky." This speaks of Yahweh having created the heavens as if he had stretched them out in the same way one would stretch out a large garment. AT: "who stretched out the heavens like a garment" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the foundations of the earth** - The word "foundation" normally refers to a stone structure that gives support to a building from underneath. Here it describes a similar structure that was thought to support and hold the earth in place. See how you translated this phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:24:17|24:18]].
  * **the hot fury of the oppressor when he decides to destroy** - "the oppressor's hot fury when he decides to cause destruction" 
  * **hot fury** - Here the word "hot" means "strong" or "great." AT: "great fury" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Where is the fury of the oppressor?** - Yahweh uses a question to emphasize that the people should not fear those who want to oppress them. Their oppressors are no longer a threat to them. This may be written as a statement. AT: "The fury of the oppressor is not a threat!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
