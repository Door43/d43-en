===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

    * **I will put it into the hand of your tormentors** - "I will put the cup of staggering into the hands of those who hurt you." This means God will now punish the enemies of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **you made your back like the ground and like the street for them to walk on** - AT: "you lay in the streets so your enemies could walk on your backs" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
