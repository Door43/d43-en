===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **Yahweh will comfort Zion**  - AT: "Yahweh will comfort the people of Zion" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
  * **her wilderness he made like Eden, and her desert plains beside the Jordan river valley like the garden of Yahweh**  - Both of these phrases mean basically the same thing. It means God will restore beauty and happiness to the places that are empty. Also, in prophecy, events that will happen in the future are often described as something in the past. This emphasizes that it certainly will happen. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
  * **joy and gladness will be found in her**  - AT: "there will be joy and gladness in Zion again" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
