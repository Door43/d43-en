===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **nor be disheartened by their abuse**  - AT: "and do not lose your courage when they hurt you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **For the moth will eat them up like a garment, and the worm will eat them like wool**  - This means that God will destroy perhaps slowly but surely those who insult his people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
