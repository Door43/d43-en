===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Awake, awake, stand up, Jerusalem**  - The word "awake" is repeated for emphasis and shows urgency, to arouse the people of Israel, not to //literally//  wake them from sleep. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe|Apostrophe]])
  * **you drank the bowl of Yahweh's anger from his hand** - This compares the people of Israel who fully experienced God's anger and punishment to a person who drinks all the wine in a bowl.
  * **the bowl of staggering**  - This compares the people of Israel, who experienced Yahweh's punishment to the full, to a wine drinker who stumbles and falls down. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **There is no one among all the sons â€¦ to take her by the hand**  - These two clauses mean the same thing. Yahweh is describing the city of Jerusalem as if it were a mother and the people were her children. Here there are no children left to help their mother. This emphasizes how helpless the people were after God punished them.
