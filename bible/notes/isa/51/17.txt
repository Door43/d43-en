===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Awake, awake, stand up, Jerusalem** - The repetition of the word "awake" emphasizes the urgency of the call to arouse the people of Israel. It is not literally to wake them from sleep. "Jerusalem" stands for the people of Jerusalem. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **you who drank the bowl of Yahweh's anger from his hand** - This compares the people of Israel who fully experienced God's anger and punishment to a person who drinks all the wine in a bowl. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the bowl of staggering** - This compares the people of Israel, who experienced Yahweh's punishment to the full, to a wine drinker who stumbles and falls down. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **There is no one among all the sons ... to take her by the hand** - These two clauses mean the same thing. Yahweh is describing the city of Jerusalem as if it were a mother and the people were her children. Here there are no children left to help their mother. This emphasizes how helpless the people were after God punished them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
