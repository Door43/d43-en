===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 That is why Yahweh, who rescued Abraham, says about the people of Israel,
\q1 "My people will no longer be ashamed;
\q2 no longer will they show on their faces that they are ashamed.
\q1
\v 23 When they see that I have blessed them by giving them many children and doing many other things for them,
\q2 they will realize that I am the Holy One of Israel,
\q2 and they will revere me, the God to whom they, the descendants of Jacob, belong.
\q1
\v 24 When that happens, those who are not able to think well will think clearly,
\q2 and those who complain \add about what I am doing\add* will accept what I am teaching them."

\q1
\v 22 Therefore this is what Yahweh says concerning the house of Jacob—Yahweh, who redeemed Abraham: 
\q1  "Jacob will no longer be ashamed, nor will his face be pale.
\q1
\v 23 But when he sees his children, the work of my hands, they will make my name holy.
\q1 They will make holy the name of the Holy One of Jacob and they will stand in awe of the God of Israel.
\q1
\v 24 Those who err in spirit will gain understanding, and complainers will learn knowledge."
