====== Isaiah 29 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of chapter 29, which is an extended quotation.

This chapter begins a series of "woes" against specific nations. This chapter presents judgements against the kingdoms of Ephraim and eventually Judah. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:woe]] and [[:en:obe:kt:judge]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Ariel ==
This is another name for Jerusalem. It is an uncommon name. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Prophecies ==
This chapter appears to prophesy about a time of restoration when the messiah will reign. This chapter pictures a time of great peace and harmony in the world. The translator should not add explanation, but should try to maintain the tense of the original text, as a future or uncompleted action. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:obe:kt:fulfill]])
