\v 13 The Lord said, "This people draws near to
me with their mouth 
\q1 and honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. 
\q1 Their honoring me
is a commandment taught by men.

\v 14 Therefore, see, I will proceed to do a marvelous thing among this people, wonder after wonder. 
\q1 The
wisdom of their wise men will perish, and the understanding of their prudent men will disappear.
