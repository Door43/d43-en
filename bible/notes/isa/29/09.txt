===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Astonish yourselves and be astonished** - The word "yourselves" refers to the people of Jerusalem. Why they are astonished can be made explicit: AT: "Be astonished at what I am telling you" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **blind yourselves...be drunk** - Isaiah compares the people of Jerusalem to a blind person and a drunk person. This emphasizes they are senseless and do not understand God's plans. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **blind yourselves and be blind** - AT: "keep being ignorant and spiritually blind to what I am showing you"
  * **Be drunk, but not with wine; stagger, but not with beer** - AT: "Be senseless like a drunk person, but it is not because you have drank too much wine"
  * **For Yahweh has poured out on you the spirit of deep sleep** - AT: "The reason you are senseless is because Yahweh has caused you to be spiritually asleep."
  * **He has closed your eyes, the prophets, and has covered your heads, the seers** - AT: "He has made your prophets and seers unable to hear and understand his message"
