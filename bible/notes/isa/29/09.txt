  * **blind yourselves and be blind! Be drunk, but not with wine; stagger, but not with beer **  -This compares their spiritual insensitivity to God by comparing them to a blind man and a drunkard stumbling around unable to see God’s guidence and power – (See:Metonymy}
  * **Yahweh has poured out on you the spirit of deep sleep , He has closed your eyes, the prophets, and has covered your heads, the seers**. – “Yahweh has caused a deep sleep to overcome you so that neither you nor your prophets or your leaders can see” - (See:Metonymy)
