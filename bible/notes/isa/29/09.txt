  * **Be drunk, but not with wine; stagger, but not with beer** - AT: "Be senseless like a drunk person, but it is not because you have drank too much wine"
  * **For Yahweh has poured out on you the spirit of deep sleep** - AT: "The reason you are senseless is because Yahweh has caused you to be spiritually asleep."
