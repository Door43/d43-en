===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I will encamp against you** - The word "I" refers to Yahweh. AT: "I will command the army of your enemies to surround you."
  * **palisade...siege works** - A "palisade" is a tower armies would build to attack cities with high walls. Also, "siege works" refers to other various weapons armies would build to attack cities.
  * **You will be brought down** - AT: "Your enemy will bring you down" or "Your enemy will humble you" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **and will speak from the ground; your speech will be low from the dust. Your voice will be like a ghost out of the ground, and your speech will be very weak from the dust** - This emphasizes that the people who once spoke with proud words will be weak and grieving after the enemy defeats them. AT: "and you will only be able to speak with weak whispers like a spirit speaking from where dead people dwell." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
