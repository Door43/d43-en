===== translationNotes: =====

  * **At that time** - before the child knows to refuse the evil and choose the good ([[:en:bible:notes:isa:07:13|7:15]])
  * **Yahweh will whistle for** - "Yahweh will call" or "Yahweh will summon"
  * **for a fly from the distant streams of Egypt, and for a bee from the land of Assyria** - Here the armies of Egypt and Assyria are spoken of as if they are insects that will invade the land of Israel. This can be stated as a simile. AT: "for the armies of Egypt and Assyria, and their soldiers will be everywhere like flies and bees" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
