\v 13 So Isaiah replied, "Listen, house of David. Is it not enough for you to test the patience of people?  Must you also test the patience of my God?

Immanuel.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **house of David** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:isa:07:01|7:2]].
  * **Is it not enough for you to test the patience of people? Must you also test the patience of my God?** - AT: "You test the patience of of people. Now you even test the patience of my God!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **young woman will conceive** - Possible meanings are 1) a young woman old enough to marry will become pregnant the natural way or 2) a virgin will become pregnant through a miracle or 3) Isaiah is referring to both options. Sometimes a prophecy is fulfilled once in a certain way then fulfilled again later in another way.
  * **his name Immanuel** - Translators may add a footnote that says: "The name Immanuel means 'God with us.'"
  * **He will eat curds and honey when he knows to refuse the evil and choose the good.** - Possible meanings are 1) "By the time that child is old enough to eat curds and honey, he will be able to reject what is evil and choose what is good." This emphasizes that the child will be very young when he knows to choose what is right instead of wrong. 2) "By the time the child is old enough to reject what is evil and choose what is good, he will be eating curds and honey." The people of Judah considered a child to be responsible for doing what is right when he was 12 years old. This emphasizes that within twelve years there will be an abundance of curds and honey to eat because the most of the people of Israel will be killed or taken as captives.
