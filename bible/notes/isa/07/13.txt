\v 13 So Isaiah replied, "Listen, O house of David.' Is it not enough for you to test the patience of people?  Must you also test the patience of my God?
\v 14 Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: see, a young woman will conceive, bear a son, and will call his name
Immanuel.
\v 15 He will  eat curds and honey when he knows to refuse the evil and choose the good.
