  * **The Lord spoke again to Ahaz** - It can be made explicit that the Lord did not speak directly to Ahaz:  "Again, the Lord told Isaiah to tell Ahaz." (See: [[en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit]])
  * **Ask a sign of Yahweh your God** - "Ask Yahweh your God to prove what he says is true."
  * **ask for it in the depths or in the height above** - Yahweh uses the word "depths" and "height" to mean Ahaz could ask him for anything. (See: [[en:ta:translate:merism]])
