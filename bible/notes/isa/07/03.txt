===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Isaiah writes about what happened to him as if it had happened to someone else.

  * **Shear Jashub** - Translators may also add a footnote that says, "The name Shear Jashub means 'a remnant will return.'" The meaning may have given hope to Ahaz. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **at the end of the conduit of the upper pool** - "where the water enters the upper pool" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **conduit** - man-made ditch or tunnel through which water flows
  * **road** - If your language has a word for a road or path that people have made smooth by filling in the low places and lowering the high places, you can use it here.
  * **Launderer's Field** - Possible meanings are 1) this is the proper name by which the people called the field or 2) this is the common noun that the people used to talk about the field, "the launderer's field" or "the field where men wash wool" or "the field where women wash clothes." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Launderer's Field** - A launderer is either 1) a man who washes wool that someone has cut from the sheep, "Wool Washer Field," or 2) a woman who washes dirty clothes, "Clothes Washer Field." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Tell him** - "Tell Ahaz"
  * **do not be afraid or intimidated by these two smoldering firebrands, by the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram, and of Pekah son of Remaliah** - God compares Rezin and Pekah to burning sticks whose fire has gone out and are making smoke now. God is emphasizing that they are not real threats to Judah. This can be stated in active form. AT: "do not let Rezin and Pekah make you afraid; their fierce anger is like a burning stick whose fire has gone out and there is only smoke" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **afraid or intimidated** - The words "afraid" and "intimidated" mean the same thing and can be translated as one word. AT: "afraid" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
