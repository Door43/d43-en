\v 3 Then Yahweh said to Isaiah, "Go out with your son Shear Jashub to meet Ahaz at the end of the conduit of the
upper pool, on the road to the Launderer's field.
\v 4 Tell him, 'Be careful, remain calm, do not be afraid or intimidated by these two smoldering firebrands, by 
the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram, and of Pekah son of Remaliah.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Shear Jashub** - Translators may also add a footnote that says "The name Shear Jashub means 'a remnant will return.'" The meaning may have given hope to Ahaz. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **at the end of the conduit of the upper pool** - "where the water enters the upper pool"
  * **on the road to the Launderer's field** - "near the place where the women wash and dry clothes"
  * **Tell him** - "Tell Ahaz"
  * **do not be afraid or intimidated by these two smoldering firebrands, by the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram, and of Pekah son of Remaliah** - God compares Rezin and Pekah to burning sticks whose fire has gone out and are making smoke now. God is emphasizing that they are not real threats to Judah. This can be stated in active form. AT: "do not let Rezin and Pekah scare you. Because their fierce anger is like a burning stick whose fire has gone out and there is only smoke" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
