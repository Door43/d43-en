  * **before the child know to refuse the evil and choose the good** - In Hebrew culture, the child would be about 12 years old.
  * **the land whose two kings** - This refers to the nation of Israel, called Ephraim, and the nation of Aram. Pekah was king of Ephraim. Rezin was king of Aram.
  * **you dread** - "you fear." Here "you" is singular and refers to Ahaz. (See: [[en:ta:translate:formsofyou]])
  * **your people** - This refers to the people of Judah.
  * **father's house** - This refers to the descendants of David who are now ruling over the people of Judah.
