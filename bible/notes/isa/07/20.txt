\v 20 At that time Yahweh will hire the king of Assyria to come \add with his army\add* from east of the \add Euphrates\add* River. \add They will get rid of everything in your land—the crops and the people.

\v 21 When that happens, a farmer will be able to have only one cow and two goats\f + \ft Or: sheep \f*.
\v 22 However, those animals will give plenty of milk, with the result that the farmer will have curds\f + \ft Or: yogurt \f* to eat. And \add because there will not be many people left\add* in the land, all the people who remain there will have plenty of milk and honey.

\v 20 At that time Yahweh will hire the king of Assyria to come with his army from east of the Euphrates River. They will get rid of everything in your land—the crops and the people. They will destroy everything thoroughly; it will be like a barber shaving not only a man's hair but his beard and the hair on his legs.
\v 21 When that happens, a farmer will be able to keep alive only one young cow and two goats.
\v 22 However, those animals will give plenty of milk, with the result that the farmer will have curds to eat. And because there will not be many people left in the land, all the people who remain there will have plenty of milk and honey.

\v 20 At that time the Lord will shave with a razor that was hired  beyond the Euphrates River—
the king of Assyria—
\q1 he will shave your head, the hair on your legs; and he will also shave off your beard.
\q1 
\v 21 On that day, a man will keep alive a young cow and two sheep,
\q1
\v 22 and because of the abundance of milk which they shall give, he will eat curds, 
\q1 for everyone left in the land 
 will eat curds and honey.
