  * **Ephraim will be shattered and will no longer be a people** - Here "Ephraim" refers to all of the northern kingdom of Israell. This can be translated with an active verb: "an army will destroy Ephraim, and there will no longer be a people of Israel"
  * **sixty-five years**  - "65 years" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son** - This means Pekah is the king of Samaria and all of Israel. AT: "the king of Samaria is only Pekah.
  * **If you do not remain firm in faith, surely you will not remain secure**  - AT: "If you continue to believe in me, you will certainly remain safe." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
