===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **Then your light would be broken open like the sunrise** - "Break open" is an idiom that means when a light begins to shine brightly. This means that if they help people in need, their deeds will be like lights others will see, as when the sun comes up after a dark night. Or the light may refer to the light of the Lord, shining on them and blessing them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **your healing would quickly sprout up** - This means God will bless and restore them quickly, as a wound heals quickly. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **your righteousness would go before you, and the glory of Yahweh would be your rearguard** - This refers to the time when God protected the people of Israel as they escaped from Egypt. This means God will again protect them from their enemies if they will do what is right.
  * **your righteousness** - This expression in Hebrew can also be interpreted as the one who gives righteousness or even victory. In this context, this expression would refer to God. A few modern versions have this interpretation.
