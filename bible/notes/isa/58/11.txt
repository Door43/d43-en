===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **satisfy the dry region of your soul**  - AT: "satisfy you like a rain falling in the desert" or "satisfy you even in the driest desert" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche|Synecdoche]])
  * **You will be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters never fail**  - This means they will have all they need for an abundant life. Judah was a dry land, and water was essential to life.  Also, it may recall the garden of Eden . (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
