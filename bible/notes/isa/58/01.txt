===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **lift up your voice like a trumpet** - This means shout loudly. Here "your" refers to Isaiah. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **confront my people with their rebellion, and the house of Jacob with their sins** - This is saying the same thing in two ways for emphasis. Here "my" refers to Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
