===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Lift up your voice like a trumpet** - This means shout loudly. Here "your" refers to Isaiah. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_yousingular]])
  * **Confront my people with their rebellion, and the house of Jacob with their sins** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Together they strengthen the urgency to confront Yahweh's people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
