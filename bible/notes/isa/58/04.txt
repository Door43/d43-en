<usfm>
\q1
\v 4 Look, you fast to quarrel and fight, and to hit  with your fist of wickedness;
\q1 you do not fast today to make your voice heard above.
\q1
\v 5 Is this really the kind of fast that I would want: A day for anybody to humble himself, 
\q1 for him to bow down his head like a reed, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under himself? 
\q1 Do you really call this a fast, a day that pleases Yahweh?

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **fist of wickedness**  - "wicked fist." This shows to what point they fight—viciously. It is possible that going without food leads them to being irritable to the point of violence.
  * **Is this really the kind of fast that I would want**  - Yahweh uses a question to scold the people. They act like they are humble before God, but they are hurting other people. AT: "This is not the kind of fast I want" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **A day for anybody to humble himself, for him to bow down his head like a reed**  - This means the person is bowing down, but he is not truly humble. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
  * **Do you really call this a fast, a day that pleases Yahweh?**  - Yahweh uses a question to scold the people. AT: "Surely you do not think this kind of fast pleases me"
