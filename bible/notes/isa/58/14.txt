===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **and I will make you ride on the high places of the earth**  - This recalls Deuteronomy 32.13 and means that God will wonderfully care for and protect them as he did their ancestors. It might mean, too, that their name would be known widely and that they would overcome and be victorious. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken**  - AT: "for Yahweh has spoken it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche|Synecdoche]])
