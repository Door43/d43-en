====== Isaiah 58 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Fasting ==
The practice of fasting became more common after the exile. This was intended to bring people into a right relationship with God by creating a designate time to concentrate on him. It may have been believed that Yahweh heard people better when they fasted. Its significance is derived from the attitude of repentance and faith in Yahweh and not the practice itself. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:repent]] and [[:en:obe:kt:faith]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "Yet they seek me daily" ==
The people did not truly seek Yahweh every day. They practiced the outward aspects of the Jewish religion, but their hearts were far from Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
