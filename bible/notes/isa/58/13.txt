===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **If you turn back from the Sabbath day your feet from doing your own pleasure on my holy day**  - AT: "If you turn back your feet from doing your own pleasure on the Sabbath, my holy day." Here "feet" refers to the kinds of work and traveling that the people did on all other days. God did not allow work on the Sabbath day. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
