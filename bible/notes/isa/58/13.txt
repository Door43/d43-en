===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **turn back your feet from traveling on the Sabbath day, and from doing your own pleasure on my holy day**  - AT: "If you traveling and doing what you want to do on the Sabbath, my holy day." Here "feet" refers to the kinds of work and traveling that the people did on all other days. God did not allow work on the Sabbath day. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
