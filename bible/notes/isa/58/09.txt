<usfm>
\q1
\v 9 Then you would call, and Yahweh would answer; you would cry out for help, and he would say, "Here I am."
\q1 If you take away from among yourselves the yoke, the accusing finger, and the speech of wickedness,
\q1
\v 10 if you provide for the hungry and satisfy the need of the distressed; 
\q1 then your light will rise in the darkness, and your darkness will be like the noonday.

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **then your light will rise in the darkness, and your darkness will be like the noonday**  - This means their acts of kindness will be examples of light in the community, and the "darkness," the bad deeds, will be overcome by the light. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
