\q1
\v 9 Then you would call, and Yaweh would answer; you would cry out for help, and he would say, "Here I am."
\q1 If you take away from among yourselves the yoke, the accusing finger, and the speech of wickedness,
\q1

\q1 then your light will rise in the darkness, and your darkness will be like the noonday.
