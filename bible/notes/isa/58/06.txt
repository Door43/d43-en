===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Is not this the fast that I choose: to release wicked bonds, to undo the ropes of the yoke, to set the crushed ones free, and to break every yoke?** - Through this rhetorical question, Yahweh continues to explain that what he really wants it for them to free those who have been falsely imprisoned, encourage those who have been cruelly treated and free everyone from their oppression. Here he is also saying the same thing in two ways for emphasis. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
    * **Is it not to break your bread with the hungry and to bring the poor and homeless into your house? When you see someone naked, you should clothe him; and you should not hide yourself from your own relatives?** - Yahweh is using this rhetorical question to further explain that he wants them to feed the hungry, let the homeless stay in their homes, give clothes to those who need it and not hide from any relatives that need their help. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
