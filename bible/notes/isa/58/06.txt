===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **Is not this the fast that I choose**  - Yahweh uses a question to teach the people about the kind of fast that pleases him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **to release wicked bonds, to undo the ropes of the yoke, to set the crushed ones free, and to break every yoke?**  - All of these phrases mean they should help those people that the wicked are hurting and oppressing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]])
  * **Is it not to**  - Yahweh uses another question to teach the people.
