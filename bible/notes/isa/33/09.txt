===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The land mourns and withers away** - This speaks of the land becoming dry as if it were a person mourning. AT: "The land becomes dry and its plants wither away" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **is ashamed and withers away** - Lebanon is someone who is ashamed (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **Lebanon ... withers away** - Because Lebanon was known for its beautiful trees, this expression is probably based on the fact that trees wither away. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Sharon ... Bashan ... Carmel** - regions where many flowers and trees once grew
