<usfm>
\q1
\v 15 He who walks righteously and speaks honestly; 
\q1 who despises the gain of oppression,
\q1 who shakes his hand so that it will not accept a bribe, 
\q1 who stops his ears from hearing about bloodshed,
\q1 and who shuts his eyes from looking on evilâ€”
\q1
\v 16 this is the man who will dwell on the heights,
\q1 his place of defense will be the fortress among the cliffs, 
\q1 his food will be given, and his water will be in steady supply.
