<usfm>
\v 23 The ropes on our enemies' boats will hang loose,
\q2 their masts will not be fastened firmly,
\q2 and their sails will not be spread out.
\q1 The treasures that they have seized will be divided among us, God's people,
\q2 and even lame people among us will get some.
\q1
\v 24 And the people in Jerusalem will no longer say, "We are sick,"
\q2 because Yahweh will forgive the sins that have been committed by the people who live there.

\v 23 Your riggings are slack; they cannot hold the mast in place; they cannot spread the sail;
\q1 when the great spoil is divided, even the lame will drag off the spoil.
\q1
\v 24 The inhabitants will not say, "I am sick;" the people who live there will be forgiven for their iniquity.

  * **Your riggings are slack; they cannot hold the mast in place; they cannot spread the sail** - Possible meanings: 1) The Assyrian army is like a boat that is unable to move through the water: the ropes that support the mast and sail have come loose and no longer support the mast, so the sail is useless ([[:en:bible:notes:isa:33:01|33:01]]) or 2) the people of Judah are no longer at war: "You have loosened the cords that supported your flagpole; the flag no longer flies" ([[:en:bible:notes:isa:33:17|33:17]]-[[:en:bible:notes:isa:33:22|22]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **mast** - tall poles that support the sail
  * **sail** - a large cloth that fills with wind and moves a boat through the water
  * **when the great spoil is divided** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "when they divide the treasure" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
