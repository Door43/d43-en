\v 20 Look at Zion, the city of our feasts; 
\q1 your eyes will see Jerusalem as a quiet habitation, a tent that will not be removed, 
\q1 whose stakes will never be pulled up or will any of its cords be broken.

\v 21 Instead,  Yahweh in majesty will be with us, in a place of broad rivers and streams. 
\q1 No warship with oars will travel it, and no large ships will sail by.

===== Translation Notes: =====
Isaiah continues to speak to the people of Judah.
  * **a tent that will not be removed** - It may be translated as a new sentence. AT: "It will be like a tent that no one will ever remove." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) 
  * **whose stakes will never be pulled up or will any of its cords be broken** - This can be translated as a new sentence. AT: "No one will ever pull up its stakes or break its cords."
  * **Yahweh in majesty will be with us, in a place of broad rivers and streams** - Here "us" refers to Isaiah and includes the people of Judah. This compares the safety of living with Yahweh to a place that has rivers around it so that enemies cannot attack them. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
