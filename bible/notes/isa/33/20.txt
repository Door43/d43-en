\v 20 At that time, you will see Mount Zion, the place where we celebrate our festivals;
\q2 You will see that Jerusalem has become a place that is calm and safe.
\q2 It will be secure,
\q1 like a tent that cannot be moved because its ropes are tight
\q2 and its stakes are firmly in the ground.
\q1

<usfm>
\q1
\v 20 Look at Zion, the city of our feasts;
\q1 your eyes will see Jerusalem as a quiet habitation, a tent that will not be removed,
\q1 whose stakes will never be pulled up nor will any of its cords be broken.
\q1
\v 21 Instead, Yahweh in majesty will be with us, in a place of broad rivers and streams.
\q1 No warship with oars will travel it, and no large ships will sail by.
