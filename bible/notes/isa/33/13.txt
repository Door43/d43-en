===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to speak.

  * **You who are far away, hear what I have done; and, you who are near, acknowledge my might** - Yahweh uses the words "far away" and "near" to mean all people. The word "might" can be expressed with the adjective "mighty." AT: "All people everywhere hear what I have done and acknowledge that I am mighty" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]] and  [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **trembling has seized the godless ones** - This speaks of the godless people trembling as if their trembling were an enemy that had seized them. AT: "the godless ones tremble are overwhelmed with trembling" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **Who among us ... burnings** - It is implied that the sinner in Zion ask these questions. AT: "They say, "Who among us ... burnings" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Who among us can sojourn with a raging fire? Who among us can sojourn with everlasting burnings?** - These rhetorial questions have basically the same meaning and emphasize that no one can live with fire. Here fire represents Yahweh's judgement. AT: "No one can live with raging fire! No one can live with everylasting burns!" or "No one can live bearing Yahweh's judgement, it is like an everlasting fire!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **sojourn** - live in a place that is not one's home
