\q1
\v 9 Therefore justice is far from us, nor does righteousness reach us. 
\q1 We wait for light, but see, darkness; we look for
brightness, but we walk in darkness.
\q1
\v 10 We grope for the wall like the blind, like those who cannot see. 
\q1 We stumble at noonday as in the twilight;
among the strong we are like dead men.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Isaiah continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **far from us**  - Here "us" refers to Isaiah and the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive|Inclusive]])
  * **We wait for light, but see, darkness; we look for brightness, but we walk in darkness**  - Both of these mean basically the same thing. This means the people are waiting for God's goodness, but it seems like he has abandoned them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **We grope for the wall like the blind…like dead men**  - This means that because God is not coming to them, they feel helpless, not finding the right path and despairing of the future, with no hope for a vibrant life. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
