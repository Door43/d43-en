===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Isaiah continues speaking.

  * **fear the name of Yahweh** - Here "name" refers to Yahweh's reputation and character. AT: "fear Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **from the west ... from the sun's rising** - Isaiah combines these words to mean people in all places of the world. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **for he will come as a rushing stream** - Narrow valleys in Judah were dry most of the year until a sudden, heavy rain turned them into fast-moving water. When that happened there was a lot of noise and wind. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **driven by the breath of Yahweh** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "which the breath of Yahweh drives" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Yahweh's declaration** - This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "declaration" is expressed as the verb "declared" or "solemnly said." See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:14:21|14:22]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what Yahweh has solemnly said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
