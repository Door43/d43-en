===== Translation Notes: =====
Isaiah continues speaking to the people of Israel.
  * **For your hands are stained with blood and your fingers with sin** - Here "hands" and "fingers" refers to their actions. This means they are guilty of doing violent and sinful things. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **they conceive trouble and give birth to sin** - This emphasizes how carefully they plan to do sinful things. Here "they" still refers to the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
