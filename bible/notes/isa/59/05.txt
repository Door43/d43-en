Isaiah continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **They hatch eggs of a poisonous snake…weave a spider's web**  - The people of Judah were so wicked that they made plans to endanger and harm others. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **Whoever eats of their eggs dies, and if an egg is crushed, it hatches into a poisonous snake**  - This means the wicked people's sins will always harm other people.
  * **if an egg is crushed**  - AT: "if someone crushes an egg" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **Their webs cannot be used for garments, nor can they cover themselves with their works**  - This means their sinful deeds cannot be covered and hidden, just as a web cannot serve as as clothing and cover someone. Their evil deeds will be exposed.
