===== translationNotes: =====

  * **is on me** - Possible meaning of "me" are 1) Isaiah the prophet or 2 another prophet or 3) the future messiah.
  * **the afflicted** - That is, the poor people, the oppressed people.
  * **liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison for those who are bound** - These two phrases mean the same thing. They state that God will certainly give freedom to captives. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
