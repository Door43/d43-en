===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The Spirit of the Lord Yahweh is on me** - "Spirit" here is the Holy Spirit of Yahweh who compels or motivates the person. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:11:01|11:2]] or in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:42:01|42:1]].
  * **the afflicted** - This refers to poor people, those in great sorrow, or oppressed people who have problems they cannot overcome by themselves.
  * **liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison for those who are bound** - These two phrases mean the same thing. They state that God will certainly give freedom to captives. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
