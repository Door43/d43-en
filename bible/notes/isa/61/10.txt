\q1
\v 10 I will greatly rejoice in Yahweh; my soul will exult in my God. 
\q1 For he has clothed me with the garments of
salvation; he has clothed me with the robe of righteousness, 
\q1 as a bridegroom adorns himself with a turban, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
\q1
\v 11 For like the earth puts forth its sprouting plants, and like the garden makes its planting grow,
\q1 so the Lord Yahweh will cause righteousness and praise to sprout up in front of all the nations.
