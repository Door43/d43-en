\q1
\v 10 I will greatly rejoice in Yahweh; my soul will exult in my God. 
\q1 For he has clothed me with the garments of
salvation; he has clothed me with the robe of righteousness, 
\q1 as a bridegroom adorns himself with a turban, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
\q1
\v 11 For as the earth produces its sprouting plants, and as the garden makes its planting grow,
\q1 so the Lord Yahweh will cause righteousness and praise to sprout up in front of all the nations.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I will greatly rejoice**  - Possible meanings are 1) "I" refers to the people of God speaking as one person, or 2) "I" refers to on of the people who mourned.
  * **my soul will exult in my God**  - AT: This points to the close relationship of the person with God. "I will be very happy because of my God" or "I will delight in my God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche|Synecdoche]])
  * **as a bridegroom adorns himself with a turban, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels**  - This emphasizes that the speaker is extremely happy, joyful, celebrating. The turban reminds one of the headdress of the priest. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
  * **turban**  - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:61:03|61:3]].
  * **For as the earth puts forth its sprouting plants, and as the garden makes its planting grow**  - This is saying the same thing in two ways for emphasis and to show that whatever God says he will do is certainly going to happen, just as seeds always sprout. It can be translated as, "Just as seeds sown in a garden sprout from the soil and grow" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]])
