===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Has Yahweh attacked Jacob and Israel as he attacked those nations who attacked them?** - The question is used to contrast the severity of God's punishment. AT: "Yahweh has certainly punished the enemy nations more severely than he punished the people of Israel." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Jacob ... Israel** - These represent the descendants of Jacob. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Have Jacob and Israel been killed as in the slaughter of those nations that were killed by them?** - This question too is used to contrast the severity of God's punishment. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh has not killed the people of Israel like they killed their enemies from other nations." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **In exact measure you have contended** - Here "you" refers to God. Yahweh punishing his people as much as they needed is spoken of as if God's punishment were something that could be measured. AT: "But you did punish them as much as was needed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **sending Jacob and Israel away** - This represents the descendants of Jacob. AT: "sending the Israelites away" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **he drove them away with his fierce breath in the day of the east wind** - Yahweh's power to send his people away to a foreign country is spoken of as if Yahweh used his breath to blow them to a foreign country. AT: "the power of Yahweh drove them out like a fierce wind from the east" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
