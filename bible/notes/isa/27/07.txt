===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Has Yahweh struck Jacob and Israel as he struck those nations who struck them**- This rhetorical question is answered with a denial. "Yahweh has not punished Israel in the same way he has punished other nations." (See Rhetorical Question) His judgement on other nations will be more severe.
  * **or have Jacob and Israel been killed as the slaughter of those nations that were killed by them?**- Same as above. (See: Doublet)
  * **In exact measure**- The punishment is carefully adjusted to the degree of the offence. "Exact measure" could also mean in moderation.
  * **sending Jacob and Israel away he drove them away with his severe wind, on the day of the east wind - **sending the people of Israel away here means Yahweh has inflicted his judgement or punishment on the people. Yahweh's power is described here as a **"**severe wind" and "east wind".  Alternate translation "Yahweh, in his great power, has punished the people of Israel"
