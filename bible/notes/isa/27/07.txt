===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Has Yahweh struck Jacob and Israel as he struck those nations who struck them** - Here "Jacob" and "Israel" refer to the people of Israel. Isaiah uses a question to answer the people of Israel who were complaining that God punished them in the same way that he punished their enemies. Isaiah emphasizes the God's punished their enemies more severely. Alternate translation: "Yahweh has certainly punished the enemy nations more severely than he punished the people of Israel"  (See [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion]])
  * **or have Jacob and Israel been killed as the slaughter of those nations that were killed by them?** - Again Isaiah emphasizes that Yahweh has not punished the people of Israel like he has their enemies. Alternate translation: "and he has not killed the people of Israel like he killed the enemies from other nations."  (See: [[en:ta:translate:doublet]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **In exact measure you have contended** - The phrase "in exact measure" means God punished them the exact amount that was needed to purify them from sin. Here "you" refers to Yahweh. Alternate translation: "But you did punish them as much as was needed" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **sending Jacob and Israel away** - This refers to the people who live in Israel. Alternate translation: "sending the people of Israel away" 
  * **he drove them away with his severe wind, on the day of the east wind ** - Isaiah describes Yahweh's power as a "severe wind" and "east wind." Alternate translation "The power of Yahweh drove them out like a severe wind from the east." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
