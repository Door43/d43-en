===== Translation Notes: =====

Isaiah is speaking. He continues to describe the people of Israel as a vineyard. (See: [[en:bible:notes:isa:27:01|27:2]])

  * **In the coming day** - AT: "In the future" or "In a time that is coming"
  * **Jacob will take root; Israel will blossom and bud** - "Jacob" and "Israel" here refer to the descendants of Jacob. In the time when God is no longer angry with them he will bless them and cause them to prosper. AT: "the descendants of Israel will prosper like a vine that has taken root and blossomed." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **they will fill the surface of the ground with fruit** - AT: "and they will fill the earth with their fruit"
