====== Isaiah 27 General Notes ======

=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of chapter 26, which is an important quotation. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Leviathan ==
This was an ancient type of dragon or serpent. It is possible that this is a reference to Satan, who is also described as a serpent and a dragon.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "That day" ==
This is a common phrase in this section of Isaiah. This chapter appears to prophesy about a time of restoration when the messiah will reign. This chapter pictures a time of great peace and harmony in the world. The translator should not add explanation, but should try to maintain the tense of the original text, as a future or uncompleted action. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:christ]], [[:en:obe:kt:fulfill]] and [[:en:obe:kt:lastday]])
