<usfm> \q1 \v 10 For the fortified city is desolate, the habitation is deserted and forsaken like the wilderness. \q1 There a the calf feeds, and there he lies down and consumes its branches. \q1 \v 11 When the boughs are withered, they will be broken off. Women will come and make fires with them, \q1 for this is not a people of understanding. \q1 Therefore their Maker will not have compassion on them, and he who made them will not be merciful to them. </usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **For the fortified city is desolate, the habitation is deserted and forsaken like the wilderness**-
The defenced city;  Jerusalem, and the rest of the defenced cities in the land, the singular number being put for the plural. \\ This city is compared to a tree, whose branches are not only gnawed and consumed by cattle, as in the former verse
  * **the calf feeds**- Here "calf" is referring to numerous cattle. (See: Synecdoche)
  * **bold words**  - and women come, without fear of trespassing, to gather them for firewood.
  * **bold words**  - set … on fire—burn them as fuel; "women" are specified, as probably it was their office to collect fuel and kindle the fire for cooking.

no understanding—as to the ways of God

  * **bold words**  -
They shall be broken off,  that there may be no hopes nor possibility of their recovery. \\  \\
The women;  he mentions women, either because it is their usual work in the country to make fires, and to gather fuel for them, or to signify that the men should be generally destroyed. \\
  * **bold words**  - By a sudden introduction of metaphor, the city becomes a tree, the prophet's thought going back, perhaps, to ver. 6. "Withered boughs" are indications of internal rottenness, and must be "broken off" to give the tree a chance of recovery.
