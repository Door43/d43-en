<usfm>
\v 10 The cities that have strong walls around them will be empty;
\q2 like the desert, they will have no one living in them.
\q1 The houses will be abandoned,
\q2 and the streets will be full of weeds.
\q1 Calves will eat grass there and lie down there;
\q2 they will chew up all the leaves on the trees.
\q1
\v 11 \add The Israelite people are like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* dry branches on a tree;
\q2 women break them off and use them to make fires \add under their cooking pots\add*.
\q1 Our Israelite people do not have any sense;
\q2 so Yahweh, who created them, will not act mercifully toward them
\q2 or be kind to them.

\q1
\v 10 For the fortified city is desolate, the habitation is deserted and forsaken like the wilderness. 
\q1 There a the calf feeds,
and there he lies down and consumes its branches.
\q1
\v 11 When the boughs are withered, they will be broken off. Women will come and make fires with them, 
\q1 for this is not a
people of understanding.

be merciful to them.
