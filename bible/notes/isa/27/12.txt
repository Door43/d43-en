\v 12 However, there will be a time when Yahweh will gather them together again; \add he will separate them from the people who have conquered them, like people\add* separate wheat from chaff. He will bring them \add back to Israel\add*, one by one, from \add the land between\add* the Euphrates River in the northeast and the brook at the border of Egypt in the southwest.
\v 13 At that time, a trumpet will be blown very loudly. And those who were exiled to Assyria and Egypt and who almost died there will return to Jerusalem, to worship Yahweh on \add Zion\add*, his holy hill.

\v 12 It will come about on that day
\q1 that Yahweh will thresh from the flowing stream of the Euphrates River, to the brook of Egypt,
\q1 and you will be gathered one by one, people of Israel.

\v 13 On that day a great trumpet will be blown;
\q1 and the perishing ones in the land of Assyria will come, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt,
 \q1 they will worship Yahweh on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.
