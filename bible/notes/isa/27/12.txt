\v 12 However, there will be a time when Yahweh will gather them together again; \add he will separate them from the people who have conquered them, like people\add* separate wheat from chaff. He will bring them \add back to Israel\add*, one by one, from \add the land between\add* the Euphrates River in the northeast and the brook at the border of Egypt in the southwest.
\v 13 At that time, a trumpet will be blown very loudly. And those who were exiled to Assyria and Egypt and who almost died there will return to Jerusalem, to worship Yahweh on \add Zion\add*, his holy hill.

He will bring them back to Israel, one by one, from the land between the Euphrates River in the northeast and the brook at the border of Egypt in the southwest.
\v 13 At that time, a trumpet will be blown very loudly. And those who were exiled to Assyria and Egypt and who almost died there will return to Jerusalem, to worship Yahweh on Zion, his holy hill.

\v 12 It will come about on that day
\q1 that Yahweh will thresh from the Euphrates River to the Wadi of Egypt
\q1 and you, the people of Israel, will be gathered together one by one.

\q1 and the perishing ones in the land of Assyria will come, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt,
\q1 they will worship Yahweh on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.
