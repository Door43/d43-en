\v 12 However, there will be a time when Yahweh will gather them together again; \add he will separate them from the people who have conquered them, like people\add* separate wheat from chaff. He will bring them \add back to Israel\add*, one by one, from \add the land between\add* the Euphrates River in the northeast and the brook at the border of Egypt in the southwest.
\v 13 At that time, a trumpet will be blown very loudly. And those who were exiled to Assyria and Egypt and who almost died there will return to Jerusalem, to worship Yahweh on \add Zion\add*, his holy hill.
