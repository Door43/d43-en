===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Who is this who comes from Edom**  - This Isaiah speaking as a watchman. The question and answer format is a way of presenting this information, but it is not to be understood literally. Isaiah did not actually see Yahweh approaching.
  * **Bozrah**  - This is the capital city of Edom. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])
  * **It is I**  - Here "I" refers to Yahweh.
