\v 15 Look down from heaven and take notice from your holy and glorious habitation. 
\q1 Where are your zeal and your mighty acts? 
\q1 Your pity and your compassionate actions are kept from us.

===== Translation Notes: =====

The people of Israel continue speaking.

  * **Where are your zeal and your mighty acts?**  - They use a question to express deep emotion and concern because it seems God is not helping them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **Your pity and your compassionate actions are kept from us**  - AT: "You keep your pity and compassion from us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
