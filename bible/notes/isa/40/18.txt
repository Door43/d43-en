===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **To whom then will you compare God? To what idol will you liken him?** - Isaish uses a rhetorical question to mock man-made craven images that the people worship. AT: "There is no one that compares to God and no man-made image can represent him." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **An idol! A craftsman casts it: the goldsmith overlays it with gold and forges silver chains for it** - An idol is traditionally made with precious metals.
