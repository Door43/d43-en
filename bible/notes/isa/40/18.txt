===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **To whom then will you compare God? To what idol will you liken him?** - Isaiah uses questions to mock the idols that the people worship. AT: "There is no one that compares to God and no idol that can represent him" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **you** - This is plural and refers to all of God's people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **A craftsman casts it: the goldsmith overlays it with gold and forges silver chains for it** - "A skilled worker forms it, another covers it with gold, and makes a silver chain for it."
