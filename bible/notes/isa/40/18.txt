\q2 and decorated with silver chains?
\q1
\v 20 A man who is poor \add cannot buy silver or gold for his idol\add*;

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **To whom then will you compare God? To what idol will you liken him?** - Isaiah uses two similar questions to emphasize that there is no idol that can compare with God. AT: "There is no one to whom you can compare God. There is no idol to which you can liken him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **you** - This is plural and refers to all of God's people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **A craftsman casts it: the goldsmith overlays it with gold and forges silver chains for it** - "A skilled worker forms it, another covers it with gold, and makes a silver chain for it"
