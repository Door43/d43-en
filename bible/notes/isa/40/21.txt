===== Translation Notes: =====
Isaiah continues speaking to God's people.
  * **Have you not known? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?** - Isaiah uses these questions to emphasize that the people should know how great God is. AT: "You certainly do know and have heard! It has been told to you from the beginning; even from when God created the earth!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **He is the one who sits above the horizon of the earth** - AT: "God rules over the entire earth."
  * **the inhabitants are like grasshoppers before him** - A grasshopper is a small insect. This emphasizes how small and weak people are before God. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **He stretches out the heavens like a curtain and spreads them out as a tent to live in** - This emphasizes God's power to create the heavens.
