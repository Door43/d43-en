===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Have you not known? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?** - Isaiah uses these rhetorical questions to emphasize that the people should know how great God is. AT: "You certainly do know and have heard! It has been told to you from the beginning; even from before God created the earth!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **He is the one who sits above the horizon of the earth** - "He" here is God. AT: "God rules over the entire earth." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **the inhabitants are like grasshoppers before him** - The people of the earth are being compared to grasshoppers. AT: "The people of the earth below are very small in his sight." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **He stretches out the heavens like a curtain and spreads them out as a tent to live in** - The heavens are compared to a thin cloth made of fine material that is placed over the people as a tent to live in.
