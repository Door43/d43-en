===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Isaiah continues speaking to God's people.

  * **Have you not known? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?** - Isaiah uses these questions to emphasize that the people should know Yahweh's greatness as the creator. AT: "You certainly know and have heard! It has been told to you from the beginning; you have understood from the foundations of the earth!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Has it not been told you from the beginning?** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Have people not told you from the beginning?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **from the foundations of the earth** - The prophet speaks of Yahweh creating the earth as if the earth were a building for which Yahweh laid the foundation. AT: "from the time that Yahweh created the earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **He is the one who sits above the horizon of the earth** - The prophet speaks of Yahweh ruling the earth as if Yahweh were seated on a throne above the earth. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the inhabitants are like grasshoppers before him** - The prophet compares the way Yahweh considers humans to the way humans would consider grasshoppers. Just as grasshoppers are small to humans, humans are small and weak before God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **He stretches out the heavens like a curtain and spreads them out as a tent to live in** - These two lines share similar meanings. The prophet speaks of Yahweh creating the heavens as if he had erected a tent in which to live. AT: "He spreads out the heavens as easily as a person would stretch out a curtain or erect a tent in which to live" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
