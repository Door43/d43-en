  * **Have you not known? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?** - Isaiah uses these questions to emphasize that the people should know how great God is. AT: "You certainly do know and have heard! It has been told to you from the beginning; even from when God created the earth!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **He is the one who sits above the horizon of the earth** - "God rules over the entire earth"
  * **the inhabitants are like grasshoppers before him** - A grasshopper is a small insect. This emphasizes how small and weak people are before God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **He stretches out the heavens like a curtain and spreads them out as a tent to live in** - This emphasizes God's power to create the heavens.
