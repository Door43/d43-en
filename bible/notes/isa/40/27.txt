\v 27 Why do you say, Jacob, and declare, Israel,
\q1 "My way is hidden from Yahweh, and my God is not concerned about my vindication?"

\v 28 Have you not known? Have you not heard?
\q1 The everlasting God, Yahweh, the Creator of the ends of the earth,

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Why do you say, Jacob, and declare, Israel ... vindication?** - These two phrases mean the same thing and emphasize that all of Israel is included. The question emphasizes that they should not say what they say. AT: "Why do you say, O people of Israel ... vindication?" or "You should not say, O people of Israel ... vindication'." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **My way is hidden from Yahweh, and my God is not concerned about my vindication** - "Yahweh does not see us. He is not concerned to clear our blame" ([[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Have you not known? Have you not heard?** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:40:21|40:21]].
