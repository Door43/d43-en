===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Why do you say, Jacob and declare, Israel** - This says the same thing twice for emphasis. AT: "Why do you say, O people of Israel." Isaiah uses a question for emphasis. AT: "You should not say, O people of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **My way is hidden from Yahweh, and my God is not concerned about my vindication** - "Yahweh does not see us. He is not concerned to clear our blame"
  * **Have you not known? Have you not heard?** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:isa:40:21|40:21]].
