\v 3 A voice cries out, 
\q1 "In the wilderness prepare the way of Yahweh;
\q1 make straight in the desert a highway for our God." 
\q1
\v 4 Every valley will be lifted up, and every mountain and hill will be leveled; 
\q1 and the rugged land will be made level, and the
rough places a plain;
\q1 
\v 5 and the glory of Yahweh will be revealed, and all people will see it together; for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it.
