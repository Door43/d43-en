===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **He reduces rulers to nothing and makes the rulers of the earth insignificant** - "He" here is God. "God reduces the rulers to nothing, making them worth nothing"
  * **they are barely planted…they are barely sown…they have barely taken root in the earth** - The rulers are being compared to a seed or seedling that is not placed firmly in the ground.
