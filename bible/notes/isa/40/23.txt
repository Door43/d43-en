\q2 but then \add he gets rid of them\add*

<usfm>
\q1
\v 23 He reduces rulers to nothing and makes the rulers of the earth insignificant.
\q1
\v 24 See, they are barely planted; see, they are barely sown; see, they have barely taken root in the earth,
\q1 before he blows upon them, and they wither, and the wind blows them away like straw.

  * [[:en:obe:other:sow]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He reduces** - "God reduces"
  * **they are barely planted ... they have barely taken root in the earth** - Isaiah compares the rulers to a seed that is not planted firmly in the ground. This emphasizes they are insignificant before God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the wind blows them away like straw** - This emphasizes that God can easily defeat human rulers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
