\q1
\v 24 They start to rule, like small plants start to grow and form roots;
\q2 but then \add he gets rid of them\add*
\q2 as though \f + \ft metaphor \f* they withered when he blew on them,

<usfm>
\q1
\v 23 He reduces rulers to nothing and makes the rulers of the earth insignificant.
\q1
\v 24 See, they are barely planted; see, they are barely sown; see, they have barely taken root in the earth,
\q1 before he blows upon them, and they wither, and the wind blows them away like straw.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He reduces** - "Yahweh reduces"
  * **See ... see ... see** - These words add emphasis to what follows.
  * **they are barely planted ... and they wither** - The prophet speaks of rulers being helpless before Yahweh as if they were new plants that wither away when a hot wind blows on them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **they are barely planted ... they are barely sown** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and refer to the point at which the plants or seeds are placed into the ground. They can be stated in active form. AT: "as soon as someone plants them ... as soon as someone sows them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **he blows upon them** - The prophet speaks of Yahweh removing the rulers from power as if Yahweh were a scorching wind that blows upon the plants and causes them to wither. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the wind blows them away like straw** - This simile extends the metaphor of the rulers as plants and Yahweh as the wind that causes them to wither. The wind of Yahweh's judgement will remove the withered plants as easily as wind blows away straw. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
