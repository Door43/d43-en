===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Who has measured ... or the hills in a balance?** - These rhetorical questions anticipate a negative answer and emphasize that only Yahweh is able to do these things. AT: "No one but Yahweh has measured ... and the hills in a balance." (See: [[ en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **measured the waters in the hollow of his hand** - Yahweh knowing how much water is in the oceans is spoken of as if Yahweh held the water in his hand. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **measured the span of the sky** - Yahweh knowing the length of the sky is spoken of as if he measured it with his hand. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **held the dust of the earth in a basket** - Yahweh knowing how much dust there is on the earth is spoken of as if he carried it in a basket. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **weighed the mountains in scales, or the hills in a balance?** - Yahweh knowing how heavy the mountains are is spoken of as if he weighed them in scales and balances. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
