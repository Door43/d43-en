===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Isaiah describes what the world will be like when the Messiah comes. The references to the animals here, natural enemies of each other but who are now living in peace, are to all such animals. For example, the expression "the wolf" means all wolves, not only a certain one. The picture of these animals living together is a very powerful image of complete peace that the Messiah will bring when he comes to rule. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_genericnoun]])

  * **leopard** - a large cat with yellow fur and black spots that kills and eats other animals
  * **the calf, the young lion and the fattened calf, together** - The context makes it clear that these animals will be together. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **bear** - a very large animal with thick hair and sharp claws that kills and eats other animals
