<usfm>
\q1
\v 3 His delight will be the fear of the Lord; 
\q1 he will not judge by what his eyes see, nor decide by
what his ears hear.
\q1
\v 4 Instead, he will judge the poor with righteousness and decide fairly for the humble of the earth. 
\q1 He will strike the
earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he will  slay the wicked.
\q1
\v 5 Righteousness will be the belt of his waist, and faithfulness the belt around his hips.
