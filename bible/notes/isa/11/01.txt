===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **A shoot will sprout from the root of Jesse, and a branch out of his root will bear fruit** - This compares the family of king David to a tree that someone cut down. This tree will start to grow again and produce fruit. This emphasizes that though the descendants of David were sinful and God had to punish them, one day a descendant of David will be king again. This speaks of the coming Messiah or Christ. (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
  * **The Spirit of Yahweh will rest upon him** - Here "him" refers to the Messiah.
