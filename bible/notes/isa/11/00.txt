====== Isaiah 11 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Messiah ==
The prophecies of this chapter focus on the coming messiah. Some of these prophecies concern the first coming of Jesus, while some reference a future day of restoration. The author transitions between these time periods without telling his reader. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]], [[:en:obe:kt:christ]] and [[:en:obe:kt:restore]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Ambiguity ==
It is uncertain what period of time these prophecies refer to or who will fulfill them. The translator should allow this uncertainty and ambiguity to remain. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:fulfill]])
