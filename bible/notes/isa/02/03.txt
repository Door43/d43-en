===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **he will teach us some of his ways, and we may walk in his paths** - "he will teach us his will so that we may obey him"
  * **for out of Zion will go the law** - "for the law will go out from Zion." Alternate translations: "They will teach the law in Zion" or "they will hear the law in Zion"
  * **and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem** - "and the word of Yahweh will go out from Jerusalem" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]]) They will proclaim Yahweh's message in Jerusalem.
  * **for out of Zion will go the law, and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem** - "People in Zion will teach God's law, and people in Jerusalem  will teach the word of Yahweh." These phrases mean the same thing. Isaiah was emphasizing that all nations will understand that the truth is found in Jerusalem. (See:[[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
