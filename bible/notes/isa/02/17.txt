===== Translation Notes: =====
Isaiah continues to describe what will happen on the day of Yahweh.

  * **The pride of man will be brought low and the haughtiness of men will fall** - Both of these phrases mean basically the same thing and are used for emphasis. This could be translated with an active verb:  “He will make every prideful person humble." (See: [[en:ta:translate:doublet]] and [[en:ta:translate:active]])
  * **Yahweh alone will be exalted** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:isa:02:09|2:11]].
  * **The idols will completely pass away** - "All idols will disappear" (UDB) or "There will be no more idols"
  * **from before the terror of Yahweh, and from the splendor of his majesty** - See how this was translated in [[en:bible:notes:isa:02:09|2:10]].
  * **when he rises to terrify the earth** - This can be translated as "when Yahweh causes the people of the earth  to be terribly afraid of him."
