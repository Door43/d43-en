  * **General Information:** - Isaiah continues to describe what will happen on the day of Yahweh.

  * **The pride of man will be brought low and the haughtiness of men will fall** - These phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that Yahweh will humble every proud person. This can be stated in active form. AT: "He will make every prideful person humble" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
