====== Isaiah 02 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 2:2-3:26, which is a vision Isaiah receives. These are the words of Yahweh.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Latter days ==
This is probably a reference to the "last days." This makes parts of this prophecy reference events near the end of this world. Most scholars expect these prophecies to be fulfilled by Jesus. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:lastday]], [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:obe:kt:fulfill]])

== Idolatry ==
While the first prophecy of Isaiah concerned the lack of justice in Judah, this chapter focuses on the presence of idolatry in Judah. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:justice]])
