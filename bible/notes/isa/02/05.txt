===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In 2:5 Isaiah was speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **General Information:** - In 2:6 Isaiah was speaking to God.

  * **House of Jacob** - "You descendants of Jacob" (UDB) or "You people of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **come** - a gentle encouragement to do what the speaker is about to tell the hearer to do
  * **let us walk in the light of Yahweh** - Isaiah speaks of people learning and then doing what Yahweh wants them to do as if they were walking at night with a lamp that Yahweh has provided so they can see the path. AT: "let us learn how Yahweh wants us to live and then live that way" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For you have abandoned your people** - "For you have rejected your people" or "For you have left your people." Here the word "you" refers to Yahweh. 
  * **they are filled with customs from the east** - "they act like the people who live in lands east of Israel and do not know God"
  * **omen readers** - "soothsayers" or "diviners." This refers to people who claim to know what will happen the future.
  * **and they shake hands with sons of foreigners** - Clasping hands together is the symbol of friendship and agreement. AT: "they make agreements with people who are not from Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the craftsmanship of their own hands, things that their own fingers have made** - These two phrases mean the same thing and emphasize that these are not real gods. AT: "things that they themselves have made" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
