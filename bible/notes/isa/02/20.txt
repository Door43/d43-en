\q1
\v 20 On that day people will  throw away their idols of silver and of gold
\q1 that they have made for themselves to worship—they will throw them away to the moles and bats.
\q1
\v 21 The people will go into the caves of the rocks and into the clefts of the ragged rocks, 
\q1 from the terror of Yahweh and from the glory of his majesty, when he rises to terrify the earth.
\q1
\v 22 Stop trusting in man, whose life-breath is in his nostrils, 
\q1 for what does he amount to?

===== Translation Notes: =====
Isaiah continues to describe what will happen on the day of Yahweh.

  * **to the moles and bats** - Moles are small animals that dig and live underground. Bats are small flying animals that sometimes live in caves. Alternate translation: "to the animals." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **from the terror of Yahweh and from the glory of his majesty** - See how this was translated in [[en:bible:notes:isa:02:09|2:10]].
  * **when he rises to terrify the earth** - See how this was translated in [[en:bible:notes:isa:02:17|2:19]].
  * **whose life-breath is in his nostrils** - This means that humans are weak. We rely on breathing, and if we do not breathe, we will die. Alternate translation: "who are mortal and will die." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **for what does he amount to** - Isaiah uses a question to remind the people of something they should already know. Alternate translation: "Man amounts to nothing!" or "Man is not worth anything" or "How can people help you?" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
