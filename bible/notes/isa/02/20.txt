\v 20 On that day people will  throw away their idols of silver and of gold
\q1 that they have made for themselves to worship—they will throw them away to the moles and bats.
\q1
\v 21 to go into the caves of the rocks and into the clefts of the ragged rocks, 
\q1 from before the terror of Yahweh and from the glory of his majesty, when he rises to terrify the earth.
\q1

\q1 for why what does he amount to?

  * **stop trusting in man** - The summary of the whole chapter. Only trust Yahweh.
  * **whose life-breath is in his nostrils** - This is a metaphor. Man is only something that can breathe. (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
