\q1
\v 21 Then they will crawl into caves
\q2 and hide in holes in the cliffs.
\q1 They will try to escape from Yahweh, who is coming to punish them;
\q2 They will fear what he will do because he is glorious and awesome,
\q2 when he comes to come to terrify the people on the earth.

\q1
\v 20 On that day people will throw away their idols of silver and of gold
\q1 that they have made for themselves to worship—they will throw them away to the moles and bats.
\q1
\v 21 The people will go into the crevices in the rocks and into the clefts of the ragged rocks,
\q1 from the terror of Yahweh and from the glory of his majesty, when he rises to terrify the earth.
\q1
\v 22 Stop trusting in man, whose life-breath is in his nostrils,
\q1 for what does he amount to?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Isaiah speaks to the people of Judah in the form of a poem. He continues to describe what will happen on the day of Yahweh of Hosts ([[:en:bible:notes:isa:02:12|2:12]]). (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **to the moles and bats** - Moles are small animals that dig and live underground. Bats are small flying animals that sometimes live in caves. AT: "to the animals" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **the crevices in the rocks ... the clefts of the ragged rocks** - If your language does not have two different words for "crevice" and "cleft," the space that appears between the two parts of a rock when it splits, you can combine these two phrases into one.
  * **from the terror of Yahweh** - because they are very afraid of Yahweh. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:02:17|2:19]].
  * **the glory of his majesty** - "the great beauty and power he has as king" or "his royal majesty." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:02:09|2:10]].
  * **when he rises to terrify the earth** - "when Yahweh takes action and causes the people of the earth to be terribly afraid of him." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:02:17|2:19]].
  * **whose life-breath is in his nostrils** - The nose is weak and nostrils are not beautiful, so the nose is a metonym for people, who are weak. AT: "who is weak and will die" or "who needs the breath in his nose to live"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **nostrils** - the holes in the nose through which people breathe
  * **for what does he amount to?** - Isaiah uses a question to remind the people of something they should already know. This question can be translated as a statement. AT: "for man amounts to nothing!" or "for man is not worth anything!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
