===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **against everyone who is proud and raised up, and against everyone who arrogant** - The words "proud, "raised up," and "arrogant" all mean the same thing. Alternate translation: "against every person who is proud."
  * **and he will be brought down** - "and every proud person will be brought down." This can be translated with an active verb: "Yahweh will humble him." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **and against the cedars of Lebanon…the oaks of Bashan** - The "day of Yahweh of Hosts" will be against the cedars and oaks. Possible meanings are 1) these trees refer to the proud people that God will judge or 2) God will actually destroy these mighty trees.
