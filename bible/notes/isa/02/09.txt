===== Translation Notes: =====

In 2:9 Isaiah was speaking to God. In 2:10-11 Isaiah was speaking to the people.

  * **The people will be bowed down, and individuals will fall down**  - The phrases "the people" and "individuals" used together means "all people." Alternate translation: "Every person will be made to bow down and be humbled." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **therefore do not forgive them**  - Here Isaiah is talking to Yahweh.
  * **Go into the rocky places**  - Here Isaiah is again talking to the people of Judah.
  * **hide in the ground**  - "hide in the holes in the ground"
  * **from the terror of Yahweh**  - Alternate translations: "to get away from Yahweh's terrifying presence" or "from Yahweh because you will be extremely afraid of him"
  * **the glory of his majesty**  - Alternate translation: "his awesome power" or "his great power"
  * **The lofty gaze of man will be brought low, and the pride of men will be brought down**  - Both of these phrases mean basically the same thing and are used for emphasis. This could be translated with an active verb: “He will make every prideful person humble." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Yahweh alone will be exalted**  - This can be translated with an active verb: "people will praise only Yahweh."
  * **on that day**  - This refers to the time when Yahweh will judge all people. Translation alternate: “on the day that Yahweh comes to judge everyone.” (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
