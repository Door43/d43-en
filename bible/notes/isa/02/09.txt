===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In 2:9 Isaiah speaks to God. In 2:10-11 Isaiah speaks to the people.

  * **The people will be bowed down, and individuals will fall down** - The phrases used together mean the same thing and are used together for emphasis. This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will make every person bow down and be humble" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **therefore do not accept them** - Here Isaiah is talking to Yahweh.
  * **Go into the rocky places** - Possible meanings are the people should go into 1) caves on steep hillsides (see UDB) or 2) places where there are many large rocks among which to hide.
  * **hide in the ground** - Possible meanings are that the people should hide 1) in natural holes in the ground or 2) in pits that they dig in the ground (see UDB).
  * **from the terror of Yahweh** - This can be reworded so that the noun "terror" is expressed by "terrifying." AT: "to get away from Yahweh's terrifying presence" or "from Yahweh because you will be extremely afraid of him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]]) 
  * **the glory of his majesty** - "his awesome power" or "his great power"
  * **The lofty gaze of man will be brought low** - "Yahweh will bring down the lofty gaze of man." A man with a "lofty gaze" is looking above everyone to show them that he is better than they are. Here all people are guilty of thinking they are better than Yahweh, and the way they look at those who worship Yahweh is a metonym for their pride. "Yahweh will make ashamed all people because they think they are better than he is" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the pride of men will be brought down**
  * **Yahweh alone will be exalted** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "people will praise only Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **on that day** - This refers to the time when Yahweh will judge all people. AT: "on the day that Yahweh comes to judge everyone" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
