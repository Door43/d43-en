<usfm>
\v 10 But it will be Yahweh's will that he be afflicted and caused to suffer. When he dies as an offering for your own sin,
\q2 he will benefit many, many people, as if they were his children;
\q2 he will live a long time after he dies and becomes alive again,
\q2 and he will accomplish everything that Yahweh has planned.
\q2
\v 11 When he sees all that he will accomplish because of his suffering,
\q1 he will be satisfied.
\q2 And because of what will have happened to him, Yahweh's righteous servant,
\q1 he will cause the guilt of many people to be ended,
\q2 because he will bear the guilt for their sins.

\q1
\v 10 Yet it was Yahweh's will to crush him and make him ill. When he makes his life an offering for sin,
\q1 he will see his offspring, he will prolong his days, and Yahweh's purpose will be accomplished through him.
\q1
\v 11 After the suffering of his life, he will see light and be satisfied by his knowledge.
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa After the suffering of his life \fqa* , some modern versions have \fqa From the suffering of his life he will see the result \fqa* . \f*
\q1 My righteous servant will justify many; he will bear their iniquities.
\f + \ft Many modern versions supply \fqa light \fqa* . Some modern versions have \fqa By his knowledge, my righteous servant will justify many \fqa* . \f*
