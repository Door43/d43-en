===== Translation Notes: =====

Isaiah continues speaking to the people in exile in Babylonia, describing Yahweh's servant. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:isa:53:01|53:1-2]])

  * **He was oppressed**  - AT: "They treated him harshly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **he did not open his mouth**  - AT: "he did not protest" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
  * **as a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and as a sheep that before its shearers is silent**  - Isaiah compares the servant to a lamb and a sheep to emphasize that he will remain silent as people harm and humiliate him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
  * **as a lamb that is led to the slaughter**  - AT: "just as a lamb is silent as a person slaughters it"
