===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues describing his servant.

  * **Therefore will I give him his portion among the multitudes, and he will divide the spoils with the many** - These two clauses mean basically the same thing. "Portion" and "spoils" refer to a king after a victorious battle sharing the plunder or rewards with his army. This means God will greatly honor his servant because of his sacrifice. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the multitudes** - Many versions interpret this expression as "the many" or "the strong."
  * **because he exposed himself to death** - "Exposed" means to be vulnerable or unprotected. The servant of Yahweh put himself in a situation where he would die. AT: "he willingly accepted the possibility of death" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **was numbered with the transgressors** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "allowed people to treat him as a criminal" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
