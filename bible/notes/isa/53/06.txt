===== Translation Notes: =====

Isaiah continues speaking to the people in exile in Babylonia, describing Yahweh's servant. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:isa:53:01|53:1-2]])

  * **We all like sheep have gone astray**  - Sheep often leave the path on which the shepherd leads them. Isaiah means that every person has done what God commands not to do. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
  * **the iniquity of us all**  - Our "iniquity" here represents the punishment for our sin. AT: "the punishment for the sin of every one of us." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
