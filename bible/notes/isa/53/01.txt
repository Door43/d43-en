===== Translation Notes: =====

Here Isaiah describes events that will happen in the future as if they happened in the past. This emphasizes that they certainly will happen.

  * **Who would have believed what we heard?**  - What Isaiah just found out is so amazing that he wonders if the exiles will believe it. The "we" includes him and those in exile. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive|Inclusive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **Who would have believed**  - This question is like the one above, expressing surprise.
  * **And the arm of Yahweh, to whom was it revealed?**  - AT: "And to whom has Yahweh revealed his power?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **For he grew up before Yahweh like a sapling, and like a sprout out of parched earth**  - Here "he" refers to God's servant whom Isaiah compares to a very young tree. This emphasizes that he will appear weak. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
