===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The path of the righteous is level ... the path of the righteous you make straight** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. People obeying Yahweh is spoken of as if they were walking on his path. Yahweh ensuring the people that what they do is right is spoken of as if he were making the path level and straight for them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in the path of your judgments, Yahweh, we wait for you** - Doing what Yahweh judged to be right is spoken of walking on his path. AT: "We wait for you, Yahweh, as we continue to do what you judged to be right" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **of your judgments** - "of your laws" or "of your teachings"
  * **we wait** - Here "we" refers to Isaiah and all righteous people who are speaking to Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]]) 
  * **your name and your reputation are our desire** - Here "name" and "reputation" refer to the person of God. AT: "your name and your reputation are our only desire" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
