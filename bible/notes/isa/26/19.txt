===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Your dead will live** - Here "your" refers to Yahweh. This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "dead" is expressed as the verb "have died." AT: "Your people who have died will live again." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **our dead bodies** - Here "our" refers to Isaiah and all the righteous people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
  * **for your dew is the dew of herbs** - Yahweh's grace will fall on the people like spring dew that revives plants after the "death" of winter. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and the earth will drop the dead, its prey** - "and the earth will release the dead to live again"
