===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Your dead will live** - This can be reworded so that the nominal adjective "dead" is expressed as the verb "have died." AT: "Your people who have died will live again" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]])
  * **Your dead** - Possible meanings are 1) "Your" refers to Yahweh or 2) "Your" refers to the people of Israel. If you choose option two you could translate it as "Our dead."
  * **our dead bodies** - Here "our" refers to Isaiah and the people of Israel. If you translate this as Isaiah speaking to Yahweh you would need to use an exclusive "our." If you translate this as Isaiah speaking to the people of Israel you would need to use an inclusive "our." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
  * **Awake** - This speaks of dead people coming back to life as if they were waking up from sleep. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **those who settle down in the dust** - This is a polite way of referring to those who have died. AT: "those who are dead and buried" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **for your dew is the dew of light** - Yahweh acting kindly towards his people and bringing them back to life is spoken of as if it were the dew that causes the plants to live. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **for your dew** - Possible meanings are 1) "your" refers to Yahweh and this is the dew that Yahweh gives or 2) "your" refers to the people of Israel and this is the dew they receive from Yahweh.
  * **dew of light** - Possible meanings are 1) "light" refers to Yahweh's power to make dead people alive again, or 2) "light" refers to the morning time when dew is on the plants. 1) AT: "dew from Yahweh" or 2) AT: "dew in the morning"
  * **the earth will bring forth its dead** - "the earth will give birth to those who died." Yahweh causing dead people to come back to life is spoken of as if the earth would give birth to those who have died. AT: "and Yahweh will cause those who have died to rise from the earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
