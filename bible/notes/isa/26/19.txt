===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Your dead will live; our dead bodies will arise** - This is saying the same thing in two different ways for emphasis. This can be translated as "Yahweh's people will come back to life again." (See: Doublet)
    * **dwellers in the dust** - This is referring to the dead bodies that are in the graves. Alternate translation: "You whose bodies lie in graves." (UDB)
    * **for your dew is the dew of herbs** - Yahweh's light will be like the morning dew that falls on the graves of the dead. 
    * **and the earth will drop the dead, its prey** - "and you who are dead will live again"
