===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Isaiah continues to compare the suffering of the people of Judah to a woman giving birth. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:isa:26:16|26:16-17]]) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **but it is as if we have only given birth to wind** -  This is a simile that emphasizes that the people's suffering resulted in nothing. AT: "but nothing good resulted from it" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **We have not brought salvation to the earth** - This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "salvation" is expressed as the verb "save." AT: "We have not saved the earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **and the inhabitants of the world have not fallen** - "nor have we caused the world to fall"
