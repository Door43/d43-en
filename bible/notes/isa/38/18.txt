===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **For Sheol does not thank you; death does not praise you** - The words "Sheol" and "death" are used to substitute for "dead people." Dead people cannot sing praise to Yahweh. (See: Metonymy)
    * **Those who go down into the pit do not hope in your trustworthiness**  - He continues to talk about the dead people and says, "those who have descended to their graves cannot expect you to faithfully do things for them."
