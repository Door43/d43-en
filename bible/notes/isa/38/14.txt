===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **Like a swallow I chirp; I coo like a dove** - Hezekiah says he is in a disturbed state of mind probably due to his resent illness. Hence he says that he was chirping like a swallow and cooing like a dove.
  * **I am oppressed** - "I am troubled"
  * **What shall I say?** - Hezekiah is not expecting an answer when he asks this question. He is distressed and asks "What can I ask yahweh and expect an answer for?" It was Yahweh who had made him ill. (See: Rhetorical Question)
  * **I will walk slowly all my years** - "I will live humbly during my remaining years"
