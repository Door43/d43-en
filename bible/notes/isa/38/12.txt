===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **My dwelling is removed and carried away from me like a shepherd’s tent**  - Hezekiah continues to write his prayer and compares his life being taken away to a tent that is taken away quickly by a shepherd who must move quickly to a new pasture. This can be translated as, "It is as if my life had been taken away like a shepherd quickly packs his tent to move to a new place " (See: Simile)
  * **I have rolled up my life like a weaver; you are cutting me off from the loom**  - This is also a Simile that compares a weaver who rolls up the finished cloth and cuts off the threads that were woven into the loom to the quick and final ending of Hezekiah's life.
  * **Like a lion he breaks all my bones**  - This is comparing his pain to the pain caused as though he were being torn apart by lions. This can be translated as, "But my pain was as though I were being torn apart by lions." (See: Metaphor)
