\v 25 Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies, also says, "Shebna is like a peg that is firmly fastened to the wall. But there will be a time when I will remove him from his position; he will lose his power, and everything that he promoted will fail." That will surely happen because Yahweh has said it.

===== Translation Notes: =====
This continues the imagery from the previous verses. (See: [[en:bible:notes:isa:22:23|22:23-24]])

  * **declaration of Yahweh of hosts** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:isa:14:21|14:22]].
  * **the peg driven in a firm place...will be cut off** - This compares Shebna to a peg. This emphasizes that Shebna thought his authority was secure but God will remove him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
