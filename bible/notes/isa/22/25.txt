\v 25 Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, also says, "Shebna is like a peg that is firmly fastened to the wall. But there will be a time when I will remove him from his position; he will lose his power, and everything that he promoted will fail." That will surely happen because Yahweh has said it.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This continues the imagery from the previous verses. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:isa:22:23|22:23-24]])

  * **On that day** - Here "day" represents a period of time in general. AT: "At that time" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **declaration of Yahweh of hosts** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:14:21|14:22]].
  * **the peg driven in a firm place ... will be cut off** - Yahweh causing Shebna to lose his authority in the king's palace is spoken of as if Shebna were a peg in the wall that breaks off and falls to the ground. This emphasizes that Shebna thought his authority was secure but God will remove him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the weight that was on it will be cut off** - Here "weight" represents Shebna's power and authority. It is spoken of as if it were an object hanging on the peg that represents Shebna. Yahweh causing Shebna to lose his power and authority is spoken of as if someone were to cut off the object that was hanging on the peg. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
