===== Translation Notes: =====
Isaiah continues to speak God's message to Shebna.
  * **He will surely wind you round and round, and toss you like a ball into a vast country** - This compares the enemy army taking Shebna as captive to a foreign land to God throwing him like a ball. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **You will be pulled down** - AT: "I will bring you down from your honored position" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
