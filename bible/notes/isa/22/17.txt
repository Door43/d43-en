He will surely wind you round and round, and toss you like a ball into a vast country** – Yahweh will deal very roughly with Shebna by removing him and deporting him to a foreign land where he will die. Yahweh will throw him like he would toss a ball. (See: [[en:ta:translate:simile]])

  * **I will thrust you from your office and from your station. You will be pulled down** – “I will force your removal from your present position”
