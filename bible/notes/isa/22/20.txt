Isaiah continues to speak God's message to Shebna.
  * **Eliakim ... Hilkiah** - These are names of men. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **sash** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:isa:03:18|3:20]].
  * **into his hand** - AT: "to him"
  * **He will be a father** - This emphasizes that Eliakim will care for and protect the people of Judah. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will place the key of the house of David on his shoulder** - Here "key" refers to authority. AT: "I will put him in charge of the king's palace" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
