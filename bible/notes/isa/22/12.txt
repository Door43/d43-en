====== Isaiah 22:12-14 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels told you to weep and mourn;
\q2 he told you to shave your heads and to wear rough sackcloth
\q1 to show that you were sorry for the sins that you had committed
\q1
\v 13 But instead of doing that, you were happy and celebrating;
\q1 you slaughtered cattle and sheep,
\q2 \add in order to cook their\add* meat and eat it and drink wine.
\q1 You said, "Let's eat and drink \add all that we want to\add*,
\q2 because it is possible that we will die tomorrow!"
\p
\v 14 So the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels revealed this to me: "I will never forgive my people for sinning like this!"
