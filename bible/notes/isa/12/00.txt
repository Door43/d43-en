====== Isaiah 12 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "That day" ==
The time of this day is unclear. It may be a time in the near future for Isaiah, or a time in the distant future for him. In the latter case, it would reference the last days. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:lastday]])


=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Tense ==
Extra care must be taken in translating the tense of this chapter. The author talks about the future, but frequently changes to speak in the present tense. Some languages will have difficulty speaking in this way.
