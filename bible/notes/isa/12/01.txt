===== Translation Notes: =====

Here Isaiah continues to describe what it will be like when the Branch of Jesse comes. (See: [[en:bible:notes:isa:11:01|11:1-2]])

  * **On that day** - "On the day when God saves his people and brings them home" 
  * **you will say** - The word "you" refers to the people of Israel, but Isaiah includes himself as part of Israel. AT: "we will say."
  * **I will give thanks to you, Yahweh. For though you were angry with me, your wrath has turned away, and you have comforted me** - AT: "We praise and thank you, Yahweh. Now your anger is gone and you comfort us."
