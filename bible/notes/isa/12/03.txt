===== Translation Notes: =====

Here Isaiah continues to describe what it will be like when the Branch of Jesse comes. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:isa:11:01|11:1-2]])

  * **With joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation** - The word "you" refers to the people of Israel, but Isaiah includes himself as part of Israel.  AT: "We will be refreshed as with water because God has rescued us." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **call upon his name** - Here "name" refers to Yahweh. AT: "speak loudly to Yahweh and praise him" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **declare his deeds among the peoples, proclaim that his name is exalted** - "tell everyone in the world what Yahweh has done and that he is great"
