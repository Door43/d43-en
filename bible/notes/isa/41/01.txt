===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Listen before me in silence** - Here "me" refers to God.

  * **renew their strength** - "regain their courage"
  * **let them come near and speak; let us come near together to argue a dispute** - “then let them come near so they may speak and reason with me” (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Who stirred up this one from the east? Who calls him in good order to his service?** - Yahweh uses questions to emphasize he is in control of all nations. AT: “I am the one who called this powerful ruler from the east and put him in my good service” (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **He hands nations over to him** - "I give the nations over to the one from the east"
