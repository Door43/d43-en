\v 1 Yahweh says, "You people who live on islands in the ocean,
\q2 be silent in front of me while I ask you some questions!

\q2 We will meet together and decide which one of us is right.
\q1
\v 2 Who has raised up this king to come from the east?
\q1 He is the one who does what is right with every step. He hands nations over to him and he defeats them,
\q2 and he tramples their kings under his feet.
\q1 He cuts their enemies and they are destroyed so they are like the dust,  
\q2 and his army shoots them with bows and arrows so that they are like the chaff when the wind blows.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Listen before me in silence** - Here "me" refers to God.
  * **you coastlands** - This refers to the people who live on the islands and in the lands bordering or beyond the Mediterranean Sea. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
  * **renew their strength** - See how you translated this phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:40:29|40:31]].
  * **let them come near and speak; let us come near together to argue a dispute** - These two phrases share similar meanings. The second explains the reason for the first. AT: "then let them come near so they may speak and reason with me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Who has stirred up one from the east, calling him in righteousness to his service?** - Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that he is the one who caused this ruler from the east to be victorious. AT: "I am the one who called this powerful ruler from the east and put him in my good service." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **He hands nations over to him** - "I give the nations over to him" or "The one who does these things hands nations over to him"
  * **He turns them to dust with his sword, like windblown stubble with his bow** - Turning them to dust and stubble is a metaphor or exaggeration for completely destroying everything the people of these nations have made. The armies of one from the east will conquer these nations and scatter the people easily. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
