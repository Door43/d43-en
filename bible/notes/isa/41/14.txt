===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **Jacob you worm, and you men of Israel** - Here "Jacob" and "men of Israel" mean the same thing. AT: "you people of Israel who are like worms" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Jacob you worm** - Possible meanings are 1) that this refers to the opinions of other nations regarding the people of Israel or 2) that this refers to Israel's own opinion of themselves. Yahweh speaks of their insignificance as if they were a worm. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:30:01|30:1]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **Holy One of Israel** - Translate this phrase in the same way you did in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:01:04|1:4]].
  * **I am making you like a sharp threshing sledge ... you will make the hills like chaff** - Yahweh speaks of enabling Israel to defeat their enemies as if he were making the nation a threshing sledge that will level mountains. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a sharp threshing sledge** - A threshing sledge was a board with sharp spikes that someone would drag over the wheat to separate the grain from the chaff.
  * **two-edged** - This refers to the edges of the spikes that were attached to the threshing sledge. That they are "two-edged" means that they are very sharp.
  * **you will thresh the mountains and crush them** - This is a double metaphor. The mountains are a metaphor for grain, and threshing grain is a metaphor for the Israelites defeating the powerful enemy nations near them. AT: "you will thresh your enemies and crush them as if they were grain, even though they appear to be as strong as mountains" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **you will make the hills like chaff** - The hills are a metaphor for the powerful enemy nations near Israel. People having the wind blow the chaff away after they have threshed the grain is a metaphor for them allowing Yahweh to destroy their enemies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
