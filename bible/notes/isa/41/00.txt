====== Isaiah 41 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this, which is an extended quotation.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Mocking ==
Yahweh tells the people to present their case or their best arguments for the idols. It is challenge to the people. Yahweh mocks or insults these false gods because they are not real and have no power. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod]])
