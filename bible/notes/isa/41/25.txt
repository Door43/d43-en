\q1
\v 25 I have raised up one from the north, and he comes; from the sun's rising I summon him who calls on my name,
\q1 and he will trample the rulers like mud, like a potter who is treading on the clay.

\v 26 Who announced this from the beginning, that we might know? And before time, that we may say,
"He is right"?
\q1 Indeed none of them decreed it, yes, none heard you say anything.
