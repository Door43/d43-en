===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues speaking.
  * **The isles** - You can translate "isles" the same way you did "coastlands" in [[en:bible:notes:isa:41:01|41:1]].
  * **anvil** - an iron block on which a person shapes metal with a hammer
  * **They fasten it with nails so it will not topple over.** - Here "it" refers to the idol which they are repairing because they think it will protect them from Yahweh.
