===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking.

  * **you whom I am bringing back from the ends of the earth, and whom I called from the far away places** - These two lines mean basically the same thing and emphasize that Yahweh is bringing the people of Israel back to their land from distant countries. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **the ends of the earth** - The places on the earth that are very far away are spoken of as if they were the places where the earth ends. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:41:05|41:5]]. AT "the farthest places of the earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I have chosen you and not rejected you** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second states in negative terms what the first states in positive terms. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
