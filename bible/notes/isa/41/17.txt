\q1
\v 17 The oppressed and needy look for water, but there is none, and their tongues are parched for thirst; 
\q1 I, Yahweh, will respond to their prayers; I,
the God of Israel, will not forsake them.
\q1
\v 18 I will make streams to flow down  the slopes, and springs in the middle of the valleys; 
\q1 I will make the desert into a pool of
water, and the dry land into springs of water.
