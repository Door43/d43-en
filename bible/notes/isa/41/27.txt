\q1
\v 27 I first said to Zion, "Look here they are;" I sent a herald to Jerusalem.
\q1
\v 28 When I look, there is no one, not one among them who can give good advice, 
\q1 who, when I ask, can answer a word.
\q1
\v 29 Look, all of them are nothing, 
\q1 and their deeds are nothing; their cast metal figures are wind and emptiness.
