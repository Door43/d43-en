===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Jerusalem.

  * **you will forget the shame of your youth and the disgrace of your abandonment**  - Yahweh is speaking to the people of Jerusalem as if they were a woman whose husband had left them and is addressing the shame they felt when the army of Babylon defeated them and took them into exile. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
