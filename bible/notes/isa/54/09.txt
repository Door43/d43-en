<usfm>
\v 9 During the time that Noah lived,

\q1
\v 10 Even if the mountains and hills shake and collapse,
\q2 I will not stop faithfully loving you,
\q1 and I will not cancel my agreement
\q2 to cause things to go well for you.
\q2 That is what I, Yahweh, who act mercifully, say.

\q1
\v 9 For this is like the waters of Noah to me: 
\q1 as I swore that the waters of Noah would never again pass over the earth, 
\q1 so have I sworn that I will not be angry with you or rebuke you.
\q1
\v 10 Though the mountains may fall and the hills be shaken, 
\q1 yet my covenant faithfulness will not turn away from you, nor will my covenant of peace be shaken— 
\q1 says Yahweh, who has mercy on you.
