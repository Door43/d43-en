===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Jerusalem.

  * **storm-driven**  - Yahweh compares the people to something that the storm and wind blows around. This means the people are hurt and without stability. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **uncomforted one**  - "without comfort"
  * **turquoise…sapphires…rubies**  - These are precious gemstones. Turquoise is light blue-to-green, sapphires are //typically//  dark blue, and rubies are red-to-pink. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown|Translate Unknowns]])
