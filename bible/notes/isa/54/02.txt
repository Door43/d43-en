===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Jerusalem.

  * **Make your tent larger ... strengthen your stakes** - This continues God's promise to increase the number of Israelites, and the use of "tent" recalls their former nomadic life. God is telling them to make room for an increased population and descendants. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
