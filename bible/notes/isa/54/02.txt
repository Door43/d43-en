===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Jerusalem.

  * **Make your tent larger ... strengthen your stakes** - This continues the metaphor that began in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:54:01|54:1]]. Yahweh telling the people of Jerusalem to prepare because Yahweh will greatly increase their people is spoken of as if he is telling a woman to make her tent bigger to make room for many children. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For you will spread out** - Here "you" is singular and refers to the barren woman. She represents all of her descendants. AT: "For you and your descendants will spread out" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **will conquer nations** - Here "nations" represents the people. AT: "will conquer the people of other nations" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
