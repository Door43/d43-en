===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **you barren woman…children of the married woman**  - A woman who did not have a husband or could not have children felt ashamed and sad. Yahweh is telling Jerusalem that even though it is "childless" now, the city abandoned and empty, that one day its population would increase to the point of being crowded.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
