===== translationNotes: =====

  * **you barren woman ... children of the married woman** - Yahweh telling the people of Jerusalem to rejoice because there will be many people living in Jerusalem again is spoken of as if Yahweh were telling a barren women she is going to have many children. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **break into joyful singing and cry aloud, you who have never been in birth labor** - This statement means the same thing as the first part of the sentence. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **For the children of the desolate one are more** - An event that will happen in the future is spoken of as if it happened in the past. This emphasizes that the event will certainly happen. AT: "For the children of the desolate woman will be more" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pastforfuture]])
  * **the desolate one** - Here "desolate" means that the woman's wife had rejected and abandoned her.
