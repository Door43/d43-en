Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.
    * **Have I not declared to you long ago, and announced it?** - Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that he is the one who predicted the events that have now happened. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **Is there any God besides me?** - Yahweh uses a question again to emphasize the that there is no other God. 
    * **There is no other Rock** - Here Yahweh compares himself to a rock. This means he has the power to protect his people (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
