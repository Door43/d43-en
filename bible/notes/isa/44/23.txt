  * [[:en:obe:kt:heaven]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:yahweh]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:redeem]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:jacob]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:glory]] 

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Sing, you heavens ... glory in Israel** - Here Isaiah speaks various parts of creation as if they were people and commands them to praise Yawheh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **you underworld under the earth** - "you lowest parts of the earth." Possible meanings are 1) that this refers to very deep places on the earth such as caves or canyons and forms a merism with "heavens" in the previous phrase or 2) that this refers to the place of the dead. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
