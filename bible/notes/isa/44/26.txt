===== translationNotes: =====


  * **who confirmed the words of his servant and brings to pass the predictions of his messengers** - Yahweh is saying the same thing twice to emphasize that it is only he, Yahweh, who causes the prophesies to be fulfilled. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **the words of his servant ... the predictions of his messengers** - The abstract nouns "words" and "predictions" can be translated as verbs. AT: "what his servant declares ... what his messengers announce" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **She will be inhabited** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "People will live there again" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **They will be built again** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "People will rebuild them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **I will raise up their ruins** - The phrase "ruins" refers to places that have been destroyed. Yahweh speaks of rebuilding them as if he were raising them up. AT: "I will rebuild what others have destroyed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
