\v 26 I, Yahweh!—who fulfills the declarations of his servant and brings to pass the advice of his messengers,

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **who fulfills the declarations of his servant and brings to pass the advice of his messengers** - Yahweh is saying the same thing twice for emphasis. It is only Yahweh who causes the prophesies to be fulfilled. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **the declarations of his servant ... the advice of his messengers** - The words "declarations" and "advice" can be translated as verbs. AT: "what his servant declares ... what his messengers announce" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **She will be inhabited** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "People will live there again" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **They will be built again** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "People will rebuild them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **I will raise up her waste places** - The phrase "waste places" refers to places that have been destroyed. Yahweh speaks of rebuilding them as if he were raising them up. AT: "I will rebuild what others have destroyed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
