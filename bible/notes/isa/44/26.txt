\v 26 I, Yahweh!—who fulfills the declarations of his servant and brings to pass the advice of his messengers,

be inhabited;' and of the cities of Judah, 'They will be built again, and I will raise up her waste places'—

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **who fulfills the declarations of his servant and brings to pass the counsel of his messengers**  - Yahweh is saying the same thing twice for emphasis. It is only Yahweh who causes the prophesies to be fulfilled. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **She will be inhabited** - AT: "People will live there again" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
    * **They will be built again, and I will raise up her waste places** - AT: "I will rebuild the ruined cities"
    * **who says to the deep sea** - Yahweh commands the sea to do what seems impossible to demonstrate his power. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
