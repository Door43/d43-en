===== translationNotes: =====


  * **It is as if he were eating ashes** - Yahweh speaks of a person worshiping an idol as if that person were eating the burned ashes of the wood from which he made the idol. Just as eating ashes does not benefit a person, neither does worshiping an idol. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **his deceived heart misleads him** - The heart represents the inner person. AT: "he misleads himself because he is deceived" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **He cannot rescue himself** - "The person who worships idols cannot save himself"
