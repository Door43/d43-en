===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues speaking.

    * **Jacob, and Israel** - AT: "you descendants of Israel" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
    * **you will not be forgotten by me** - AT: "I will not forget you" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
    * **I have blotted out, like a thick cloud, your rebellious deeds, and like a cloud, your sins** - Both of these statements mean the same thing. God has removed their sins as quickly and easily as a wind can blow away a cloud. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
