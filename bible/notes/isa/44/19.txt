<usfm>
\q1
\v 19 No one thinks, nor do they comprehend and say, 
\q1 "I have burned part of the wood in the fire; yes,
I have also baked bread upon its coals. I have roasted meat over its coals and eaten. 
\q1 Now  should I make the other part of the wood into  something disgusting to worship? Should I bow down to a block of wood?"

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Now should I make the other part of the wood into something disgusting to worship? Should I bow down to a block of wood?"** - Yahweh uses these question to emphasize that the people are ignorant for making idols from the same wood they also use for burning. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
