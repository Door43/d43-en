===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues speaking.

    * **the things they delight in are worthless** - "the images that are precious to them are useless"
    * **their witnesses cannot see or know anything** - This means that those who say idols have power are spiritually blind and do not understand the truth. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **they will be put to shame** - AT: "and I will put them to shame" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
    * **Who would form a god or cast an idol that is worthless?** - Yahweh is using this question to rebuke those who make idols. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
