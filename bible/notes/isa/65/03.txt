===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking about the people of Israel.

  * **in gardens…on brick tiles**  - These refer to Canaanite places for worshiping idols. Their sacred altars were made of bricks, which Yahweh forbid for his altars. His were made of stone. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Explicit and Implicit]])
  * **eat pork**  - Yahweh did not allow the people of Israel to eat meat from pigs.
