===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking.

  * **the former things will not be remembered or be brought to mind**  - Both of these phrases mean the same thing and are combined for emphasis. AT: "you will not even think about what happened in the past." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **But you will be glad**  - Here "you" refers to all of God's servants.
