  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking about the people of Israel.

  * **Look, it is written** - "Take notice and pay attention"
  * **into their laps** - This means God will punish them to the fullest extent. This expression compares Yahweh punishing the people to dumping on their legs as they are sitting. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
