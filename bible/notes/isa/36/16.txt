\v 16   Do not listen to Hezekiah, for this is what the king of Assyria says: 'Make  peace with me and come out to me. Then every one of you will eat from his own vine and from his own fig-tree, and drink from the water in his own cistern,
\v 17 until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.'
