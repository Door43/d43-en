\v 9 How could you resist even one captain of the least of my masterâ€™s servants? You have put your trust in Egypt for chariots and horsemen!
\v 10 Now then, have I traveled up here without Yahweh to fight against this land and destroy it? Yahweh said to me, "Attack this land and destroy it."'"

===== Translation Notes: =====
This continues the king of Assyria's message to Hezekiah by speaking the message to Hezekiah's men. (See: [[en:bible:notes:isa:36:04|36:4-5]])

    * **How could you resist even one captain** - The Rabshakeh continues to ridicule Hezekiah and his army. AT: "You could not even defeat one captain"  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **Now then, have I traveled up here without Yahweh to fight against this land and destroy it?** - The Rabshakeh uses another question to ridicule Hezekiah and the people of Judah. AT: "I came here with Yahweh's command to destroy Jerusalem." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
