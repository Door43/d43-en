===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Eliaim...Hilkiah...Shebnah** - See how you translated these names of men in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:22:20|Isa 22:20]] and [[:en:bible:notes:isa:22:15|Isa 22:15]].
    * **Joah...chief commander** - See how you translated these in [[en:bible:notes:isa:36:01|36:2-3]].
    * **Please speak to your servants** - Eliakim, Shebnah, and Joah refer to themselves as the chief commander's servants. This is a polite way to speak to someone who has greater authority.
    * **Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words?** - the chief commander uses a question to emphasize that his message is for all the people of Judah. AT: "Certainly, my master has sent me to speak this message to you and to all who can hear." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **Has he not sent me to the men who sit on the wall, who will have to ...?** - the chief commander continues using a question for emphasis. AT: "My master has sent me to everyone who hears this, who will have to ...."
