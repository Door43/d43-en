===== Translation Notes: =====
This continues the king of Assyria's message to Hezekiah by speaking the message to Hezekiah's men. (See: [[en:bible:notes:isa:36:04|36:4-5]])

    * **two thousand horses** - "2,000 horses"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
    * **if you are able to find riders for them** - Rabshakeh continues to ridicule Hezekiah and his army by implying that he did not have many soldiers. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
