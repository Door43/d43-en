<usfm>
\v 18 Do not allow Hezekiah to mislead you by saying, "Yahweh will rescue us." The gods that people of other nations worship have never \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* rescued any of them from the power \f + \ft metonymy \f* of the king of Assyria!
\v 19 Why were the gods of Hamath and Arpad \add cities\add*, and the gods of Sepharvaim unable to rescue Samaria from my power \f + \ft metonymy \f*?
\v 20 No, no god \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* of any nation \add which that army has attacked\add* has been able to rescue their people from me. So why do you think that Yahweh will rescue you people of Jerusalem from my power \f + \ft metonymy \f*?'~"
