====== Isaiah 36:6-7 ======

<usfm>
\v 6 Listen to me! You are relying on \add the army of\add* Egypt. But that will be like \f + \ft metaphor \f* using a broken reed for a walking stick on which you could lean. But it would pierce the hand of anyone who would lean on it! That is what the king of Egypt would be like for anyone who relied on him \add for help\add*.
\v 7 But perhaps you will say to me, 'No, we are relying on Yahweh our God \add to help us\add*'.' \add I would reply\add*, 'Is he not the one whom \add you insulted by\add* tearing down his shrines and altars and forcing everyone in Jerusalem and \add other places in\add* Judah to worship only in front of the altar \add in Jerusalem\add*?'

\v 6 Listen to me! You are relying on the army of Egypt. But that is like when a man tries to walk while leaning on a broken reed for a walking stick. But it would pierce the hand of anyone who would lean on it! That is what the king of Egypt is like for anyone who relies on him for help.
\v 7 But perhaps you will say to me that you are relying on Yahweh your God to help you. In that case, I would answer that Yahweh is the one whom Hezekiah insulted by tearing down his shrines and altars and forcing everyone in Jerusalem and other places in Judah to worship only in front of the altar in Jerusalem."

\v 6 Look, you trust in the walking stick of this bruised reed of Egypt, but if a man leans it will stick into his hand and pierce it. That is what Pharaoh king of Egypt is to anyone who trusts in him.
\v 7 But if you say to me, "We are trusting in Yahweh our God," is not he the one whose shrines and altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, "You must worship before this altar in Jerusalem?"

===== Translation Notes: =====
This continues the king of Assyria's message to Hezekiah. The Rabshakeh is speaking the message to Hezekiah's men. (See: [[en:bible:notes:isa:36:04|36:4-5]])

   * **you trust in the walking stick of this bruised reed of Egypt, but if a man leans it will stick into his hand and pierce it** - The bruised reed of Egypt refers to Pharaoh and the armies of Egypt. The Rabshakeh warns Hezekiah that Egypt will not be able to help and will cause Judah harm. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
   * **bruised reed** - A reed is the long, thin stem of a plant like tall grass. If it is bruised (damaged) it cannot carry any weight.
   * **is not he the one whose shrines and altars Hezekiah has taken away, …?** - The king of Assyria uses this question to ridicule the people and to imply that Yahweh was angry about what Hezekiah did and would not protect them. AT: "He is the one whose shrines and altars Hezekiah has taken away …" or "He is the one whom Hezekiah insulted by tearing down his shrines and altars" (UDB).  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
   * **has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, 'You must worship before this altar in Jerusalem** - "has said to the people of Judah and Jerusalem that they must worship only at the altar in Jerusalem." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
