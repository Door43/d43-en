====== Isaiah 36:6-7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 Listen to me! You are relying on \add the army of\add* Egypt. But that will be like \f + \ft metaphor \f* using a broken reed for a walking stick on which you could lean. But it would pierce the hand of anyone who would lean on it! That is what the king of Egypt would be like for anyone who relied on him \add for help\add*.
\v 7 But perhaps you will say to me, 'No, we are relying on Yahweh our God \add to help us\add*'.' \add I would reply\add*, 'Is he not the one whom \add you insulted by\add* tearing down his shrines and altars and forcing everyone in Jerusalem and \add other places in\add* Judah to worship only in front of the altar \add in Jerusalem\add*?'

\v 6 Listen to me! You are relying on the army of Egypt. But that is like when a man tries to walk while leaning on a broken reed for a walking stick. But it would pierce the hand of anyone who would lean on it! That is what the king of Egypt is like for anyone who relies on him for help.
\v 7 But perhaps you will say to me that you are relying on Yahweh your God to help you. In that case, I would answer that Yahweh is the one whom Hezekiah insulted by tearing down his shrines and altars and forcing everyone in Jerusalem and other places in Judah to worship only in front of the altar in Jerusalem?"

\v 6 Do  you trust in the staff of this bruised reed, Egypt, which, if a man leans on it, will pierce his hand? That is what Pharaoh, king of Egypt, is to all who trust in him.
\v 7 But if you say to me, "We trust in Yahweh our God," isn't he the god whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has removed and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, "See that you worship before this altar?"'
