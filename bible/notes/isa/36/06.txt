====== Isaiah 36:6-7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 Listen to me! You are relying on \add the army of\add* Egypt. But that will be like \f + \ft metaphor \f* using a broken reed for a walking stick on which you could lean. But it would pierce the hand of anyone who would lean on it! That is what the king of Egypt would be like for anyone who relied on him \add for help\add*.
\v 7 But perhaps you will say to me, 'No, we are relying on Yahweh our God \add to help us\add*'.' \add I would reply\add*, 'Is he not the one whom \add you insulted by\add* tearing down his shrines and altars and forcing everyone in Jerusalem and \add other places in\add* Judah to worship only in front of the altar \add in Jerusalem\add*?'

\v 6 Listen to me! You are relying on the army of Egypt. But that is like when a man tries to walk while leaning on a broken reed for a walking stick. But it would pierce the hand of anyone who would lean on it! That is what the king of Egypt is like for anyone who relies on him for help.
\v 7 But perhaps you will say to me that you are relying on Yahweh your God to help you. In that case, I would answer that Yahweh is the one whom Hezekiah insulted by tearing down his high places and altars and forcing everyone in Jerusalem and other places in Judah to worship only in front of the altar in Jerusalem."

\v 6 Look, you are trusting in Egypt, that splintered reed that you use as a walking staff, but if a man leans on it, it will stick into his hand and pierce it. That is what Pharaoh king of Egypt is to anyone who trusts in him.
\v 7 But if you say to me, "We are trusting in Yahweh our God," is not he the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, "You must worship before this altar in Jerusalem"?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This continues the king of Assyria's message to Hezekiah. The chief commander is speaking the message to Hezekiah's men. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:isa:36:04|36:4-5]])

  * **Look** - Sennacherib uses this word to draw Hezekiah's attention to what he says next. AT: "Listen" 
  * **trusting in Egypt** - Here "Egypt" refers to the Egyptian army. AT: "trusting in the Egyptian army" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **that splintered reed that you use as a walking staff, but if a man leans on it, it will stick into his hand and pierce it** - This speaks of Egypt, specifically its army and its Pharaoh, as if it were a splintered reed to emphasize that relying on them would not help them but would only harm them. AT: "that is like walking with a splintered reed for a staff. If a man leans on it, it will stick into his hand and pierce it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **splintered reed** - A reed is the long, thin stem of a plant like tall grass. If it is splintered or damaged it cannot carry any weight.
  * **walking staff** - This is a stick that someone would use for support when walking, made of whatever kind of tree limb that is found along the way.
  * **is not he the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah has taken away ... Jerusalem"?** - The king of Assyria uses this question to ridicule the people and to imply that Yahweh was angry about what Hezekiah did and would not protect them. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "he is the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah has taken away ... Jerusalem." or "he is the one whom Hezekiah insulted by tearing down his high places and altars ... Jerusalem." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, "You must worship before this altar in Jerusalem"?** - This can be written as an indirect quote. "Judah" and "Jerusalem" refer to the people who live in them. AT: "has told the people of Judah and Jerusalem that they must worship only at this altar in Jerusalem." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
