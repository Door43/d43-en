===== Translation Notes: =====
Isaiah continues to tell what God has judged against the nations in 13:1-23:18.

  * **Howl, you ships of Tarshish** – See how you translated "ships of Tarshish" in [[en:bible:notes:isa:02:14|2:16]]. Isaiah speaks to the men on the ships of Tarshish as if they could hear him. AT: "Cry out in despair you men on the ships of Tarshish." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
  * **from the land of Kittim it has been revealed to them** - Kittum is another name for Cyprus. It is an island in the Mediterranean Sea. AT: "The men heard about Tyre when they were in the land of Kittim" or "The men heard about Tyre when they were in Cyprus." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Be astounded, you inhabitants of the coast, you merchants of Sidon** - "Be shocked you people of the coast, you sellers from Sidon." The "coast" is the land near or around the sea or ocean. 
  * **who travel over the sea, whose agents supply you** - AT: "whose men travel on the sea and supply you with goods to sell."
  * **And on great waters the grain of the Shihor region, the harvest of the Nile, was brought to Tyre** - Shihor and the Nile refer to the land of Egypt. AT: "The men traveled on the great waters to bring to Tyre the grain and the harvest from Egypt.
