\v 1 I, Isaiah, received this message from Yahweh for you, the people in the city of Tyre:
\q1 You sailors on ships from Tarshish,
\q2 weep, because the harbor of Tyre and all the houses in the city have been destroyed.
\q2 The reports that you heard in the Island of Cyprus about Tyre are true.
\b
\q1
\v 2 You people who live along the coast, you merchants of the city of Sidon, mourn silently.
\q2 Your sailors went across the seas to make you rich, there in Tyre.
\q1
\v 3 They sailed across deep seas
\q2 to buy grain in Egypt, grain from the Valley of Shihor.
\q2 This wealth came down the Nile River, and you, Tyre, were the place where the people of all nations traded.

\f + \ft Some ancient and modern versions have \fqa Be silent, you inhabitants of the coast; the merchants of Sidon, who travel over the sea, have filled you \fqb or \fqa Be silent, you inhabitants of the coast and you merchants of Sidon, whom those who travel over the sea have filled \fqb . \f*
\q1
\v 3 And on great waters was the grain of Shihor,
\q1 the harvest of the Nile, her produce; you were the commerce of nations.
