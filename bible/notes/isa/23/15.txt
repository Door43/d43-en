\v 15 For seventy years, which is as long as kings usually live, people will forget about Tyre. \add But then it will be rebuilt\add*. What will happen there will be like what happened to a prostitute in this song:
\q1
\v 16 You harlot, whom people had forgotten,
\q2 play your harp well,
\q1 and sing many songs,
\q2 in order that people will remember you again.

<usfm>
\v 15 In that day, Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, like the days of a king. After the end of seventy years there will happen in Tyre something like in the song of the prostitute:

\q1
\v 16 Take a harp, go about the city, you forgotten prostitute; 
\q1 play it well, sing many songs, so that you
may be remembered.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **for seventy years** - "for 70 years" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **like in the song of the prostitute** - This compares the people of Tyre to a prostitute. Just as a prostitute who is no longer popular may sing in the streets to regain her former lovers, so Tyre will seek to regain her former position of power and wealth with other nations. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
