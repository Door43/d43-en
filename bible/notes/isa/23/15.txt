\v 15 For seventy years, which is as long as kings usually live, people will forget about Tyre. \add But then it will be rebuilt\add*. What will happen there will be like what happened to a prostitute in this song:
\q1
\v 16 You harlot, whom people had forgotten,
\q2 play your harp well,
\q1 and sing many songs,
\q2 in order that people will remember you again.

\v 15 In that day, Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, like the days of a king. After the end of seventy years there will happen in Tyre something like in the song of the prostitute.
\q1
\v 16 Take a harp, go about the city, you forgotten prostitute;
\q1 play it well, sing many songs, so that you may be remembered.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **In that day** - "At that time" or "Then" 
  * **Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years** - Since people will no longer go to Tyre to buy or sell goods, it will be like they have forgotten about the city. This can be stated in active form. AT: "for seventy years it will be like the people have forgotten about Tyre" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **for seventy years** - "for 70 years" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **like the days of a king** - "like the years of a king" or "which is about as long as a king lives" 
  * **like in the song of the prostitute ... so that you may be remembered** - This speaks about the people of Tyre as if they were a prostitute. Just as a prostitute who is no longer popular may sing in the streets to regain her former lovers, the people of Tyre will try to get people from other nations to return to them to continue trading so that the people of Tyre will be rich and powerful again. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **so that you may be remembered** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "so that people remember you" or "so that people return to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
