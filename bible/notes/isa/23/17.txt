\v 17 It will come about that after seventy years, Yahweh will help Tyre, and she will return to her trading by selling her services to all the kingdoms on the earth.
\v 18 Her profits and earnings will be set apart for Yahweh. They will not be stored up or kept in the treasury, for her profits will be given to those who live in Yahweh's presence and will be used to supply them with abundant food and so they can have the best quality clothing.
