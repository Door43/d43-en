===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Who has planned this against Tyre** - Isaiah uses a question to mock Tyre. The word "this" refers to God's plans to destroy Tyre which Isaiah described in 23:1-7. Also, "Tyre" refers to the people who live in Tyre. AT: "Someone has planned to destroy the people of Tyre." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the giver of crowns** - Here "crown" refers to the power a person has as a ruler over people. AT: "who gives people power to rule over others"
  * **whose merchants are princes** - The merchants are compared to princes to emphasize how much power they had when they went to different lands. AT: "whose merchants are like kings" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **whose traders are the honored ones of the earth** - "whose traders the people of the earth give the highest honors"
