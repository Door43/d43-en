Also, "Tyre" refers to the people who live in Tyre. AT: "Someone has planned to destroy the people of Tyre." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the giver of crowns** - Here "crown" refers to the power a person has as a ruler over people. AT: “who gives people power to rule over others"
