===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Who has planned this against Tyre ... of the earth?** - Isaiah uses a question to mock Tyre. The word "this" refers to God's plans to destroy Tyre which Isaiah described in 23:1-7. Also, "Tyre" refers to the people who live in Tyre. AT: "It was Yahweh who has planned to destroy the people of Tyre ... of the earth." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the giver of crowns** - Here "crown" refers to the power a person has as a ruler over people. AT: "who gives people power to rule over others" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **whose merchants are princes** - The merchants are compared to princes to emphasize how much power they had when they went to different lands. AT: "whose merchants are like princes" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **whose traders are the honored ones of the earth** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "whose traders the people of the earth give the highest honors" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **to dishonor her pride and all her glory** - "to dishonor them because they were proud of their own glory"
  * **her pride ... her glory ... her honored ones** - Here "her" refers to the city of Tyre which represents the people who live there. AT: "their pride ... their glory ... their honored one" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
