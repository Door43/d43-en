===== Important Terms: =====

  * Tarshish
  * [[:en:obe:kt:joy|joyful]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:foreigner|foreign]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Cross over to** Tarshish – "Make your way to Tarshish".  Tarshish was the furthest point where Tyre held  business, but it will be the only place of safety for those who escape from Tyre.
  * **Has this happened to you****, the joyful city, **** **whose feet carried ****her far away to foreign places to settle ****- This question is mocking Tyre.  It can be translated " This has happend to you Tyre even though you used to be known as the city of pleasure, the one who went to many places to make money".** ** (See: Metonymy, see: Rhetorical Question)
