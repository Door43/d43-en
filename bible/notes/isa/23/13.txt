\v 13 Think about what happened in Babylonia:
\q2 the people who were in that land have disappeared.
\q1 \add The armies of\add* Assyria have caused that land to become a place where wild animals from the desert live.
\q1 They built dirt ramps to the top of the walls \add of the city of Babylon\add*;
\q2 then they \add entered the city and\add* tore down the palaces
\q2 and caused the city to become \add a heap of\add* rubble.
\b
\q1
\v 14 So wail, you \add sailors on the\add* ships of Tarshish,
\q2 because the harbor \add in Tyre where your ships stop\add* is destroyed!

\q1
\v 13 See the land of the Chaldeans. This people has ceased to be; the Assyrians have made it a wilderness for wild animals:
\q1 they set up their siege towers; they demolished its palaces; they made it a  heap of ruins.
\q1
\v 14 Howl, you ships of Tarshish; for your refuge has been destroyed.
