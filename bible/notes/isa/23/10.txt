===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Plow your land, as one plows the Nile, O daughter of Tarshish. There is no longer a marketplace in Tyre** - Possible meanings are 1) Isaiah is telling the people of Tarshish to start planting crops since they can no longer trade with Tyre, or 2) Isaiah is telling the people of Tarshish they are free from Tyre's control. AT: "Pass through your land like a river, O daughter of Tarshish. The people of Tyre no longer have any power." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **O daughter of Tarshish** - The "daughter" of a city means the people of the city. AT:  "the people of Tarshish" or "the people who live in Tarshish."
  * **has stretched out his hand over the sea** - "has shown his power over the people who live near the sea" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
