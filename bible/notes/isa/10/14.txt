===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh is still quoting the king of Assyria. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:isa:10:12|10:13]])

  * **My hand has seized** - The hand is a metonym for either the king's power or his army. AT: "In my power I have seized" or "My army has seized" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **My hand has seized, as from a nest, the wealth of nations** - The king of Assyria compares taking the treasures from the nations to a person taking eggs out of a bird's nest. This emphasizes how easy it was for him and his army to conquer these other kingdoms. AT: "My army has stolen the wealth from the nations just as easily as a man takes eggs from a nest" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **as one gathers abandoned eggs, I gathered all the earth** - The king of Assyria speaks of taking over nations as if he was gathering eggs. AT: "just as a person takes eggs from a nest when the bird is not there to protect them, my army has taken the treasures of every nation" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **None fluttered their wings or opened their mouth or chirped** - This compares the nations to a bird who sits quietly while her eggs are taken. This emphasizes that the nations did nothing while the army of Assyria took all of their possessions. AT: "And like a bird that does not make a sound or flap her wings when someone steals her eggs, the nations did nothing as we took their treasure" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
