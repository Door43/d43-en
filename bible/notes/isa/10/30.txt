===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **daughter of Gallim** - The word "daughter" here refers to the people who live in the city. Alternate translation: "Gallim" or "people of Gallim."
  * **Gallim…Laishah…Anathoth…Madmenah…Gebim…Nob** - These are names of more cities and villages near Jerusalem that the Assyrian army traveled through causing fear among the people. All of these refer to the people who live in these places. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **he will halt at Nob and shake his fist at the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem ** -  Here "he" and "his" refer to the king of Assyria and his soldiers. People would shake their fists at people that they were threatening. Alternate translation: "The army of Assyria will stop at Nob and threaten the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem** - Both of these phrases mean the same thing. Alternate translation: "the people of Mount Zion" or "the people living on the hill in Jerusalem." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
