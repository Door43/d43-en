\v 15 Will the ax boast about itself against the one who wields it? Will the saw praise itself more than the one who cuts with it?
\q1 It as if a rod could lift up those who raise it, or as if a wooden club could lift up a person.
\q1
\v 16 Therefore the Lord Yahweh of hosts will send emaciation among his elite warriors;
\q1 and under his glory there will be kindled a burning like fire.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Will the axe boast about itself against the one who wields it? Will the saw praise itself more than the one who cuts with it** - The speaker uses these questions to mock the king of Assyria. Alternate translation: "An axe is not better than the one who holds it. And a saw does not get more glory than the one who cuts with it." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the saw** - a sharp tool used for cutting wood
  * **as if a rod could lift up those who raise it, or as if a wooden club could lift up a person** - These phrases mean basically the same thing and are used to strengthen the meaning of the two questions before it. This could be translated as a new sentence: "And neither can a rod or staff lift the person who picks it up." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Therefore the Lord Yahweh of Hosts will send emaciation among his elite warriors** - It is unclear whether Yahweh or Isaiah is speaking. Alternate translation: "Therefore I, Lord Yahweh of Hosts, will make the king's strongest soldiers weak."
  * **under his glory there will be kindled a burning like fire** - Yahweh compares his punishment to a fire. This emphasizes that his punishment will completely destroy all the splendor and greatness of the kingdom of Assyria. Alternate translation: "like a burning fire I will destroy his greatness" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
