\v 15 Will the axe boast itself against the one who wields it? Will the saw magnify itself over the one who cuts with it,
\q1 as if a rod could lift them that raise it, or a staff could lift something that is not wood.

\v 16 Therefore the Lord God of Hosts will send emaciation among his elite warriors;
\q1 and under his glory there will be kindled a burning like fire.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Will the axe boast itself against the one who wields it? Will the saw magnify itself over the one who cuts with it** - The speaker uses a question to mock the king of Assyria. Alternate translation: "An axe is not better than the one who holds it. And a saw does not get more glory than the one who cuts with it." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion]])
  * **the saw** - a sharp tool used for cutting wood
  * **as if a rod could lift them that raise it, or a staff could lift something that is not wood** - These phrases mean basically the same thing and are used for emphasis. This could be translated as a new sentence: "And, neither can a rod or staff lift the person who picks it up." (See: [[en:ta:translate:parallelism]])
  * ** Therefore the Lord God of Hosts will send emaciation among his elite warriors** - It is unclear whether Yahweh or Isaiah is speaking. Alternate translation: "Therefore I, Lord God of Hosts, will make the king's strongest soldiers weak"
  * **and under his glory there will be kindled a burning like fire** - God compares his punishment to a fire. This emphasizes his punishment will completely destroy all the splendor and greatness of the kingdom of Assyria. Alternate translation: "and like a burning fire I will destroy his greatness" (See: [[:en:ta:translate:simile]])
