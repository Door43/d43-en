\v 15 Will the axe boast itself against the one who wields it? Will the saw magnify itself over the one who cuts with it,
\q1 as if a rod could lift them that raise it, or a staff could lift something that is not wood.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Will the axe boast itself against the one who wields it? Will the saw magnify itself over the one who cuts with it**  - Yahweh is mocking the proud response of the Assyrian King. Yahweh says that the king could do nothing unless Yahweh used the king to punish the people of Jerusalem. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **as if a rod could lift them that raise it, or a staff could lift something that is not wood**  - Yahweh repeats the fact that the tool is useless without the one who uses it.
  * **Therefore the Lord God of Hosts will send emaciation among his elite warriers**  - Yahweh will punish the Assyrian king and his army for their pride and cruelty toward the people of Jerusalem.
  * **and under his glory there will be kindled a burning like fire**  - The word "it" here is God's wrath and it is being compared to a fire. We will see this comparison continued in verse 17. This can be translated as "and God's wrath will be like a fire that will destroy the Assyrians." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:simile|Simile]])
