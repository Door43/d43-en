===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Woe** - This word marks the beginning of God's announcement about a severe punishment against Assyria.
  * **the Assyrian** - This refers to the king of Assyria.
  * **the club of my anger, the rod by whom I wield my fury** - Both of these phrases mean basically the same thing. Yahweh compares the king of Assyria to a weapon a person holds in his hand and hits other people with. It emphasizes that the king of Assyria and his army are a tool that Yahweh uses to punish Israel. AT: "who will be like a weapon in my hands and I will use it to show my anger" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I send him ... I order him** - The word "him" here also refers to the king of Assyria. But it does not mean God is only sending the king; he is sending with him the army of Assyria. AT: "I send the army of Assyria ... I order them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **against an arrogant nation and against the people who bear my overflowing wrath** - "to attack a nation full of proud people who have made me very angry"
  * **to take the spoil** - "to take everything they have"
  * **to take the prey** - to take the people like prey. See how you translated "prey" in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:05:29|5:29]].
  * **trample them like mud** - Possible meanings are that Yahweh compares the army of Assyria attacking Israel to 1) people stomping through mud who do not care what happens to the mud or 2) people stomping on other people so they are lying in the mud and unable to rise. AT: "trample them until they become like mud" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]]) This is a metaphor for completely defeating them. AT: "completely defeat them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
