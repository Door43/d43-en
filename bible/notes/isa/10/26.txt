\q2 He will do to them like he did when he helped Gideon \add and his 300 soldiers\add* to defeat the \add army of the\add* Midian people-group
\q2 and like he did when he showed his mighty power\f + \ft metonymy \f* \add by causing the army of Egypt to drown\add* in the \add Red\add* Sea.
\q1
\v 27 Some day, Yahweh will cause the army of Assyria to stop oppressing you, his people;
\q2 he will end your suffering and your being slaves of the people of Assyria \f + \ft metaphor \f*;
\q1 he will take away the load that you people of Judah have been carrying,
\q2 and cause things to go well for you.

<usfm>
\v 26 Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, will strike them with his whip.
\q2 He will do to them as he did when he defeated the army of the Midian people group,
\q2 and as he did when he caused the army of Egypt to drown in the Sea of Reeds.
\q1
\v 27 One day in the future, Yahweh will cause the army of Assyria to stop oppressing you, his people;
\q2 he will end your suffering and your being slaves of the people of Assyria;
\q1 you will become too strong for them.

<usfm>
\p
\v 26 Then Yahweh of hosts will wield a whip against them, as when he defeated Midian at the rock of Oreb. He will raise his rod over the sea and lift it up as he did in Egypt.
\p
\v 27 On that day, his burden is lifted from your shoulder and his yoke from off your neck,
and the yoke will be destroyed because of fatness.
\f + \ft The last line of this verse is difficult because it does not seem to fit the context. Some modern versions leave out \fqa because of fatness \fqa* . Other modern versions have \fqa and the yoke will be destroyed from off your neck. He has gone up from Rimmon. \fqa* Here \fqa He \fqa* means the Assyrian king and his army. \f*

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Yahweh of hosts** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:01:09|1:9]].
  * **will wield a whip against them** - "will beat the Assyrians with a whip." God will not really use a whip. This refers to God's power to punish the Assyrians severely. AT: "will punish the Assyrians severely as if with a whip" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **as when he defeated Midian at the rock of Oreb** - This refers to when God helped a man named Gideon defeat the army of Midian. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **He will raise his rod over the sea and lift it up as he did in Egypt** - This speaks of God rescuing the people from the Assyrians as if they were the Egyptian army. This refers to when God caused the water of the Red Sea to split so the people of Israel could escape from the Egyptian army and so that the Egyptian army would drown in it. AT: "He will help you escape from the army of Assyria as he helped your ancestors escape the army of Egypt" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **his burden is lifted from your shoulder and his yoke from off your neck** - "Yahweh will lift the burden that Assyria has put on your shoulder, and he will remove the yoke that they have put on your neck." These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The words "burden" and "yoke" refer to slavery. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh will remove the Assyrians who oppress you and will stop them from making you their slaves" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the yoke will be destroyed because of fatness** - This expression suggests that the neck of the animal that is wearing the yoke will become too fat to fit the yoke any longer. This is a metaphor for Israel becoming so strong that the Assyrians can no longer rule them. This can be stated in active form. AT: "your neck will become so fat that it will break the yoke" or "you will become so strong that you will no longer be the Assyrians' slaves" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
