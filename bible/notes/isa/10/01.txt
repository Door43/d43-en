===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **to those who enact unjust laws and institute unfair decrees** - "to those who make laws and decrees that are not fair to everyone"
  * **They deprive the needy of justice, rob the poor of my people of their rights** - "They are unjust to the poor and needy among my people"
  * **the needy** - "poor people" 
  * **plunder widows** - "take everything from the women whose husbands have died"
  * **and make the fatherless their prey** - Isaiah compares orphans to animals that other animals hunt and eat. This emphasizes that orphans are powerless and judges can easily harm them. Alternate translation: "and harm children who do not have parents like an animal that goes after its prey." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  *  **prey** - See how you translated "prey" in [[en:bible:notes:isa:05:29|5:29]].
