===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **your people, Israel** - Here "your" is singular. Isaiah is speaking to the people of Israel as if they were a single person. Alternate translation: "your people, O Israel" or "the people of Israel." (UDB) (See: [[en:ta:translate:formsofyou]])
  * **are like the sand of the seashore**  - This compares the people of Israel to the sand around the sea. This emphasizes how many Israelites there were. Alternate translation: "are too many to count like the sand on the seashore." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:simile|Simile]])
  * **Destruction is decreed**  - Alternate translation: "Yahweh has stated that he will destroy most of those who live in Israel." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:active|Active or Passive]])
  * **as overflowing righteousness demands**  - This can be translated as a new sentence: "This must be done for the sake of righteousness."
