\v 12 When the Lord has finished his work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, he will speak: "I will punish the speech of the arrogant heart of the king of Assyria and his prideful looks."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **When the Lord has finished his work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, he will speak: "I will punish** - It is unclear whether Isaiah or Yahweh is saying the first part of this sentence. Alternate translation: "When I, the Lord, have finished punishing Mount Zion and Jerusalem, I will punish."
  * **I will punish the speech of the arrogant heart of the king of Assyria and his prideful looks** - "I will punish the king of Assyria for the arrogant things he said and the look of pride on his face."
  * **For he says** - "For the king of Assyria says"
  * **I have removed the boundaries of the peoples** - Here the word "I" refers to the king of Assyria. He was the leader of the Assyrian army and took credit for what the army did at his command. Alternate translation: "my army has removed the boundaries of the peoples." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **and like a mighty man** - Possible meanings are 1) "and like a powerful soldier" or 2) "and like a ferocious bull." (UDB) This compares the king and his army to a large beast. This emphasizes their power. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **I have brought down those who sit on thrones** - "I have defeated their kings." Alternate translation: "my army has defeated their kings."
