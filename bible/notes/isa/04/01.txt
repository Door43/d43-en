===== translationNotes: =====

  * **let us take your name** - This phrase means "let us marry you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **the branch of Yahweh will be beautiful** - Possible meanings are 1) "branch" is a synecdoche that represents the crops Yahweh will cause to grow in the land of Israel. AT: "Yahweh will cause the crops in Israel to be beautiful" or 2) "branch" is a metaphor that refers to the Messiah. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **will be beautiful and glorious** - "will be full of beauty and glory"
  * **the fruit of the land will be tasty and delightful for those survivors in Israel** - "Fruit" sometimes simply represents food produced in the land, and sometimes it represents spiritual blessings. Possible meanings here are 1) God will cause the land to produce good food again. AT: "the people who are still in Israel will enjoy the best food from the land" or 2) the future Messiah will bring spiritual blessings to the people in the land. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
