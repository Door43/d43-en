====== Isaiah 04 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== More women than men ==
This chapter describes a time when there will be many more women than men in Judah. This is because so many of Judah's fighting men will have died before the exile. Those who come through this difficult time will be a holy remnant. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]], [[:en:obe:kt:holy]] and [[:en:obe:kt:remnant]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Branch of Yahweh ==
Scholars are divided over the possible meaning of this metaphor. Some believe it is a reference to the messiah, while others believe it is a reference to the faithful remnant. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]], [[:en:obe:kt:christ]] and [[:en:obe:kt:faithful]])
