will belong to the Lordâ€”all those whose names are listed among those who live there.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the one who is left in Zion and the one who remains in Jerusalem** - Both of these statements mean the same thing. Here "the one who" does not refer to a specific person but to people in general who are still alive in Jerusalem. AT: "everyone who remains in Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_genericnoun]])
  * **will be called holy** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the Lord will call them holy" or "will belong to the Lord" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **everyone who is written down as living in Jerusalem** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "everyone whose name is on the list of the people who live in Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **when the Lord will have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion** - This expression speaks of sin as if it were physical dirt. AT: "after the Lord removes the sins of the daughters of Zion as someone washes away filth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the daughters of Zion** - Possible meanings are 1) the women of Jerusalem or 2) the people of Jerusalem.
  * **will have cleansed the blood stains from Jerusalem's midst** - "Blood stains" here represents violence and murder. AT: "will have taken away those in Jerusalem who harm innocent people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **by means of the spirit of judgment and the spirit of flaming fire** - This is how God would remove the sin from Jerusalem. Here "spirit" probably represents the activity of judging and burning. AT: "by judgment and flaming fire" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **spirit of judgment** - Possible meanings are 1) Yahweh will punish the people or 2) Yahweh will declare the people guilty.
  * **the spirit of flaming fire** - Possible meanings are 1) this is a metaphor that means Yahweh will remove sinners from Zion like a fire removes impurities or 2) "flaming fire" is a metonym that represents the destruction in general of all the sinners. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
