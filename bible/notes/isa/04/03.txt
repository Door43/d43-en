===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 All the people who will remain in Jerusalem, who did not die when the enemy destroyed Jerusalem,
will belong to the Lord—all those whose names are listed among those who live there.
\v 4 That will happen when the Lord washes away the guilt of the women of Jerusalem,
 and when he stops the violence on the streets of Jerusalem by punishing the people of Jerusalem.
 When he does that, it will be like a fire that burns up all the impure things.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 It will happen that the one who is left in Zion and the one who remains in Jerusalem will be called holy, everyone who is written down as living in Jerusalem.
\v 4 This will happen when the Lord will have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and will have cleansed the blood stains from Jerusalem's midst, by means of the spirit of judgment and the spirit of flaming fire.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the one who is left in Zion, and the one who remains in Jerusalem** - This merism includes all who are left alive in Jerusalem. AT: "everyone who remains in Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **will be called holy** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the Lord will call them holy" or "will belong to the Lord" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **every one who is written down as living in Jerusalem** - "every one whose name is on the list of the people who live in Jerusalem"
  * **when the Lord will have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion** - This expression speaks of sin as if it were physical dirt. AT: "after the Lord removes the sins of the daughters of Zion as someone washes away filth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the daughters of Zion** - Possible meanings are 1) the women of Jerusalem or 2) the people of Jerusalem.
  * **and will have cleansed the blood stains from Jerusalem's midst** - "Blood stains" here represents violence and murder. AT: "and will have taken away those in Jerusalem who harm innocent people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
