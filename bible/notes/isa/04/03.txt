<usfm>
\v 3 All the people who will remain in Jerusalem, who did not die when the enemy destroyed Jerusalem,
will belong to the Lord—all those whose names are listed among those who live there.
\v 4 That will happen when the Lord washes away the guilt of the women of Jerusalem,
 and when he stops the violence on the streets of Jerusalem by punishing the people of Jerusalem.
 When he does that, it will be like a fire to burn up all the impure things.
\v 5 Then Yahweh will send a cloud of smoke during the days and a flaming fire during the nights
to cover Jerusalem and all those who gather there;
it will be like a glorious canopy over the city.
\v 6 It will shelter the people from the sun during the daytime
and protect them when there are windstorms and rain.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Then, he who is left in Zion, and he who remains in Jerusalem, will be called holy, 
every one who is  recorded as living in Jerusalem,
\v 4 when the Lord will have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and will have cleansed the blood stains from Jerusalem's midst, by the spirit of justice, and by the spirit of burning fire.
 
 
 \v 5 Then Yahweh will create over the whole site of Mount Zion and over her place of assembly, cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; a canopy over all the glory.
\v 6 It  will be a shelter for  shade in the daytime from the heat, and a refuge and a cover from the storm and rain.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **every one who is recorded as living in Jerusalem**  - "every one whose name is written in the list of the people who live in Jerusalem"
  * **when the Lord will have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion** - This compares removing sin with washing away filth. Alternate translation "after the Lord removes the sins of the daughters of Zion as somone washes away filth." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
