  * **It will no more be said of you**  - AT: "People will no longer call you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **and your land will be married**  - This means Yahweh will love the people of Israel and will always be with them as a husband is. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
