===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **As a young man marries a young woman, so your sons will marry you**  - Here "sons" refers to the people of Israel and "you" refers to Judah, the land of Israel. This means the people will take possession of the land as a man takes possession of his young wife. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
  * **As a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, your God will rejoice over you**  - This emphasizes God's happiness about his relationship with his people.
