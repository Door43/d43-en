===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I will not be silent**  - It is most likely that "I" refers to Isaiah.
  * **until her righteousness proceeds brightly, and her salvation as a burning torch**  - This reassures the people that God will eventually come and save the people of Israel and that it will be as apparent as light is. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
