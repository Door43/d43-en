===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **you**  -You refers to Judah
  * **you will eat the good of the land**.- "your land will produce much food and you will have much to eat"
  * **but if you refuse and rebel**-" but if you refuse to listen and instead disobey my instructions"
  * **the sword will devour you**-" -The word “sword” is a metaphor and it refers to Judah's enemies. Also, the word “devour” compares Judah's enemies coming to kill them to a wild animal that eats its prey. This could be translated as “Your enemies will kill you.” (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **the mouth of Yahweh has spoken** - Here, the word “mouth” emphasizes that it is Yahweh that spoke and that what was said will certainly happen. It could be translated as “Yahweh has spoken.” (See: [[en:ta:translate:synecdoche|Synecdoche]])
