===== Translation Notes: =====

God continues to speak to the people of Judah.

  * **if you are willing and obedient** - Here, "willing" and "obedient" are  used together to express one idea. Alternate translation: "if you willingly obey." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hendiadys]])
  * **you will eat the good of the land** - "the land will produce good food for you to eat"
  * **but if you refuse and rebel** - "but if you refuse to listen and instead disobey me"
  * **the sword will devour you** - The word "sword" refers to Judah's enemies. Also, the word "devour" compares Judah's enemies coming to kill them to a wild animal that attacks and eats other animals. Alternate translation: "Your enemies will kill you." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it** - The word "mouth" emphasizes that Yahweh has spoken and what he says will certainly happen. Alternate translation: "Yahweh has spoken" or "Yahweh has said that this will happen." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
