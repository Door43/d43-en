===== Translation Notes: =====

The words in 1:4-10 were probably spoken by Isaiah.

  * **woe** - Isaiah is expressing deep concern about Israel's rebellion.
  * **a people weighed down with iniquity**  - This compares their many sins to something very heavy that a person might carry. Alternate translation: "their sin is like a heavy bag on their shoulders that makes it hard for them to walk." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **They have abandoned Yahweh** - "They have turned away from Yahweh" 
  * **they have despised the Holy One of Israel** - "they have rejected the Holy One of Israel" or "they have been disrespectful to the Holy One of Israel" 
  * **they have estranged themselves from him**  - "they have separated themselves from him." Alternate translation: "they have treated him as a stranger."
