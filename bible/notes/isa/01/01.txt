  * **Hear, O heavens, and listen, O earth**  - Although these prophecies were meant for the people of Jerusalem and Judah to hear, Isaiah told the “heavens” and “earth” to listen to what Yahweh said. By doing this, he emphasized how bad the people were. They were so bad that he was telling the heavens and earth about their sins. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe|Apostrophe]], [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification|Personification]])
