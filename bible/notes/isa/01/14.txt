===== Translation Notes: =====

God continues to speak to the people of Judah.

  * **Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates** - God refers to himself with the phrase "my soul". This can be translated as "I hate all your new moon celebrations and special feasts." (See: [[en:ta:translate:synecdoche]])
  * **they are a burden to me; I am tired of enduring them** - This compares how God feels about the people's celebrations to  carrying a heavy object.  It can be translated as “they are a heavy load that I am tired of carrying.” (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
  * **I hide my eyes from you** - This is a way of saying "I will not look at you" or "I will not pay attention to you." (See: [[en:ta:translate:idiom]]).
  * **your hands are full of blood** - Possible meanings are 1) the blood refers to violence they have done against people, or 2) the blood refers to the sacrifices that God considers worthless. This could be translated as "because it is like your hands are covered with the blood of those you have harmed" or "because your hands are covered in the blood of your worthless sacrifices."
