===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Your new moons and your appointed feasts ** - This is refer special times people would gather to celebrate and worship God. Also, God is very angry and refers to himself with the phrase "my soul" which is the part that has emotions. It can be translated "I hate all your new moon celebrations and special feasts." (See: [[en:ta:translate:synecdoche|Synecdoche]])
  * **they are a burden to me; I am tired of enduring them** - This compares how God feels about the people's celebrations to  carrying a heavy object.  It can be translated as “They are a heavy load that I am tired of carrying.” (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **I hide my eyes from you** - This is a way of saying "I will not look at you" or "I will not pay attention to you." (See: [[en:ta:translate:idiom]]).
  * **your hands are full of blood** - Possible meanings are 1) the blood refers to the sacrifices that God considers worthless or 2) the blood refers to the violence and injustice towards the weak described in 1:16-17. This could be translated as "because your hands are covered in the blood of your worthless sacrifices" or "because it is like your hands are covered with the blood of those you have harmed."
