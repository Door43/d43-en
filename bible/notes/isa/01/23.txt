  * **companions of thieves** - "they are friends with people who steal from others"
  * **everyone loves bribes and runs after payoffs** - These are two different ways of saying the same thing to emphasize how wicked the leaders were. Alternate translation: "They all are happy to lie and make bad decisions if someone will pay them enough money." (See: [[en:ta:translate:doublet]])
