===== Translation Notes =====

  * **Your princes are rebels** - "Your leaders rebel against God"
  * **companions of thieves** - "they are friends with people who steal from others"
  * **everyone loves bribes and runs after payoffs** - These are two different ways of saying the same thing to emphasize how wicked the leaders were. Alternate translation: "They all are happy to lie and make bad decisions if someone will pay them enough money." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **they do not defend the fatherless** - "they do not protect those who do not have fathers" 
  * **nor does the widow's legal plea come before them** - "nor do they listen when widows go to them for help" or "and they do not help widows who go to them for help"
