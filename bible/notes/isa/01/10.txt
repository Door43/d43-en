===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **You rulers of Sodom…you people of Gomorrah** - Isaiah is comparing the people of Judah to Sodom and Gomorrah to emphasize how sinful they have become. It could be translated as “You rulers who are as sinful as the people of Sodom…you people who are as wicked as those who lived in Gomorrah.” (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **What is the multitude of your sacrifices to me?** - God is using a question to scold the people. This could be translated as “Your sacrifices mean nothing to me!” (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
