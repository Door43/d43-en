===== Translation Notes: =====
Isaiah quoted God in [[en:bible:notes:isa:01:10|1:11-20]]. Isaiah is the speaker in 1:21-23.

  * **How the faithful city has become a prostitute**  - This exclamation shows Isaiah's anger and sadness about the people of Jerusalem. Alternate translation: "See how the people of Jerusalem who had been loyal to God have become a prostitute." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **has become a prostitute**  - Isaiah compared the people to a woman who is not loyal to her husband but who sleeps with other men for money. The people were no longer loyal to God but were worshiping false gods. Alternate translation: "acted like a prostitute." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **she who was full of justice**  - The word "she" refers to Jerusalem and its people. In the Bible, cities are often referred to as women. Alternate translation: "the people of Jerusalem were fair and did what was right."
  * **but now she is full of murderers**  - "but now they are murderers"
  * **Your silver has become impure, your wine mixed with water**  - Isaiah compared the sinful people of Jerusalem to two things that were good but were now ruined. Alternate translation: "You are like silver that is no longer pure, and like wine that is mixed with water."
