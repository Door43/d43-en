===== Translation Notes: =====

Isaiah quoted God in [[en:bible:notes:isa:01:27|1:24-26]]. Isaiah 1:27-28 is probably Isaiah writing to the people of Judah.

  * **Zion will be redeemed by justice, and her repentant ones by righteousness** - This can be translated with active verbs. There are two possible meanings: 1) "God will redeem Zion because they do what is just, and he will redeem those who repent because they do what is right before him" or 2) God will redeem Zion because he is just, and he will redeem those who repent because he is righteous." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Zion** - This refers to the people who live in Jerusalem. It can be translated as “those living in Zion.” (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Rebels and sinners will be crushed together** - This can be translated with an active verb: "God will destroy those who rebel and sin against him."
  * **those who abandon Yahweh will be done away with** - This can be translated with an active verb: "And Yahweh will completely do away with those who turn away from him" or "And Yahweh will kill all who  reject him."
