===== Translation Notes: =====

Isaiah 1:29-31 is spoken to the people of Judah and Jerusalem. It is probably God speaking.

  * **the sacred oak trees...gardens** - These phrases refer to places where the people of Judah worshiped idols.
  * **embarrassed by** - "disgraced because of"
  * **For you will be like an oak whose leaf fades, and like a garden that has no water** - The people who were worshiping false gods were being compared to a tree or garden that is dying because it is cut off from what gives it life. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
