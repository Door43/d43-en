===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Isaiah speaks Yahweh's words to the people of Judah in the form of a poem. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **the sacred oak trees ... gardens** - These phrases refer to places where the people of Judah worshiped idols.
  * **you will be embarrassed by** - Some versions read, "you will blush because of." A person blushes when his face turns hot and red, often because he feels that he has done something wrong.
  * **For you will be like an oak whose leaf fades, and like a garden that has no water** - Water gives life to trees and gardens. The people have cut themselves off from Yahweh, who gives them life. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
