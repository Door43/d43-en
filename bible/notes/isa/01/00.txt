====== Isaiah 01 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 1:2-31, which is a vision Isaiah receives. These are the words of Yahweh.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Woe ==
The prophecy of this chapter serves as a warning to the people of the kingdom of Judah. If they do not change their evil ways, Yahweh will punish them. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:woe]], [[:[[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:obe:kt:evil]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphors ==
There are many vivid metaphors used to describe Judah's sin. Their sin is described as a sickness that spreads. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])

== Rhetorical Questions ==
Yahweh uses several rhetorical questions in this chapter. The purpose of these questions is to convince the people of Judah of their sin. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
