===== Translation Notes: =====

God continues to speak to the people of Judah.

  * **Wash, cleanse yourselves**  -  Here God compares  stopping sinning with becoming clean. This can be translated as: “Repent and wash the sin from your heart like you wash the dirt from your body.” (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **remove the evil of your deeds from my sight** - God was not telling them to do their evil deeds somewhere else, but to stop doing them. Alternate translation: "Stop doing the evil deeds that I see you doing." 
  * **the oppressed** - "people who are oppressed" or  "people who are treated cruelly"
  * **give justice to the fatherless** - "be fair to the children who do not have fathers"
  * **defend the widow** - "protect the women whose husbands have died"
