===== Translation Notes: =====

Isaiah 1:31 is probably a continuation of God speaking.

  * **The strong man** - "The strong person" or "Whoever is powerful." This may refer to people who are important and who influence other people.
  * **will be like tinder** - Here, the powerful person is compared to material that is easily broken and burned. Alternate translation: "will be like kindling for a fire." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **tinder** - dry material that is used to start a fire
  * **and his work like a spark** - This compares the person's deeds or evil works to a spark that sets the tinder on fire. Alternate translation: "His work will be like the small flame that starts the fire."
