===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The ox knows his owner, and the donkey his master’s feeding trough, but Israel does not know, Israel does not understand** -  Here God is insulting and scolding the people of Israel by stating that animals know their masters better than Israel knows their master. This could be translated as "Unlike animals who know their masters, the people of Israel do not know that God is their master and he is the one who takes care of them.
  * **a people weighed down with iniquity **  - This compares a person or animal that can barely walk because they are carrying so much weight to how much sin the people of Israel are committing. This could be translated as "your sin is like a heavy bag on your shoulders that is making it hard for you to walk. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:doublet|Metaphor]])
  * **They have abandoned Yahweh, they have despised the Holy One of Israel, they have estranged themselves from him** - These phrases all refer to Israel no longer worshiping Yahweh only. They were worshiping false gods, which God says is like a husband divorcing his wife. This could be translated as "They have left Yahweh, the holy one of Israel. They have turned away from him." (UDB)
