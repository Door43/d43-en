Yahweh continues to speak about the people of Judah.

  * **The ox knows his owner, and the donkey his master’s feeding trough, but Israel does not know, Israel does not understand**  - God is scolding the people of Israel by saying that animals know their masters better than Israel knows their master.
  * **the donkey his master’s feeding trough** - "the donkey knows his master’s feeding trough." Alternate translation: "the donkey knows where his master gives him food."
  * **but Israel does not know, Israel does not understand**  - This probably means "but the people of Israel do not know me, they do not understand that I am the one who cares for them."
  * **Ah** - This word shows the sadness that God feels for the people.
  * **a people weighed down with iniquity**  - This compares their many sins to something very heavy that a person might carry. Alternate translation: "their sin is like a heavy bag on their shoulders that makes it hard for them to walk." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
  * **They have abandoned Yahweh** - "They have turned away from Yahweh" 
  * **they have despised the Holy One of Israel** - "they have rejected the Holy One of Israel" or "they have been disrespectful to the Holy One of Israel"
