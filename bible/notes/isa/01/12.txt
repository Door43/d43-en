===== Translation Notes: =====

God continues to speak to the people of Judah.

  * **who has required this of you, to trample my courts?**  - The word "trample" means to step on and crush with one's feet. God is using a question to scold the people who live in Judah. This could be translated as "no one told you to stomp around in my courtyards." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **Bring no more meaningless offerings**  - "Do not bring me anymore of your worthless gifts"
  * **Incense is an abomination to me**  - "I hate the incense the priests burn"
  * **I cannot tolerate these wicked assemblies**  - "I cannot endure when you gather together because of the wicked things you do"
