===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Isaiah speaks Yahweh's words to the people of Judah in the form of a poem. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **who has required this of you, to trample my courts?** - The word "trample" means to step on and crush with one's feet. God is using a question to scold the people who live in Judah. AT: "no one told you to stomp around in my courtyards!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Bring no more meaningless offerings** - "Do not bring me any more of your worthless gifts"
  * **incense is an abomination to me** - This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "abomination" is expressed as the verb "hate." AT: "I hate the incense the priests burn" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **I cannot tolerate these wicked assemblies** - Possible meanings are 1) "I cannot allow you to gather together because of the wicked things you do" or 2) "I cannot allow myself to watch you gather together because of the wicked things you do."
