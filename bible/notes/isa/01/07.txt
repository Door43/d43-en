===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **your fields–in your presence, strangers are destroying them** - "People who are not from your own country steal the crops in your fields while you watch"
  * **abandoned devastation**  - "empty and devastated." This could be translated as "the land is destroyed and no one lives there."
  * **overthrown by strangers**  - This can be translated with an active verb: "strangers have overthrown your country" or "a foreign army has completely conquered it." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the daughter of Zion** - The ”daughter” of a city means the people of the city. Alternate translations:  "the people of Zion” or ”the people who live in Zion."
  * **is left like a hut in a vineyard, like a shed in a garden of cucumbers**  - "is like a hut in a vineyard or a shed in a garden of cucumbers." A "hut" and a "shed" are shelters that farmers built in the field during the harvest season. After the harvest, the farmers left them, and they quickly fell apart.
  * **like a besieged city**  - This could be translated as a new sentence: "Her enemies have surrounded the city."
