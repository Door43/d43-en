  * **a waste and desolation**  - This could be translated as "the land is destroyed and no one lives there."
  * **as overthrown by strangers** - This compares the destruction in Judah to what a land looks like after an enemy's army has conquered it. This can be translated with an active verb: "like a foreign army has completely conquered it." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:simile]] and [[:en:ta:translate:active]])
  * **The daughter of Zion** - Isaiah refers to Zion or Jerusalem as the daughter of God. This emphasizes that God still loved the people of the city even though he had to punish them for their sins. This could be translated as "Zion" or "the city of Jerusalem" (UDB). (See: [[:en:ta:translate:personification]])
  * **is left as a hut in a vineyard, as a shed in a garden of cucumbers**  - A "hut" and a "shed" are shelters that farmers built in the field during the harvest season.  After the harvest, the farmers would leave them, and they would quickly fall apart. Isaiah is comparing Jerusalem in a destroyed land to shelters falling apart out in a field.
