===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Why are you still being struck?**- Isaiah is using a question to scold the people of Judah. This could be translated as a statement and with an active verb: "There is no reason for God to continue punishing you." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Question]] and [[:en:ta:translate:active|Active or Passive]])
  * **You**- Here the word "you" is plural and refers to the people who live in Judah. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:formsofyou-plural|Forms of 'You' - Dual/Plural]])
  * **Why do you rebel more and more?**- Isaiah is using a question to scold the people of Judah. This could be translated as "You just continue sinning more and more."
  * **The whole head is sick, the whole heart faint.**  Here Isaiah begins a metaphor that compares the nation of Judah to a person who is sick and hurting. Just like there are physical wounds and emotional pain that indicate a person is unhealthy, there are also signs that indicate a nation is continually sinning against God. Isaiah shows some of these signs in 1:7-8. This could be translated as "You are like someone whose whole mind and heart are sick." (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **they have not been closed, cleansed, bandaged, nor treated with oil**  - This can be translated with an active verb: "no one is there to close, cleanse, bandage, or treat them with oil."
