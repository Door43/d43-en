\v 3 Oxen know their owners,
\q2 and donkeys know who feeds them,
\q1 but Israel does not know;
\q2 Israel does not understand."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Isaiah speaks to the people of Judah in the form of a poem. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **Hear, heavens, and give ear, earth** - Although these prophecies were meant for the people of Jerusalem and Judah to hear, Isaiah knows they will not listen. Possible meanings are 1) he speaks in apostrophe, as though the "heavens" and "earth" would be able to listen to what Yahweh said, or 2) the words "heavens" and "earth" are metonyms and a merism for all living beings everywhere. AT: "you who live in the heavens ... you who live on the earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **Yahweh** - This is the name of God that he revealed to his people in the Old Testament. See the translationWord page about Yahweh concerning how to translate this.
  * **I have nourished ... does not understand** - Words that Yahweh spoke and which Isaiah is speaking to the Israelites for Yahweh.
  * **I have nourished and brought up children** - Yahweh speaks as if his words were food and as if the Israelites were his children. AT: "I have taken care of the people living in Judah like they were my children" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the donkey his master's feeding trough** - You can make clear the understood information. AT: "the donkey knows his master's feeding trough" or "the donkey knows where his master gives him food" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **but Israel does not know, Israel does not understand** - This probably means "but the people of Israel do not know me, they do not understand that I am the one who cares for them."
  * **Israel** - This is a metonym for the people of Israel. Judah is part of what had been the nation of Israel. AT: "the people of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
