===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Hear, heavens, and listen, earth** - Although these prophecies were meant for the people of Jerusalem and Judah to hear, Isaiah told the "heavens" and "earth" to listen to what Yahweh said. By doing this, he emphasized how bad the people were. They were so bad that he was telling the heavens and earth about their sins. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **I have nourished and brought up children** - This is what Yahweh was saying. AT: "I have taken care of the people living in Judah like they were my children" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **The ox knows his owner, and the donkey his master's feeding trough, but Israel does not know, Israel does not understand** - God is scolding the people of Israel by saying that animals know their masters better than Israel knows their master.
  * **the donkey his master's feeding trough** - "the donkey knows his master's feeding trough" or "the donkey knows where his master gives him food"
  * **but Israel does not know, Israel does not understand** - This probably means "but the people of Israel do not know me, they do not understand that I am the one who cares for them."
  * **Israel** - This refers to the nation of Israel. The kingdom of Judah was a part of it.
