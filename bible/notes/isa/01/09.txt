  * **Yahweh of Hosts **- "Yahweh, the Leader of the angel armies,"
  * **usâ€¦we**  - Here these words refer to Isaiah and includes all the people of Judah and Jerusalem. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive|Inclusive]])
  * **we would have been like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah**  - How Judah would have been like Sodom and Gomorrah can be made explicit: "we would have all been destroyed, like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed." (UDB) (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]])
