===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **let us reason together** - "let us think about this together." Here the word "us" refers to God and includes the people of Judah. (See: [[en:ta:translate:inclusive]])
  * **your sins are as scarlet, they will be white as snow**- God is comparing someone's sins being forgiven to something with a bright red color becoming white. The color "white" is often a symbol for holiness or purity. And, "snow" refers to frozen rain that is very white. If snow is unknown you could replace it with something else white like "white as a seashell" or "white as a dove." (See: [[en:ta:translate:simile]])
  * **they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool**- This is saying in different words the same thing as the first simile. Here, "crimson" refers to a dark red. The word "wool" refers to the hair of a sheep or goat. The phrase "as white as" is left out here but it is understood. This could be translated as "they are dark red, they will be as white as wool." (See: [[en:ta:translate:doublet]] and [[en:ta:translate:ellipsis]])
