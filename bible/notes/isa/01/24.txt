===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Therefore** - "For that reason"
  * **this is the declaration of the Lord** - "thus declares the Lord"
  * **I will take vengeance against my adversaries, and avenge myself against my enemies** - Both of these phrases mean basically the same thing. AT: "I will punish those who opposed me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **I will turn my hand against you** - Here "hand" refers to God's power which he would use to punish his people. AT: "I will turn my power against you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **refine away your dross, and take away all your impurities** - This is what God would do. God compared removing the sin from his people to using fire to remove dirt from silver. AT: "and like fire removing the dirt from silver, I will remove all the evil from among you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
