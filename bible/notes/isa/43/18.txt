Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.
 
  * **former things…the things of long ago** - "what happened in the past" (See: Doublet)
  * **Look** - "Listen" or "Pay attention"
  * **do you not perceive it?** - Yahweh uses a question to teach the people of Israel. AT: "Surely you have noticed it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
