===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **say to the north...to the south** - Yahweh speaks to these directions as if commanding the nations in those locations. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **my sons...my daughters** - This means all of God's people. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **everyone who is called by my name** - This means everyone who belongs to God and worships him. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) AT: "Everyone whom Yahweh calls by his name and creates for his glory" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **whom I have formed, yes, whom I have made** - Both of these mean the same thing and emphasize that it is God who made the people of Israel. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
