  * **say to the north ... to the south** - Yahweh speaks to "the north" and "the south" as if commanding the nations in those locations. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **my sons ... my daughters** - Yahweh speaks of the people who belong to him as if they were his children. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **everyone who is called by my name** - Here to be called by someone's name represents belonging to that person. This can be stated in active form. AT: "everyone whom I have called by my name" or "everyone who belongs to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **whom I have formed, yes, whom I have made** - Both of these mean the same thing and emphasize that it is God who made the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
