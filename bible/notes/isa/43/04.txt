===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **Since you are precious and special in my sight** - The words "precious" and "special" mean basically the same thing and emphasize how much Yahweh values his people. AT: "Because you are very precious to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **therefore I will give people in exchange for you, and other peoples in exchange for your life** - Both phrases mean the same thing. AT: "therefore I will let the enemy conquer other peoples instead of you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **I will bring your offspring from the east, and gather you from the west** - The directions "east" and "west" form a merism and represent from every direction. AT: "I will bring you and your offspring from every direction" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
