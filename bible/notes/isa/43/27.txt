===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **I will hand Jacob over to the destructive ban, and Israel to abusive humiliation** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The words "Jacob" and "Israel" both refer to the people of Israel. AT: "I will allow the enemy to completely destroy and humiliate the people of Israel." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
