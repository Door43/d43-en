  * **sweet-smelling cane** - This is a plant with a pleasant smell used to make anointing oil. It did not grow in the land of Israel so the people had to buy it from other nations.
  * **burdened me with your sins, you have wearied me with your evil deeds** - These both mean the same thing and emphasize the complaint Yahweh has with his people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **burdened me with your sins** - "troubled me with your sins"
