<usfm>
\v 24 You have bought for me fragrant reeds,

\q2 and made me weary because of all your iniquities\f + \ft Or: the wrong things that you have done \f*.

<usfm>
\v 24 You have not bought for me any fragrant reeds,

\q2 and made me weary because of all your iniquities.

<usfm>
\q1
\v 24 You have bought me no sweet-smelling cane with money, neither have you poured out to me the fat of your sacrifices;

===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.
  * **sweet-smelling cane** - This is a plant with a pleasant smell used to make anointing oil. It did not grow in the land of Israel so the people had to buy it from other nations.
  * **burdened me with your sins, you have wearied me with your evil deeds** - These both mean the same thing and emphasize the complaint Yahweh has with his people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **burdened me with your sins** - "troubled me with your sins"
