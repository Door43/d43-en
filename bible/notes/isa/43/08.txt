===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the blind people ... the deaf** - Yahweh speaks of those who do not listen to him or obey him as if they were blind and deaf. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Who among them could have declared this and announced to us earlier events?** - This rhetorical question applies to the gods whom the people of the nations worship. The implied answer is that none of them could do this. AT: "None of their gods could have declared this or announced to us earlier events." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **announced to us earlier events** - This refers their ability to tell about events that happened in the past before they happened. AT: "announced to us earlier events before they happened" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Let them bring their witnesses to prove themselves right, let them listen and affirm, 'It is true.'** - Yahweh challenges the gods whom the nations worship to provide witnesses who will testify that they have been able to do these things, although he knows that they cannot do so. AT: "These gods have no witnesses who will prove them right, witnesses who will listen and affirm, 'It is true'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
