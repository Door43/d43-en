===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the blind people...the deaf** - This refers to those who are spiritually blind and deaf. This means they do not listen to or obey God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Who among them could have declared this and announced to us earlier events?** - Here "us" refers to Isaiah and the people of Israel. Isaiah uses a question to mock the people of other nations and their idols. AT: "None of them could have declared this or told us what would happen in the future" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Let them bring their witnesses to prove themselves right,  let them listen and affirm, 'It is true."** - Isaiah challenges them to prove that the idols could tell them the future. But, he knows they cannot. AT: "None of them can say they heard their idol tell what would happen in the future." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
