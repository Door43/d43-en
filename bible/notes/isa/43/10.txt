===== translationNotes: =====

  * **You ... my servant** - Here "you" is plural and refers to the people of Israel. The phrase "my servant" refers to the nation, as a whole. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_youdual]])
  * **Before me ... after me** - In speaking this way, Yahweh is not saying that there was a time before which he did not exist or a time after which he will not exist. He is asserting that he is eternal and that the gods whom the people of other nations worship are not.
  * **Before me there was no god formed** - Here the word "formed" indicates that Yahweh is speaking of idols that people have made. This can be stated in active form. AT: "None of the gods whom people have formed existed before me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **there will be none after me** - "none of those gods will exist after me"
  * **I, I am Yahweh** - The word "I" is repeated to emphasize the focus on Yahweh. AT: "I alone am Yahweh" or "I myself am Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **there is no savior but me** - This can be expressed positively. AT: "I am the only savior" or "I am the only one who can save you"
