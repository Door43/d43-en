===== translationNotes: =====

  * **when my sword will have drunk its fill in heaven** - Yahweh is satisfied with destroying the heavens like a person puts a sword down when he has finished killing people. "Drunk its fill" makes the sword sound like a person who is finally satisfied. AT: "When I am finished destroying the objects in heaven" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * ** Yahweh speaks of himself being satisfied with what he had destroyed in heaven as if his sword were a person that had eaten and become satisfied. 
  * **it will now come down on Edom, on the people I am setting apart for destruction** - This continues the symbolism of the sword. AT: "I will now come to punish the people Edom whom I have set aside so that I may destroy them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **The sword of Yahweh is dripping with blood and covered with fat, dripping with the blood of lambs and goats, covered with the fat of the kidneys of rams** - Because of their sins, Yahweh slaughters the people of Edom the way priests sacrifice animals.
  * **Bozrah** - an important city in Edom (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
