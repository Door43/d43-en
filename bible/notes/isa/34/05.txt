===== translationNotes: =====

  * **when my sword will have drunk its fill in heaven** - Yahweh refers to himself here by his "sword." Also, Yahweh speaks of being satisfied with destroying the heavens as if he were a person putting down his sword after killing people. The phrase "drunk its fill" makes the sword sound like a person who is finally satisfied. AT: "When I am finished destroying the objects in heaven" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **look** - This word is used here to draw the listener's attention and to have them imagine the things being said. AT: "listen" or "and then" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **it will now come down on Edom, on the people I am setting apart for destruction** - The word "it" refers to Yahweh's sword continuing the imagery of Yahweh destroying things with a sword. Edom refers to the people who live there. AT: "I will come to punish the people Edom whom I have set aside so that I may destroy them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **The sword of Yahweh is dripping with blood and covered with fat, dripping with the blood of lambs and goats, covered** - Because of their sins, Yahweh slaughters the people of Edom the way priests sacrifice animals. AT: "Yahweh's sword will be like a sword dripping in blood and covered with fat that has been used to sacrifice lambs and goats. It will be covered"
  * **Bozrah** - an important city in Edom (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **For Yahweh has a sacrifice in Bozrah and a great slaughter in the land of Edom** - The words "sacrifice" and "slaughter" may be expressed here as verbs. AT: "For Yahweh has sacrificed many people in Bozrah and killed many people in the land of Edom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
