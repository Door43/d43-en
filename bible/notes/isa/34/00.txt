=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Destruction ==
There are many images used in this chapter which describe destruction. Each of these metaphors describe complete destruction. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Prophecy ==

This chapter appears to prophesy about a time of restoration when the messiah will reign. This chapter pictures a time of great peace and harmony in the world. The translator should not add explanation, but should try to maintain the tense of the original text, as a future or uncompleted action. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:obe:kt:fulfill]])
