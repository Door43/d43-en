===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Wild oxen will be slaughtered along with them, and young bull with the older ones** - The ox was not a usual animal to sacrifice. This again emphasizes that all will be slaughtered, rich, poor, young and old.
  * **Their land will be drunk with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness** - "Their land will be covered in blood and their fields will become fertile from the fat of the animals"
