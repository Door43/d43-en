\q1
\v 3 Their slain will be left unburied; the stench of their dead bodies will be everywhere, 
\q1 and the mountains will be soaked with their blood.
\q1
\v 4 All the stars of the sky will fade away, 
\q1 and the sky will be rolled up like a scroll; and all their stars will fade away, 
\q1 as the leaf fades from off the vine, and as the overripe figs from the fig tree.
