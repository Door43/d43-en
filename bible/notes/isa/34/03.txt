\q1
\v 3 The bodies of their dead will be thrown out. The stench of the dead bodies will be everywhere;
\q1 and the mountains will soak up their blood.
\q1
\v 4 All the stars of the sky will fade away,
\q1 and the sky will be rolled up like a scroll; and all their stars will fade away,
\q1 as the leaf fades from off the vine, and as the overripe figs from the fig tree.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The bodies of their dead will be thrown out** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "No one will bury their dead" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **their dead** - This refers to the dead people. AT: "those who died" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]])
  * **the mountains will soak up their blood** - "the mountains will be covered in their blood"
  * **the sky will be rolled up like a scroll** - This can be stated in active form. This compares what Yahweh will do to the sky to a person rolling up a scroll. AT: "Yahweh will roll up the sky in the same way that a person rolls up a scroll" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **all their stars will fade away, as the leaf fades from off the vine, and as the overripe figs from the fig tree** - This emphasizes even the things in the sky that people thought would be there forever will fall as easily as a leaf. AT: "all the stars will fall from the sky like a leaf falls from a vine or a fig falls from a tree" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
