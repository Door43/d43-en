====== Isaiah 32 General Notes ======

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation.


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Reign of the Messiah ==
This chapter appears to prophesy about a time of restoration when the messiah will reign. This chapter pictures a time of great peace and harmony in the world. The translator should not add explanation, but should try to maintain the tense of the original text, as a future or uncompleted action. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:christ]], [[:en:obe:kt:fulfill]] and [[:en:obe:kt:lastday]])
