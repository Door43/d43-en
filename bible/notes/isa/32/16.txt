===== Translation Notes: =====
Isaiah continues speaking.
  * **justice will reside...righteousness will live** - Isaiah describes "justice" and "righteousness" as a person who lives in these places. This means the people who live in these places will do what is just and right. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
