\v 4 The rash will think carefully with understanding, and the stutterer will speak distinctly and with ease.
\q1
\v 5 The fool will no longer be  called honorable, nor the deceiver called principled.
\q1
\v 6 For the fool speaks folly, and his heart plans evil
\q1 and godless actions, and he speaks wrongly against Yahweh. 
\q1 He makes the hungry empty, and the thirsty he causes to lack drink.
