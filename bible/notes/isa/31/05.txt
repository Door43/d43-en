  * **Yahweh of hosts** - Translate this phrase the same as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:01:09|1:9]].

  * **Return to him from whom you have deeply turned away** - "Return to the one against whom you have rebelled"
  * **that your own hands have sinfully made** - "Hands" refers to something a person has made by hand. AT: "that you have made with your own hands. Making them was a sin against God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
