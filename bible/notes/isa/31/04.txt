\q1
\v 4 This is what Yahweh says to me,
\q1 "As a lion, even a young lion, growls over its torn prey,
\q1 when a group of shepherds is called out against it,
\q1 but it does not tremble at their voices, nor creep away from their sound;
\q1 thus Yahweh of hosts will descend to fight on Mount Zion, on that hill.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh speaks to Isaiah.

  * **As a lion ... thus Yahweh of hosts** - "A lion ... in the same way Yahweh of hosts." Here Yahweh speaks of how he will defend the people who belong to him and not be scared away by comparing himself to a lion who guards it's prey. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **thus Yahweh of hosts will descend ... that hill** - It may be more clear if you move the last line to before the first line: "Yahweh of hosts will descend to fight on Mount Zion, on that hill, as a lion, even a young lion"
  * **a lion, even a young lion** - "a female lion or killer lion." This is a doublet with both phrase referring to a fierce lion. AT: "a lion" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **growls** - warns others to stay away
  * **when a group of shepherds is called out against it** - The phrase "called out against it" means to be sent out to chase the lion away. This can be stated in active form. AT: "when someone sends shepherds to chase the lion away" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] or [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **from their sound** - The shepherds would make loud noises to try and chase away the lion. AT: "from the loud noises that they make" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
