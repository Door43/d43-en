\v 4 This is what Yahweh says to me,  
\q1 "As a lion, even a young lion, growls over its torn prey, 
\q1 when a group of shepherds is called out against it, 
\q1 but it does not tremble  at their voices, nor creep away from  their sound; 
\q1 thus Yahweh of hosts will descend  to fight on Mount Zion, on that hill.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh speaks to Isaiah.

  * **As a young lion… that hill** - Yahweh will defend those people who belong to him, and no one can scare him away. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **thus Yahweh of hosts will descend…that hill** - It may be more clear if you move the last line to before the first line: "Yahweh of hosts will descend to fight on Mount Zion, on that hill, as a lion, even a young lion…"
  * **lion, even a young lion** - "female lion or killer lion." You may need to translate as one word, "lion."
  * **growls** - warns others to stay away
  * **when a group of shepherds is called out against it** - AT: "when someone sends shepherds to stop the lion" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
