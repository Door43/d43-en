\v 4 This is what Yahweh says to me,  
\q1 "As a lion, even a young lion, growls over its torn prey, 
\q1 when a group of shepherds is called out against it, 
\q1 but it does not tremble  at their voices, nor creep away from  their sound; 
\q1 thus Yahweh of Hosts will descend  to fight on Mount Zion, on that hill.
