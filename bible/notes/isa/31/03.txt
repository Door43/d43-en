  * **Egypt is a man** - Here Egypt refers to the soldiers of Egypt. AT: "The soldiers of Egypt are men"
  * **their horses flesh and not spirit** - This means that their horses are only horses and not spiritual beings. AT: "their horses are only horses; they are not powerful spirits!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **When Yahweh reaches out with his hand** - The term "hand" is often used in reference to God's power and action. AT: "When Yahweh uses his power against them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
