===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Judah, referring to the Assyrians as though they are one person.

  * **Assyria will fall by the sword; a sword not wielded by man will consume him** - "Sword" refers to military might. This can be stated in active form. AT: "God's sword, and not a man's sword, will destroy the Assyrian army" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **He will flee** - "The Assyrians will flee"
  * **all confidence because of terror** - The word "terror" can be expressed with the adjective "terrified." AT: "all of their confidence because they are terrified" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **and his young men will be forced to do hard labor** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "and enemies will capture their young men and force them to do hard labor" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **and his princes** - "and their leaders"
  * **at the sight of Yahweh's battle flag** - The word "sight" can be expressed with the verb "see." AT: "when they see the flag of Yahweh's army" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **the declaration of Yahweh** - This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "declaration" is expressed as the verb "solemnly said." See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:14:21|14:22]]. AT: "what Yahweh of hosts has declared" or "what Yahweh of hosts has solemnly said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **whose fire is in Zion and whose firepot is in Jerusalem** - Both of these clauses mean the same thing and are used together for emphasis. Here God's presence and his power to judge and destroy are spoken of as if they were a fire. AT: "whose powerful presence is in Zion" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
