===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking to the Israelites, referring to the Assyrians as though they are one person.

  * **Assyria will fall by the sword, a sword not wielded by man will consume him** - AT: "God's sword, and not a man's sword, will destroy the Assyrian army." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **he will flee** - "the Assyrians will flee"
  * **and his young men will be forced to do hard labor** - AT: "and enemies will capture their young men and force them to do hard labor" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **and his princes** - "and their leaders"
  * **at the Yahweh's battle flag** - "when they see the flag of Yahweh's army." See how you translated "flag" in [[en:bible:notes:isa:05:26|5:26]]. 
  * **declaration of Yahweh** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:isa:14:21|14:22]].
  * **whose fire is in Zion and whose firepot is in Jerusalem** - Both of these clauses mean the same thing and are used together for emphasis. Here fire and firepot refer to God's presence and his power to judge and destroy. AT: "whose powerful presence is in Zion." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
