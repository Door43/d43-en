  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Judah, referring to the Assyrians as though they are one person.

  * **Assyria will fall by the sword; a sword not wielded by man will consume him** - "Sword" refers to military might. This can be stated in active form. AT: "God's sword, and not a man's sword, will destroy the Assyrian army" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **He will flee** - "The Assyrians will flee"
  * **They will lose all confidence because of terror** - The word "confidence" can be expressed with the adjective "confident." The word "terror" can be expressed with the adjective "terrified." AT: "They will no longer be confident because they are so terrified" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **his young men will be forced to do hard labor** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "enemies will capture their young men and force them to do hard labor" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])

  * **whose fire is in Zion and whose firepot is in Jerusalem** - Both of these clauses mean the same thing and are used together for emphasis. Here God's presence and his power to judge and destroy are spoken of as if they were a fire.
