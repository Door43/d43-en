===What is Isaiah about?===
Isaiah lived in Jerusalem and warned Judah about the coming destruction of the nation Israel. The book records many of the [[:en:obe:kt:prophet|prophecies]] of Isaiah. In a difficult time, Isaiah gives the nation hope in the [[:en:obe:kt:redeem|redemption]] of the coming of the [[:en:obe:kt:christ|messiah]].


===How should the title of this book be translated?=== 
It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). "Isaiah" may also be called the "The book about Isaiah" or "The sayings of Isaiah."

===Who wrote Isaiah?===
Some believe that is the product of more than one author. However, it is likely that the prophet Isaiah wrote the whole book. The New Testament attributes the whole book to Isaiah.

===When did Isaiah live?===
The prophet Isaiah wrote this great book about 740-700 BC, when the Assyrian empire increased in power. Isaiah prophesied in Judah during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, and Manasseh. The period of Isaiah’s ministry is also found in the 2 Kings 19-20. Isaiah sees the rising power of the Assyrian empire. When he lived, Babylon was not a major force, but a hundred years later, Babylon was the dominate power in the world. Yahweh gives Isaiah a vision of the rise and power of Babylon and the coming destruction of Israel. 

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====
===Did Isaiah teach that the messiah of Israel was to be a conquering king or a suffering servant?===
While most of Israel expected the Messiah to be a conquering king, Isaiah does explain that the Messiah will also be a servant of the Lord who suffers for the sins of the people. The messiah will offer both spiritual and physical deliverance but this does not mean they will happen at the same time.

===What are the [[:en:obe:kt:lastday|last days]]?===

The book of Isaiah is one of the first books to deal with the topic of the last days or the end times. Isaiah explains that there will be a future kingdom of Israel, centered around Jerusalem, where the world will come to learn about and worship Yahweh. There will also be peace in the world.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

===What is the meaning of the term Israel?===
Israel is used in many different ways in Scripture. The descendants of Jacob, also known as Israel, were a people group who became known as Israel.  This people group is also the [[:en:obe:other:israel|nation of Israel]]. After the civil war in the nation of Israel, the tribes in the north took the name Israel, which is a reference to the "[[:en:obe:other:kingdomofisrael|kingdom of Israel]]." Isaiah references both the northern kingdom of Israel and the whole nation of Israel as "Israel".

===How do I translate a book of prophecy?===
A book of prophecy is considerably different than history or narrative. Isaiah often convicts his reader of their sin and their need to fear or worship Yahweh. He does this using poetic language and unique vocabulary. Occasionally, he gives a prophecy without mentioning the subject. The reader may or may not immediately understand who the prophecy is about. Chapter 53 is a prophecy about the Messiah but Isaiah never explicitly mentions the messiah.
