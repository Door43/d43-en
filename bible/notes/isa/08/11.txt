===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Yahweh spoke to me, with his strong hand upon me** - Here "his strong hand upon me" is an idiom that refers to Yahweh's power. AT: "Yahweh spoke to me in a very powerful way" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **warned me not to walk in the way of this people.** - This is an indirect quote that ends in 8:17. AT: "warned me and said, 'Do not act like this people.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **Do not call conspiracy anything that this people calls conspiracy** - The people imagine there are conspiracies, and it makes them anxious. AT: "Do not worry like this people who think someone is always trying to harm them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **It is Yahweh of hosts whom you will honor as holy; he is the one you must fear, and he is the one you must dread** - If you translate this as a direct quote, you can also translate it with Yahweh speaking in the first person: "But you will consider me, Yahweh of Hosts, as holy. And you will fear and be in awe of me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]])
