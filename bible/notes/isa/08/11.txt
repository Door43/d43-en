===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Yahweh  spoke  to me, with his strong hand upon me** - "Yahweh spoke to me in a very powerful way"
  * **and warned me not to walk in the way of this people** - "and warned me not to act like this people." This is an indirect quote that ends in 8:17. AT: "and warned me and said, 'do not act like this people.'" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **Do not call conspiracy anything that this people calls conspiracy** - AT: "Do not worry like this people who think someone is always trying to harm them."
  * **Yahweh of Hosts, him you will treat as holy; him you will fear, him you will be in awe of** - If you translate this as a direct quote you can also translate it with Yahweh speaking in the first person: "But, you will consider me, Yahweh of Hosts, as holy. And, you will fear and be in awe of me."
