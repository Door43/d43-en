===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **and it will sweep onward into Judah, flooding and passing on, until it reaches to the your neck **- This means that the Assyrian army will sweep over the land like flood waters overflowing a riverbank.  It  can be translated as, "and the soldiers will go all over Judah, like a river whose waters rises as high as a person's neck." (UDB) (See: Metaphor)
  * **Its outstretched wings will fill your entire land **  - This compares a flood spreading out from the river to an eagle soaring with wings spread wide.  It compares that to how the army will spread over the land.  It can be translated as, "Their army will spread over the land quickly, like an eagle" (UDB)
  * **O Immanuel**  -  Yet there is hope because "Immanuel" means Yahweh will be with you.
