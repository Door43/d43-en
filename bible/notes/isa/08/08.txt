===== Translation Notes: =====
The Lord continues to describe the army of Assyria as a river that will flood Judah. (See: [[en:bible:notes:isa:08:05|8:7]])
  * **and it will sweep onward into Judah, flooding and passing on, until it reaches to the your neck** - "and more and more soldiers will come like waters rising up to your neck" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) AT: "The army will spread out over your entire land like a bird spreading its wings over its prey."
  * **O Immanuel** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:isa:07:13|7:14]].
