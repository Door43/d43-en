===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Bind up my testimony, seal the the official record** - AT: "Close up tightly the scroll with this message written on it." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **my testimony...my disciples** - It is unclear to whom the word "my" refers. It could be Isaiah or Yahweh. It is best to leave the pronouns ambiguous if your language will allow it. 
  * **I will wait for Yahweh** - Here "I" refers to Isaiah.
  * **who hides his face from the house of Jacob** - AT: "who has taken away his blessing from the people of Israel." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I and the sons whom Yahweh has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel** - "I and the sons Yahweh has given me are like signs to warn the people of Israel." The sons are Shear-Jashub and Maher-shalal-hash-baz whose names are a message to the people of Israel. (See: [[en:bible:notes:isa:07:03|7:3]] and [[en:bible:notes:isa:08:01|8:1]])
