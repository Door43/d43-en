===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Because this people have refused the gentle waters of Shiloah **- Water was collected into a pool at Shiloah. This water was moved from Shiloah to Jerusalem through a narrow trough. These gentle, flowing waters are compared to the teachings of the Lord that were always available to lead the people of Jerusalem. It can be translated as "Because this people have rejected Yahweh's help which is like the getle waters of Shiloah" (See: Metaphor)
  * **and are happy over Rezin and Remaliah's son - **  Instead of following Yahweh, the people of Jerusalem looked to Rezin, King of Syria and Remaliah's son, Pekah, the king of Samaria. It can be translated “The people of Jerusalem trust Rezin and Remaliah’s son to keep them safe”
  * **therefore the Lord is about to bring up on them the waters of the River, mighty and many, the king of Assyria and all his glory****- **  This means that since the people have turned away from the gentle waters of Shiloah, they will be caught up by the fast flowing river which refers to the king of Assyria and his great army. It can be translated as, "therefore, the Lord will cause the people of Judah to be attacked by the powerful army of the king of Assyria, which will be like a great flood from the Euphrates River"
