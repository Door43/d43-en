===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Because this people have refused the gentle waters of Shiloah** - These gentle, flowing waters are compared to the teachings of the Lord that were always available to lead the people of Jerusalem. AT: "Because this people have rejected Yahweh's help which is like the gentle waters of Shiloah." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **and are happy over Rezin and Remaliah’s son** - See how you translated these names in [[en:bible:notes:isa:07:01|7:1]]. The full meaning can be made explicit: "and are happy that the armies of Assyria have defeated Rezin, king of Aram, and Pekah, Remaliah's son, king of Israel." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **therefore the Lord is** - Yahweh is still speaking. He refers to himself as "the Lord." AT: "therefore I am."
  *  **up on them** - "up on the people of Judah" 
  * **the waters of the River, mighty and many, the king of Assyria and all his glory** - AT: "the army from Assyria that is powerful like a mighty river."
