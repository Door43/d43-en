\p
\v 19 They will say to you, "Consult with the mediums and magicians," those who chirp and
mutter incantations. But should a people not consult their God?
Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living?
\v 20 So you must pay attention to the law and the testimony! If they do not say such things, it is because they have no light of dawn.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Isaiah is speaking.

  * **They will say to you** - The word "they" refers to those who do not trust Yahweh. The word "you" is plural and refers to those who trust Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_youdual]])
  * **Consult with** - "Talk with"
  * **mediums and magicians** - "witches and wizards." This refers to those who said they could speak with those who had died.
  * **those who chirp and mutter incantations** - The words "chirp" and "mutter" refer to the sounds mediums and magicians made when trying to speak to dead people. AT: "those who whisper and mutter their magic words to try and speak to dead people"
  * **But should a people not consult their God? Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living?** - These questions are to show that people could consult God instead of the foolish activity of trying to talk to dead people. AT: "But people should ask Yahweh to guide them. They should not seek answers from those who have died" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **If they do not say such things** - "if they do not speak of the law and the testimony"
  * **it is because they have no light of dawn** - This refers to people who live in spiritual darkness. AT: "it is because they are like a person lost in the dark" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
