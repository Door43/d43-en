===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Isaiah continues to give an indirect quote of Yahweh. It can be translated as a direct quote and with Yahweh speaking in the first person. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:isa:08:11|8:11-13]])

  * **He will** - "I will" (UDB)
  * **He will become a sanctuary** - Sanctuary is a symbol of safeness and protection. AT: "I will be like a sanctuary and I will protect you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **but he will be a stone that strikes them, and a rock that makes them fall** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **stone ... rock** - The stone is a symbol for something people trip over to their harm. AT: "but for those who do not consider me holy I will be like a stone that they will trip over" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **And he will be a trap and a snare to the people of Jerusalem.** - The words "trap" and "snare" mean the same thing. AT: "And for the people in Jerusalem that do not fear me, I will be like a trap" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Many will stumble over it and fall and be broken, and be ensnared and captured** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Many people will stumble over the stone, and when they fall they will not get up. And, many people will step into the trap, and they will not be able to get out" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **ensnared and captured** - These two words mean basically the same thing and emphasize that they will be caught in the trap. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
