===== Translation Notes: =====
Isaiah continues to give an indirect quote of Yahweh. It can be translated as a direct quote and with Yahweh speaking in the first person. (See: [[en:bible:notes:isa:08:11|8:11-13]])
  * **He will** - AT: "I will" (UDB)
  * **be a sanctuary** - Yahweh compares himself to a sanctuary. This emphasizes that people can rely on God to protect them. Alternate translation: "I will be like a sanctuary and I will protect you." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
  * **but he will be a stone that makes one trip and a rock that makes one stumble** - Both of these phrases mean basically the same thing are used for emphasis. Yahweh compares himself to a stone that cause people to fall when they walk blindly into it. And here the words "trip" and "stumble" refer to a person failing in a spiritual way. Alternate translation: "but for those who do not consider me holy I will be like a stone that they will trip over." (See: [[en:ta:translate:parallelism]] and [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]]) 
  * **to both the houses of Israel, as a trap and as a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem** - AT: "For the people in Israel and Jerusalem that do not fear me, I will be like a trap." (See: [[en:ta:translate:doublet]])
  * **Many will stumble over it and fall and be broken, and be ensnared and captured** - AT: "Many people will stumble over the stone, and when they fall they will not get up. And, many people will step into the trap, and they will not be able to get out." (See: [[en:ta:translate:active]])
