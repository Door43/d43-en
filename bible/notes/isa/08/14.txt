===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Isaiah continues the indirect quote of Yahweh that began in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:08:11|8:11-13]]. It can be translated as a direct quote with Yahweh speaking in the first person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]])
  * **He will become a sanctuary** - The word "sanctuary" is a metaphor for Yahweh keeping his people safe and protecting them. AT: "He will protect them when they go to him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he will be a stone of striking, and a rock of stumbling** - The words "stone of striking" and "rock of stumbling" are both metaphors for Yahweh harming his people. Some translate "striking" and "stumbling" as "stumbling" and "falling"; others translate as "offense" and "stumbling." AT: "he will harm his people, like a stone against which people strike their feet and stumble, and like a rock that causes people to fall down" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **And he will be a trap and a snare to the people of Jerusalem** - The words "trap" and "snare" mean almost the same thing and emphasize that when Yahweh decides to punish the people of Jerusalem they will not be able to escape. AT: "And he will trap the people of Jerusalem so they cannot escape him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **trap** - here a trap that catches a bird in a net or basket
  * **snare** - here a trap that catches and holds an animal's leg or nose
  * **Many will stumble over it and fall and be broken, and be ensnared and captured** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Many people will stumble over the stone, and when they fall they will not get up. And many people will step into the trap, and they will not be able to get out" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **ensnared and captured** - These two words mean basically the same thing and emphasize that they will be caught in the trap. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
