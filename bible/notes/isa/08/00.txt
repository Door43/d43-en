====== Isaiah 08 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 8:6-18, 21-22, which are important quotations.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Trust in Yahweh ==
Israel will not trust in Yahweh. Instead, they will trust in their own power, their Gentile allies and the power of false gods. They will be punished because the power of Yahweh is greater than all of these. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:trust]] and [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod]])
