===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting statement** - Verse 3 tells what the messengers in [[en:bible:notes:isa:18:01|18:2]] must say to the people of the world.

  * **All you inhabitants of the world ... you who live on the earth** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. AT: "All you people on the earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **when a signal is lifted up on the mountains, look; and when the trumpet is blown, listen** - The signal and trumpet were to call people to battle. The commands to look and listen are commands to pay attention and prepare for battle. AT: "pay attention when the signal is lifted up on the mountains and the trumpet is blown" 
  * **when a signal is lifted up on the mountains, look** - The signal was a flag used to call people to battle. This can be stated in active form. AT: "pay attention when you see the battle flag on the mountains." See how you translated "signal" in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:05:26|5:26]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) 
  * **when the trumpet is blown, listen** - The trumpets were used to call people to battle. This can be stated in active form. AT: "pay attention when you hear the sound of the battle trumpets" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
