\q2 as quietly as the dew forms \add on the ground\add* during harvest time."
\q1
\v 5 But even before the army of Ethiopia starts to attack,
\q2 while their plans are \add slowly forming\add* like \f + \ft simile \f* grapes that are ripening,
\q1 Yahweh will \add get rid of them like a farmer who\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* cuts off the new shoots of the grapevines with his shears,
\q2 and prunes the branches that have become very long.

\v 4 This is what Yahweh said to me, "I will quietly observe from my home,
\q1 like the simmering heat in sunshine, like a cloud of mist in the heat of harvest."
\q1
\v 5 Before the harvest, when the blossoming is over, and the flower is ripening into a grape,
\q1 he will cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and he will cut down and take away the spreading branches.
