\v 4 This is what Yahweh said to me, "I will quietly observe from my home, 
\q1 like the simmering heat in sunshine, like a cloud of mist in the heat of harvest."
\q1
\v 5 Before the harvest, when the blossoming is over, and the flower is ripening into a grape, 
\q1 he will cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and  he will cut down and take away the spreading branches.

  * **pruning hooks** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:isa:02:04|2:4]].
