===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the rebellious children** - This refers to the people of Judah.
  * **declaration of Yahweh** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:14:21|14:22]].
  * **They make plans, but not from me; they make alliances with other nations, but they were not directed by my Spirit** - Both phrases mean the same thing and are used for emphasis. AT: "They make plans and ally with others but I do not approve" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **They seek protection from Pharaoh** - his can be reworded so that the abstract noun "protection" is expressed as the verb "protect." AT: "They ask Pharaoh to protect them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **take refuge in the shadow of Egypt** - Egypt's protection from enemy armies is spoken of as if it were a shadow that protects someone from the burning heat of the sun. AT: "make themselves feel secure in the protection that Egypt offers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
