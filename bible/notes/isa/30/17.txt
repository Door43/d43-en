===== translationNotes: =====

  * **One thousand will flee at the threat of one; at the threat of five you will flee** - The word "solider" is understood. AT: "One thousand soldiers will flee at the threat of one enemy soldier; at the threat of five enemy soldiers all of your soldiers will flee" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **One thousand** - "1,000" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **until your remnant will be like a flagstaff on the top of a mountain, or like a flag on a hill** - This simile means there will be so few people left that they will be like a single flag on top of a hill. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
