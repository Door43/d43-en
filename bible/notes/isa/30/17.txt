===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **One thousand** - "1,000" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **until your remnant will be like a flagstaff on the top of a mountain, or like an flag on a hill** - This emphasizes that very few people will remain in Jerusalem. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
