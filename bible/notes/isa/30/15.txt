\q1
\v 15 For this is what the Lord Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel says, 
\q1 "In returning and resting you will be saved; in quietness and in
trust will be your strength. 
\q1 But you were not willing.
\q1
\v 16 You said, 'No, 
\q1 for we will flee on horses,' so you will flee; 
\q1 and, 'We will ride upon swift horses,' so those who pursue you will be swift.
