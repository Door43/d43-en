\v 15 Yahweh, our God, the Holy One of Israel, also says this:
\q1 "You will be rescued \add from your enemies\add* only if you repent and trust \add in what I will do for you\add*;
\q2 you will be strong only if you quit worrying and trust in me.
\q1 But you do not want to do that.
\q1
\v 16 You said, 'No, we will escape on horses \add that the army of Egypt will give us\add*!'
\q2 So, you will try to flee.

\q1
\v 15 For this is what the Lord Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel says,
\q1 "In returning and resting you will be saved; in quietness and in trust will be your strength.
\q1 But you were not willing.
\q1
\v 16 You said, 'No,
\q1 for we will flee on horses,' so you will flee;
\q1 and, 'We will ride upon swift horses,' so those who pursue you will be swift.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Holy One of Israel** - Translate this the same as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:01:04|1:4]].
  * **In returning and resting you will be saved** - Repenting is spoken of as if it were physically returning to Yahweh. This can be stated in active form. AT: "I will save you from your enemies if you will repent and rest knowing that I will take care of you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) 
  * **in quietness and in trust will be your strength** - "You will be strong if you are quiet and trust in me." Quietness here refers to not being anxious and worried. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
