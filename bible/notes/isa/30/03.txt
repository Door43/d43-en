\q1
\v 3 Therefore Pharaoh's protection will be your shame,
\q1 and the refuge in Egypt's shade, your humiliation,
\q1
\v 4 although their princes are at Zoan, and their messengers have come to Hanes.
\q1
\v 5 They will all be ashamed because of a people who cannot help them,
\q1 who are neither help nor aid, but a shame, and even a disgrace."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Judah.

  * **Therefore Pharaoh's protection will be your shame, and the refuge in Egypt's shade, your humiliation** - This can be reworded so that the abstract nouns "protection," "shame," "humiliation" are expressed as adjectives or verbs. AT: "Therefore you will be ashamed because you relied on Pharaoh to protect you; you will be humiliated because you relied on the Egyptians to keep you safe" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **the refuge in Egypt's shade** - Egypt's protection from enemy armies is spoken of as if it were a shadow that protects someone from the burning heat of the sun. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **their ... They ... them** - These words refer to the people of Judah.
  * **Zoan ... Hanes** - These were cities in the northern part of Egypt. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **have come to Hanes** - Here "come" can be stated as "gone." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_go]])
  * **because of a people** - "because of the people of Egypt"
