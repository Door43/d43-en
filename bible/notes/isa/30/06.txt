\v 6 \add I received from Yahweh\add* this message about the animals in the southern part of Judah:
\q1 That area is one where \add people experience a lot of\add* troubles and difficulties,
\q2 an area where there are male and female lions
\q2 and various kinds of poisonous snakes.
\q1 Caravans go through that area
\q2 taking donkeys and camels loaded with valuable goods.
\q1 \add They are taking them\add* to Egypt to seek for protection \add by the army of Egypt\add*,
\q2 but it will be useless.

\v 7 The promises made by \add the king of\add* Egypt are worthless;

\v 6 I received from Yahweh this message about the animals in the southern part of Judah, the desert part:
\q1 That area is one where people experience a lot of troubles and difficulties,
\q2 an area where there are male and female lions
\q2 and various kinds of poisonous snakes.
\q1 Caravans go through that area
\q2 taking donkeys and camels loaded with valuable goods.
\q1 They are taking them to Egypt because they hope that the army of Egypt will protect them,
\q2 but it will be useless.
\q2
\v 7 The promises made by the king of Egypt are worthless;
\q1 therefore I call Egypt 'Useless Rahab,' 'the sea monster that does nothing.'

\v 6 A declaration about the beasts of the Negev: 
\q1 Through the land of trouble and danger, of the lioness and the lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, 
\q1 they carry their riches on the backs of donkeys, and their treasures on the camels' humps, 
\q1 to a people who cannot help them.
\q1
\v 7 For Egypt's help is worthless; 
\q1 therefore I have called  her Rahab, who sits still.

===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues God's declaration concerning the people of Judah.

  * **they carry their riches** - "the people of Judah carry their riches"
  * **I have called her Rahab, who sits still** - There were popular stories about a sea monster named Rahab. The name Rahab means "strength" or "arrogance." AT: "I call Egypt a loud boaster who does nothing." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
