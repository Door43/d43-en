\q2 an area where there are male and female lions
\q2 and various kinds of poisonous snakes.
\q1 Caravans go through that area

\q2 but it will be useless.

\v 6 A declaration about the beasts of the Negev: 
\q1 Through the land of trouble and danger, of the lioness and the lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, 
\q1 they carry their riches on the backs of donkeys, and their treasures on the camels' humps, 
\q1 to a people who cannot help them.

===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues God's declaration concerning the people of Judah.

  * **they carry their riches** - "the people of Judah carry their riches”
  * **I have called her Rahab, who sits still** - There were popular stories about a sea monster named Rahab. The name Rahab means "strength" or "arrogance." AT: “I call Egypt a loud boaster who does nothing." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
