\q1 That area is one where \add people experience a lot of\add* troubles and difficulties,
\q2 an area where there are male and female lions
\q2 and various kinds of poisonous snakes.
\q1 Caravans go through that area
\q2 taking donkeys and camels loaded with valuable goods.
\q1 \add They are taking them\add* to Egypt to seek for protection \add by the army of Egypt\add*,
\q2 but it will be useless.

\q1 Through the land of trouble and danger, of the lioness and the lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, 
\q1 they carry their riches on the backs of donkeys, and their treasures on the camels' humps,
