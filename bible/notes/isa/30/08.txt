===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking to Isaiah.
  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in Yahweh's declaration about Judah. Here he tells Isaiah to do something.
  * **in their presence** - "in the presence of the people of Judah"
  * **lying children, children who will not hear the instruction of Yahweh.**" - This can be translated as a new sentence. AT: "They behave like children who lie and do not listen to what Yahweh commands." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
