\q1
\v 27 Look, the name of Yahweh comes from a distant place, burning with his anger and in dense smoke. 
\q1 His lips are full of fury, and his tongue is like a devouring fire.
\q1
\v 28 His breath is like an overflowing torrent that reaches up to the middle of the neck, 
\q1 to sift the nations with the sieve of
destruction. His breath is a bridle in the jaws of the peoples to cause them to wander away.
