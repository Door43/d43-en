\q1
\v 27 Look, the name of Yahweh comes from a distant place, burning with his anger and in a heavy burden. 
\q1 His lips are full of fury, and his tongue is like a devouring fire.
\q1
\v 28 His breath is like an overflowing torrent that reaches up to the middle of the neck, 
\q1 to sift the nations with the sieve of
destruction, and a bridle in the jaws the peoples to send them astray.
