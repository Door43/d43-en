\q1
\v 27 Look, the name of Yahweh comes from a distant place, burning with his anger and in dense smoke.
\q1 His lips are full of fury, and his tongue is like a devouring fire.
\q1
\v 28 His breath is like an overflowing torrent that reaches up to the middle of the neck,
\q1 to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction. His breath is a bridle in the jaws of the peoples to cause them to wander away.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the name of Yahweh ... like a devouring fire** - Yahweh being extremely angry is spoken of as if he were a large fire. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the name of Yahweh comes** - Here "name" represents Yahweh. AT: "Yahweh comes" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **His lips are full of fury, and his tongue is like a devouring fire** - Here "lips" and "tongue" are metonyms that represent Yahweh speaking. And, Yahweh speaks with so much anger and power that it is spoken of as if his tongue were a fire. AT: "When he speaks his fury is like a fire that destroys everything" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **His breath is like an overflowing torrent** - This compares the air coming out of Yahweh's mouth to a flood to emphasize its power to destroy. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction** - Yahweh separating the people of the nations and destroying the wicked people is spoken of as if Yahweh puts the nations in a sieve. This can be translated as a new sentence. AT: "Yahweh will separate and destroy the wicked people of the nations" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **His breath is a bridle in the jaws of the peoples to cause them to wander away** - Yahweh having the power to cause people's plans and purposes to fail is spoken of as if his breath were a bridle that steers people off the correct path. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a bridle in the jaws of the peoples** - "a bridle on the heads of the peoples" or "a bit in the jaws of the peoples." A "bridle" is a device that people put over a horse's head to guide it. The bridle contains a small piece called a "bit" that goes in the horse's mouth. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
