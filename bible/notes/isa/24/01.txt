===== Translation Notes: =====
  * **It will come about that** - This is an "important event" marker. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **as with...so with** - What Yahweh will do is not stated here, but it is understood. AT: "as Yahweh scatters...so he will scatter." This show that God will treat all people the same way. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **the receiver of interest** - "the one who owes money." The word "interest" means the extra money someone has to pay so that he may borrow money.
  * **the giver of interest** - "the one who is owed money"
