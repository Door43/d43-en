===== Translation Notes: =====
Isaiah continues to describe a time in the future when God will judge the earth. Prophets sometimes describe a future event as something in the past or in the present. This emphasizes the event certainly will happen.

  * **and its inhabitants are found guilty** - AT: "and Yahweh will declare that the people are guilty" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
