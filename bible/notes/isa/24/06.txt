===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Isaiah continues to describe a time in the future when God will judge the earth. Prophets sometimes describe a future event as something in the past or in the present. This emphasizes the event certainly will happen. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pastforfuture]])

  * **a curse devours the earth** - Yahweh cursing the earth and destroying it is spoken of as if a curse were either a wild animal that completely eats the earth or a fire that completely burns up the earth. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **its inhabitants are found guilty** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh will declare that the people are guilty" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
