  * **The transgression of it will be heavy on it, and it will fall and not rise again** - The word "it" in the phrase "transgression of it" refers to the earth, but it means the people of the earth. AT: "The sins of the people are many and they will cause the earth to fall and not rise again" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
