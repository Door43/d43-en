===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The earth will be completely devastated and completely stripped** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh will completely devastate the earth and he will remove everything with value" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Yahweh has spoken this word** - Here "word" represents what Yahweh said. AT: "Yahweh has said he would" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **The earth dries up and withers, the world shrivels up and fades away** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. AT: "Everything on earth will dry up and die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **The earth ... the world** - Both of these represent everything that is on the earth. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **The earth is polluted by its inhabitants** - The people sinning and making the earth unacceptable to God is spoken of as if the people made the earth physically unclean. This can be stated in active form. AT: "The people have polluted the earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **they have transgressed the laws, violated the statutes, and broken the everlasting covenant** - "they have not obeyed God's laws and statutes, and they have broken God's eternal covenant"
