===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Isaiah continues to describe a time in the future when God will judge the earth. Prophets sometimes describe a future event as something in the past or in the present. This emphasizes the event certainly will happen. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pastforfuture]])

  * **In the city is left a desolation** - The abstract noun "desolation" can be stated as "desolate" or "empty." AT: "The city will be desolate" or "The city will be empty" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **In the city** - This is not a specific city but cities in general. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_genericnoun]])
  * **as when an olive tree is beaten, as the gleanings when the grape harvest is done** - This compares the nations after Yahweh devastates the land to trees and vines after their fruit has been picked. This means there will be very few people left in the land. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
