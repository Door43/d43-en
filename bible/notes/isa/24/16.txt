===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **we have heard** - Isaiah is describing something in the future as if it has already happened. AT: "we will hear"
    * **I have wasted away, I have wasted away** - Isaiah repeats this phrase for emphasis. AT: "I have become very weak." Isaiah was very concerned because he saw people who deceived others and did not honor their commitments. 
    * **The treacherous have dealt treacherously; yes, the treacherous have dealt very treacherously** - AT: "Indeed, those who deceive are now deceiving others" or "Indeed, the deceivers have acted deceitfully."
