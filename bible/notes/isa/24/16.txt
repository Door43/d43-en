===== translationNotes: =====


  * **we have heard** - Here "we" refers to Isaiah and the people of Israel. Isaiah is describing something in the future as if it has already happened. AT: "we will hear" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pastforfuture]])
  * **I have wasted away, I have wasted away** - Isaiah repeats this phrase to emphasize his anguish. He was very concerned because he saw people who deceived others and did not do what they promised to do. AT: "I have become very weak" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **The treacherous have dealt treacherously; yes, the treacherous have dealt very treacherously** - Isaiah repeats this phrase to emphasize his anguish. AT: "Indeed, those who deceive are now deceiving others" or "Indeed, the deceivers have acted deceitfully" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
