===== Translation Notes: =====
Isaiah continues to describe a time in the future when God will judge the earth. Prophets sometimes describe a future event as something in the past or in the present. This emphasizes the event certainly will happen.
  * **tambourines...lyre** - These are musical instruments.  See how you translated these in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:05:11|5:12]].
