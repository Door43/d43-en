  * **General Information:** - Isaiah continues to describe a time in the future when God will judge the earth. Prophets sometimes describe a future event as something in the past or in the present. This emphasizes the event certainly will happen. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pastforfuture]])

  * **tambourines ... lyre** - These are musical instruments. See how you translated these in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:05:11|5:12]].
