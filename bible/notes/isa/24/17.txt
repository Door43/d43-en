===== Translation Notes: =====

  * ** the sound of terror** - "the terrifying sound"
  * **will be caught in the snare** - AT: "the snare will catch him" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the foundations of the earth will shake** - The word "foundation" normally refers to a stone structure that gives support to a building from underneath. Here it describes a similar structure that was thought to support and and hold the earth in place. Isaiah says even the structure that holds the earth will shake. AT: "and the earth will shake terribly" or "and there will be a terrible earthquake."
