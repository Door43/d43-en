  * **Israel will be saved by Yahweh** - AT: "Yahweh will save the people of Israel"
  * **you will never again be ashamed or humiliated** - Here "you" refers to the people of Israel, but Isaiah would also include himself as a part of Israel. AT: "No one will ever humiliate you again" or "No one will ever humiliate us again"
