===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues speaking.
  * **An earthen potshard among all the earthen potshards in the ground** - In 45:9 God compares himself to a potter and the people as the clay. This emphasizes that he is the creator. AT: "You are like broken pieces of pottery on the ground" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Should the clay say to the potter** - God uses a question to rebuke those who argue with him about what he does. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
