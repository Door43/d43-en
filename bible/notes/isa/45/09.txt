\q2 so they certainly cannot \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* criticize me.
\q1 A lump of clay certainly cannot \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* argue with the one who shapes it \add to form a pot\add*, saying,

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 Terrible things will happen to those who argue with me, because I am  the one who created them.
\q2 They are like clay pots who are arguing with the Potter who made them;
\q2 they are just like every other clay pot that is made, and yet they argue with the One who made them and formed them out of the clay.
\q1 Can a lump of clay say to the potter who made him,
\q2 'Why are you making me like this?'
\q1 The clay pot cannot say 'What do you think you are doing, making me this way?" or "You have no skill and your clay pots are not worth anything!"



\q1

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q1
\v 9 Woe to anyone who argues with the one who formed him, to him who is like any other earthen pot among all the earthen pots in the ground!
\q1 Does the clay say to the potter, 'What are you making?' or 'Your work has no handles on it'?
