====== Isaiah 45 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines this chapter, which is an extended quotation.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Potter and clay ==
The potter and the clay are important images used in Scripture. They emphasize the power and control of God. This chapter connects this to the truth that Yahweh is the Creator of all, which it repeatedly emphasizes. He is even able to "anoint" or chose a future, pagan king. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:anoint]])
