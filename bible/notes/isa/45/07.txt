===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues speaking.
  * **You heavens, rain down from above...I, Yahweh, have created them both** - God compares his power to save to the rain falling from the sky and causing plants to grow. This means the true God in heaven is the only one who can save people and restore justice on the earth. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
