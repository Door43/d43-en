\q1
\v 10 You have trusted in your wickedness; you have said, "No one sees me;" 
\q1 your wisdom and your knowledge lead you astray,
\q1 but you say in your heart, "I exist, and there is no one else like me."
\q1
\v 11 Disaster will overcome you; you will not be able to drive it away with your incantations.  
\q1 Destruction will fall on you; you will not be able to ward it off.
\q1 Calamity will strike you suddenly, before you know it.
