====== Isaiah 47:14-15 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 But \add they cannot do that, because\add* they are like \f + \ft simile \f* straw that is burning in a fire;
\q2 they cannot save themselves from being burned up in the flames.
\q1 Those men are unable to help you \f + \ft metaphor \f*;
\q2 they are as useless as stubble \add that burns quickly and produces no heat\add* for you.
\q1
\v 15 The people whom you have associated with and worked with since you were young
\q2 \add will not help you\add*,
\q1 because they will just continue doing their own foolish things,
\q1 and they will not pay any attention to you
\q2 \add when you cry out for help\add*."

\v 14 But they cannot do that, because they are like straw that is burning in a fire;
\q2 they cannot save themselves from being burned up in the flames.
\q1 They are unable to help you;
\q2 they are as useless as stubble that burns, but that fire will burn them up rather than let them enjoy the heat.
\q1
\v 15 And they will disappoint you, those with whom you faithfully worked and with whom you traveled and traded when you were younger,
\q1 and yet all of them keep doing their own foolish things;
\q2 and when you cry out for help, there is no one who can help you."

\q1
\v 14 See, they will become like stubble. The fire will burn them up.
\q1 They will not save themselves from the hand of the flame.
\q1 There are no coals to warm them and no fire for them to sit by!
\q1
\v 15 This is what they have become to you, those with whom you have worked, and you bought and sold with them when you were young,
\q1 and all of them keep doing their own foolish things;
\q2 and when you cry out for help, there is no one who can rescue you."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues to speak to Babylon about her downfall as if she were a queen who is humiliated. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])

  * **they will become like stubble. The fire will burn them up** - Yahweh compares the magicians and sorcerers to straw that burns quickly in a fire. This means that Yahweh will destroy them as easily as fire burns stubble, and so they are powerless to save Babylon. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **the hand of the flame** - Here the word "hand" represents strength. AT: "the power of the flame" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **There are no coals to warm them and no fire for them to sit by** - Yahweh emphasizes that this is a destructive fire by stating that it is not one that people will use to warm themselves.
  * **they wander every one to his own way** - Possible meanings are 1) that each one does as he considers best or 2) that each one deserts Babylon and runs away.
