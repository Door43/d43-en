====== Isaiah 47:14-15 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 But \add they cannot do that, because\add* they are like \f + \ft simile \f* straw that is burning in a fire;
\q2 they cannot save themselves from being burned up in the flames.
\q1 Those men are unable to help you \f + \ft metaphor \f*;
\q2 they are as useless as stubble \add that burns quickly and produces no heat\add* for you.
\q1
\v 15 The people whom you have associated with and worked with since you were young
\q2 \add will not help you\add*,
\q1 because they will just continue doing their own foolish things,
\q1 and they will not pay any attention to you
\q2 \add when you cry out for help\add*."

<usfm>
\v 14 But they cannot do that, because they are like straw that is burning in a fire;
\q2 they cannot save themselves from being burned up in the flames.
\q1 They are unable to help you;
\q2 they are as useless as stubble that burns, but that fire will burn them up rather than let them enjoy the heat.
\q1
\v 15 The people whom you have associated with and worked with since you were young
\q2 will disappoint you,
\q1 because they will just continue doing their own foolish things,
\q1 and they will not pay any attention to you
\q2 when you cry out for help."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q1
\v 14 See, they will become like stubble; the fire will burn them up; 
\q1 they will not save themselves from the hand of the flame; 
\q1 there are no coals here suitable for warming them nor no fire suitable to sit before.
\q1
\v 15 They will be for you nothing but toil, those with whom you have traded since your youth;  
\q1 they wander every one to his own way; there is no one to save you.

===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Babylon.

    * **they will become like stubble; the fire will burn them up** - Yahweh compares the magicians and sorcerers to straw that burns quickly in a fire. This means they will be no help to the people of Babylon. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
    * **there are no coals here suitable for warming them nor no fire suitable to sit before** - Again, this means the magicians and sorcerers will burn up so quickly the fire will not help the people. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **They will be for you nothing but toil** - "Those from whom you expected help will make more work for you."
