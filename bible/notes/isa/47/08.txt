\v 8 You people \add of Babylon\add* who enjoy pleasure and sex,
\q2 listen to this:
\q1 You enjoy a luxurious life and you feel secure.
\q1 You say, 'We are \add like gods\add*,
\q2 and there are no others like us.
\q1 Our women will never become widows,
\q2 and our children will never be killed \add in wars\add*.'
\q1
\v 9 But both of those things will happen to you suddenly:
\q2 many of your women \bd will\bd* become widows
\q2 and many of your children \bd will\bd* die,
\q1 even though you perform much sorcery and many kinds of magic \add to prevent bad things from happening to you\add*.

\v 8 /q1  So now hear this, you who are given to pleasures, who sits securely, who says in your heart, "I am, and
             there is no one else who  compares to me;
      /q2  I will not sit as a widow, nor will I ever lose my children:"
\v 9 /q1 But these two things will come to you in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood;
             in their full impact
       /q2they will come on you, despite  your sorceries and your many incantations and amulets.
