\q2 and there are no others like us.
\q1 Our women will never become widows,
\q2 and our children will never be killed \add in wars\add*.'

\q1
\v 8 So now hear this, you voluptuous one who sit securely, 
\q1 you who say in your heart, "I exist, and there is no one else like me;
\q1 I will never sit as a widow, nor will I ever experience loss of children."

\q1
\v 9 But these two things will come to you in a moment in one day: 
\q1 the loss of children and widowhood; in full force they will come on you, 
\q1 despite your sorceries and your many incantations and amulets.

===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Babylon.

    * **you voluptuous one...widowhoood** - In 47:8-9 Yahweh speaks to the people of Babylon as if they were a prideful queen. Because of their pride Yahweh will destroy the city and the people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
