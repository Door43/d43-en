===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Babylon.

    * **Your nakedness will be uncovered, yes, your shame will be seen** - AT: "You will be naked, yes, and everyone will see your shame" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **Our Redeemer** - "Our" refers to Isaiah and the people of Israel. See how you translated "Redeemer" in [[en:bible:notes:isa:41:14|41:14]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
    * **Yahweh of hosts** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:isa:01:24|1:24]].
    * **Holy One of Israel** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:isa:05:15|5:16]].
    * **daughter of the Chaldeans** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:isa:41:01|47:1]].
    * **for you will no longer be called** - AT: "for people will no longer call you" 
    * **Queen of kingdoms** - This means that people will no longer consider Babylon to be the greatest kingdom of all. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
