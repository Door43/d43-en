== Babylon ==
This chapter prophesied the destruction of Babylon. When this was prophesied, Assyria was still in power and Babylon had not yet become a world power. The Chaldeans were not yet a world power either. The people of Judah would become servants or slaves of Babylon and be forced to work very hard.
