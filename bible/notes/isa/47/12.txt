\v 12 Persist in casting your spells and your many sorceries, 
\q1 which you have faithfully recited since your childhood; 
\q1 perhaps you will be successful, perhaps you will scare away disaster.

\q1
\v 13 You are tired out with your many consultations; let those men stand up 
\q1 and save you—those who chart the heavens and look at the stars, 
\q1 those who declare the new moons—let them save you from what will happen to you.
