===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **He will lift up a signal flag for a far away nation and will whistle for them from the end of the earth** - Isiah repeats the same thing in two different ways for emphasis. Isaiah is emphasizing that God will use another nation to punish his people. Alternate translation: "He will call for the army of a nation that is far away from Judah." (See: [[en:ta:translate:parallelism]])
  * **speedily and promptly** - These words mean basically the same thing and are used for emphasis. Alternate translation: "very quickly." (See: [[en:ta:translate:doublet]])
