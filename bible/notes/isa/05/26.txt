===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **He will lift up a signal flag for a far away nation and will whistle for them from the end of the earth** - Isaiah says the same thing in two different ways to emphasize that God will use another nation to punish his people. Alternate translation: "He will call for the army of a nation that is far away from Judah and tell them to come." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **They will come** - "The enemy army will come"
  * **speedily and promptly** - These words mean basically the same thing and are used for emphasis. Alternate translation: "very quickly." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
