===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He will lift up a signal flag for a far away nation and will whistle for them from the end of the earth** - Isaiah says the same thing in two different ways to emphasize that God will use another nation to punish his people. AT: "He will call for the army of a nation that is far away from Judah and tell them to come" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **they will come** - "the enemy army will come"
  * **speedily and promptly** - These words mean basically the same thing and emphasize how quickly they will come. AT: "very quickly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
