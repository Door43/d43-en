===== Translation Notes: =====
This continues the parable about the vineyard that Isaiah began in [[en:bible:notes:isa:05:01|5:1]]. The one who planted the vineyard is speaking.

  * **O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah** - "You who live in Jerusalem and Judah"
  * **judge between me and my vineyard** - "decide between me and my vineyard who is right"
  * **What more could have been done for my vineyard, that I have not done for it** - Yahweh uses this question to scold the people of Jerusalem and Judah. Alternate translation: "I have done all that I could do for my vineyard." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **When I looked for it to bring forth good grapes, why did it produce wild grapes** - Yahweh uses a question to scold the people of Jerusalem and Judah. Alternate translation: "I wanted it to make good grapes, but it only produced worthless grapes."
