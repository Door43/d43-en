===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **who represent darkness as light, and light as darkness ...bitter as sweet, and sweet as bitter** - These mean the same as "who call evil good, and good evil." These things are opposites and people know the difference between them, but some people lie and say that bad things are good. Alternate translation: "They are like people who call darkness light and light darkness. They are like people who call bitter things sweet and sweet things bitter." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to those who are wise in their own eyes** - Here "eyes" refers to their thoughts. Alternate translation: "to those who consider themselves to be wise." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **and prudent in their own understanding** - "and think they understand everything"
