===== Translation Notes: =====

Isaiah announces God's judgment.

  * **to those who join house to house, who join field to field**  - "to those who take more and more houses, and who take more and more fields"
  * **Yahweh of Hosts**  - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:01:09|1:9]].
  * **without inhabitant** - "without anyone living in it"
  * **four hectares**  - This is the amount of land that ten teams of oxen could plow in one day. (Each team would have two oxen.) 
  * **one bath**  - "one bath of wine" or  "22 liters of wine" (UDB). (See: [[en:obe:other:biblicalvolume]])
  * **one homer of seed will yield only an ephah**  - "220 liters of seed will produce only 22 liters of grain." One homer equals ten ephahs. (See: [[en:obe:other:biblicalvolume]])
