\v 25 Therefore the anger of Yahweh is kindled against his people, and he has reached out with his hand against them  and has punished them;

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **he has stretched out his hand against them and has struck them**  - In prophecy something that will happen in the future is described as something in the past. This emphases that the prophecy certainly will happen. Alternate translation: "he will strike them with his powerful hand."
  * **corpses** - "dead bodies"
  * **their corpses are like garbage in the streets** - Isaiah compares their dead bodies to garbage. This emphasizes that many will die but no one will be there to bury them. Their bodies will be left to rot in the streets. The word "garbage" can also be translated as "refuse" or "manure." (UDB) (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
