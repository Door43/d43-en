\v 24 Therefore as the tongue of fire devours stubble, and as the dry grass goes down in flame,
\q1 so their root will rot, and their blossom will blow away like dust,
\q1 because they have rejected the law of Yahweh of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **tongue of fire** - "flame of fire" or "flame"
  * **as the tongue of fire devours stubble, and as the dry grass goes down in flame** - These phrases mean basically the same thing. God will punish the people described in 5:18-23 as a fire that completely and easily burns up dead grass. AT: "as a fire burns up stubble and grass" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **stubble** - "dry grain stalks." This refers to the part of the plant that is left in the garden to die after the farmer collects the food.
  * **their root will rot, and their blossom will blow away like dust** - Isaiah compares those people to a dying plant. AT: "they will die like a plant whose roots have rotted and whose blossom has dried up and blown away in the wind" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
