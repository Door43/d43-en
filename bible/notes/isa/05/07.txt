===== Translation Notes: =====
Isaiah explains the parable he just told.

  * **For the vineyard of Yahweh of Hosts is the house of Israel** - "For the vineyard of Yahweh of Hosts represents the house of Israel" or "The people of Israel are like the vineyard of Yahweh, Lord of the angel armies."
  * **the men of Judah his pleasant planting** - Alternate translation: "the people of Judah are like the vines the farmer cared for."
  * **he waited for justice, but instead, there was killing**​ - "Yahweh waited for the people to do what is fair, but instead they killed one another"
  * **for righteousness** - The phrase "he waited" is left out but it is understood. "He waited for righteousness" or  "He waited for them to do what is right." (See: [[en:ta:translate:ellipsis]])
  * **instead, a cry for help** - "instead, there was a cry for help." The reason people cried out for help can be made explicit:  "instead those who were weak cried out to him for because others were attacking them." (See [[en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit]]).
