===== Translation Notes: =====

Isaiah explains the parable he just told.

  * **For the vineyard of Yahweh of Hosts is the house of Israel**  - "For the vineyard of Yahweh of Hosts represents the house of Israel" or "The people of Israel are like the vineyard of Yahweh, Lord of the angel armies."
  * **the men of Judah his pleasant planting**  - Alternate translation: "the people of Judah are like the vines the farmer cared for."
  * **he waited for justice, but instead, there was killing** â€‹ - "Yahweh waited for the people to do what is fair, but instead they killed one another"
  * **for righteousness**  - The phrase "he waited" is left out but it is understood. "He waited for righteousness" or "He waited for them to do what is right." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis|Ellipsis]])
  * **instead, a cry for help**  - "instead, there was a cry for help." The reason people cried out for help can be made explicit: "instead those who were weak cried out to him for because others were attacking them." (See [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]]).
