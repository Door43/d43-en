===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues the parable about the vineyard.
  * **remove the hedge** - A hedge refers to bushes or small trees planted around the vineyard to protect it. Here it may refer to the thorns that grew on the stone wall. Alternate translation: "take away the border."
  * **a pasture** - This is a grassy place where animals are kept. Alternate translation: "I will allow animals to go there and eat."
  * **and it will be trampled on** - This can be translated with an active verb: "and animals will trample on it." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **I will lay it waste** -  "I will make the ground useless"
  * **it will not be pruned nor hoed** - This can be translated with active verbs: "No one will prune it or hoe it" or "no one will cut off the branches that are not needed and no one will take care of the soil."
