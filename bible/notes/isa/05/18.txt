===== translationNotes: =====


  * **to those who pull along iniquity with cords of emptiness and who pull along sin with a cart rope** - These phrases mean basically the same thing. They compare people who continue to sin on purpose to a person who uses all his strength to keep pulling a heavy cart along. The word "emptiness" means it is all in vain. God will judge them and they will not benefit from their sin. AT: "to those who work hard to sin like a person who drags a cart by a rope" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **those who say** - This refers to those who continue to sin (verse 18) and then mockingly challenge God to stop them. AT: "those mockers who say" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **let the plans of the Holy One of Israel take shape and come** - "let the Holy One of Israel accomplish his plans"
  * **the Holy One of Israel** - See how you translated "the Holy One" in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:05:15|5:16]].
