===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Isaiah continues to describe the army that will attack Judah. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:isa:05:26|Isaiah 05:26]])

  * **Their roaring will be like a lion; they will roar like young lions** - Both of these phrases mean basically the same thing. Isaiah compares the enemy army to a lion to imply how the sound of their attack will cause the people of Judah to be very afraid. AT: "When their army shouts in battle they will sound like a roaring lion" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **young lions** - A young age is a metonym for strength. AT: "the strongest lions" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **They will growl and seize the prey** - Isaiah compares the enemy killing the people of Judah to a lion killing a weaker animal. Possible meanings are 1) lions make a sound not as loud as a roar just before they strike, or 2) the writer is using two words to mean the same thing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]]) 
  * **prey** - animals that another animal wants to catch and kill
  * **with none to rescue** - "and no one will be able to save them"
  * **will roar ... sea roars** - These are the same word translated "growl" in verse 29. Use your language's word for the sound of waves in a storm or heavy rain or some other frightening natural sound.
  * **even the light will be made dark by the clouds** - Here darkness represents suffering and disaster. This metaphor can be stated in active form. AT: "the dark clouds will completely block the light of the sun" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
