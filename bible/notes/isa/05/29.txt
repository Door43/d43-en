===== Translation Notes: =====
Isaiah continues to describe the army that will attack Judah. (See: [[en:bible:notes:isa:05:26]])

    * **Their roaring will be like a lion, they will roar like young lions** - Isaiah compares the enemy army to a lion to emphasize how the sound of their attack will cause fear. Alternate translation: "When their army shouts in battle they will sound like a roaring lion." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:simile]])
    * **They will roar and seize the prey** - Isaiah compares the enemy killing the people of Judah to a lion killing a weaker animal. He is emphasizing that Judah's will not be able to escape their enemy.  
    * **with none to rescue** - "and no one will be able to save them"
    * **as the sea roars** - Isaiah also compares the sound of the enemy army to the sound that the waves of the sea make during a storm. Isaiah is again emphasizing that the army will be so loud it will cause the people of Judah to be afraid. 
    * **the light is darkened by the clouds** - This can be translated with an active verb: "and the dark clouds will completely block the light of the sun."
