===== Translation Notes: =====

Isaiah continues to describe the army that will attack Judah. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:isa:05:26|Isaiah 05:26]])

  * **Their roaring will be like a lion, they will roar like young lions**  - Both of these phrases mean basically the same thing. Isaiah compares the enemy army to a lion to emphasize how the sound of their attack will cause the people of Judah to be very afraid. Alternate translation: "When their army shouts in battle they will sound like a roaring lion." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **They will roar and seize the prey**  - Isaiah compares the enemy killing the people of Judah to a lion killing a weaker animal. He is emphasizing that the people of Judah will not be able to escape from their enemy.
  * **prey** - animals that another animal wants to catch and kill
  * **with none to rescue**  - "and no one will be able to save them"
  * **as the sea roars**  - Isaiah also compares the sound of the enemy army to the sound that the waves of the sea make during a storm. Isaiah is again emphasizing that the army will be so loud it will cause the people of Judah to be afraid.
  * **the light will be darkened by the clouds**  - This can be translated with an active verb: "the dark clouds will completely block the light of the sun." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
