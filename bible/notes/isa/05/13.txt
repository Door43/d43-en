===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **my people have gone into captivity**  - In prophecy things that will happen in the future are described as something in the past. This emphasizes that the prophecy will certainly come true. Alternate translation: "enemies from other countries will take my people, Israel, as slaves."
  * **for lack of understanding**  - What they do not understand can be made explicit: "because they do not understand Yahweh or his law"
  * **their masses**  - "their common people"
  * **death has made its appetite greater and has opened its mouth very wide**  - This phrase compares death to an animal that is ready to eat other animals. It emphasizes that many, many people will die. Alternate translation: "Death is like a hungry animal that has opened its mouth wide to eat up many people." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **their elite, the people, their leaders, and the revelers and those who are happy among them, descend into Sheol.**  - "Many people of Israel, their important people and common people, their leaders and those who enjoy wild parties, will go into Sheol."
