===== translationNotes: =====

  * **my people have gone into captivity** - In prophecy things that will happen in the future are often referred to as if they had already happened. This emphasizes that the prophecy will certainly come true. AT: "enemies from other countries will take my people, Israel, as slaves"
  * **for lack of understanding** - What they do not understand can be made explicit. AT: "because they do not understand Yahweh or his law" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Sheol has made its appetite greater and has opened its mouth very wide** - This phrase speaks of Sheol, which stands here for the grave, to an animal that is ready to eat other animals. It implies that many, many people will die. AT: "death is like a hungry animal that has opened its mouth wide to eat up many people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **their elite, the people, their leaders, and the revelers and those who are happy among them, descend into Sheol** - The prophet sees the future as if it were happening now. AT: "Many people of Israel, their important people and common people, their leaders and those who enjoy wild parties, will go into Sheol"
