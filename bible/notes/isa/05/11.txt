\v 11 Woe to those who rise up early in the morning to look for strong drink; 
\q1 who linger late into the night until wine inflames them!

\v 12 They banquet with harp, lute, tambourine, flute, and wine,
\q1 but they do not recognize the work of Yahweh, nor have they considered the doings of his hands.
