===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **from your suffering and anguish** - The word "your" is singular but it refers to the people of Israel. Also, "suffering" and "anguish" mean basically the same thing and are used together for emphasis. AT: "from the things that have caused you to suffer greatly." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **the proud fury ended** - The word "has" is understood: "the proud fury has ended" or "his pride and fury has ended." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
