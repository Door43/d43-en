<usfm>
\q1
\v 18 All the kings of the nations,
\q1 all of them, sleep in glory, every one in his own tomb.
\q1
\v 19 But you are cast out of your grave like a branch thrown away.
\q1 The dead cover you like a garment, those pierced by the sword—those who go down to the stones of the pit.
 \q1
\v 20 Like a dead body trampled under, you will never join with them in burial,
\q1 because you have destroyed your land. You who have killed your people
\q1 are the son of evildoers and will never be mentioned again."
