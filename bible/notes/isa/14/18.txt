\q1 Your corpse will be under a heap of other corpses of soldiers that were killed by their enemies' swords,
\q2 and their corpses were not buried;
\q1 you will be with those who were killed by their enemies' swords,
\q2 with those who have gone down to the stony ground in the pit \add of hell\add*.
\q1
\v 20 Your corpse will not be buried
\q1 because you have destroyed your nation

<usfm>
\q1
\v 18 All the kings of the nations, 
\q1 all of them, sleep in glory, every one in his own tomb.
\q1
\v 19 But you are cast out of your grave like a branch thrown away 
\q1 the dead cover you like a garment, those pierced by the sword—those who go down to the stones of the pit.
 \q1
\v 20 Like  a dead body trampled under, you will never join with them in burial, 
\q1 because you have destroyed your land. You who have killed your people 
\q1 are the son of evildoers and will never be mentioned again."
