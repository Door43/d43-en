  * **and this is the hand that is raised over all the nations** - God being ready to punish the nations is spoken of as if he raised his hand in order to hit them. The word "hand" may also represent his power. AT: "and this is Yahweh's power to punish all the nations" or "this is how Yahweh will punish the nations" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **who will stop him?** - This question emphasizes that no one can stop Yahweh. AT: "there is no one who can stop him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
