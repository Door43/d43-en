\v 28 In the year that king Ahaz died this declaration  came:
\q1
\v 29 Do not rejoice, Philistia, because the rod that struck you is broken. 
\q1 For out of the serpentâ€™s root will
come an adder, and his offspring will be a fiery flying serpent.
\q1
\v 30 The firstborn of the poor will eat, and the needy will lie down in safety. 
\q1 I will kill your root with famine that will put to death all your survivors.
