\q1
\v 29 You people of Philistia, do not rejoice that the enemy army \f + \ft metaphor \f* that attacked you has been defeated
\q2 and that their king is dead.
\q1 He was \add as dangerous as\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a snake,
\q2 but there will be another king,

\q2 he will be like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a quick-moving poisonous snake.
\q1
\v 30 Those of my people who are very poor will take care of their flocks of sheep,
\q2 and the needy people will lie down safely,

\v 28 In the year that king Ahaz died this declaration came:
\q1
\v 29 Do not rejoice, Philistia, because the rod that struck you is broken. 
\q1 For out of the serpent's root will
come an adder, and his offspring will be a fiery flying serpent.
\q1
\v 30 The firstborn of the poor will eat, and the needy will lie down in safety. 
\q1 I will kill your root with famine that will put to death all your survivors.
