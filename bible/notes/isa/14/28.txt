\v 28 In the year that king Ahaz died this declaration came:
\q1
\v 29 Do not rejoice, all you Philistines, that the rod that struck you is broken.
\q1 For out of the serpent's root will grow out an adder, 
\q1 and his offspring will be a fiery flying serpent.
\v 30 The first-born of the poor will graze their sheep in my pastures, and the needy will lie down in safety.
\q1 I will kill your root with famine that will put to death all your survivors.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the rod that struck you is broken** - The rod that struck Philistia represents a king who sent his army to attack them. Being broken represents either being dead or being defeated. AT: "the king that sent his army against you is dead" or "the army that attacked you is defeated" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For out of the serpent's root will grow out an adder ... his offspring will be a fiery flying serpent** - These two phrases are both the image of a serpent's offspring being even more harmful than the serpent. They represent a king's successor being more powerful and cruel than the first king. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **an adder** - a kind of poisonous snake
  * **a fiery flying serpent** - Here the word "fiery" probably refers to the serpent's poisonous bite, and the word "flying" refers to its quick movements. AT: "a quickly moving poisonous snake" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **The first-born of the poor** - This represents the poorest people. AT: "The poorest people" or "The poorest of my people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will kill your root with famine that will put to death all your survivors** - Here "your root" refers to the people of Philistia. AT: "I will kill your people with famine that will put to death all your survivors" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
