===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Prepare your slaughter for his children** - This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "slaughter" is expressed with the verb "kill." AT: "Get ready to kill the children of the king of Babylon" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])

  * **so they will not rise up** - Here "rise up" represents either becoming powerful or attacking. AT: "so they will not become powerful" or "so they will not attack" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **possess the earth** - This represents taking control of the people on the earth, in this case by conquering them. AT: "take control of the peoples on the earth" or "conquer the peoples on the earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **fill the whole world with cities** - This represents causing the world to have many cities on it. AT: "build cities all over the world" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
