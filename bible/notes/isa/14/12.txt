\v 12 How you are fallen from heaven, daystar, son of the morning! 
\q1 How you are cut down to the ground, you who conquered
the nations!
\q1
\v 13 You had said in your heart, 'I will ascend into heaven, 
\q1 I will exalt my throne above the stars of God, 
\q1 and I will sit on the mount of assembly, in the far reaches of the north.
\q1
\v 14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High God.'

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **How you are fallen from heaven, O day-star, son of the morning** - refers to the star that rises and indicates morning is coming soon. Isaiah compares the king of Babylon to this star, emphasizing that the king once was great but God has destroyed him. AT: "You were like the morning star, but you have fallen from the sky." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
