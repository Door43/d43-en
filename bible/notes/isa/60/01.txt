===== Translation Notes: =====
Isaiah continues speaking to the people of Israel.
  * **Arise, shine, for your light has come** - "Light" refers to the salvation and spiritual awakening brought by Yahweh. "Your" refers to Jerusalem, which is personified as a female. And Jerusalem is being asked to wake up as if it were a person and can sleep and wake up. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
