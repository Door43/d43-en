===== Translation Notes: =====
Isaiah continues speaking to the people of Israel.
  * **Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of Yahwah has risen on you** - This refers to the sun rising and shining on a city. The city also shines as it reflects the light of the sun. Isaiah means that Yahweh has done great things for the people of Israel. The people of Israel should celebrate and tell others about Yahweh.
