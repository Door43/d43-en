===== Translation Notes: =====

Isaiah continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **They all gather themselves**  - "They" refers to the rest of the people of Israel returning to Jerusalem.
  * **your daughters will be carried in their arms**  - AT: "You will be brought back like daughters being carried on the hip" or "they will carry your daughters on the hip" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **Then you will look and be radiant, and your heart shall rejoice and overflow**  - This is saying the same thing in two different ways and emphasizes that they will be very happy at what will happen in Jerusalem. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]])
  * **the abundance of the sea**  - This refers to the riches and goods that will come to Jerusalem via ships, perhaps from along the Mediterranean Sea.
