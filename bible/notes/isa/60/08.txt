  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **Who are these who fly along like a cloud, and like the doves to their shelters?** - Yahweh uses questions and poetic images to draw attention here. He compares the sails of the ships to clouds and doves. This is also a picture of the Israelites returning to the country where they belong. AT: "Look, I see something like clouds moving quickly and like doves returning to their shelters." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **The coastlands** - This refers to the people who live on the coastlands and describes the area of coastlands as if it was people looking out. AT: "The people from the coastlands" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]]) 
  * **the ships of Tarshish** - This expression usually means large merchant ships suitable for long voyages. 
  * **Holy One of Israel** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:01:04|1:4]].
