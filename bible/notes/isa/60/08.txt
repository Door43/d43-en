===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **Who are these who fly along like a cloud, and like the doves to their shelters?**  - Yahweh uses questions and poetic images to draw attention here. He compares the sails of the ships to clouds and doves. Doves are sometimes trained to return to the dovecotes (shelters) where they belong. This is a picture, too, of the Israelites returning to the country where they belong. AT: "Look, I see something like clouds moving quickly and like doves returning to their shelters." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
  * **The coastlands**  - AT: "The people from the coastlands" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
  * **Holy One of Israel**  - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:01:04|1:4]].
  * **he has honored you**  - "Yahweh has honored you, the people of Israel"
