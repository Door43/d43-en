  * [[:en:obe:kt:light]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:yahweh]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:glory]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:eternity]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **for Yahweh will be your everlasting light** - Both verses repeat this same idea for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Your sun will no longer set, nor will your moon withdraw and disappear** - The moon will not literally disappear. This exaggeration is saying that the light of the sun and the moon will be much less bright than the light of Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
