===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **Your sun will no longer set, nor will your moon withdraw and disappear**  - This is not to be understood literally. The sun and moon will not disappear. This is saying that in comparison to the light of Yahweh, they will be nothing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes|Litotes]])
