===== Translation Notes: =====
Isaiah continues speaking.

    * **Therefore he** - "Therefore Yahweh"
    * **against them** - Here "them" refers to the people of Israel, but Isaiah still included himself as part of the people. AT: "against us"
    * **It blazed around them...it burned them** - Isaiah describes Yahweh's anger as a fire to emphasize its power to destroy. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
