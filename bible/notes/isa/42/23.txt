===== translationNotes: =====


  * **Who among you** - Here "you" is plural and refers to the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_youdual]])
  * **Who gave Jacob over to the robber, and Israel to the looters?** - Isaiah uses a question to emphasize that Yahweh was the one that allowed the enemy to conquer the people of Israel. AT: "It was Yahweh who gave the people of Israel over to robbers and looters." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Was it not Yahweh, against whom we have sinned, in whose ways they refused to walk, and whose law they refused to obey?** - Isaiah uses another question for the same reason. Here "we" refers to Isaiah and the people of Israel. The word "they" also refers to the people of Israel, but Isaiah still included himself as part of the people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
