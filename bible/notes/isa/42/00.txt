====== Isaiah 42 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation.

Many scholar believe that there are four songs or poems which Isaiah records about the messiah. Isaiah 42:1-4 is the first of these songs. They are often called the "servant song" because they focus on the messiah being a servant. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:christ]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Servant ==
Israel is called Yahweh's servant. The messiah is also called the servant of Yahweh. It is probable that they are supposed to contrast with each other.
