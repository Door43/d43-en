===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues speaking.

    * **you deaf...you blind** - Here "you" is plural and refers to the people of Israel. The people are spiritually deaf and blind which means they do not listen to or obey God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **Who is blind...as Yahweh's servant?** - In 42:18 Yahweh uses questions to scold his people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
