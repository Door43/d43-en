===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues speaking.
   * **A crushed reed he will not break and a dimly burning wick he will not quench** - The "​crushed reed" and "dimly burning wick" refers to weak and helpless people. ​ (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
   * **bruised reed** - A reed is the long, thin stem of a plant like tall grass. If it is bruised (damaged) it cannot carry any weight. See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:isa:36:06|36:6]].
   * **he will not break** - "My servant will not break"
   * **coastlands** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:isa:41:01|41:1]].
