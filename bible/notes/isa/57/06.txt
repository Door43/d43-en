===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking to the unfaithful people of Israel.

  * **that have been assigned to you**  - AT: "that is your lot" or "that is your inheritance" The exact meaning in Hebrew is unclear. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **In these things should I take pleasure?**  - Yahweh uses a question to scold the people. AT: "Certainly, these things do not please me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
