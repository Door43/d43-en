  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to the unfaithful people of Israel.

  * **You heat yourselves ... under the rocky overhangs** - All of these actions are associated with worshiping idols. The oaks were sacred trees to the Canaanites. People thought such activity would increase fertility for people and the land. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
