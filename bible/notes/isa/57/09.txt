===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking to the unfaithful people of Israel.

  * **you went down to Sheol**  - The people did not literally go to Sheol. Yahweh is exaggerating slightly to emphasize how far they were willing to travel to find new gods to worship. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole|Hyperbole]])
  * **therefore you did not weaken**  - This means they continued seeking for other gods. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes|Litotes]])
