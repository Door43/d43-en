====== Isaiah 57 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Child sacrifice ==
This chapter references the killing of children. Some cultures and religions in the ancient Near East practiced the religious sacrificing of their children. This was considered evil by Yahweh. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:evil]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Mocking ==
The people abandoned the worship of Yahweh in favor of other gods. When they needed help, he tells them to ask these false gods. This is mocking the power of the false gods and shows the people the uselessness of their worship of these gods. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod]])
