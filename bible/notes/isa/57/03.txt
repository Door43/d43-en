===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But come here** - God is calling all of the unfaithful people to come before him so he can judge them in a strong contrast to the promises for the righteous that came before.
  * **sons of the sorceress** - This is a strong insult against the people who practice sorcery because sorcery and magic includes idolatry. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **children of the adulterer and the woman who has prostituted herself** - This refers to actual and spiritual adultery. They have abandoned the worship of God and now worship other gods and idols along with actual prostitution in pagan Canaanite ceremonies.
  * **Whom are you merrily mocking? Against whom are you opening the mouth and sticking out the tongue?** - Yahweh uses questions to scold the people who are mocking him through false worship. AT: "You are mocking me and making fun of me by opening your mouth wide and sticking out the tongue!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Are you not children of rebellion, children of deceit?** - Yahweh uses another question to scold the people. This does not refer to their birth but to their spiritual state. AT: "You are children of rebellion, children of deceit!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
