===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **But draw near**  - God is calling all of the unfaithful people to him so he can judge them.
  * **sons of the sorceress**  - Here, calling them people who practice sorcery is a way of saying that the people of Judah are idolaters. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **children of the adulterer and the woman who has prostituted herself**  - This refers mainly to //spiritual //  adultery. They have abandoned the worship of God and now worship other gods and idols. And yet, prostitution //was//  involved in pagan Canaanite ceremonies.
  * **Whom are you merrily mocking? Against whom are you opening the mouth and sticking out the tongue?**  - Yahweh uses questions to scold the people who are mocking him through false worship. AT: "You are mocking me and making fun of me by opening your mouth wide and sticking out the tongue!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **Are you not children of rebellion, children of deceit?**  - Yahweh uses another question to scold the people. This does not refer to their birth but to their spiritual state.
