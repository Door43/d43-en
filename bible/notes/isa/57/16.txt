===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **I hid my face**  - This means God gave up on his people and no longer helped or blessed them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom|Idiom]])
  * ** he went backward in the way of his heart. ** - This means the Israelites kept rejecting the true God for false ones.
