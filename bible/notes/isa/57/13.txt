===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking to the unfaithful people of Israel.

  * **let your collection of idols rescue you**  - Yahweh is mocking the people and their idols. He tells the idols to save the people though he knows they cannot. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **Instead the wind will carry them all away, a breath will carry them all away.**  - This is saying the same thing in two ways for emphasis. It means the idols are helpless and worthless. AT: "Instead the wind or even a breath will blow them away."  This might refer to the breath of God's spirit. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet|Doublet]])
  * **holy mountain**  - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:11:08|11:9]].
