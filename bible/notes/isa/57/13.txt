===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to the unfaithful people of Israel.

  * **let your collection of idols rescue you** - Yahweh is mocking the people and their idols. He tells the idols to save the people though he knows they cannot. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **the wind will carry them all away, a breath will carry them all away** - This is saying the same thing in two ways to emphasize that idols are helpless and worthless. AT: "the wind, or even a breath, will blow them away" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **holy mountain** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:11:08|11:9]].
