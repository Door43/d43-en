===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking to the unfaithful people of Israel.

  * **on a high mountain**  - People often went on top of hills and mountains to worship false gods. They thought those were the best places for worship. This might even refer to Jerusalem, too. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Explicit and Implicit]])
  * **you prepared your bed**  - This refers to having sex with prostitutes as a part of worshiping false gods. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism|Euphemism]])
  * **You made a covenant with them **- AT: "You made a contract with them" or "You bribed them"
  * **made yourselves naked, and went up; you made your bed wide. You made a covenant with them; you loved their beds; you saw their private parts**  - This refers to the Israelites joining with those who worship false gods. This also included participating in sexual immorality.
