===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking to the unfaithful people of Israel.

  * **Whom are you worried about and afraid of, that you acted so deceitfully?**  - Yahweh uses a question to scold the people. AT: "You must really fear these idols for you to act so deceitfully" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **call me to mind**  - "pay attention to me" or "remember me"
  * **I was not long silent, was I?**  - Yahweh uses a question to scold the people. AT: "I waited a long time before I punished you for your sins"
  * **I will proclaim your 'righteousness'**  - Here Yahweh is being sarcastic, calling their evil deeds so-called righteousness. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony|Irony]])
