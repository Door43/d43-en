<usfm> \v 4 Yahweh, you are like a strong tower where poor people can find refuge, \q2 a place where needy people can go when they are distressed. \q1 You are like a place where people can find refuge in a storm \q2 and where they can stay in the shade, out of the hot sun. \q1 People oppress us and show us no mercy; \q2 they are like a storm beating against a wall, \q2 \v 5 and like the very strong heat in the desert. \q1 But you cause the roaring of people in foreign nations to cease. \q2 Like the air cools when a cloud comes overhead, \q2 you stop merciless people from singing songs about how great they are. \b
