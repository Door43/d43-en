\v 4 Yahweh, you are like a strong tower where poor people can find refuge,
\q2 a place where needy people can go when they are distressed.
\q1 You are like a place where people can find refuge in a storm
\q2 and where they can stay in the shade, out of the hot sun.
\q1 People oppress us and show us no mercy;
\q2 they are like a storm beating against a wall,
\q2
\v 5 and like the very strong heat in the desert.
\q1 But you cause the roaring of people in foreign nations to cease.
\q2 Like the air cools when a cloud comes overhead,
\q2 you stop merciless people from singing songs about how great they are.

<usfm>
\q1
\v 4 For you are a protection for the poor, a guardian for the needy in his distress, 
\q1 a refuge from the storm, a shade
from the heat, 
\q1 when the blast of the ruthless is like a storm against a wall.
\q1
\v 5 As the heat in a drought, 
\q1 you will subdue the noise of strangers; 
\q1 as the heat by the shade of a cloud, the song of
the ruthless ones will be put down.
