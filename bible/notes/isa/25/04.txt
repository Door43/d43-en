\q1 Ruthless\f + \ft Or: Cruel \f* people oppress us;

\q2
\v 5 and like \f + \ft simile \f* the very strong heat in the desert.

<usfm>
\v 4 Yahweh, you are like a strong tower where poor people can find refuge,
\q2 a place where needy people can go when they are distressed.
\q1 You are like a place where people can find refuge in a storm
\q2 and where they can stay in the shade, out of the hot sun.
\q1 People oppress us and show us no mercy;
\q2 they are like a storm beating against a wall,
\q2
\v 5 and like the very strong heat in the desert.
\q1 But you cause the roaring of people in foreign nations to cease.
\q2 Like the air cools when a cloud comes overhead,
\q2 you stop merciless people from singing songs about how great they are.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q1
\v 4 For you are a protection for the poor, a guardian for the needy in his distress,
\q1 a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat,
\q1 when the blast of the ruthless is like a storm against a wall.
\q1
\v 5 As the heat in a drought,
\q1 you will subdue the noise of strangers;
\q1 as the heat by the shade of a cloud, the song of the ruthless ones will be put down.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **when the blast of the ruthless is like a storm ... the ruthless ones will be put down** - Ruthless people being unable to harm God's people is compared to a storm that hits a wall but is unable to knock it down. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **the ruthless** - This is a nominal adjective. AT: "ruthless people" or "those who are ruthless" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]])
  * **of strangers** - Here "strangers" refers to foreigners.
  * **the song of the ruthless ones will be put down** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "You will stop the song of the ruthless ones" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
