====== Isaiah 25 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation.

This chapter shifts from being a prophecy against the nations to the personal praises of Isaiah. He praises Yahweh for the deliverance of his people. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]], [[:en:obe:kt:deliverer]] and [[:en:obe:kt:peopleofgod]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Reign of the Messiah ==
This chapter appears to prophesy about a time of restoration when the messiah will reign. This chapter pictures a time of great peace and harmony in the world. The translator should not add explanation, but should try to maintain the tense of the original text, as a future or uncompleted action. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:obe:kt:christ]])
