\q1 and they despise me \f + \ft metonymy \f* continually \f + \ft doublet \f*.

\q1 It is I, \add Yahweh, who will do it\add*."

\v 5 But now think about what is happening:
\q1 My people are being forced to be slaves again, this time by the people of Babylonia.
\q2 And my people's own rulers wail and lament,
\q1 and the other people groups in the world despise me.
\q1
\v 6 But after that, my people will love me and honor me;
\q2 when that happens, they will know that I am the one who said that this would happen.
\q1 It is I, Yahweh, who will do it."
