\v 5 But now think about what is happening:
\q1 My people are being forced to be slaves again, this time by the \add people of Babylonia\add*.
\q2 And \add those who have conquered them this time have also\add* paid me nothing,
\q1 and they despise me \f + \ft metonymy \f* continually \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\q1
\v 6 But my people will then have a close relationship with \f + \ft metonymy \f* me,
\q2 and when that happens, they will know that I am the one who predicted\f + \ft Or: promised \f* \add that it would happen\add*.
\q1 It is I, \add Yahweh, who will do it\add*."

\v 5 But now think about what is happening:
\q1 My people are being forced to be slaves again, this time by the people of Babylonia. They have taken my people away, but they never declared any just reason for taking them captive.
\q2 And the rulers of Babylon boast and make fun of them (as I, Yahweh, have said they would do),
\q1 and the other people groups in the world despise the mention of my name.
\q1
\v 6 But after that, my people will love me and honor me;
\q2 when that happens, they will know that I am the one who said that this would happen. I am the one who speaks, and I say, 
\q2 'Yes, this is Yahweh who is speaking to you.'

\q1
\v 5 Now what do I have here—this is Yahweh's declaration—seeing that my people are taken away for nothing? Those who rule over them mock—this is Yahweh's declaration—and my name is slandered continually all day long.
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa mock \fqa* , some versions identify a different Hebrew word meaning \fqa wail \fqa* . \f*
\q1
\v 6 Therefore my people will know my name;
\q1 they will know in that day that I am the one who says, "Yes, it is I!"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Now what do I have here ... seeing that my people are taken away for nothing?** - Yahweh uses a question to make the people pay attention to what he is about to say. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "Now look at what is happening ... my people are again taken away for nothing." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:30:01|30:1]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **seeing that my people are taken away for nothing** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "I see the enemy taking my people away for nothing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **for nothing** - Possible meanings are 1) "for nothing" means the Babylonians took the people unjustly and without cause or 2) this continues the metaphor from [[:en:bible:notes:isa:52:02|52:3]] where Yahweh is spoken of as if he owned the people of Israel and could give them away for nothing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Those who rule over them mock** - This refers to the Babylonians who have conquered the people. However, some versions have, "Those who rule over them wail." For these versions, this passage refers to the leaders of the Israelites in captivity. 
  * **my name is slandered continually all day long** - Here "name" represents Yahweh's reputation. This can be stated in active form. AT: "those who watch the enemy take away my people are continually saying evil things about me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Therefore my people will know my name** - Here "name" represents Yahweh's reputation. AT: "Therefore my people will truly know who I am" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
