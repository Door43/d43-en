<usfm>
\v 2 People of Jerusalem, get up from sitting in the dust
\q2 and sit in places where people are honored!
\q1 You people who have returned from being exiled,
\q2 take off from your neck the chains which were fastened around you \add in Babylonia\add*,
\p
\v 3 because this is what Yahweh says:
\q1 "\add When you were taken to Babylonia\add*,
\q2 no one paid me for doing that.
\q1 So now I will bring you back
\q2 without \add being required to\add* pay for you!"

<usfm>
\v 2 People of Jerusalem, get up from where you have been sitting in the dust,
\q2 and sit down properly!
\q1 You people who have returned from being exiled,
\q2 take off from your neck the chains that the Babylonians fastened around your necks,
\p
\v 3 because this is what Yahweh says:
\q1 "When I sent you as captives to Babylonia,
\q2 no one paid me for making that happen.
\q1 So now I will bring you back,
\q2 and I will not pay anyone for releasing you to me."
