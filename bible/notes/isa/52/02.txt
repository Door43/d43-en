\v 2 People of Jerusalem, get up from sitting in the dust
\q2 and sit in places where people are honored!
\q1 You people who have returned from being exiled,
\q2 take off from your neck the chains which were fastened around you \add in Babylonia\add*,

\q2 without, and I will not pay anyone for releasing you to me."
