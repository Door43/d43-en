===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Awake, awake** - This word is repeated for emphasis and shows urgency. Isaiah trying to arouse the people is spoken of as if he were trying to wake them up from sleep. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **put on your strength** - Being strong again is spoken of as if strength were clothing that a person puts on. AT: "be strong" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Zion ... Jerusalem** - Both of these refer to the people who live in Jerusalem. Isaiah is speaking to the people as if they were there listening to him. AT: "people of Zion ... people of Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
  * **the uncircumcised or the unclean** - These nominal adjectives can be stated as adjectives. AT: "Those who are uncircumcised or those who are unclean" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]])
  * **the unclean** - This refers to unclean people. A person who God considers spiritually unacceptable or defiled is spoken of as if the person were physically unclean. AT: "those who are not acceptable to God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **enter you** - Here "you" refers to Jerusalem which represents the people who live there. It is understood that the uncircumcised and unclean people would enter the city to attack the people. AT: "enter your city to attack you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
