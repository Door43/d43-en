===== translationNotes: =====

  * **my servant will be successful** - Some versions have "My servant will act wisely." These are two different but related translations of the same Hebrew word.
  * **he will be high and elevated; he will be very exalted** - This can be stated in active form. These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize the servant's greatness. AT: "I will give my servant the greatest honor" (See the way you translated something similar in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:06:01|52:13]] and [[:en:bible:notes:isa:33:10|33:10]] and [[:en:bible:notes:isa:57:14|57:15]]) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **high and elevated** - These words mean basically the same thing. AT: "highly elevated" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **horrified at you** - Here "you" refers to Yahweh's servant. However, translators may decide to change "you" to "him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_youdual]])
  * **his appearance was so disfigured out of human appearance, so that the sight of him was far from anything human** - "his enemies beat his body so badly that he did not even look like a human anymore"
