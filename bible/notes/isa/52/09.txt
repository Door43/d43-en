===== Translation Notes: =====

Isaiah continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **bared his holy arm**  - This refers to Yahweh's holiness and power. He is preparing to rescue his people, perhaps by taking off his coat and being ready to use his sword. Even his arm is holy, meaning set apart to rescue his people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
