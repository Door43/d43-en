===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues speaking about Zion as if it were a mother. (See: [[en:bible:notes:isa:66:07|66:7-8]])
  * ** Do I bring a mother to the time of birth and not cause her child to be born...Do I beget and then hold back?** - Yahweh uses questions to emphasize that he will not fail to fulfill his promises to the people of Jerusalem. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
