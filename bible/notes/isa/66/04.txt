<usfm>
\v 4 When I called out to you,
\q2 you did not answer.
\q1 When I spoke, you did not pay attention.
\q1 You did many things that I say are evil,
\q2 and you chose to do things that I did not like.
\q1 So now I will punish you by causing you to experience the things that you are very afraid of."

\q2 you did not answer.
\q1 When I spoke, you did not pay attention.
\q1 You did many things that I say are evil,
\q2 and you chose to do things that I did not like.
\q1 So now I will punish you by causing you to experience the things that you yourselves have done, that you yourselves are afraid of."

<usfm>
\q1
\v 4 In the same way I will choose their own punishment; I will bring on them what they fear, 
\q1 because when I called, no one answered; when I spoke, no one listened.
\q1 They did what was evil in my eyes, and chose to do things in which I take no pleasure."
