  * **He who slaughters ... also bless wickedness** - These four clauses all describe different ways evil people act and come to the same meaning for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **They have chosen their own ways** - "They have chosen to do evil things that violate the ways of Yahweh."
