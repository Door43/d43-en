====== Isaiah 66:18-19 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 I know all the \add evil\add* things that you think and do. \add It is now time\add* for me to gather together the people who live in all nations and who speak all languages, and to show them that I am very great.
\p
\v 19 I will put a mark on them, and those whom I have spared will go to various \add distant\add* countries: To Tarshish, Put, Lud, Meshech, Tubal, Javan, and to distant islands. I will send them to proclaim to nations that have never heard about me that I am very great and glorious.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 I know all the evil things that they all think and do. It is now time for me to gather together the people who live in all nations and who speak all languages, and to show them that I am very great.
\p
\v 19 I will do something among them to show everyone who they are, and those whom I have spared will go to various distant countries: To Tarshish, Put, Lud (home of archers), Meshech, Tubal, Javan, and to distant islands. I will send them to proclaim to nations that have never heard about me that I am very great and glorious.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 18 For I know their deeds and their thoughts. The time is coming when I will gather all nations and languages. They will come and will see my glory.
\f + \ft This verse is very difficult, and modern versions provide various interpretations. \f*
\v 19 I will set a mighty sign among them. Then I will send survivors from them to the nations: To Tarshish, Put, and Lud, archers who draw their bows, to Tubal, Javan, and to the distant coastlands where they have not heard about me nor seen my glory. They will proclaim my glory among the nations.
