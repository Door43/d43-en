===== Translation Notes: =====
The people of Israel continue speaking to Yahweh.

    * **Your holy cities have become a wilderness** - This emphasizes that the cities are destroyed and no one lives there. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **has been destroyed by fire** - AT: "the enemy destroyed it with fire" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
    * **How can you still hold back, Yahweh? How can you remain silent and continue to humiliate us?** - They use questions to express their frustration because God has not yet come to help them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
