<usfm>
\v 6 We have all become people who are not fit to worship you;
\q2 all of the good things that we have done are only like \f + \ft simile \f* filthy\f + \ft Or: blood \f*-stained rags.
\q1 Because of our sins, we are like \f + \ft simile \f* leaves that dry up
\q2 and are blown away by the wind.

\v 7 None \add of our people\add* worships you,
\q2 and no one is completely dedicated to [IDI] you.

<usfm>
\q1
\v 6 For we have all become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous deeds are like a menstrual rag. 
\q1 We have all withered like
leaves; our iniquities, like the wind, carry us away.
\q1
\v 7 There are none who call on your name, who makes an effort to take hold of you; 
\q1 for you have hidden your face from us and have handed us over to our sins.

===== Translation Notes: =====

The people of Israel continue speaking to Yahweh.

  * **and all our righteous deeds are like a menstrual rag**  - A "menstrual rag" is a cloth that a woman uses during the time of month when she bleeds from her womb. This means all their attempts to please God fail. This sentence was meant to be shocking. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
  * **We have all withered like leaves; and our iniquities, like the wind, carry us away**  - This means their sins, as a community, are the reason for their failure.
  * **you have hidden your face from us**  - This means God gave up on his people and let them suffer. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom|Idiom]])
