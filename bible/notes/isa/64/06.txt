====== Isaiah 64:6-7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 We have all become people who are not fit to worship you;
\q2 all of the good things that we have done are only like \f + \ft simile \f* filthy\f + \ft Or: blood \f*-stained rags.
\q1 Because of our sins, we are like \f + \ft simile \f* leaves that dry up
\q2 and are blown away by the wind.
\q1
\v 7 None \add of our people\add* worships you,
\q2 and no one is completely dedicated to [IDI] you.
\q1 You have turned away from us.
\q2 It is as though you have caused us to be forced to continue our sinful behavior.

<usfm>
\q1
\v 6 For we have all become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous deeds are like a menstrual rag.
\q1 We have all withered like
leaves; our iniquities, like the wind, carry us away.
\q1
\v 7 There are none who calls on your name, who makes an effort to take hold of you.
\q1 For you have hidden your face from us and made us waste away in the hand of our iniquities.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The people of Israel continue speaking to Yahweh.

  * **all our righteous deeds are like a menstrual rag** - A "menstrual rag" is a cloth that a woman uses during the time of month when she bleeds from her womb. This means all their attempts to please God fail. This sentence was meant to be shocking. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **We have all withered like leaves** - Isaiah compares the people of Israel to leaves that dry up when dead. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **our iniquities, like the wind, carry us away** - This means their sins, as a community, are the reason for their failure. Isaiah compares the iniquities to the wind as the force for their suffering Yahweh's punishment. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **you have hidden your face from us** - This means God gave up on his people and let them suffer. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
