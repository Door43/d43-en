===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues describing a hypothetical situation to the people of Israel.

  * **Your descendants would have been as numerous as the sand, and the children from your womb as numerous as the grains of sand** - These both mean that the people would have had more descendants than they could count. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **the children from your womb** - Yahweh speaks of the descendants of the people of Israel as if they were children to which the nation gives birth. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **their name would not have been cut off nor blotted out** - The people of Israel being destroyed is spoken of as if their name had been cut off, as one would cut a piece of cloth or cut a branch from a tree, or blotted out. This can be translated in active form. AT: "I would not have cut off nor blotted out their name" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **their name** - Here the word "name" refers to the descendants who would carry on the name of Israel. AT: "they" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **cut off nor blotted out** - These two expressions in this context refer to destroying the people. AT: "destroyed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
