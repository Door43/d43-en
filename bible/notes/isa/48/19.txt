    * **Your descendants would have been as numerous as the sand, and the children from your womb as numerous as the grains of sand** - These both mean that the people would have had more descendants than they could count.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
    * **their name would not have been cut off** - The people would not have lost their reputations or family histories. AT: "I would not have needed to destroy them"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
