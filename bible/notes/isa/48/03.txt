\q2 I knew that your heads are \f + \ft metaphor \f* as hard as iron or brass \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\q1
\v 5 That is why I told you those things long ago.
\q2 Long before they occurred, I announced that they would occur,
\q1 in order that \add when they happened\add* you could not say
\q2 'Our idols did it;
\q2 our statue made of wood and our idol made of metal caused them to happen.'

<usfm>
\q1
\v 3 I have declared the things from long ago, from my mouth they came forth, and I made them known; 
\q1 then suddenly I did them, and they came to pass.
\q1
\v 4 Because I knew that you were obstinate, 
\q1 your neck muscles tight as iron, and your forehead like bronze,
\q1
\v 5 therefore I declared these things to you beforehand; before they happened I informed you, 
\q1 so you could not say, "My idol has done them," or "my carved figure, or my cast metal figure has ordained these things."

  * [[:en:obe:other:idol]]
 

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **I have declared the things from long ago, from my mouth they came forth** - "My mouth" is a shorter way of referring to "predictions that were made long time ago" by Yahweh. (See: Metonymy)
    * **your neck muscles tight as iron, and your forehead like bronze**  - Here the stubbornness of the people is compared to the hardness of metals such as iron and bronze. AT: "your heads were as hard as iron and bronze." This is also saying the same thing twice for emphasis. (See: Metaphor and Doublet)
    * **I declared these things to you beforehand; before they happened I informed you** - This is also saying the same thing twice for emphasis.
