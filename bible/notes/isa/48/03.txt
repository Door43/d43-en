===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Long ago I \f + \ft metonymy \f* predicted what would happen \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\q2 And then suddenly, I caused those things to happen.
\q1
\v 4 I knew that you people are very stubborn;
\q2 I knew that your heads are \f + \ft metaphor \f* as hard as iron or brass \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\q1
\v 5 That is why I told you those things long ago.
\q2 Long before they occurred, I announced that they would occur,
\q1 in order that \add when they happened\add* you could not say
\q2 'Our idols did it;
\q2 our statue made of wood and our idol made of metal caused them to happen.'

<usfm>
\q1
\v 3 I have declared the things from long ago; they came out from my mouth, and I made them known; 
\q1 then suddenly I did them, and they came to pass.
\q1
\v 4 Because I knew that you were obstinate, 
\q1 your neck muscles tight as iron, and your forehead like bronze,
\q1
\v 5 therefore I declared these things to you beforehand; before they happened I informed you, 
\q1 so you could not say, "My idol has done them," or "my carved figure, or my cast metal figure has ordained these things."

===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

    * **from my mouth they came forth** - AT: "I spoke these things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
    * **your neck muscles tight as iron, and your forehead like bronze** - "you have stiff necks and hard heads." Both of these phrases mean the people were stubborn. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
    * **I declared these things to you beforehand; before they happened I informed you** - This is also saying the same thing twice for emphasis.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
