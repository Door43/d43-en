Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

    * **For the sake of my name I will defer my anger** - AT: "For the sake of my reputation I will delay my anger. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **and for my honor I will hold back from destroying you** - This part of the sentence means basically the same thing as the first part. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **Look, I refined you, but not as silver; I have purified you in the furnace of affliction** - Just like people put silver in the hot fire to remove dirt and impurities, Yahweh has purified his people from their sinful behavior by making them suffer much. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **for how can I allow my name to be dishonored?** - Yahweh uses a question to emphasize that he can never allow his own name to be dishonored. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
