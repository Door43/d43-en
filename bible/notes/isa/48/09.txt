\q2 and I will not completely get rid of you.
\q1
\v 10 I have purified you, but not the way \add people refine\add* silver.
\q1 Instead, I have caused you to suffer very much \add to get rid of your impure behavior\add*
\q2 like \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add people put metal in a very hot\add* furnace \add to get rid of the impurities\add*.
\q1
\v 11 But for my \f + \ft metonymy \f* own sake I will delay punishing you more;
\q1 I will do it for my own sake
\q2 in order that my reputation will not be damaged \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*.
\q1 I will not allow any \add person or any idol\add* to be honored as I \add deserve to be\add* honored."

===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

    * **For the sake of my name I will defer my anger** - AT: "For the sake of my reputation I will delay my anger. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **and for my honor I will hold back from destroying you** - This part of the sentence means basically the same thing as the first part. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **Look, I refined you, but not as silver; I have purified you in the furnace of affliction** - Just like people put silver in the hot fire to remove dirt and impurities, Yahweh has purified his people from their sinful behavior by making them suffer much. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **for how can I allow my name to be dishonored?** - Yahweh uses a question to emphasize that he can never allow his own name to be dishonored. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
