\b
\q1 Now I will tell you new things,
\q2 things that you have not known previously.
\q1
\v 7 I am causing them to happen now;

<usfm>
\q1
\v 6 You heard about these things; look at all this evidence; and you, will you not admit what I said is true? From now on, I am showing you new things, 
hidden things that you have not known.
\q1
\v 7 Now, and not from previously, they come into being, and before today you have not heard about them, 
\q1 so you will not be able to say, "Yes, I knew about them."

===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

    * **will you not admit what I said is true?** - Yahweh uses a question to scold the people of Israel for not admitting what they should know is true. AT: "but you are stubborn and will not admit what I said is true." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
