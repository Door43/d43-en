Yahweh continues speaking.

  * **Yahweh of Hosts** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:isa:01:09|1:9]].
  * **Like a hunted gazelle or like a sheep with no shepherd** - Gazelles (a type of deer) and sheep are prey to other wild animals - the people of the world will run away like scared animals. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
