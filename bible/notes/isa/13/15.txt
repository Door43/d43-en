===== Translation Notes: =====
This may be Yahweh or Isaiah speaking.

    * **Every one who is found will be killed, and every one who is captured will die by the sword** - Both of these clauses mean the same thing and are used together for emphasis. Alternate translation: "The enemy will kill everyone they find" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
    * **Their infants also will be dashed in pieces before their eyes** - Here "eyes" refers to what they see. Alternate translation: "The enemy will throw babies to the ground and kill them while their parents helplessly watch." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **Their houses will be plundered and their wives raped** - Alternate translation: "The enemy will rob the people's houses and violently force the women to have sex with them"
