====== Isaiah 13 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of chapter 13, which is an extended quotation.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Prophecies ==
It is unclear who is addressed by these prophecies. At times, it appears to be the people of Judah, while at other times is seems to reference the last days. This ambiguity should remain in translation. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:obe:kt:lastday]])
