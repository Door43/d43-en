===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues speaking about what will happen to Babylon.

  * **will lie there** - "will lie in Babylon"
  * **Their houses** - "The people's houses"
  * **owls** - Owls are wild birds that hunt at night. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **ostriches** - Ostriches are large wild birds that run fast and cannot fly. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **Hyenas** - Hyenas are large wild animals that look like dogs and eat dead animals. Their loud cry sounds like a person laughing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **jackals in the beautiful palaces** - The words "will cry" are understood. AT: "jackals will cry in the beautiful palaces" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **jackals** - wild dogs (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **Her time is near, and her days will not be delayed** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. "Her time" and "her days" both refer to the time that God has chosen for Babylon to be destroyed. This can be stated in active form. AT: "The time that all of this will happen to the people of Babylon is near, and nothing will stop it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
