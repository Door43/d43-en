===== translationNotes: =====

  * **It will come about** - This phrase is used here to mark an important event that will happen. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **the glory of Jacob will become thin, and the fatness of his flesh will become lean** - Here "Jacob" refers to the nation of Israel. It would no longer be glorious. Rather it would be weak and poor. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **It will be as when a harvester gathers the standing grain ... in the valley of Rephaim** - There will be nothing left in the land after God punishes the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]]) 
  * **the valley of Rephaim** - This is a valley where people grew and harvested much food. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
