<usfm>
\v 12 Listen! The armies of many nations will roar like the sea roars.
\q2 It will sound like noise of crashing waves.
\q1
\v 13 But even though their loud roaring will be like the sound of crashing waves,
\q2 when Yahweh rebukes them, they will run far away.
\q1 They will flee like \f + \ft simile \f* chaff on the hills scatters when the wind \add blows\add*,
\q2 like tumbleweeds scatter when a windstorm blows.
\q1
\v 14 And, even though you people of Israel will be terrified,
\q2 in the morning your enemies will all be gone\f + \ft Or: dead \f*.
\q1 That is what will happen to those who invade our land and then steal our possessions.

\q1
\v 12 Woe! The uproar of many peoples, that roar like the roaring of the seas, 
\q1 and the rushing of nations, that rush like the
rushing of mighty waters!
\q1
\v 13 The nations will roar like the rushing of many waters, 
\q1 but God will rebuke them. They will flee far away
\q1 and will be chased as the dead weeds on the mountains before the wind, and like weeds whirling before a storm.
\q1
\v 14 In the evening, see, terror! And before the morning they will be gone; 
\q1 this is the portion of those who loot us, the lot of those who rob us.
