====== Isaiah 17 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 17:1-6, 9-14, which are important quotations.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Damascus ==
This chapter prophesies destruction against the people of Damascus. Damascus was the capital of Aram. The people of Damascus worship gods other than Yahweh and have fought Yahweh's people. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]], [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod]], [[:en:obe:kt:peoplepfgod]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Ephraim ==
This chapter prophesied destruction against the kingdom of Israel. They are also called Ephraim in this chapter. Both the northern kingdom of Israel and Aram were conquered at about the same time in history.
