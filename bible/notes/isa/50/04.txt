===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **The Lord Yahweh has given me a tongue as one of those who are taught** - It is with a tongue that one is able to speak and teach. Here "tongue" is used as a substitute for "Yahweh giving his wise message." (See: Metonymy)
    * **he awakens my ear to hear like those who are taught** - Here "my" changes the first-person speaker from Yahweh to the Servant. The Servant listens to his Master and those in authority and refers to himself to the "ear" since it is with his ear that he hears his Masters teaching. The Servant compares himself to a student or servant who listens to his teachers and pays attention to what is being taught. (See: Synecdoche and Simile)
