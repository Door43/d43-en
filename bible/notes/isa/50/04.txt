===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The Lord Yahweh has given me a tongue as one of those who are taught**  - Here "me" refers to Yahweh's servant. The word "tongue" refers to speech. AT: "The Lord Yahweh has enabled me to speak like a wise student" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **he awakens my ear to hear like those who are taught**  - Here "my ear" refers to Yahweh's servant. This means the servant listens to Yahweh the way a student listens to a teacher. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche|Synecdoche]])
