===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh's servant continues speaking.

  * **therefore I am not disgraced**  - Even though the servant has been mistreated, he is in the will of Yahweh and so does not lose face. AT: "therefore I am not humiliated" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **so I have made my face like flint**  - Here "my face" refers to the servant. Also "flint" is a hard rock. This means he will resist any attempt to humiliate him; he is ready to endure anything. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche|Synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
  * **for I know that I will not be put to shame**  - The servant looks to the future with confidence, secure in Yahweh's calling. AT: "for I know that my enemies will not be able to make me feel shame"
