====== Isaiah 50:11 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 But you people who \add oppose me\add*,
\q2 \add who would like to throw\add* me into a blazing fire,
\q1 walk in your own fires
\q2 and burn yourselves with your own torches!
\q1 This is what Yahweh will cause to happen to you:
\q2 you will be enduring great torment when you die \f + \ft euphemism \f*!
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 But you people who oppose me by lighting your own fires,
\q2 and by carrying your own flaming torches:
\q1 go ahead and live according to your own knowledge,
\q2 according to what you think is best.
\q1 Yahweh tells you what will happen to you:
\q2 he will make you die in great torment!
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q1
\v 11 Look, all you who light fires, who equip yourselves with torches:
\q1 walk in the light of your fire and in the flames that you have ignited.
\q1 This is what you have received from me: You will lie down in a place of pain.
</usfm>

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **all you who light fires ... flames that you have ignited** - This continues the metaphor from the previous verse of people who walk in darkness. Here people who try to live according to their own wisdom instead of trusting in Yahweh are spoken of as if they lit their own fires and carried about torches in order to see in the dark. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you will lie down in a place of pain** - Here to "lie down" refers to dying. Dying painfully is spoken of as if it were lying down in a place where they will experience pain. AT: "you will die with great suffering" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
