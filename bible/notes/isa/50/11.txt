===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **all you who light fires … flames that you have ignited**  - Isaiah continues to speak here for God. This refers to the people in darkness who try to live according to their own "light," that is, by their own wisdom, instead of obeying God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **From me** - AT: "From my hand" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche|Synecdoche]])
  * **you will lie down in a place of pain**  - Here to "lie down" refers to dying. AT: "You will die with great suffering" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism|Euphemism]])
