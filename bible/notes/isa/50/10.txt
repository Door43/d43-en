===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The servant continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **Who among you fears Yahweh? Who obeys the voice of his servant? Who walks in deep darkness without light? He should ... his God.** - The servant uses these questions to identify those to whom he is speaking. AT: "If someone among you fears Yahweh and obeys the voice of his servant, but he walks in deep darkness without light, then he should ... his God." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **obeys the voice of his servant** - Here the word "voice" represents what the servant says. AT: "obeys his servant" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **walks in deep darkness without light** - The servant speaks of people who are suffering and feel helpless as if they were walking in a very dark place. AT: "is suffering and feels helpless" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **trust in the name of Yahweh and lean on his God** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Here the word "name" represents Yahweh himself. Trusting in God is spoken of as if it were leaning on him. AT: "trust in Yahweh, his God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
