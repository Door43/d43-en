===== Translation Notes: =====

The servant continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **Who among you fears Yahweh? Who obeys the voice of his servant? Who walks in deep darkness without light?** - Here Isaiah lays out responses to the servant in question form, telling God's people to continue to trust and obey Yahweh, even in the darkness. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]]) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
