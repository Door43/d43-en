\q2 like some men send away their wives

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Where is the certificate of divorce with which I divorced your mother?** - Yahweh uses a question for emphasis. Here "mother" refers to the city of Zion. This means that Yahweh did not send the people of Zion away like a man who decides to divorce his wife. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **And to which of my creditors did I sell you?** - Yahweh uses a question for emphasis. This means Yahweh did not send his people into slavery like a man who sells his children to pay for his debts. (See: UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **you were sold because of your sins, and because of your rebellion, your mother was sent away** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "I sent you away because you continually sinned and rebelled against me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
