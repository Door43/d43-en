<usfm>
\v 2 , /q1 Why was no one there when I came? Why did  no one answer when I called? Is my hand too weak to ransom you?
              Or have I no power to deliver? 
        /q2  Look, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a desert; their fish die for lack of water and rot.
\v 3  /q1 I  clothe the sky with darkness,
        /q2 I cover it with sackcloth.
