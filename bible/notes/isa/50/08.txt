===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh's servant continues speaking.

  * **Who will oppose me… Who is my accuser… Who will declare me guilty?**  - The servant uses these questions to emphasize that no one can prove before God that he has done anything wrong. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **they will all wear out like a garment; the moth will eat them up**  - This means God will remove those who accuse his servant. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
