  * **General Information:** - Yahweh's servant continues speaking.

  * **Who will oppose me? Let us stand ... Who is my accuser? Let him come** - The servant uses these questions to emphasize that there is no one who can legitimately accuse him of wrong.

  * **Who will declare me guilty?** - The servant uses this question to assert that no one can declare him guilty. AT: "There is no one who can declare me guilty." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **they will all wear out like a garment; the moth will eat them up** - There being no one left to accuse the servant of being guilty is spoken of as if the accusers were garments that wear thin and are eaten by moths. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
