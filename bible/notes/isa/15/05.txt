\q1
\v 5 My heart cries out for Moab; her fugitives flee to Zoar and to Eglath Shelishiyah. 
\q1 They go up the ascent of Luhith  weeping; 
\q1 on the road to Horonaim they loudly wail over their destruction.
\q1
\v 6 The waters of Nimrim have dried up;  
\q1 the grass is withered away and the new grass dies; nothing is green.
\q1

\q1 they carry away over the brook of the poplars.
