====== Isaiah 15 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of chapter 15, which is an extended quotation.

This chapter forms a shift from discussing Judah to the nation of Moab. Moab is punished by Yahweh, even though he is not a god they worship. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:god]])
