===== Translation Notes: =====
Isaiah continues to describe his vision.
  * **the voice of the Lord say** - AT: "the Lord say." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **who will go for us** - Possible meanings are 1) The word "us" refers to God and his angels. 2) The Lord refers to himself as "us." When a person refers to himself this way, it emphasizes the person's  authority and importance.
  * **this people** - "the people of Israel"
  * **Listen, but do not understand; see, but not perceive** - "Listen very carefully, but may you not understand; look very carefully, but may you not know."
