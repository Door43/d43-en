===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **on a high and elevated throne**  - The words "high" and "elevated" mean the same thing and are used to emphasize that the throne was "very high" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet|Doublet]])(See the other three other similar examples in Isaiah 33:10, 52:13 and 57:15.)
  * **the hem of his robe**  - "the edge of his garment"
  * **filled the temple**  - "filled the palace." The word used for temple here is often used to refer to the palace of kings.
  * **Seraphim**  - This word suggests that the creatures might have a fiery appearance or resemble snakes. Because we do not know exactly what "seraphim" means, you could translate these as "creatures" or "living things" or "beings". (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown|Translate Unknowns]])
  * **each one had six wings**  - "each seraph had six wings" or "each creature had six wings"
  * **with two each covered**  - The words "wings" and "seraph" are left out of this phrase, but they are understood. AT: "with two wings each seraph covered." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis|Ellipsis]])
  * **with two he covered his feet**  - AT: "with two wings each seraph covered his feet"
  * **with two he flew**  - AT: "with two wings each seraph flew"
