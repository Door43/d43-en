===== translationNotes: =====

  * **he was high and elevated** - The words "high" and "elevated" emphasize that the throne was very high and above everything around it. This represents how great and powerful the Lord is. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **the hem of his robe** - "the edge of his garment"
  * **filled the temple** - "filled the palace." The word used for temple here is often used to refer to the palace of kings.
  * **seraphim** - This word suggests that the creatures might have a fiery appearance or resemble snakes. Because we do not know exactly what "seraphim" means, you could translate these as "creatures" or "living things" or "beings." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **each one had six wings** - "each seraph had six wings" or "each creature had six wings"
  * **with two each covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew** - The words "wings" and "seraph" are understood. AT: "with two wings each seraph covered his face, and with two wings he covered his feet, and with two wings he flew" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
