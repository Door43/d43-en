===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I saw** – Isaiah begins to describe a vision that God gave to him. This could be translated as "I saw in a vision" or "Yahweh gave me, Isaiah, a vision of."
  * **on a high and elevated throne** - The words "high" and "elevated" mean basically the same thing and are used for emphasis. The height of the throne emphasizes the supreme authority and holiness of the Lord. Alternate translation: "on a throne that was raised up very high" (See: [[en:ta:translate:doublet]])
  * **the hem of his robe** - The word "hem" means the outer edge of the garment that the Lord was wearing. It could be translated as "the border of his garment" or "the edge of his garment."
  * **filled the temple** - "filled the palace." The word used for temple here is often used to refer to the palace of kings. This emphasizes that Yahweh is lord and king over everything.
  * **Seraphim** - The word for these creatures suggest that the creatures might have a fiery appearance or resemble snakes. Because we do not know exactly what the "seraphim" are, you could translate these as "creatures" or "living things" or "beings". (See: [[:en:ta:translate:translateunknowns|Unknowns - How to Translate]])
  * **each one had six wings** - "each seraph had six wings" or "each creature had six wings"
  * **with two each covered** - The words "wings" and "seraph" are left out of this phrase, but they are understood. Alternate translation "with two wings each seraph covered." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:ellipsis|Ellipsis]])
  * **with two he covered his feet** - "with two wings each seraph covered his feet"
  * **with two he flew** - "with two wings each seraph flew"
