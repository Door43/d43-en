===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Seraphim **–  These creatures are only mentioned in Isaiah 6, verses 2 and 6. The word in Hebrew suggest that the creatures might have a fiery appearance or resemble snakes. Because we do not know exactly what the "seraphim" are, it would be best to translate the word with a generic term such as "creatures" or "living things" or "beings".
