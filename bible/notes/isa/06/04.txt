===== Translation Notes: =====
Isaiah continues to describe his vision.
  * **The doors and the thresholds shook at the voices of those who were crying out** - “When the seraphim called out, their voices shook the foundations under the doorways"
  * **and the house was filled with smoke** - Alternate translation: “and smoke filled the temple" or "and smoke filled the palace." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:active]])
  * **Woe is me! For I am doomed because I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, because my eyes have seen the King, Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies!"** - Alternate translation: "What great trouble I am in! For my eyes have seen Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies, but I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips."
  * **unclean lips** - Isaiah uses the word "lips" to refer to what is said. Alternate translation: "who says things that are sinful" or "who says things that are not right." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
  * **because my eyes have seen** - "I have seen with my eyes." Isaiah refers to himself as "my eyes" since that is how he saw Yahweh. Alternate translation: "I have seen." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:synecdoche]])
