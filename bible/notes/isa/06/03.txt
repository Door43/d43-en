Isaiah continues to describe his vision.
  * **Each one called to another and said** - “The seraphim called out to one another” or "The creatures proclaimed to one another"
  * **Holy, holy, holy** - Repeating the word "holy" three times indicates God is completely holy. Alternate translation: "He is holy beyond all else" or "He is completely holy." (UDB)
  * **The whole earth is full of his glory** - “The glory of Yahweh fills all the earth”
