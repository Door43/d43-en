\q1 As a result, they will not see \add what I want them to see\add* or hear \add what I want them to hear\add*,
\q2 and they will not understand it with their inner beings,

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 I will cause you people to be unable to care;
\q2 and I will cause you people to not be able to hear,
\q2 and I will cause you people to not be able to see.  
\q1 Otherwise you would see with your eyes and you would recognize what it is you are looking at,
\q2 and you would hear with your ears and be able to understand what you have heard,  
\q2 and you would care deeply and with understanding,
\q2 and you would turn to me so I might save you and not punish you."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to tell Isaiah what he must do when Yahweh sends him to the people of Israel.

  * **Make the heart of this people insensitive** - Here "heart" represents a person's mind. A person who does not think clearly and is unable to understand and unable to care about what is happening is spoken of as if his heart were insensitive. AT: "Make them unable to understand" or "Make their minds dull" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Make the heart** - This command means that Yahweh will use Isaiah's message to cause the people to understand even less and to make them less sensitive to what Yahweh is doing.
  * **their ears dull, and blind their eyes** - "make it so that they cannot hear, and make it so that they cannot see." Isaiah making people to not understand Yahweh's message or what he is doing is spoken of as if Isaiah were making them deaf and blind. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears** - People being able to understand Yahweh's message and what he is doing is spoken of as if the people could physically see and hear. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **understand with their heart** - Here "heart" represents as person's mind. Truly understanding something and caring about what is happening is spoken of as if the people understood with their hearts. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **then turn** - Repenting and starting to obey Yahweh is spoken of as if they people would physically turn towards him. AT: "and follow me again" or "then start trusting in me again" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **be healed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "I would heal them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
