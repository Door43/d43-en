====== Isaiah 55:8-9 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 I, Yahweh, declare that what I think is not the same as what you think,
\q2 and what I do is very different from what you do.
\q1
\v 9 Just as the sky is far above the earth,
\q2 what I do is far greater than what you do,
\q1 and what I think is much greater than what you think.
\q1
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Yahweh declares that what he thinks is not the same as what you think,
\q2 and what he does is very different from what you do.
\q1
\v 9 Just as you people on the earth can never reach the sky,
\q2 in the same way, what Yahweh does you can never understand, although you may understand the things you do;
\q1 and what Yahweh thinks you can never understand, although you may understand what you think.


\q1
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q1
\v 8 "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways my ways—this is Yahweh's declaration of Yahweh—
\q1
\v 9 for as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.
</usfm>

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Jerusalem.

  * **declaration of Yahweh** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:14:21|14:22]].
  * **for as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts** - This emphasizes that what God thinks and does is beyond what a human can understand. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
