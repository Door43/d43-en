====== Isaiah 55:8-9 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 I, Yahweh, declare that what I think is not the same as what you think,
\q2 and what I do is very different from what you do.
\q1
\v 9 Just as the sky is far above the earth,
\q2 what I do is far greater than what you do,
\q1 and what I think is much greater than what you think.
\q1
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Yahweh declares that what he thinks is not the same as what you think,
\q2 and what he does is very different from what you do.
\q1
\v 9 Just as you people on the earth can never reach the sky,
\q2 the thoughts of Yahweh are that much higher than the way you think.
\q1 His ways are always different from what you do.
\q1 And so, you can be sure that you can never fully understand the way Yahweh thinks or know the reasons for what Yahweh does.


\q1
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q1
\v 8 "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways my ways—this is Yahweh's declaration—
\q1
\v 9 for as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.
</usfm>
