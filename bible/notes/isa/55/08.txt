====== Isaiah 55:8-9 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 I, Yahweh, declare that what I think is not the same as what you think,
\q2 and what I do is very different from what you do.
\q1
\v 9 Just as the sky is far above the earth,
\q2 what I do is far greater than what you do,
\q1 and what I think is much greater than what you think.
\q1

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 I, Yahweh, declare that what I think is not the same as what you think,
\q2 and what I do is very different from what you do.
\q1
\v 9 Just as you people on the earth can never reach the sky,
\q2 in the same way, what I do you can never understand, although you may understand the things you do;
\q1 and what I think you can never understand, although you may understand what you think.


\q1

<usfm>
\q1
\v 8 "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways my ways—this is Yahweh's declaration of Yahweh—

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Jerusalem.

  * **declaration of Yahweh**  - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:14:21|14:22]].
  * **For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts**  - This emphasizes that what God thinks and does is beyond what a human can understand. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
