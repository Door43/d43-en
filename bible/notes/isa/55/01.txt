===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel in exile through Isaiah.

  * **Ho**  - This word is used to get their attention. You may have a similar word in your language. AT: "Listen to me." Or it can be omitted.
  * **all who thirst **-This metaphor points to the spiritual thirst of the people for Yahweh.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **come **- There is an urgency shown through three uses of "come."
  * **wine and milk**  - The land of Judah produced wine and milk. These are symbols of God's mercy.
