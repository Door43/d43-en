===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.
  * **Ho** - This word is used to get their attention. AT: "Listen to me."
  * **all who thirst, come to the water...without cost** - Here Yahweh's blessing is compared to food and drink.  This means God freely gives his blessing and it can satisfy the people (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
