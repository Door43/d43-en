====== Isaiah 55:10-11 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 Rain and snow come down from the sky,
\q2 and they cause the ground to be moist before the moisture returns \add to the sky and produces more clouds\add*.
\q1 When the ground becomes moist, it causes plants to sprout and grow,
\q2 with the result that the soil produces seed for the farmer \add to plant\add* and \add grain to produce flour to make\add* bread for people to eat.
\q1
\v 11 And similarly the things that I promise to do, I will always cause to happen;
\q2 my promises will always be fulfilled \f + \ft litotes \f*.
\q1 They will accomplish the things that I gave them to accomplish \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\q1
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 Yahweh sends the rain and snow down from the sky,
\q2 and they water the ground.
\q1 When the ground becomes moist, it causes plants to sprout and grow,
\q2 with the result that the soil produces seed for the farmer to plant and grain to produce flour to make bread for people to eat.
\q1
\v 11 And similarly, the things that I promise to do, I will always cause to happen;
\q2 my promises will always come true.
\q1 They will accomplish the things for which I spoke them.


\q1
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q1
\v 10 For as the rain and snow come down from heaven
\q1 and do not return there unless they saturate the earth
\q1 and make it produce and sprout and give seed to the farmer who sows and bread to the eater,
\q1
\v 11 so also my word will be that goes from my mouth—it will not return to me empty,
\q1 but it will achieve the purpose for which I sent it.
</usfm>

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Jerusalem.

  * **For as the rain and snow ... do not return there** - This is likely a description of the rain and snow evaporating.
  * **so also my word ... it will succeed in that for which I sent it** - Yahweh speaks of his word as if it were a person whom he sends out as his messenger to accomplish a task. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **my word will be that goes from my mouth** - Here the word "mouth" represents Yahweh himself. AT: "the word that I speak" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **it will not return to me useless** - Here the description of the word returning to Yahweh means that it has completed the task that Yahweh had sent it to complete. That it will not return "useless" means that it will not fail to accomplish its task. AT: "it will not fail to complete its task" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **but it will accomplish that which I wish, and it will succeed in that for which I sent it** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that what Yahweh says will always happen. AT: "but I will accomplish what I wish, and the things that I speak I will cause to happen" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
