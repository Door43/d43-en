\q1
\v 10 For as the rain and snow come down from heaven 
\q1 and do not return there unless they water the earth,
\q1 and make it sprout and bud and give seed to the sower and bread to the one who eats,
\q1
\v 11 So also my word will be that goes from my mouth: it  will not return to me empty,
\q1 but it will accomplish that which I intend, and it will succeed in that which I intended."
