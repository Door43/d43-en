====== Isaiah 55:10-11 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 Rain and snow come down from the sky,
\q2 and they cause the ground to be moist before the moisture returns \add to the sky and produces more clouds\add*.
\q1 When the ground becomes moist, it causes plants to sprout and grow,
\q2 with the result that the soil produces seed for the farmer \add to plant\add* and \add grain to produce flour to make\add* bread for people to eat.
\q1
\v 11 And similarly the things that I promise to do, I will always cause to happen;
\q2 my promises will always be fulfilled \f + \ft litotes \f*.
\q1 They will accomplish the things that I gave them to accomplish \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\q1
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 I send the rain and snow down from the sky,
\q2 and they water the ground.
\q1 When the ground becomes moist, it causes plants to sprout and grow,
\q2 with the result that the soil produces seed for the farmer to plant and grain to produce flour to make bread for people to eat.
\q1
\v 11 And similarly, the things that I promise to do, I will always cause to happen;
\q2 my promises will always come true.
\q1 They will accomplish the things for which I spoke them.


\q1

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q1
\v 10 For as the rain and snow come down from heaven 
\q1 and do not return there unless they saturate the earth
\q1 and make it produce and sprout and give seed to the sower and bread to the eater,
\q1
\v 11 so also my word will be that goes from my mouth: it  will not return to me uselessly,
\q1 but it will accomplish that which I wish, and it will succeed in that for which I sent it.
</usfm>
