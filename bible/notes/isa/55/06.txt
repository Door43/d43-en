===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Seek Yahweh while he may be found; call on him while he is nearby** - These two clauses mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. It means the people need to repent and start obeying God while he is willing to forgive them and bless them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Seek Yahweh while he may be found** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Seek Yahweh while you may still find him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Let the wicked leave his path** - Here "path" refers to a person's behavior.
  * **and he will pity him** - "and Yahweh will pity him"
