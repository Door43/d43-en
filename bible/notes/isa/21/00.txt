====== Isaiah 21 General Notes ======

=== Structure and formatting ===
Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 21:1-10, 13-17, which are quotations.


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Cush ==
Dumah and Seir are places in Edom. Part of this chapter is a prophecy against Cush. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])


=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== The desert by the sea ==
This is a metaphor for an unknown nation. Scholars are divided over the proper identity of this nation, but it is probably Babylon. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

== Mystery ==
The fulfillment of this chapter is very mysterious. It is unknown who is truly being address and how this is to be fulfilled in history. This prophecy may be symbolic or literal. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:fulfill]])
