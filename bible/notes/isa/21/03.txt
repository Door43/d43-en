<usfm>
\q1
\v 3 Therefore my loins are filled with pain;
\q1 pains like the pains of a woman in labor have taken hold of me;
\q1 I am bowed down by what I heard; I am disturbed by what I saw.
\q1
\v 4 My heart pounds; shuddering overcomes me;
\q1 the night that I desired has been turned into trembling for me.
