  * **They prepare** - Here "They" refers to the leaders of Babylon.
  * **arise, princes** - Here "princes" refers in general to men with authority and not necessarily to sons of kings.
  * **prepare the table** - Here "table" represents the food that people will eat at the feast. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **anoint your shields with oil** - Soldiers would put oil on their leather shields so they would stay soft and not crack during battle. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
