\v 11 Dear friend, do not imitate a bad example like that. Instead, keep imitating good examples. Remember that people who do good deeds truly belong to God. Anyone who keeps doing what is bad has never seen God.
\p
\v 12 All the believers who know Demetrius say that he is a good person. If the truth were a person, he would say the same thing! We also say he is a good person, and you know that what we say about him is true.

\v 11 Beloved, do not imitate what is evil but what is good. The one who does good is of God; the one who does evil has not seen God.
\v 12 Demetrius is borne witness to by all and by the truth itself. We also bear witness, and you know that our testimony is true.

  * **General Information:** - Here "we" refers to John and those with him and does not include Gaius. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])

  * **Beloved** - Here this is used as a term of endearment for fellow believers. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:3jn:01:05|1:5]].
  * **do not imitate what is evil** - "do not copy the evil things that people do" 
  * **but what is good** - There are words left out but they are understood. AT: "but imitate the good things that people do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **is of God** - "belongs to God" 
  * **has not seen God** - "does not belong to God" or "does not believe in God"
