\v 11 Dear friend, do not imitate a bad example like that. Instead, keep imitating good examples. Remember that people who do good deeds truly belong to God.


\p
\v 12 All the believers who know Demetrius say that he is a good person. If the truth were a person, he would say the same thing! We also say he is a good person, and you know that what we say about him is true.

\v 11 Beloved, do not imitate evil but good. He who does good is of God. He who does evil has not seen God.
\v 12 Demetrius is born witness to by all and by the truth itself. We also bear witness, and you know that our testimony is true.
