\v 25 When you have been in the land \add of Canaan\add* for a long time and you have children and grandchildren, do not sin by making an idol that represents anything at all, because Yahweh says that is evil, and if you do that, you will cause him to become angry with you \add and punish you\add*.
\v 26 Today I am requesting everyone who is in heaven and everyone who is on the earth \f + \ft metonymy \f* to watch what you are doing. \add If you disobey what I am telling you\add*, you will soon all die in the land that you will be crossing the Jordan \add River\add* to occupy. You will not live very long there; Yahweh will completely get rid of many \f + \ft hyperbole \f* of you.

\v 25 When you beget children and your children’s children, and when you will have been in the land for a long time, and if you corrupt yourselves and make a carved figure in the form of anything, and do what is evil in the sight of Yahweh your God, to provoke him to anger—
\v 26 I call heaven and earth to witness against you today that you will soon utterly perish from off the land that you are going over the Jordan to possess; you will not prolong your days in it, but you will be completely destroyed.
