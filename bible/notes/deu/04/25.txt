\v 26 Today I am requesting everyone who is in heaven and everyone who is on the earth \f + \ft metonymy \f* to watch what you are doing. \add If you disobey what I am telling you\add*, you will soon all die in the land that you will be crossing the Jordan \add River\add* to occupy.

\v 25 When you beget children and your children's children, and when you will have been in the land for a long time, and if you corrupt yourselves and make a carved figure in the form of anything, and do what is evil in the sight of Yahweh your God, to provoke him to angerx97
\v 26 I call heaven and earth to witness against you today that you will soon utterly perish from off the land that you are going over the Jordan to possess; you will not prolong your days in it, but you will be completely destroyed.
