<usfm>
\v 19 Be careful when you lift your eyes up to the heavens and look at the sun, the moon, or the stars—all the host of the heavens—be careful that you are not drawn away to worship them and adore them—those things that Yahweh your God has assigned them there for all the people under the whole sky.
\v 20 But Yahweh has taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be to him a people of his own inheritance, as you are today.
