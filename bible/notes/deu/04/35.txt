===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues to speak to the people of Israel as one person, so all instances of "you" and "your" are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]]) 

  * **To you these things were shown** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh showed you these things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **he made you to hear ... made you see** - "he made sure you heard ... made sure you saw"
  * **made you ... you heard** - Moses speaks as if the people to whom he was speaking were the people he had spoken to at Mount Sinai many years earlier. In fact the people at Mount Sinai were the fathers of the people to whom he was speaking these words. AT: "made your fathers ... your fathers heard" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
