===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues to speak to the people of Israel. He speaks as though they were one man, so all instances of "you" and "your" are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]]) 

  * **But from there** - "But when you are in those other nations"
  * **you will seek** - The word "you" here is plural. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **when you search after him** - "when you really try to find him" or "when you really try to know him"
  * **with all your heart and with all your soul** - The idiom "with all your heart" means "completely" and "with ... soul" means "with all your being." These two phrases have similar meaning. AT: "with all your being" or "with all your energy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
