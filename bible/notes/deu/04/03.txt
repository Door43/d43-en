===== Translation Notes: =====
Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

    * **Your eyes have seen** - AT: "You saw" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
    * **because of Baal Peor** - This refers to an event that happened while the people were walking through the wilderness. The people of Israel listened to the women of Moab and they started worshiping a false god. Yahweh was angry and told Moses to kill the leaders who caused the people to sin. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
    * **Peor** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:deu:03:28|3:29]].
    * **you who clung to Yahweh** - AT: "you who were careful to obey Yahweh"
