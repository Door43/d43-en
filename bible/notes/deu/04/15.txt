\v 15 So take great heed to yourselves—for you saw no kind of form on the day that Yahweh spoke to you at Horeb out of the middle of the fire—
\v 16 that you do not corrupt yourselves and make a carved figure in the likeness of any creature, the form of a male or a female person,
\v 17 or the likeness of any beast that is on the earth, or the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the heavens,
\v 18 or the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, or the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth.
