\v 41 Then Moses selected three cities on the east side of the Jordan river,
\v 42 so that anyone might flee to one of them if he killed another person accidentally, without being his enemy previously. By fleeing to one of these cities, he might survive.
\v 43 They were: Bezer in the wilderness, the plain country, for the Reubenites;  Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites.
