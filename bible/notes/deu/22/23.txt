\v 23 If there is a girl who is a virgin, engaged to a man, and another man finds her in the city and sleeps with her,
\v 24 take both of them to the city gate, and stone them to death. You must stone the girl, because she did not cry out, even though she was in the city. You must stone the man, because he violated his neighbor's wife; and you will remove the evil from among you.
