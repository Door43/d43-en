\v 17 See, he has accused her of shameful things and said, 'I did not find in your daughter the proof of virginity'—yet this is the proof of my daughter’s virginity." And then they will spread the garment out before the elders of the city.

  * **he has accused her of shameful things**  - "he has accused her of having sex before their marriage" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **I did not find in your daughter the proof of virginity**  - "I did not find proof that your daughter was a virgin"
  * **yet this is the proof of my daughter’s virginity**  - "but here is the proof that my daughter was a virgin"
  * **And then they will spread the garment out**  - "And then the father and mother will show the clothing to the elders." The clothing was proof that their daughter was virgin because it had a blood stain from the first time she had sex on her wedding night.
