====== Deuteronomy 22:20-21 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 But if what the man said is true, and there is nothing to prove that she was a virgin when he married her,
\v 21 they must take that young woman to the door of her father's house. Then the men of that city must execute her by throwing stones at her. They must do that because she has done something in Israel that is very disgraceful, by having sex with some man \add while she was still living\add* in her father's house. By executing her like that, you will get rid of this evil practice from among you.
