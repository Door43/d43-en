\v 25 But if the man finds the engaged girl in the field, and if he force hers, and lies with her; then the only man who lay with her must die.
\v 26 But to the girl you must do nothing; there is no sin worthy of death in the girl. For when a man rises against his neighbor and kills him—this matter is like it.
\v 27 For he found her in the field; the engaged girl cried out, but there was no one to save her.
