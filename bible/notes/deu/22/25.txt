\v 25 But if the man finds the engaged girl in the field, and if he forces her and lies with her, then only the man who lay with her must die.
\v 26 But to the girl you must do nothing; there is no sin worthy of death in the girl. For this case is like when a man attacks his neighbor and kills him.
\v 27 For he found her in the field; the engaged girl cried out, but there was no one to save her.
