\v 26 But you must not punish the young woman, because she did not do anything for which she deserves to be executed. This case is like when one man attacks another man \add in the countryside\add* and murders him,

\v 25 But if the man finds the engaged girl in the field, and if he force hers, and lies with her; then the only man who lay with her must die.
\v 26 But to the girl you must do nothing; there is no sin worthy of death in the girl. For when a man rises against his neighbor and kills him—this matter is like it.
\v 27 For he found her in the field; the engaged girl cried out, but there was no one to save her.
