\v 26 But you must not punish the young woman, because she did not do anything for which she deserves to be executed. This case is like when one man attacks another man \add in the countryside\add* and murders him,
\v 27 because the man who raped her saw her when she was in the open countryside, and even though she called out for help, there was no one there who could rescue her.

\v 25 But if the man finds the engaged girl in the field, and if he seizes her and sleeps with her, then only the man who sleeps with her must die.
\v 26 But to the girl you must do nothing; there is no sin worthy of death in the girl. For this case is like when a man attacks his neighbor and kills him.
\v 27 For he found her in the field; the engaged girl cried out, but there was no one to save her.
