  * **If a man is found** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "If someone finds a man" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **and you will remove the evil.** - "you must remove from among the Israelites those who do this evil thing" or "both of them are evil. You must execute them."
