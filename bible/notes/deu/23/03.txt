\v 3 An Ammonite or a Moabite must not enter into the assembly of Yahweh; as far as to the tenth generation of his descendants, none of them may enter into the assembly of Yahweh.
\v 4 This is because they did not meet you with bread and with water on the road, when you had come out of Egypt, and because they hired against you Balaam, the son of Beor from Pethor in Aram Naharaim, to curse you.
