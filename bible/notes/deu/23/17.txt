===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **cultic prostitute ... among the daughters ... among the sons** - Possible meanings are that Moses 1) openly forbids women and men to perform sexual acts as part of temple service or 2) uses a euphemism to forbid women and men to perform sexual acts to receive money. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **You must not bring the wages of a female prostitute** - "If a woman earns money from prostitution, you must not bring that money"
  * **or the wages of a male prostitute** - "or the money a man earns from prostitution" 
  * **into the house of Yahweh your God** - "into the temple"
  * **for any vow** - "to fulfill a vow" 
  * **both these** - The phrase "both these" refers to the wages of a sacred female prostitute and the wages of a sacred male prostitute.
