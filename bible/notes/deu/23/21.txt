\v 21 When you make a vow to Yahweh your God, you must not be slow in fulfilling it, for Yahweh your God will surely require it of you;  it would be sin in you not to fulfill it.
\v 22 But if you will refrain from making a vow, it will be no sin in you.
\v 23 That which has gone out from your lips you must observe and do; according as you have vowed to Yahweh your God, anything that you have freely promised with your mouth.
