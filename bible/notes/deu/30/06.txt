===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **circumcise your heart** - This is not a literal removal of flesh. It means God will remove their sin and enable them to love and obey him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **with all your heart and with all your soul** - See how you translated this phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:04:29|4:29]].
  * **obey the voice of Yahweh** - Here "voice" means what Yahweh says. AT: "obey what Yahweh says" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
