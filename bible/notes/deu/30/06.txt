===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **circumcise your heart** - This is not a literal removal of flesh. It means God will remove their sin and enable them to love and obey him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **with all your heart and with all your soul** - These basically mean the same thing and are combined for emphasis. AT: "with complete commitment" or "completely" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **obey the voice of Yahweh** - AT: "obey what Yahweh says" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
