\v 11 For this commandment that I am commanding you today is not too hard for you, neither is it too far for you to reach.
\v 12 It is not in heaven, so that you should have to say, ‘Who will go up for us to heaven and bring it down to us and make us able to hear it, so that we may do it?’

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **neither is it too far for you to reach** - This means it is not too difficult for a person to know what Yahweh wants his people to do.
  * **Who will go up for us to heaven and bring it down to us and make us able to hear it, so that we may do it?** - Moses describes an Israelite using this question. The Israelite would be emphasizing that he thinks God's commands are too difficult to kmow. AT: "Someone must travel to heaven to learn God's commands and then return to tell us what they are." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
