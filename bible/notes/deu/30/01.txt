===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 "I have now told you about the ways that Yahweh our God will bless you \add if you obey him\add* and the ways that he will curse you \add if you disobey him\add*. I am saying that you must choose which you want. But when \add you choose not to obey his laws\add*, some day you will be living in the countries to which he will scatter you, and you will remember \add what I told you\add*.
\v 2 Then, if you return to Yahweh our God, and faithfully [IDI] obey all that I have today commanded you to do,
\v 3 he will act mercifully toward you. He will bring you back from the nations to which he scattered you, and he will cause you to be prosperous again.

\v 1 I have now told you about the ways that Yahweh our God will bless you if you obey him and the ways that he will curse you if you disobey him. But if you choose not to obey his laws, some day you will be living in the countries to which he will have scattered you, and you will remember what I told you.
\v 2 Then, if you and your children begin to worship Yahweh our God and faithfully obey all that I have today commanded you to do,
\v 3 he will again act mercifully toward you. He will bring you back from the nations to which he scattered you, and he will cause you to be prosperous again.

\c 30
\p
\v 1 When all these things have come on you, the blessings and the curses that I have set before you, and when you call them to mind among all the other nations where Yahweh your God has driven you,
\v 2 and when you return to Yahweh your God and obey his voice, following all that I am commanding you today— you and your children—with all your heart and with all your soul,
\v 3 then Yahweh your God will reverse your captivity and have compassion on you; he will return and gather you from all the peoples where Yahweh your God has scattered you.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **When all these things have come on you** - Here "these things" refer to the blessings and curses described in chapters 28-29. The phrase "have come on you" is an idiom that means to happen. AT: "When all these things happen to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **that I have set before you** - This speaks of the blessings and curses that Moses told the people as if they were objects that he set in front of them. AT: "that I have just now told you about" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **call them to mind** - This is an idiom. AT: "remember them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])

  * **obey his voice** - Here "voice" is referring to what Yahweh says. AT: "obey what he says" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **with all your heart and with all your soul** - The idiom "with all ... heart" means "completely" and "with all ... soul" means "with all your being." These two phrases have similar meaning. AT: "with all your being" or "with all your energy." See how you translated these words in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:04:29|4:29]].
