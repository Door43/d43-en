===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Who will go over the sea for us and bring it to us and make us to hear it, so that we may do it?**  -  AT: "Someone must travel across the sea to learn God's commands and then return and tell us what they are" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **in your mouth and your heart**  - This means that the people already know God's commands and can speak them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
