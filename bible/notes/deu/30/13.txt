\v 13 And they are not on the other side of the sea. You do not need to say, 'Who will cross the sea for us and bring them back to us, so we can learn them?'
\v 14 No, his commands are here with you. You know them, and you can say them again and again. So you can easily obey them.

\v 13 Neither is it beyond the sea, so that you should have to say, 'Who will go over the sea for us and bring it to us and make us to hear it, so that we may do it?'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **Who will go over the sea for us and bring it to us and make us to hear it, so that we may do it?** - This rhetorical question continues the idea that the people of Israel think Yahweh's commands are too difficult to know. This question can be translated as a statement. AT: "Someone must travel across the sea to learn God's commands and then return and tell us what they are" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **in your mouth and your heart** - This means that the people already know God's commands and can tell them to others. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
