===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Neither is it beyond the sea** - This means it is not too difficult to know what God wants his people to do.
  * **Who will go over the sea for us and bring it to us and make us to hear it, so that we may do it?** - Moses describes an Israelite using this question. The Israelite would be emphasizing that he thinks God's commands are too difficult to know. AT: “Someone must travel across the sea to learn God's commands and then return and tell us what they are.” (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **But the word is very near to you** - This means God's commands are easy to know and to understand. 
  * **in your mouth and in your heart** - These words mean basically the same thing. They emphasize that the people already know God's commands and can speak them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
