<usfm>
\v 17 But if you stop worshiping Yahweh, and if you refuse to obey what he says, and if you allow others to persuade you to worship other gods,

\v 17 But if your heart turns away, and you do not listen but instead are drawn away and bow down to other gods and worship them,

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues to speak to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **if your heart turns away ... but instead are drawn away and bow down to other gods and worship them** - Here "heart" refers to the whole person. This can be stated in active form. AT: "if you stop being loyal to God ... and the people living in the land convince you to bow down and worship other gods" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **to you today that you ... you will not prolong your days** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as a group. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **prolong your days** - Long days are a metaphor for a long life. AT: "be able to live a long time." See how you translated these words in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:04:25|4:26]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
