===== Translation Notes: =====
Moses continues blessing the tribes of Joseph.
    * **The firstborn of an ox, majestic is he** - AT: "Joseph's descendants are powerful like a firstborn bull"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
    * **firstborn of an ox**  - Here "firstborn" and "ox" represent superiority and strength.
    * **his horns are the horns** - Here "horns" are also represent strength.
    * **ten thousands of Ephraim...the thousands of Manasseh** - This means the tribe of Ephraim will be stronger than the tribe of Manasseh. AT: "the 10,000 of Ephraim...the 1,000 of Manasseh" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
