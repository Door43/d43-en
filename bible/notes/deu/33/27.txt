===== translationNotes: =====

  * **underneath are the everlasting arms** - This means God will support and take care of his people forever. AT: "he holds you with his everlasting arms" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **before you ... Destroy** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the word "you" and the command "destroy" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
