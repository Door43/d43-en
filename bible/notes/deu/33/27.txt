===== translationNotes: =====

  * **is a refuge for his people** - "will protect his people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **underneath are the everlasting arms** - The words "everlasting arms" are a metaphor for Yahweh's promise to protect his people forever. AT: "he will support and take care of you, his people, forever (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **He thrust out ... he said** - Moses speaks of the future as if it were the past to emphasize that what he is saying will come true. AT "He will thrust out ... he will say" [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pastforfuture]]
  * **before you ... Destroy** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the word "you" and the command "destroy" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **he said, "Destroy!"** - "he will tell you to destroy them!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
