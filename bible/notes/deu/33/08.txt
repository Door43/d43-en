===== Translation Notes: =====
Moses continues blessing each tribe of Israel.

    * **Your Thummim and your Urim** - These were sacred stones the high priest carried on his breastplate and used at times to determine God's will. Here "your" refers to Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
    * **the one with whom you are pleased** - This refers to the tribe of Levi. AT: "your holy one"
    * **Massah** - See how you translated this name in [[en:bible:notes:deu:06:16|6:16]]. Translator may add a footnote that says: "The name 'Massah' means 'testing.'"
    * **Meribah** - See how you translated this name in [[en:bible:notes:deu:32:50|32:51]]. Translator may add a footnote that says: "The name 'Meribah' means 'argue' or 'quarrel.'"
