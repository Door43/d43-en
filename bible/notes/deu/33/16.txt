===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues to bless the tribes of Israel; the blessings are short poems. He continues to describe the tribe of Joseph, which he began to do in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:33:13|33:13]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **May his land be blessed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "May Yahweh bless his land." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:33:13|33:13]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **its abundance** - The abstract noun "abundance" can be translated as a verb phrase. AT: "what it produces in large amounts"
  * **him who was in the bush** - The full meaning of this statement can be made clear. AT: "Yahweh, who spoke to Moses from the burning bush" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Let the blessing come on the head of Joseph** - This metaphor is of a man putting his hand on the head of a son and asking God to bless the son. The man here is Yahweh. AT: "May Yahweh bless Joseph as a father blesses his son" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **come on the head of Joseph, and on the top of the head of him** - Here "head" and "top of the head" refer to the whole person and are a reference to Joseph's descendants. AT: "be upon the descendants of Joseph" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **top of the head** - Another possible meaning is "brow" or "forehead."
