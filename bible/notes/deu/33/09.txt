===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues to bless the tribes of Israel, which he began to do in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:33:01|33:2]]. The blessings are short poems. He continues describing the tribe of Levi, which he began to do in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:33:08|33:8]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **your word** - "your commands"
  * **guarded ... kept** - These words both mean to watch over and to protect. They are often metaphors for "obeyed," but here they should be translated literally because they refer to a time when the Levites literally killed people who were rebelling against Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
