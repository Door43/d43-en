===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues to bless the tribes of Israel; the blessings are short poems. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]])

  * **satisfied with favor, and full of the blessing of Yahweh** - "whom Yahweh has blessed and given many good things"
  * **take possession** - Moses speaks as if the tribe of Naphtali is one man, so these words are singular. [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]]
  * **the land to the west and south** - This refers to the land around Lake Galilee. The full meaning of this statement may be made explicit. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
