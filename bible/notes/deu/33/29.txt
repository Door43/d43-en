===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **Who is like you, a people saved by Yahweh** - Here the people of Israel are reminded that no other people have been saved by Yahweh like they have. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. It can also be stated in active form. AT: "There is no other people group like you, a people whom Yahweh has saved and uses to defeat his enemies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the shield of your help, and the sword of your majesty** - This means Yahweh uses his power to fight for the Israelites and to protect them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you will trample down their high places** - Possible meanings are 1) the Israelites will walk on the backs of their enemies when the Israelites defeat them, or 2) the Israelites will destroy the places where the other people worship false gods.
