  * [[:en:obe:other:Moses]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:love]]

 
===== Translation Notes: =====
Moses continues blessing each tribe of Israel.

    * **The one loved by Yahweh lives** - AT: "The ones Yahweh loves live" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **he lives between Yahweh’s arms** - Possible meanings are 1) Yahweh protects the tribe of Benjamin with his power, or 2) Yahweh lives in the hill region of the tribe of Benjamin. Either way it means Yahweh takes care of them.
