===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses continues blessing each tribe of Israel.

  * **Dan is a lion cub that leaps out from Bashan**  - This means the people of Dan are strong, and they attack the enemies of the Israelites who live in Bashan. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
