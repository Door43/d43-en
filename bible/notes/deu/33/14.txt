===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues blessing the tribes of Joseph.

  * **With the precious things of the harvest made by the sun** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "With the best crops which the sun causes to grow" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **With the precious things of the passing of the months** - "With the best crops that grow month to month"
  * **With the finest things of the ancient mountains, And with the precious things of the everlasting hills** - Both phrases mean the same thing. They emphasize that Moses wants the best fruit to grow in the hills of their land. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
