===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Jeshurun** - This is another name for the people of Israel. It means "upright one." See how you translated it in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:32:15|32:15]].
  * **to your help** - "to help you." Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the word "you" here is singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **on the clouds** - This is an image of Yahweh riding on clouds like a king in his chariot. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
