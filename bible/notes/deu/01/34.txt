\v 34 Yahweh heard the sound of your words and was angry; he swore and said,
\v 35 'Surely not one of these men of this evil generation will see the good land that I swore to give to your ancestors,
\v 36 save Caleb son of Jephunneh; he will see it. To him I will give the land that he has stepped on, and to his children, because he has wholly followed Yahweh.'
