\v 26 Yet you refused to attack, but rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your God.
\v 27 You complained in your tents and said, “It is because Yahweh hated us that he has brought us out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
\v 28 Where can we go now? Our brothers have made our heart to melt, saying, ‘Those people are bigger and taller than us; their cities are large and are fortified up to the heavens;  moreover, we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.’
