\v 26 Yet you refused to attack, but rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your God.
\v 27 You complained in your tents and said, "It is because Yahweh hated us that he has brought us out of the land of Egypt, to defeat us by the power of the Amorites, and to destroy us.
\v 28 Where can we go now? Our brothers have made our heart to melt, saying, 'Those people are bigger and taller than we are; their cities are large and are fortified up to the heavens;  moreover, we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.'"

===== Translation Notes: =====
Moses continues reminding the people of Israel what the previous generation of Israelites did.


  * **Yet you refused to attack** - God commanded the Israelites to attack and destroy the Amorites, but the Israelites were afraid and refused to fight them.
  * **Where can we go now?** - The people use a question to emphasize how afraid they were. AT: "We have nowhere to go" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **made our hearts to melt** - AT: "made us very afraid" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **and are fortified up to the heavens** - This is an exaggeration that emphasizes how frightened the people were because the cities were so large and strong. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **sons of the Anakim** - These are descendants of the Anak people who were very large and fierce. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
