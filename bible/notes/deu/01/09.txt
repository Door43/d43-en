===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I spoke to you at that time** - Here "I" refers to Moses. The phrase "at that time" refers to when the Israelites were at Horeb, which is the same as Mount Sinai. AT: "Also, when we were at Horeb, I spoke to you" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **I am not able to carry you myself alone** - AT: "I cannot take care of all of you by myself"
  * **as the stars of heaven for multitude** - This is an exaggeration to show that God has been faithful to his promise by making it so that there are lots of Israelites. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **thousand** - "1,000" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
