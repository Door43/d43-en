===== Translation Notes: =====
Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **But how can I myself alone carry your loads, your burdens, and your disputes?** - Moses uses a question to emphasize that he cannot solve every person's problems by himself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **your loads, your burdens** - This means the people's problems and complaints are like a heavy load that Moses cannot carry alone. He needs others to help him. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **your disputes** - "your arguments" or "your disagreements"
  * **and men of good repute, tribe by tribe** - AT: "and men that the people from each of your tribes know and respect"
