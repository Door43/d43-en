    * **he who removes his neighbor's landmark**  - This implies that a person would take the markers away from the borders of his neighbor's land so he can say that he own some of that land. AT: "who takes land away from his neighbor by moving the markers on the borders of his land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
