===== translationNotes: =====


  * **command you today ... you will pass** - Moses sis speaking to the Israelites as a group, so both instances of the word "you" are plural. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **I command** - Here "I" refers to Moses. The elders are there in agreement with Moses, but he is the only one speaking.
  * **plaster them with plaster** - Plaster is usually a mixture of lime, sand and water that is spread on something. After it dries it forms a hard, smooth surface on which a person can write. "spread plaster on them" or "spread a white substance on them"
  * **a land flowing with milk and honey** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:06:03|6:3]].
