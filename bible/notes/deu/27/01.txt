===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so except where noted, the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **command you today ... you will pass** - Moses is speaking to the Israelites as a group, so both instances of the word "you" are plural. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **I command** - Here "I" refers to Moses. The elders are there in agreement with Moses, but he is the only one speaking.
  * **plaster them with plaster** - Plaster is usually a mixture of lime, sand, and water that is spread on something. It dries to form a hard, smooth surface on which a person can write. "spread plaster on them" or "make them so you can write on them"
  * **a land flowing with milk and honey** -   * **a land flowing with milk and honey** - This is an idiom. Translate this as in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:06:03|6:3]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
