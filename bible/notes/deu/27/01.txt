===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **I command** - Here "I" refers to Moses. The elders are there in agreement with Moses, but he is the only one speaking.
    * **plaster them with plaster** - Plaster is a paste that goes on wet and dries to form a smooth surface, suitable for writing upon. AT: "spread plaster on them" or "spread a white substance on them"
    * **a land flowing with milk and honey** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:deu:06:03|6:3]].
