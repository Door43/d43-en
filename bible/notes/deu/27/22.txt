===== Translation Notes: =====
Moses continues telling the Levites and the people what they must say. 

    * **May the man be cursed** - AT: "May Yahweh curse the man" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
    * **the daughter of his father, or with the daughter of his mother** - This means a man cannot sleep with his sister, even if she has a different mother or father.
