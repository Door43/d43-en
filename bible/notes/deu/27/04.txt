===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **you have passed ... set up ... I am commanding you** - Moses is addressing the Israelites as a group, so the instances of "you" and the command "set up" are plural. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **Mount Ebal** - This is a mountain near Shechem. See how you translated it in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:11:29|11:29]].
  * **you must raise no iron tool to work the stones** - This refers to the chisels that would make the stones smoother, in order that they might fit together better. The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit.  AT: "you will not shape the altar stones with iron tools" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
