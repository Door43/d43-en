===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **there you will build an altar**  - This altar is made of stones, but is not the same as the stone monuments described in [[en:bible:notes:deu:27:01]].
    * **you must raise no iron tool to work the stones**  - This refers to the chisels that would make the stones smoother, in order that they might better fit together. AT: "you will not shape the altar stones with iron tools." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
