Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

    * **Mount Ebal** - This is a mountain near Shechem. See how you translated it in [[en:bible:notes:deu:11:29|11:29]].
    * **you must raise no iron tool to work the stones** - This refers to the chisels that would make the stones smoother, in order that they might fit together better. AT: "you will not shape the altar stones with iron tools"
