  * **your eye will not pity them** - AT: "you will not show them mercy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **that will be a trap for you** - This means worshiping other gods will result in the people dying like an animal dies when a hunter captures it in his trap. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
