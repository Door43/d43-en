===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **For they will** - Here "they" refer to the people living in Canaan that the Israelites do not kill. AT: "For the people from the other nations will"
  * **So the anger of Yahweh will be kindled against you** - Moses compares Yahweh's anger to someone starting a fire. This emphasizes Yahweh's power to destroy what makes him angry. AT: "Then Yahweh will become very angry with you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
