===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues to tell the people of Israel Yahweh's words as if the Israelites are one person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **For they will** - "If you allow your children to marry the people from the other nations, the people from the other nations will"
  * **So the anger of Yahweh will be kindled against you** - Moses compares Yahweh's anger to someone starting a fire. This emphasizes Yahweh's power to destroy what makes him angry. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh will kindle his anger against you" or "Then Yahweh will become very angry with you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **against you** - The word "you" refers to all the Israelites and so is plural. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **you will deal ... you will break ... dash ... cut ... burn** - Moses is speaking to all the Israelites here, so these words are all plural. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
