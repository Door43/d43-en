\p
\v 17 If you say in your heart, 'These nations are more numerous than I; how can I dispossess them?'—
\v 18 do not be afraid of them; you will call to mind  what Yahweh your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt;
\v 19 the great sufferings that your eyes saw, the signs, the wonders, the mighty hand, and the display of power by which Yahweh your God brought you out. Yahweh your God will do the same to all the peoples whom you fear.
