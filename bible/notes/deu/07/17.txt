\v 17 If you shall say in your heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?
\v 18 you shall not be afraid of them: you shall well remember what Jehovah your God did to Pharaoh, and to all Egypt;
\v 19 the great trials which your eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, whereby Jehovah your God brought you out: so shall Jehovah your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid.
