<usfm>
\v 25 You will burn the carved figures of their god; do not desire the silver or the gold that covers them so much that you want to take it for yourself, and you become trapped by it; for it is detestable to Yahweh your God.
\v 26 You will not bring any disgusting thing into your house and start to worship it. You will utterly detest and abhor it, for it is set apart for destruction.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **their god** - AT: "the gods of the other nations"
  * **and you become trapped by it** - This means taking the idols for the gold or silver could cause the people to start worshiping the idols. This will lead them to ruin like an animal caught in a hunter's trap. AT: "and it becomes a trap to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **for it is detestable to Yahweh your God** - AT: "for Yahweh your God hates it very much"
  * **You will utterly detest and abhor**  - The words "detest" and "abhor" mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. AT: "You will absolutely detest" or "You will completely hate" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **for it is set apart for destruction** - AT: "for Yahweh has set it apart so that he may destroy it"
