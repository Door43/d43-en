\v 25 You must burn the wooden idols \add that represent\add* their gods. Do not desire to take the silver or gold \add decorations\add* that are on those idols, because if you take them for yourselves, they will be like a trap to catch you. Yahweh hates \add every part of those idols\add*.

<usfm>
\v 25 You will burn the carved figures of their gods—do not covet the silver or the gold that covers them and take it for yourself, because if you do, you will become trapped by it—for it is detestable to Yahweh your God.
\v 26 You will not bring any disgusting thing into your house and start to worship it. You will utterly detest and abhor it, for it is set apart for destruction.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues to tell the people of Israel Yahweh's words. In verse 25 he speaks to the group as a group, so the forms of "you" are plural, but in verse 26 he speaks if the Israelites are one person, so the forms are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **You will burn** - This is a command.
  * **their god** - "the gods of the other nations"
  * **do not covet ... trapped by it** - These words add to the instruction to burn the idols.
  * **and you become trapped by it** - Even taking the gold or silver on the idols could cause the people to start worshiping them. By doing this they would become like an animal caught by a trap. This can be stated in active form. AT: "and it becomes a trap to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **for it is detestable to Yahweh your God** - These words tell why Yahweh wants the people to burn the idols. "do this because Yahweh your God hates it very much"
  * **You will utterly detest and abhor** - The words "detest" and "abhor" mean basically the same thing and emphasize the intensity of hatred. AT: "You will completely hate." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **for it is set apart for destruction** - "for Yahweh has set it apart so that he may destroy it"
