\v 25 The graven images of their gods shall you burn with fire: you shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it to thee, lest you be snared therein; for it is an abomination to Jehovah your God.
\v 26 And you shall not bring an abomination into your house, and become a devoted thing like to it: you shall utterly detest it, and you shall utterly abhor it; for it is a devoted thing.
