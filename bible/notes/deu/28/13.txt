===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the head, and not the tail** - This means they will always be the leaders over other nations and never the servants following behind them. The Israelites will be superior in power, money, and honor. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **be only above...never be beneath** - This means the same as the first part of the sentence. They are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **if you do not turn away from...to the right hand, or to the left** - AT: "if you do not disobey...in any way"
