===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **But if** - Here Moses starts describing the curses the people will receive if they disobey.
  * **the voice of Yahweh your God** - Here the metonym "voice of Yahweh" means what Yahweh says. AT: "what Yahweh your God is saying" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **then all these curses will come on you and overtake you** - Moses describes the curses as a person who will come and stay with the people. This can be stated in active form. AT: "then Yahweh will curse you in these ways" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
