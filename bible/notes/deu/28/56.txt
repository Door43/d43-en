\v 56 The tender and delicate woman among you, who would not venture to put the bottom of her foot on the ground for delicateness and tenderness—she will be envious of her own dear husband, of her son, and of her daughter,
\v 57 and of her own newborn that comes out from between her legs, and of the children whom she will bear. She will eat them in private for lack of anything else, during the siege and in the distress which your enemy will put upon you within your city gates.

===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **The tender and delicate woman among you** - This means the woman is of noble birth and normally very gentle.
  * **who would not venture to put the bottom of her foot on the ground for delicateness and tenderness** - Moses is exaggerating. He is emphasizing that this noble woman is so rich and lives in such luxury that she would not allow herself to get dirty. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]]) 
  * **she will be envious of her own dear husband** - AT: "she will be hostile toward her own dear husband"
  * **within your city gates** - AT: "within your cities" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
