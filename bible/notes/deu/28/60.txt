<usfm>
\v 60 He will bring on you again all the diseases of Egypt that you was afraid of; they will cling to you.
\v 61 Also every sickness and plague that is not written in the book of this law, those also Yahweh will bring on you until you are destroyed.
\v 62 You will be left few in number, although you were like the stars of the heavens in number, because you did not listen to the voice of Yahweh your God.
