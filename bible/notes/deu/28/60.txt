<usfm>
\v 60 He will bring on you again all the diseases of Egypt that you were afraid of; they will cling to you.
\v 61 Also every sickness and plague that is not written in the book of this law, those also Yahweh will bring on you until you are destroyed.
\v 62 You will be left few in number, although you were like the stars of the heavens in number, because you did not listen to the voice of Yahweh your God.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **He will bring on you again all the diseases of Egypt** - This is an idiom. AT: "He will make sure that you again suffer from the diseases of Egypt" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
