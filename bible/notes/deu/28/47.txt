\v 47 Because you did not worship Yahweh your God with joyfulness and gladness of heart when you were in prosperity,
\v 48 therefore will you serve the enemies that Yahweh will send against you; you will serve them in hunger, in thirst, in nakedness, and in poverty. He will put a yoke of iron on your neck until he destroys you.
