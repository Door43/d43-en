===== Translation Notes: =====
Moses continues describing the army that will attack the Israelites if they do not obey Yahweh.

  * **you in all your city gates** - AT: "your cities" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **the fruit of your own body, the flesh of your sons and of your daughters** - These mean the same thing. They emphasize that the people will eat their own children because they will be so hungry after the enemy army surrounds their city. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
