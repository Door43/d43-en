===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues describing the army that will attack the Israelites if they do not obey Yahweh. He speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **you in all your city gates** - Here the phrase "city gates" represents a city. AT: "your cities" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **the fruit of your own body, the flesh of your sons and of your daughters** - Here "the flesh of your sons and of your daughters" explains the metaphor "the fruit of your own body." The people will be so hungry after the enemy army surrounds their city that they will eat their own children. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])****
  * **the fruit of your own body** - This is an idiom. AT: "your own children" ([[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
