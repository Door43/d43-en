\v 63 As Yahweh once rejoiced over you in doing you good, and in multiplying you, so he will rejoice over you in making you perish and in destroying you. You will be plucked off the land that you are going into to possess.
\v 64 Yahweh will scatter you among all peoples from the one end of the earth to the other end of the earth; there you will worship other gods that you have not known, neither you nor your ancestors, gods of wood and stone.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **over you in doing you good ... multiplying you ... rejoice over you in making you perish and in destroying you. You will be plucked** - Moses is speaking to the Israelites as a group, so all instances of "you" are plural. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **you are going *** scatter you ... you will worship ... you have not known ... you nor your ancestors** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **Yahweh once rejoiced over you in doing you good, and in multiplying you** - "Yahweh once enjoyed doing you good and causing you to become many"
  * **he will rejoice over you in making you perish** - "he will enjoy making you die"
  * **You will be plucked off the land that you are going into to possess** - Moses speaks of the people as though they were fruit that Yahweh would take off a bush. This can be stated in active form. AT: "He will remove you from the land which you are entering to possess" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **from the one end of the earth to the other end of the earth** - These two extremes together mean everywhere on earth. AT: "throughout the earth" or "all over the earth" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
