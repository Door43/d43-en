===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **in the fruit of your body, in the fruit of your cattle, in the fruit of your ground** - This is an idiom. See how you translated these words in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:28:03|28:4]]. AT: "with children, animals, and crops" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **his storehouse of the heavens** - Moses speaks of the clouds from which the rain falls as if they were a building where he stores the rain. AT: "the clouds" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **at the right time** - "when the crops need it"
  * **all the work of your hand** - The word "hand" is a synecdoche for the whole person. AT: "all the work that you do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
