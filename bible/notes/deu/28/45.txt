\v 45 All these curses will come on you and will pursue and overtake you until you are destroyed. This will happen because you did not listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, so as to keep his commandments and his statutes that he commanded you.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **All these curses will come on you and will pursue and overtake you until you are destroyed** - Moses describes the blessings as a person who would attack them by surprise or chase and catch them. AT: "Yahweh will bless you like this in ways that will completely surprise you, and it will be as if he is chasing you and you cannot escape having him bless you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **will come on you ... and overtake you** - Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:28:01|28:2]]
  * **to the voice of Yahweh your God** - Here the metonym "voice of Yahweh" means what Yahweh said. AT: "to what Yahweh your God said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **his commandments and his statutes** - The words "commandments" and "statutes" mean basically the same thing and refer to all that God commanded Israel. AT: "all of his commandments." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
