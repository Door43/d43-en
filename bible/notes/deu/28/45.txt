\v 45 All these curses will come on you and will pursue and overtake you until you are destroyed. This will happen because you did not listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, so as to keep his commandments and his statutes that he commanded you.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **All these curses will come on you and will pursue and overtake you until you are destroyed** - Moses describes the curses as a person chasing and conquering the people. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh will cause all these curses to happen to you until he destroys you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **to the voice of Yahweh your God** - Here the metonym "voice of Yahweh" means what Yahweh said. AT: "to what Yahweh your God said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **his commandments and his statutes** - The words "commandments" and "statutes" mean basically the same thing and refer to all that God commanded Israel. AT: "all of his commandments." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
