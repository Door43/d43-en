  * **Blessed will you be** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh will bless you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **in the city ... in the field** - This merism means that Yahweh will bless them everywhere. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **the fruit of your body, the fruit of your ground, the fruit of your beasts** - These are idioms for "your children, your crops, and all your animals" form a merism for everything the Israelites valued. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **the fruit of your beasts, the increase of your cattle, and the young of your flock** - This doublet is three ways of saying that Yaheweh will make the Israelites' animals many and strong.
