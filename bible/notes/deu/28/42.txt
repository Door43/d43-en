===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **rise up above you higher and higher; you yourself will come down lower and lower** - This means the foreigner will become superior to the Israelites in power, money, and honor.
  * **he will be the head, and you will be the tail** - This means the foreigner will become the leader of the Israelites. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[en:bible:notes:deu:28:13|28:13]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
