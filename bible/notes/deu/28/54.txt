\v 54 The man who is tender and very delicate among youâ€”he will be envious of his brother and his own dear wife, and of whatever children he has left.
\v 55 So he will not give to any of them the flesh of his own children that he is going to eat, because he will have nothing left for himself in the siege and in the distress which your enemy will put upon you within all your city gates.
