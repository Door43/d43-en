<usfm>
\v 49 Yahweh will bring a nation against you from far away, from the ends of the earth, like an eagle flies to its victim, a nation whose language you do not understand;
\v 50 a nation with ferocious expressions who have no respect for the aged, nor goodwill for the young.
\v 51 They will eat the young of your cattle and the fruit of your land until you are destroyed. They will leave for you no grain, new wine, or oil, no young of your cattle or of your flock, until they have caused you to perish.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **from far away, from the ends of the earth** - These mean the same thing. They emphasize the enemy army will come from a nation that is very far away from Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **like an eagle flies to its victim** - This means the enemy will come suddenly and the Israelites will not be able to stop them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **a nation with ferocious expressions** - This means they are ready to fight and will not show mercy.
  * **until you are destroyed** - AT: "until they destroy you" or "until they leave you with nothing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
