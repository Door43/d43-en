  * **like an eagle flies to its victim** - This means the enemy will come suddenly and the Israelites will not be able to stop them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **a nation with ferocious expressions** - This means they are ready to fight and will not show mercy.
  * **until you are destroyed** - AT: "until they destroy you" or "until they leave you with nothing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
