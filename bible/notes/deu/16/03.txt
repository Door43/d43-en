\v 3 You shall eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shall you eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for you came forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that you may remember the day when you came forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life.
\v 4 And there shall be no leaven seen with you in all your borders seven days; neither shall any of the flesh, which you sacrificest the first day at even, remain all night until the morning.
