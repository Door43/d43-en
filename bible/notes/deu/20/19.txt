<usfm>
\p
\v 19 When you will besiege a city for a long time, as you wage war against it to capture it, you must not destroy its trees by wielding an axe against them. For you may eat from them, so you must not cut them down. For is the tree of the field a man whom you should besiege?
\v 20 Only the trees that you know are not trees for food, you may destroy and cut down; you will build bulwarks against the city that makes war with you, until it falls.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **wage war**  - "fight in a war"
  * **wielding an axe against them**  - "cutting down the trees with an ax"
  * **For is the tree of the field a man whom you should besiege?**  - The author uses this question to show that trees are not the enemy, so there is no reason for the Israelites to cut down fruit trees when they put a city under siege. AT: "For fruit trees are not people, so they are not your enemy." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **trees for food**  - "trees that grow fruit to eat"
  * **you will build bulwarks against the city**  - "you will use these trees to build walls and ramps to fight against the city"
  * **until it falls** - "until the city loses the war"
