<usfm>
\p
\v 19 When you will besiege a city for a long time, as you wage war against it to capture it, you must not destroy its trees by wielding an axe against them. For you may eat from them, so you must not cut them down. For is the tree of the field a man whom you should besiege?
\v 20 Only the trees that you know are not trees for food, you may destroy and cut down; you will build bulwarks against the city that makes war with you, until it falls.
