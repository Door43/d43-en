\v 17 You must get rid of them completely. Get rid of the Heth people-group, the Amor people-group, the Canaan people-group, the Periz people-group, the Hiv people-group, and the Jebus people-group; that is what Yahweh our God commanded you to do.
\v 18 If you do not do that, they will teach you to sin against Yahweh our God and do the disgusting things that they do when they worship their gods.

\v 16 In the cities of these peoples that Yahweh your God is giving you as an inheritance, you must save alive nothing that breathes.
\v 17 Instead, you must utterly destroy them: the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, as Yahweh your God has commanded you.
\v 18 Do this so that they do not teach you to act after in any of their disgusting ways, as they have done with their gods. If you do, you will sin against Yahweh your God.
