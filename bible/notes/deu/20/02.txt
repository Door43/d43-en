===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **speak to the people** - "speak to the soldiers of Israel"
  * **Do not let your hearts faint. Do not fear or tremble. Do not be afraid of them** - These four expressions all mean the same thing and strongly emphasize that they are not to be afraid. If your language does not have four ways to express this concept, you may use less than four. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Do not let your hearts faint** - Here "hearts" represents people's courage. For a heart to faint is an idiom that mean "Do no be afraid." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Yahweh your God is the one who is going with you to fight for you against your enemies** - Yahweh defeating the enemies of the people of Israel is spoken of as if Yahweh were a warrior who would fight along with the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to save you** - "to give you victory"
