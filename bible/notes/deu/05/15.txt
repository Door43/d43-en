===== Translation Notes: =====
Moses continues reminding the people of Israel about what Yahweh said.

  * **You will call to mind** - AT: "You must remember"
  * **by a mighty hand and by a display of power** - Both of these phrases mean basically the same thing are combined for emphasis. AT: "by showing his great power" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
