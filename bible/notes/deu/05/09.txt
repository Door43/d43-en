===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues to speak to the people of Israel as if they were one man, so all instances of "you" and "your" are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]]) 

  * **You will not bow down to them or serve them** - "You will not worship the carved figures or do as they command"
  * **You will not** - "Never"
  * **I ... am a jealous God** - "I ... want you to worship only me"
  * **showing covenant faithfulness to thousands, to those who love me** - The abstract noun "faithfulness" can be stated as "faithfully" or "faithful." AT: "faithfully loving thousands, those who love me" or "being faithful to the covenant with thousands, with those who love me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **to thousands, to those who love me** - Some translations read "to a thousand generations of those who love me." The word "thousands" is a metonym for a number too many to count. AT: "forever, to those who love me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
