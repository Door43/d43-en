===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues to speak to the people of Israel if they were one man, so all instances of "you" and "your" are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]]) 

  * **You will not bow down to them or serve them** - "You will not worship the carved figures or do as they command"
  * **You will not** - "Never"
  * **I ... am a jealous God** - "I ... want you to worship only me"
  * **to thousands, to those who love me** - "to thousands of people, to those who love me." Some translations read "to a thousand generations of those who love me." The word  "thousands" does is a metonym or hyperbole for a number too many to count. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
