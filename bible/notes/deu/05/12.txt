\p
\v 12 Observe the Sabbath day to keep it holy, as Yahweh your God commanded you.
\v 13 For six days you will labor and do all your work;
\v 14 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God. In it you will not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servants nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your cattle, nor any foreigner who is within your gates. This is so that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you.
