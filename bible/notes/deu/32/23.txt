===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

Moses describes the future, that has not happened yet at the moment of his speech, but he describes it as the past.

From verse 20-29, Moses quotes Yahweh.

  * **I will heap disasters on them - **  This refers to the people of Israel. It means that Yahweh would bring one disaster after another on them.
  * **I will shoot all my arrows at them**  - Moses compares Yahweh's judgments to arrows being shot. This means that Yahweh would inflict on them many calamities. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **wasted by hunger - **  This refers to famine.
  * **burning heat **  - This refers to plague and pestilence that bring fever.
