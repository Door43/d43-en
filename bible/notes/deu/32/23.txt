===== Translation Notes: =====
Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **I will heap disasters on them** - This means that Yahweh will bring one disaster after another on the people of Israel.
  * **I will shoot all my arrows at them** - Here Yahweh compares the disasters he will send to arrows shot from a bow. This means that Yahweh will cause many of them to suffer and die. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **They will be wasted by hunger** - AT: "They will grow weak and die from hunger" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **devoured by burning heat and bitter destruction** - Possible meanings are 1) this refers to fevers and pestilence, or 2) it refers to suffering from the heat during a drought or famine. AT: "they will die from the burning heat and terrible disasters"
  * **I will send on them the teeth of wild animals, with the poison of things that crawl in the dust** - This means God will send dangerous animals and poisonous snakes to punish the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
