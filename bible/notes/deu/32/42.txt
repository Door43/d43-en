===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]])

  * **I will make my arrows drunk with blood and my sword will devour flesh with the blood**  - Yahweh compares himself punishing his enemies to a soldier killing people with his weapons. AT: "I will completely destroy my enemies as if I had arrows and a sword that pierce the flesh and drip with the blood" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] )
