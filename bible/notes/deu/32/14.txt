===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])


  * **He ate** - The word "he" refers to the people of Israel.
  * **fat of lambs, rams of Basham and goats** - This means that the people of Israel had plenty of healthy herd animals.
  * **you drank** - The word "you" refers to the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
