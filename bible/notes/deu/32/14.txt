===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. He speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the word "you" here is singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **He ate** - Moses continues to speak of the Israelites as "Jacob" ([[:en:bible:notes:deu:32:09|32:9-10]]). You may need to translate as though Moses were speaking of the Israelites as many people. "Our ancestors ate" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]])
  * **fat of lambs, rams of Bashan and goats** - The people of Israel had many healthy herd animals.
