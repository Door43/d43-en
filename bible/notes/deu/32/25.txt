===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: Parallelism)

Moses describes the future, that has not happened yet at the moment of his speech, but he describes it as the past.

From verse 20-29, Moses quotes Yahweh.

  * **Outside the sword will bereave**  - The word "sword" here represents the army of the enemy. AT: “Outside the army of the enemy will bring death” (See: Metonymy and Personification)
  * **I would make the memory of them to cease from among mankind **- AT: "I will remove the memory of them from people"
