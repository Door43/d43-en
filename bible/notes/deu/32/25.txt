===== Translation Notes: =====
Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])


  * **Outside the sword will bereave** - Here "sword" represents the army of the enemy. AT: “When the Israelites are outside, the enemy army will kill them” (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **young man and virgin, the nursing baby, and the man of gray hairs** - These terms are combined to mean that all kinds of people will die. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **I would make the memory of them to cease from among mankind**- AT: "I will remove the memory of them from all people" or "I will make all people forget about them"
