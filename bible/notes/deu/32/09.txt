===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. As he speaks to the Israelites, he talks about them as if they were someone else and as if they were one man. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **For Yahweh's portion is his people; Jacob is his apportioned inheritance** - These two phrases means basically the same thing and and can be combined. AT: "The descendants of Jacob are Yahweh's inheritance" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **He found him ... shielded him and cared for him ... guarded him** - "He found Jacob ... shielded him and cared for him ... guarded him" You may need to translate this as if Moses were talking about the Israelites as many people. AT: "He found our ancestors ... shielded them and cared for them ... guarded them"
  * **howling wilderness** - Here "howling" refers to the sound the wind makes as it blows through the empty land.
  * **he guarded him as the apple of his eye** - This is an idiom. The apple of an eye refers to the dark part inside the eyeball that allows a person to see. This is a very important and sensitive part of the body. This means that the people of Israel are very important to God and something he protects. AT: "he protected him as something very valuable and precious" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
