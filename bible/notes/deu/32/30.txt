===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **How could one chase a thousand…victory over them?**  - Moses uses a question to scold the people for not being wise enough to understand why their enemies are defeating them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight**  - AT: "1 man chase 1,000 men, and 2 men cause 10,000 to run away" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **unless their Rock had sold them**  - The word "Rock" refers to Yahweh who is strong and able to protect his people. AT: "unless Yahweh, their Rock, had allowed the enemy to defeat them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **our enemies' rock is not like our Rock**  - This means the enemies' idols and false gods are not powerful like Yahweh.
