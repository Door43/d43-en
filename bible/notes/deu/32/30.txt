===== Translation Notes: =====
Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **How could one chase a thousand...victory over them?** - Moses uses a question to show the people of Israel that if they were wise, they would know that their enemies defeat them only because God is punishing them for their sin. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand** - AT: "one man chase a thousand men, and two men put 10,000" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **unless their Rock had sold them**  - The word “Rock ” refers to Yahweh who is strong and able to protect his people. AT: "unless Yahweh, their Rock, had handed them over" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **our enemies' rock is not like our Rock** - This means the enemies' idols and false gods are not powerful like Yahweh.
