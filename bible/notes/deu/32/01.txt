===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. He uses parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **Give ear, you heavens...Let the earth listen** - Yahweh speaks to the heavens and earth as if they are there listening. Possible meanings are 1) Yahweh is speaking to the inhabitants of heaven and earth or 2) Yahweh is speaking to the heavens and earth as if they are persons. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
  * **Let my teaching drop down like the rain...and like the showers on the plants** - This means Yahweh wants the people to eagerly accept his helpful teaching. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])

  * **tender grass**  - AT: "new plants"
