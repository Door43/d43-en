===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses uses parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: Parallelism)

  * ** give ear ** - AT: “listen,” or “pay attention” (See: Metonymy)
  * **Give ear, you heavens, and let me speak. Let the earth listen...** - Although these prophecies were meant for the people of Israel to hear, Moses tells the “heavens” and “earth” to listen to his words. By doing this, he emphasizes how important his message is. (See: Apostrophe, Personification )
  * **the words of my mouth** - AT: “my teachings” (See: Idiom )
  * **Let my teaching drop down like the rain, let may speech distill like the dew, like the gentle rain on the tender grass, and like the showers on the plants. - ** This is a metaphor in which Moses compares his teachings to rain, dew, gentle rain and showers. He desires that his words may be to the people, as the rain is to the plants. (See: Metaphor)
  * **distill like the dew**  - "descend like the dew"
  * **tender grass**  - "new plants" or "herbs"
