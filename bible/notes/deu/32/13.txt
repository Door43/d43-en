Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **He made him ride on the heights of the land** -  The word "him" refers to the people of Israel. AT: "Yahweh made them ride on the high places of the land" or "Yahweh helped them take possessions of the land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **he fed them the fruits of the field** - This means that Yahweh brought them to a land with lots of produce they could eat.
  * **He nourished him with honey from the rock and oil from the flinty crag** - The land had many wild bees with hives inside rock holes. And also olive trees, which grow on rocks, hills and mountains. AT: "He provided honey for them from the rock and oil from the stony ground"
