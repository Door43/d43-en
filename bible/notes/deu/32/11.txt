===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **As an eagle that guards her nest and flutters over her young, Yahweh spread out his wings and took them, and carried them on his pinions** - This means Yahweh watched over and protected the Israelites while they were in the desert. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **pinions** - the outer edges of a bird's wings
  * **led him ... with him** - Moses again speaks of the Israelites as "Jacob" ([[:en:bible:notes:deu:32:09|32:9-10]]). You may need to translate as if Moses were speaking of the Israelites as many people. AT: "led them ... with them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]])
