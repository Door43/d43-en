===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **As an eagle that guards her nest and flutters over her young, Yahweh spread out his wings and took them, and carried them on his pinions** - This means Yahweh watched over and protected his people while they were in the desert. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **pinions** - the outer edges of a bird's wings
  * **Yahweh alone led him** - Here "him" refers to the people of Israel.
