===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **a perverted and crooked generation** - The words "perverted" and "crooked" mean basically the same thing. Moses uses them to emphasize how wicked the generation is. AT: "a completely wicked generation." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Do you reward Yahweh in this way ... people?** - Moses uses a question to scold the people. AT: "You should give Yahweh proper praise ... people." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **you foolish and senseless people** - The words "foolish" and "senseless" mean the same thing and emphasize how foolish the people are for disobeying Yahweh. AT: "you extremely foolish people." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **your father... has created you ... made you and established you** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the word "you" is singular. 
  * **Is he not your father, the one who has created you?** - Moses uses a question to scold the people. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: Yahweh is your father and the one who created you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
