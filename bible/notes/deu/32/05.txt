===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]])

  * **a perverted and crooked generation** - The words "perverted" and "crooked" mean basically the same thing. Moses uses them to emphasize how wicked the generation is. AT: "a completely wicked generation" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet|Doublet]])
  * **Do you reward Yahweh in this way...?** - Moses uses a question to scold the people. AT: "You should give Yahweh proper praise...." (See:[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]]) 
  * **you foolish and senseless people** - The words "foolish" and "senseless" mean the same thing. They emphasize that the people show that they lack wisdom because they do not obey God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Is he not your father, the one who has created you?**  - Moses uses a question to scold the people. AT: Yahweh is your father and the one who created you." (See:[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
