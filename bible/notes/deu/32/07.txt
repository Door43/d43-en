===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **Call to mind** - AT: "Remember" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **days of ancient times** - Moses refers to the time period when the ancestors of the people of Israel were alive. AT: "days of long ago"
  * **think about the years of many ages past** - This is a repetition of what Moses just said in the previous portion. Moses wants the people of Israel to focus on their history as a nation. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **and he set the boundaries of the peoples, as he also fixed the number of their gods** - God assigned each people, together with its gods, to its own territory. In this way, he limited the influence of a people group's idols.
