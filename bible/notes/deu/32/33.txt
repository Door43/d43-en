===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]])

  * **Their wine is the poison of serpents and the cruel venom of asps**  - Moses continues comparing the enemies of the people of Israel to grapevines that produce poisonous fruit. This means it will destroy the Israelites if they start to act like their enemies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **asps** - "snakes"
  * **Is not this plan secretly kept by me, sealed up among my treasures?**  - AT: "I know what I have planned to do to the Israelite people and to their enemies, and I have locked up those plans as someone would lock up his valuable possessions" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **Is not this plan secretly kept by me**  - AT: "Have I not kept this plan secret" or "I have kept this plan secret" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
