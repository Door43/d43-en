===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. He continues to quote Yahweh's words. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **Their wine is the poison of serpents and the cruel venom of asps** - Moses continues comparing the enemies of the people of Israel to grapevines that produce poisonous fruit and wine. This means their enemies are wicked. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **asps** - "snakes"
  * **Is not this plan secretly kept by me, sealed up among my treasures?** - This question emphasizes that Yahweh's plans for the people of Israel are kept secret like a valuable treasure. The rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. It can also be stated in active form. AT: "I know what I have planned to do to the Israelite people and to their enemies, and I have locked up those plans as someone would lock up his valuable possessions" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
