\v 50 You will die on that mountain \f + \ft euphemism, doublet \f*, like your \add older\add* brother Aaron died on Hor Mountain.
\v 51 You will die because both of you disobeyed me in the presence of the Israelite people, when you all were at Meribah Springs near Kadesh \add town\add* in the Zin Desert. You did not honor and respect me in the presence of the Israelite people in the way that I deserve because I am God.
\v 52 \add When you are on that mountain where I told you to go\add*, you will see in the distance in front of you the land that I am about to give to the Israelite people, but you will not enter it."

\v 50 You will die on that mountain, like your older brother Aaron died on Mount Hor.
\v 51 You will die because both of you disobeyed me in the presence of the Israelite people, when you all were at the springs of Meribah near Kadesh in the Wilderness of Sin. You did not honor and respect me in the presence of the Israelite people in the way that I deserve because I am God.

<usfm>
\v 50 You will die on the mountain that you go up and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your fellow Israelite died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people.
\v 51 This will happen because you were unfaithful to me among the people of Israel at the waters of Meribah in Kadesh, in the wilderness of Sin; because you did not treat me with honor and respect among the people of Israel.
\v 52 For you will see the land before you, but you will not go there, into the land that I am giving to the people of Israel."

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh finishes speaking to Moses.

  * **be gathered to your people**  - This means Moses' soul would go to the same place as his relatives who died before him. AT: "join your ancestors who died before you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]] )
  * **Mount Hor**  - This is the name of a mountain of the border of Edom. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Meribah**  - This is the name of place in the desert where Moses disobeyed God. God told Moses to speak to a rock to make water miraculously come out of it. Instead Moses hit the rock because he was angry with the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Wilderness of Sin**  - This is the name of a wilderness on southern border of Judah. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
