===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

Moses describes the future, that has not happened yet at the moment of his speech, but he describes it as the past.

From verse 37-42, Moses quotes Yahweh.

  * **See now that I, even I, am God - **"See now that I, I am" This description shows that God can only be defined by himself, not by anything else that we know of, and he cannot be compared to anyone else. (See: The Name of God) The term "See now" is calling the people of Israel to pay attention, to open their spiritual eyes.
  * **save you from my might**  - "rescue you from my power"
  * **I lift up my hand to heaven and say - **  AT: "I lift up my hand to heaven and swear" or "I have taken an oath" Lifting up the hand shows that he will truly do what he has sworn. See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:gen:14:21|Genesis 14:22]].
  * **as I live forever**  - God said this to show that what he was about to say was true. This can be translated as “as true as it is that I live forever, it is true that” This was a common formula for taking an oath. A person would usually say "as long as I live" or "as I live." As God could swear by none greater, he swore by himself.
