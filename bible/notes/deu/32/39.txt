===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **I, even I** - Yahweh repeats "I" to emphasize that only he is God. AT: "I, I myself" or "I, I alone"
  * **I lift up my hand to heaven and say** - Lifting up the hand is a sign of making an oath. AT: "I lift up my hand to heaven and swear" or "I have taken an oath"
  * **As I live forever** - This statement assures the people that what God says in 32:41-42 will happen. AT: "As certainly as I live forever" or "I swear by my life which is never-ending"
