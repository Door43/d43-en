Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]])

  * **They sacrificed**  - "The people of Israel sacrificed"
  * **gods that recently appeared**  - This means the Israelites recently learned about these gods.

  * **who became your father...God who gave you birth**  - This compares Yahweh to a father and a mother. This means God caused them to live and to be a nation. AT: "who fathered you...God who gave you life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
