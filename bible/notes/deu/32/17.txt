  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **They sacrificed** - "The people of Israel sacrificed"
  * **gods that recently appeared** - This means the Israelites recently learned about these gods.
  * **You have deserted the Rock** - Here Yahweh is called the rock because he is strong and protective. AT: "You have left the protective care of Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **who became your father ... the God who gave you birth** - This compares Yahweh to a father and a mother. This means God caused them to live and to be a nation. AT: "who fathered you, God who gave life to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
