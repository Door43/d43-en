===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: Parallelism)

Moses describes the future, that has not happened yet at the moment of his speech, but he describes it as the past.

From verse 37-42, Moses quotes Yahweh.

  * **When I sharpen my glittering sword - ** AT: "When I sharpen my shining sword" A glittering or shining sword is ready for use, after being cleaned and polished, whetted and made sharp to penetrate more easily. It shines against the light. The meaning is "When I am ready to execute judgement." (See: Metaphor)
  * **when my hand begins to bring justice **- AT: "when I begin to carry out justice" The word "hand" is used in reference to God's power and action. (See: Metonymy)
  * **I will render vengeance on my enemies**  - AT: "I will take vegeance on my enemies" or "I will punish my enemies"
  * **And I will pay back those who hate me**  - A repetition of idea from the previous sencente. (See: Doublet)
