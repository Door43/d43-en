  * **Vengeance is mine to give, and recompense** - The words "vengeance" and "recompense" mean basically the same thing. AT: "I will have vengeance and punish Israel's enemies." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **recompense** - to punish or reward a person for what he has done
  * **their foot slips** - "they are helpless" because something bad has happened to them (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **the day of disaster for them** - "the time for me to destroy them"
  * **and the things that are to come on them will hurry to happen** - Yahweh speaks of the bad things that will happen to his enemies as if they were people running eagerly to punish them. AT: "and I will punish them quickly" (UDB)  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
