Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **Vengeance is mine to give, and recompense** - The words "vengeance" and "recompense" mean basically the same thing. AT: "I will have vengeance and punish Israel's enemies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **at the time when their foot slips** - This means God will eventually destroy their enemy. AT: "when the time is right for them to fall" or "when the time comes for me to destroy them"
