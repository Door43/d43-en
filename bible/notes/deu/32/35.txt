===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

Moses describes the future, that has not happened yet at the moment of his speech, but he describes it as the past.

From verse 34-35, Moses quotes Yahweh.

  * **Vengeance is mine to give, and recompense - **  AT: "To me belong vengeance and recompense. " This means that Yahweh would certainly avenge them.
  * **at the time when their foot slips - ** This means that the enemy would eventually fail. The image of the foot slipping represents their fall. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **and the things that are to come on them will hurry to happen. **- AT: "and their doom is coming quickly."
