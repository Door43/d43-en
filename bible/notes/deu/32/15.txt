===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues speaking his poetic song to the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **Jeshurun** - Moses speaks of the Israelites as if they were a well-fed animal whose owner named it Jeshurun. You may add a footnote that says, "The name 'Jeshurun' means 'upright one.'" If your language cannot speak of the Israelites as Jeshurun, you may refer to the Israelites as many people, as the UDB does. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **grew fat and kicked** - Jeshurun, the well-fed animal who kicks instead of becoming gentle is a metaphor for the Israelites, who rebelled even though God took care of them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you grew fat, you were too fat, and you had eaten your fill** - Moses scolds the Israelites by speaking in the song to Jeshurun. "you became fat, you became fatter, and you became as fat as you could become"
  * **the Rock of his salvation** - This means Yahweh is strong like a rock and able to protect his people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the Rock** - This a proper name that Moses gives to Yahweh, who, like a rock, is strong and able to protect his people. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:32:03|32:4]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **They made Yahweh jealous** - The Israelites made Yahweh jealous.
