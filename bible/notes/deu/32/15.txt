===== Translation Notes: =====
Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **Jeshuran** - This also refers to the people of Israel. Translators may add a footnote that says: "The name 'Jeshuran' means 'righteous one.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **grew fat and kicked** - Moses compares the people of Israel to a well-fed animal that does not become gentle but instead kicks. This means the people rebelled even though God took care of them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **filled with fat, stout and sleek** -  "heavy, plump, and stuffed." All of these mean that the people grew healthy and prospered.
  * **Rock of his salvation** - This means Yahweh is strong and able to protect his people. (See:[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
