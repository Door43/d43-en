===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **For a fire is kindled by my anger...foundations of the mountains** - Yahweh compares his anger to a fire. This emphasizes his power to destroy what makes him angry. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a fire is kindled by my anger** - AT: "my anger starts a fire" or "my anger is like a fire" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
