===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: Parallelism)

Moses describes the future, that has not happened yet at the moment of his speech, but he describes it as the past.

From verse 20-29, Moses quotes Yahweh.

  * **They have made me jealous**  - This refers to the people of Israel
  * **I will move them envious by those who are not a people **- AT: "I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation." Moses is refering to a people without God, without a covenant with God, meaning the gentiles.
