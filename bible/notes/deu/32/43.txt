===== Translation Notes: =====
This is the end of Moses' song. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **Rejoice, you nations**  - Moses addresses the peoples of all the nations as if they were there listening. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
  * **for he will avenge the blood of his servants and he will render vengeance on his enemies**  - AT: "for he will take revenge on those who killed his servants" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
