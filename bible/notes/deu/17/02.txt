\v 2 If there is found among you, within any of your city gates that Yahweh your God is giving you, any man or woman  who does what is evil in the sight of Yahweh your God and transgresses his covenant—
\v 3 anyone who has gone and worshiped other gods and bowed down to them, either the sun, the moon, or any of the host of heaven—nothing that I have commanded,
\v 4 and if you are told about this, or if you have heard of it—then you must inquire diligently and look to see if it is true and certain that such a disgusting thing has been done in Israel.
