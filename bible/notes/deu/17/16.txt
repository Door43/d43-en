===== translationNotes: =====

  * **for Yahweh had said to you, 'You must from now on never return that way again'** - This has a quotation within a quotation. A direct quotation can be stated as an indirect quotation. AT: "for Yahweh has said that you must never return to Egypt again" (See:[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotesinquotes]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **so that his heart does not turn away from Yahweh** - Here "heart" refers to the whole person. Kings often married women from other nations who worshiped different gods. An Israelite king that starts to worship the false gods of his wives is spoken of as if his heart turned away from Yahweh. AT: "so that they do not cause him to turn from Yahweh and start worshiping false gods" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]))
