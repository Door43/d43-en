===== translationNotes: =====

  * **for Yahweh had said to you, 'You will never return that way again.'** - This has a quotation within a quotation. A direct quotation can be stated as an indirect quotation. AT: "for Yahweh had said that you must never return to Egypt again." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotesinquotes]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **so that his heart does not turn away** - Here "heart" refers to the whole person.
