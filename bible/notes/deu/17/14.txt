\v 14 "\add I know that\add* after you have occupied the land that Yahweh our God is giving to you, and you are living there, you will say, 'We should have a king to rule over us, like the kings that other nations around us have.'
\v 15 Yahweh our God will permit you to have a king, but be sure that you appoint someone whom he has chosen. That man must be an Israelite; you must not appoint someone who is a foreigner to be your king.

\v 14 When you have come to the land that Yahweh your God gives you, and when you take possession of it and begin to live in it, and then you say, 'I will set a king over myself, like all the nations that are round about me,'
\v 15 then you must surely set as king over yourself someone whom Yahweh your God will choose. You must set as king over yourself someone from among your brothers. You may not put a foreigner, who is not your brother, over yourself.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **When you have come to the land** - The word "come to" can be translated as "gone to" or "entered." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_go]])
  * **then you say, 'I will set a king over myself, like all the nations that are round about me,'** - This has a quotation within a quotation. A direct quotation can be stated as an indirect quotation. AT: "then you decide that you want a king just like the peoples of the nations that surround you have kings," (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotesinquotes]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **I will set a king over myself ... round about me** - Moses has the people speaking as if they were one person. It may be more natural to translate this with plural pronouns. AT: "We will set over ourselves ... round about us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]])
  * **set a king over myself** - Giving someone the authority to rule as king in Israel is spoken of as if the people were setting the person in a place above them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **all the nations that are round about me** - "all the surrounding nations"
  * **all the nations** - Here "nations" represent the people who live in the nations. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **someone from among your brothers** - "one of your fellow Israelites"
  * **a foreigner, who is not your brother, over yourself** - Both of these phrases mean the same thing. They both refer to a person who is not an Israelite. Yahweh is emphasizing that the people of Israel should not let a foreigner rule over them. AT: "a foreigner over yourself" or "a non-Israelite over yourself" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
