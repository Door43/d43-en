\v 8 "Sometimes it will be very difficult for the judges to decide what really happened. He might be trying to decide whether, when someone injured or killed another person, he did it accidentally or deliberately. Or he might be trying to decide if some person is sueing another person unfairly. If in some town it is very difficult to know what really happened, with the result that the judge cannot decide it, you should go to the place that Yahweh our God has chosen for you \add to worship him\add*.
\v 9 There you should present the case to the descendants of Levi who are the priests, and to the judge who is serving at that time, and they should decide what should be done.

\v 8 If a matter too hard for you to judge arises—a question of murder or accidental death, of one person’s right and another person’s right, or a question of one kind of harm done or another kind—matters of controversy within your city gates, then you must arrive go up to the place that Yahweh your God will choose as his sanctuary.
\v 9 You must go to the priests and the Levites, and to the judge who will be serving at that time; you will inquire, and they will tell you the verdict of judgment.
