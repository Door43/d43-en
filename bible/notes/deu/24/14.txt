\v 14 You must not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy, whether he is of your fellow Israelites, or of the  foreigners who are in your land within your city gates;
\v 15 Each day you must give him his wage; the sun must not go down on this unsettled matter, for he is poor and is counting on it. Do this so that he does not cry out against you to Yahweh, and so that it not be a sin that you have committed.
