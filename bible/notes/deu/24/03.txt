\v 3 and that man \add later also\add* decides that he does not like her, and he writes a paper in which he says that he is divorcing her, and he sends her away from his house. Or, suppose that the second husband dies.
\v 4 If either of those things happen, her first husband must not marry her again. He must consider that she has become unacceptable to Yahweh. Yahweh would consider it to be disgusting \add if he married her again\add*. You must not sin \f + \ft metonymy \f* by doing that in the land that Yahweh our God is giving to you.

<usfm>
\v 3  If the second husband hates her and writes her a certificate of divorce, puts it into her hand, and sends her out of his house; or if the second husband dies, the man who took her to be his wifeâ€”
\v 4 then her former husband, the one who had first sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after she has become impure; for that would be something disgusting to Yahweh. You must not cause the land to become guilty, the land that Yahweh your God is giving you as an inheritance.
