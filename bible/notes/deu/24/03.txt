<usfm>
\v 3  If the second husband hates her and writes her a certificate of divorce, puts it into her hand, and sends her out of his house; or if the second husband dies, the man who took her to be his wife—
\v 4 then her former husband, the one who had first sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after she has become impure; for that would be something disgusting to Yahweh. You must not cause the land to become guilty, the land that Yahweh your God is giving you as an inheritance.
