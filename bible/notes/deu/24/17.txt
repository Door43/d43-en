\v 17 You must not use force to take away the justice that is due the foreigner or the fatherless, nor take the widow's cloak as a pledge.
\v 18 Instead, you must call to mind that you were a slave in Egypt, and that Yahweh your God rescued you from there. Therefore I instruct you to obey this command.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses is still speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **You must not use force to take away the justice that is due the foreigner or the fatherless** - Moses speaks of justice as if it were a physical object that a stronger person can violently pull away from a weaker person. AT: "You must not treat a foreigner or the fatherless unfairly." This may be translated positively. Your language might have one word that means "use force to take away." AT: "You must make sure that you treat foreigners and orphans justly"
  * **fatherless** - This refers to children whose parents have both died and do not have relatives to care for them.
  * **nor take the widow's cloak as a pledge** - A lender would take something from the borrower to ensure that she would paid him back. He was not allowed to take her coat because she needed it to stay warm. The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **call to mind** - This is an idiom. AT: "remember" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
