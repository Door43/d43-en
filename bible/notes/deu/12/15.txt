===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 However, you will be permitted to kill and eat the meat of your animals in the places where you live. As often as you want to, you may eat meat from the animals that Yahweh our God will bless you by giving them to you. Those who have done things that cause them to become unacceptable to God and those who have not done things like that may all eat that meat, just like you would eat the meat of a deer or an antelope.
\v 16 But you must not eat the blood \add of any animals\add*; you must let the blood drain onto the ground \add before you cook the meat\add*.

\v 15 However, God will permit you to kill and eat the meat of your animals in the places where you live. As often as you want to, you may eat meat from the animals that Yahweh our God will bless you by giving them to you. Those who are at that time clean or unclean may all eat that meat, just like you would eat the meat of a deer or an antelope.
\v 16 But you must not eat the blood of any animal; you must let the blood drain onto the ground before you cook the meat.
