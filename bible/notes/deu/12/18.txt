\v 18 Instead, you will eat them before Yahweh your God in the place that Yahweh your God will choose—you, your son, your daughter, your male servant, your female servant, and the Levite who is within your gates;  you will rejoice before Yahweh your God about everything to which you put your hand.
\v 19 Pay attention to yourself so that you do not forsake the Levite as long as you live on your land.
