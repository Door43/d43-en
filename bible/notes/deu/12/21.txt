<usfm>
\v 21 If the place that Yahweh your God chooses to put his name is too far from you, then you will kill some of your herd and your flock that Yahweh has given you, as I have commanded you; you may eat within your gates, as your soul desires.
\v 22 Like the gazelle and the deer are eaten, so you will eat of it; the unclean and the clean persons may eat of it alike.
