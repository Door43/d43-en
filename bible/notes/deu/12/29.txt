\v 29 When Yahweh your God cuts off the nations from before you, when you go in to dispossess them, and you dispossess them, and live in their land,
\v 30 pay attention to yourself that you are not trapped into following them, after they are destroyed from before you—trapped into investigating their gods, into asking, 'How do these nations worship their gods? I will do the same.'

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **cuts off the nations before you** - Here "nations" refers to the people already living in Canaan. AT: "destroys the nations before you"
  * **when you go in to dispossess them, and you dispossess them**  - AT: "when you take everything from them"
  * **pay attention to yourself**  - AT: "be careful"
  * **that you are not trapped into following them...trapped into investigating their gods, into asking** - This means that acting like the other people groups and worshiping their gods would result in the Israelites dying just like an animal dies after a hunter captures it in his trap. AT: "that no one causes you to act like the nations...causes you to ask about their gods, saying" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **after they are destroyed from before you** - AT: "after Yahweh destroys them from before you"
