\v 16 So it happened, when all the men fit for fighting were dead and gone from among the people,
\v 17 that Yahweh spoke to me, saying,
\v 18 â€œYou are today to pass over Ar, the border of Moab;
\v 19 When you come near opposite the people of Ammon, do not trouble them nor fight them; for I will not give you any of the land of the people of Ammon as a possession; because I have given it to the descendants of Lot as a possession."
