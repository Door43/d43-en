\v 30 But Sihon, king of Heshbon, would not let us pass by him; for Yahweh your God had hardened his mind and made his heart obstinate, that he might defeat him by your might, which he has now done today.
\v 31 Yahweh said to me, "Look, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before you; begin to possess it, in order that you may inherit his land."
