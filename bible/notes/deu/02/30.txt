\v 30 But Sihon, king of Heshbon, would not let us pass by him; for Yahweh your God had hardened his mind and made his heart obstinate, that he might defeat him by your might, which he has now done today.
\v 31 Yahweh said to me, "Look, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before you; begin to possess it, in order that you may inherit his land."

===== Translation Notes: =====
Moses continues to remind the people of what happened in the past.

    * **hardened his mind and made his heart obstinate** - Both of these phrases mean the same thing and are combined to emphasize that the God caused the king to be very stubborn. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **to deliver up Sihon and his land before you** - AT: "to give Sihon and his land over to you"
