\v 28 You will sell me food for money, so that I may eat; give me water for money, so that I may drink; only let me pass through on my feet;
\v 29 as the descendants of Esau who live in Seir, and as the Moabites who live in Ar, did for me; until I pass over the Jordan into the land that Yahweh our God is giving us."

===== Translation Notes: =====
This continues Moses' message to King Sihon.

    * **I may eat...I may drink** - Moses is buying food and water so all the people of Israel can eat and drink. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **only let me pass through on my feet** - AT: "only let us walk through your land"
    * **who live in Ar** - See how you translated "Ar" in [[en:bible:notes:deu:02:09|2:9]].
