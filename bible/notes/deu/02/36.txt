<usfm>
\v 36 Yahweh our God enabled us to capture all their towns from Aroer in the south, which is at the edge of the Arnon River Valley, to the region of Gilead in the north. Some of their cities had walls around them, but we were still able to capture them.
\v 37 But we did not go near the area where the Ammon people group live, or the banks of the Jabbok River, or the towns of the hill country, or any other place where Yahweh our God told us not to go."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 36 From Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, and from the city that is in the valley, all the way to Gilead, there was not a city too high for us. Yahweh our God gave them into our hands.
\v 37 It was only to the land of the descendants of Ammon that you did not go, as well as all the side of the Jabbok River, and the cities of the hill countryâ€”wherever Yahweh our God had forbidden us to go.

  * **Valley of the Arnon** - "Arnon" is the name of a river. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:02:24|2:24]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **there was not a city too high for us** - This negative statement is used to emphasize their success in battle. This can be stated in a positive form. AT: "we were able to defeat the people of every city even if the city had high walls around it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **you did not go** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so "you" is singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
