\v 13 ‘Now rise up and go over the brook Zered.’ So we went over the brook Zered. 
\v 14 Now the days from when we came from Kadesh-Barnea until we crossed the brook Zered, were thirty-eight years. It was by that time that all that generation of the men fit for fighting were gone from the people, as Yahweh had sworn to them.
\v 15 Moreover, the hand of Yahweh was against that generation in order to destroy them from the people until they were gone.
