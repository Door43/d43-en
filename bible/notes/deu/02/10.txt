===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **The Emim lived...call them the Emim** - Here 2:10-11 gives background information about the Emim people who had lived in the land before the Moabites. Your language may have a special way to mark background information. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **Emim...Rephaim** - These are the names of people groups that were considered giants. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Anakim** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:deu:01:26|1:28]].
