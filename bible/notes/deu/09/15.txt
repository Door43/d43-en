\v 15 So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire;  the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands.
\v 16 I looked, and, see, you had sinned against Yahweh your God; you had made yourselves a molten calf; you had turned aside quickly out of the way that Yahweh had commanded you.
