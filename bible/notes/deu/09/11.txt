\v 11 At the end of those forty days and nights, Yahweh gave me those two stone tablets on which he had written those commandments.
\v 12 But then he said to me, 'Go down the mountain immediately, because the people whom you \add are leading\add*, the people whom you led out of Egypt, have committed a terrible sin! They have very quickly done what I commanded them not to do. They have made for themselves a metal statue \add of a calf to worship\add*.'

\v 11 It happened at the end of those forty days and forty nights that Yahweh gave me the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant.
\v 12 Yahweh said to me, 'Arise, go down quickly from here, for your people that you brought out of Egypt have corrupted themselves. They have quickly turned aside out of the path that I commanded them. They have made for themselves a cast figure.'
