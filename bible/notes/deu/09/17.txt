<usfm>
\v 17 I took the two tablets and threw them out of my hands. I broke them before your eyes.
\v 18 Again I lay facedown before Yahweh for forty days and forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all your sin that you had committed, in doing that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, so as to provoke him to anger.
