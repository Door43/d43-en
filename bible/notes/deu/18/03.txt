\v 3 This will be the priests' due from the people, from those who offer a sacrifice, whether it be oxen or sheep: They must give to the priest the shoulder, the two cheeks, and the inner parts.
\v 4 The firstfruits of your grain, of your new wine, and of your oil, and the first of the fleece of your sheep, you must give him.
\v 5 For Yahweh your God has chosen him out of all your tribes to stand to serve in the name of Yahweh, him and his sons forever.
