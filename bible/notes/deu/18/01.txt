===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses continues telling the people what Yahweh wants them to do.

  * **no portion** - "no part" or "no share"
  * **Yahweh is their inheritance** - The Levites did not get land as their share of the inheritance. Their share of the inheritance was the honor of serving Yahweh as his priests. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:10:08|10:9]].
  * **among their brothers** - AT: "among the other tribes" or "among the other Israelites"
