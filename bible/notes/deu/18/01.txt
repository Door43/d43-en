===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues telling the people what Yahweh wants them to do.

  * **will have no portion nor inheritance with Israel** - The Levites not receiving any land from Yahweh is spoken of as if they would not receive an inheritance. AT: "will not possess any of the people's land" or "will not receive any of the land that the Israelites will possess" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **no portion** - "no part" or "no share"
  * **among their brothers** - "among the other tribes of Israel" or "among the other Israelites"
  * **Yahweh is their inheritance** - Moses speaks about the special relationship that the Levites would have with Yahweh as if they would inherit Yahweh. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:10:08|10:9]]. AT: "instead, they will have Yahweh" or "instead, Yahweh will allow them to serve him and he will provide for them through that service" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
