\v 15 You might forget him who led you through the great and terrible wilderness, in which were fiery serpents and scorpions, and through thirsty ground where there was no water; Yahweh, who brought water out of the rock of flint for you;
\v 16 Yahweh, who fed you in the wilderness with manna that your ancestors had not known, so that he might humble you, and that he might test you, to do you good in the end;
\v 17 otherwise, you might say in your heart, 'My power and the might of my hand acquired all this wealth.'
