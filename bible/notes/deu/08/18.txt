\p
\v 19 I solemnly warn you, that if you forget Yahweh our God and turn to other gods and start to serve them and worship them, you will certainly be destroyed.
\v 20 If you do not obey Yahweh our God, he will certainly destroy you just like he will destroy the people-groups that you will fight against."

<usfm>
\v 18 But you will call to mind Yahweh your God, for it is he who gives you the power to get wealth; that he may establish his covenant that he swore to your fathers, as it is today.
\v 19 It will happen that, if you will forget Yahweh your God and walk after other gods, worship them, and reverence them, I testify against you today that you will surely perish.
\v 20 Like the nations that Yahweh is making to perish before you, so will you perish, because you would not listen to the voice of Yahweh your God.
