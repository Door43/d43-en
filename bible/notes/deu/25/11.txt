\v 11 If men fight with each other, and the wife of one comes to rescue her husband out of the hand of him who struck him, and if she stretches out her hand and takes him by the private parts,
\v 12 then you must cut off her hand; your eye must have no pity.

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **out of the hand of him who struck him** - Here "hand" refers to power or control. "AT: "from the man who hit him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **your eye must have no pity** - Here "eye" means the whole person. AT: "you should not feel sorry for her" or "you must not show her mercy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
