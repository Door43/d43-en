\v 5 If brothers live together and one of them die, not having any son, then the wife of the dead man must not be married off to someone else outside the family. Instead, her husband's brother must sleep with her and take her to himself as a wife, and do the duty of a husband's brother to her.
\v 6 This is so that the firstborn that she bears will succeed in the name of that man's dead brother, so that his name will not perish from Israel.
