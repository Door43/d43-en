\v 5 If two brothers live on the same property, and one of them who has no son dies, the man's widow should not marry someone who is not a member of his family. The dead man's brother must marry her and have sex \f + \ft euphemism \f* with her. It is his duty to do that.
\v 6 If she later gives birth to a son, that son is to be considered \f + \ft metonymy \f* the son of the man who died, in order that the dead man's name will not disappear from Israel.

\v 5 If brothers live together and one of them die, not having any son, then the wife of the dead man must not be married off to someone else outside the family. Instead, her husband’s brother must go into her and take her to himself as a wife, and do the duty of a husband’s brother to her.
\v 6 This is so that the firstborn that she bears will succeed in the name of that man’s dead brother, so that his name will not perish from Israel.
