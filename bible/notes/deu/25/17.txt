\v 17 Continue to remember what the Amalek people-group did to your ancestors when they were coming out of Egypt.
\v 18 They attacked your ancestors as they were traveling, when they were weak and exhausted. Those people were not afraid of God at all, so they attacked your ancestors from the rear and killed all those who were unable to walk as fast as the others.
\v 19 Therefore, when Yahweh our God has given you the land \add that he promised to give you\add*, and when he has enabled you to rest from \add fighting\add* all your enemies around you, kill all the Amalek people-group, with the result that no one will remember them anymore. Do not forget \add to do this\add*!"

\v 17 Remember what Amalek did to you by the way as you came forth out of Egypt;
\v 18 how he met you by the way, and struck the hindmost of you, all that were feeble behind you, when you was faint and weary; and he feared not God.
\v 19 Therefore it shall be, when Jehovah your God has given you rest from all your enemies round about, in the land which Jehovah your God gives you for an inheritance to possess it, that you shall blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; you shall not forget.
