===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues speaking to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh.

  * **Yahweh gives rest to your brothers** - The writer speaks as if the ability to rest were a physical object that could be given as a gift. The word "rest" is also a metaphor for peaceful life in which there is no war. AT: "Yahweh allows your brothers to rest" or "Yahweh allows your brothers to stop fighting wars and live peacefully" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **beyond the Jordan** - This refers to the land across the Jordan River, to the east of Israel. Moses was east of the Jordan when he said this. See how you translated these words in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:01:01|1:1]]. AT: "east of the Jordan River"
  * **then will you return** - Moses is emphasizing that the other tribes must possess their land before Yahweh will permit these three tribes to possess their land. "only then are you to return."
