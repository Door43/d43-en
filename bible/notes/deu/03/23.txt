\v 23 I implored Yahweh at that time, saying,
\v 24 "O Lord Yahweh, you have begun to show your servant your greatness and your strong hand; for what god is there in heaven or in earth that can do the same works as you have done, and the same mighty acts?
\v 25 Let me go over, I beg you, and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that good hill country, and also Lebanon."
