\v 23 I implored Yahweh at that time, saying,
\v 24 "O Lord Yahweh, you have begun to show your servant your greatness and your strong hand; for what god is there in heaven or in earth that can do the same works as you have done, and the same mighty acts?
\v 25 Let me go over, I beg you, and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that good hill country, and also Lebanon."

===== Translation Notes: =====
Moses continues reminding the people about what happened in the past.
  * **I implored** - This means Moses asked God in a very earnest and emotional way.
  * **to show your servant** - Moses refers to himself as "your servant." This is a polite way of speaking to someone with greater authority. AT: "to show me, your servant"
  * **your strong hand** - AT: "your power" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **for what god is there** - Moses uses a question to emphasize that only Yahweh is the only God who can do the power works he has done. AT: "There is no god" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **in heaven or in earth** - AT: "anywhere" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
