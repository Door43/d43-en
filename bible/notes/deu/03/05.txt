\v 5 These were all cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; this was besides very many unwalled villages.
\v 6 We completely destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, completely destroying every city—men and the women and the little ones.
\v 7 But all the cattle and the spoil of the cities, we took as spoils for ourselves.
