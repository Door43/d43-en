\v 4 This is the law for the one who kills another and who flees there to live: whoever kills his neighbor unawares, and did not previously hate him—
\v 5 as when a man goes into the forest with his neighbor to cut wood, and his hand deals a stroke with the ax to cut down a tree, and the head slips from the haft and strikes his neighbor so that he dies—then that man must flee to one of these cities and live.
