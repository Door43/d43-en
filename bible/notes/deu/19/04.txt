\v 4 This is the law for the one who kills another and who flees there to live: whoever kills his neighbor unawares, and did not previously hate him—
\v 5 as when a man goes into the forest with his neighbor to cut wood, and his hand strikes with the ax to cut down a tree, and the head slips from the shaft and strikes his neighbor so that he dies—then that man must flee to one of these cities and live.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **This is the law** - "These are the instructions" or "These are the directions"
  * **for the one who kills another** - The word "person" is understood. AT: "for a person who kills another person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **who flees there** - "and who escapes to one of these cities" or "who runs to one of these cities"
  * **to live** - "to save his own life." The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. AT: "so the family of the man who died does not kill him to get revenge" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) 
  * **whoever kills his neighbor unawares** - Here "neighbor" means any person in general. AT: "any person who kills another person by accident"
  * **and did not previously hate him** - "but did not hate his neighbor before he killed him." This implies there was no cause for him to kill his neighbor purposely. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) 
  * **as when a man goes into the forest ... to cut wood** - The author gives a hypothetical situation where a person accidentally kills another person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **the head slips from the shaft** - The iron part of the ax comes off the handle.
  * **strikes his neighbor so that he dies** - This means the head of the ax hits and kills the neighbor.
  * **to one of these cities and live** - "to one of these cities to save his own life." It is implied that the family of the dead man may try to get revenge. The man who killed him can flee to one of these cities, and the people there would protect him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
