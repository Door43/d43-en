===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses is still speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **You must not remove your neighbor’s landmark**  - This implies that a person would take the markers away from the borders of his neighbor's land so he can say that he own some of that land. AT: "You must not take land away from your neighbor by moving the markers on the borders of his land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])  
  * **that they set in place a long time ago, in your inheritance**  - AT: "that your ancestors set up on the borders when they first got possession of the land"
  * **in your inheritance**  - AT: "in the inheritance of land"
