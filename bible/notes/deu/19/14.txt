===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses is still speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **You must not remove your neighbor's landmark**  - This implies that a person would take the markers away from the borders of his neighbor's land so he can say that he own some of that land. AT: "You must not take land away from your neighbor by moving the markers on the borders of his land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **they set in place** - "that your ancestors placed"
  * **a long time ago** - Moses means that when the people have lived in the land for a long time, they should not move the borders that their ancestor made when they first took the land.
  * **in your inheritance that you will inherit, in the land that Yahweh your God is giving you to possess**  - AT: "in the land that Yahweh your God gave you as an inheritance"
