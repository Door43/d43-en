\v 8 If Yahweh your God enlarges your borders, as he has sworn to your ancestors to do, and gives you all the land that he promised to give to your ancestors;
\v 9 if you keep all these commandments to do them, which I am commanding you today—commandments to love Yahweh your God and to always walk in his ways, then you must add three more cities for yourself, besides these three.
\v 10 Do this so that innocent blood is not shed in the midst of the land that Yahweh your God is giving you for as an inheritance, so that no bloodguilt may be on you.

Moses is still speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **enlarges your borders**  - AT: "gives you more land to possess" 
  * **as he has sworn to your ancestors to do**  - "like he promised your ancestors that he would do"
  * **if you keep all these commandments to do them**  - "if you keep all of these commandments by obeying them"
   * **walk in his ways**  - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:deu:08:04|8:6]].  
  * **then you must add three more cities for yourself** - AT: "then you must choose 3 more cities for a person to escape to if he accidentally kills someone" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **besides these three**  - AT: "in addition to the 3 cities you already established" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **Do this so that innocent blood is not shed**  - AT: "Do this so that family members do not kill an innocent person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])  
  * **in the midst of the land**  - "in the land" or "in the territory"
  * **so that no bloodguilt may be on you**  - This means that if a family member kills an innocent person, the whole nation will be guilty for letting that happen.
