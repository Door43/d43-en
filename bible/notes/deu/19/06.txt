\v 6 Because he accidentally killed someone, and because the man was not his enemy, he can try to run to one of those cities. If there were only one city, it may be a long distance to that city. Then if the relative of the man who was killed \f + \ft metonymy \f*, the man who is supposed\f + \ft Or: expected \f* to get revenge, is very angry, he may be able to catch the other person before he arrives at that city.
\v 7 \add To prevent that from happening\add*, you must choose three cities, not only one, \add in order that someone can get to one of those cities quickly\add*.

\v 6 Otherwise the avenger of blood might go after the one who took a life, and in the heat of his anger overtake him, if the distance is too great, strike him and kill him, even though that man did not deserve to die, since he had not hated his neighbor in the past.
\v 7 Therefore I command you to select three cities for yourself.
