<usfm>
\v 6 Because he accidentally killed someone, and because the man was not his enemy, he can try to run to one of those cities. If there were only one city, it may be a long distance to that city. Then if the relative of the man who was killed \f + \ft metonymy \f*, the man who is supposed\f + \ft Or: expected \f* to get revenge, is very angry, he may be able to catch the other person before he arrives at that city.
\v 7 \add To prevent that from happening\add*, you must choose three cities, not only one, \add in order that someone can get to one of those cities quickly\add*.

<usfm>
\v 6 Otherwise the blood avenger might go after the one who took a life, and in hot anger he overtakes him, and because it was a long journey. And he strikes him and kills him, though that man did not deserve to die; and so he does not deserve the death penalty since he did not hate his neighbor before this happened.
\v 7 Therefore I command you to select three cities for yourself.
