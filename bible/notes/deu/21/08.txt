===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues to tell the elders what they should say when they wash their hands over the heifer. He speaks to them as if he were speaking to one man, so the words "you" and "your" are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **and do not put guilt for innocent bloodshed in the midst of your people Israel** - "and do not treat your people Israel as if they are guilty of killing an innocent person"
  * **Then the bloodshed will be forgiven them** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Then Yahweh will forgive his people Israel for the death of an innocent person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **you will put away the innocent blood from your midst** - "you will not be guilty any more of killing an innocent person"
  * **what is right in the eyes of Yahweh** - The words "in the eyes of Yahweh" are a metonym for "what Yahweh thinks is right." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
