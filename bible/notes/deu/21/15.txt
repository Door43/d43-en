===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 Suppose that a man has two wives, but he likes one of them and dislikes the other one. And suppose that they both give birth to sons, and the oldest son is the child of the woman that he does not like.
\v 16 On the day when that man decides how he will divide his possessions for his sons to possess \add after he dies\add*, he must not favor the son of the wife that he loves by giving him \add a bigger share\add*, the share that the older son should receive.
\v 17 He must give two-thirds of his possessions to the older son, the son of the wife whom he does not like. That son is his firstborn son, and he must be given the share that he should receive because of his being that man's firstborn son.

\v 15 If a man has two wives, and one is loved and the other is hated, and they have both borne him children, both the beloved wife and the hated wifeâ€”if the firstborn son is of her that is hated;
\v 16 then on the day that the man causes his sons to inherit what he possesses, he may not make the son of the beloved wife the firstborn before the son of the hated wife, the son who is actually the firstborn.
\v 17 Instead, he must acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the hated wife, by giving him a double portion of all that he possesses; for that son is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn belongs to him.
