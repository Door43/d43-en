\v 22 And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put to death, and you hang him on a tree;
\v 23 his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but you shall surely bury him the same day; for he that is hanged is accursed of God; that you defile not your land which Jehovah your God gives you for an inheritance.
