====== Deuteronomy 21 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Elders ==
Older men were required to lead the people of Israel and help to administer justice. These men would function as judges, which would later become a more official position. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:justice]])

== Peace in Israel ==
The rules and instructions in this chapter help to ensure peace in Israel. This is not a military peace. Instead, it is about establishing peace within Israel and among the people.
