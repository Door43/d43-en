\v 17 In those countries they saw those disgusting idols made of wood and stone and \add decorated with\add* silver and gold.
\v 18 So be sure that no man or woman or family or tribe that is here \add today\add* turns away from Yahweh our God, to worship\f + \ft Or: serve \f* the gods of those nations. Doing that would be like a root \add of a plant that would grow\add* among you and bear poisonous and bitter fruit \f + \ft metaphor \f*.

\v 19 Be sure that no one here today who hears this solemn agreement reassures\f + \ft Or: says to \f* himself, that 'Everything will go well with me, even if I stubbornly do what I want to.' If you do that, the result will be that Yahweh will eventually get rid of all of you, both good people and evil people \f + \ft metaphor \f*.

\v 17 and you have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them);
\v 18 lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turns away this day from Jehovah our God, to go to serve the gods of those nations; lest there should be among you a root that bears gall and wormwood;
\v 19 and it come to pass, when he hears the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart, to destroy the moist with the dry.
