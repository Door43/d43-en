<usfm>
\v 17 In those countries they saw those disgusting idols made of wood and stone and \add decorated with\add* silver and gold.
\v 18 So be sure that no man or woman or family or tribe that is here \add today\add* turns away from Yahweh our God, to worship\f + \ft Or: serve \f* the gods of those nations. Doing that would be like a root \add of a plant that would grow\add* among you and bear poisonous and bitter fruit \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\p
\v 19 Be sure that no one here today who hears this solemn agreement reassures\f + \ft Or: says to \f* himself, that 'Everything will go well with me, even if I stubbornly do what I want to.' If you do that, the result will be that Yahweh will eventually get rid of all of you, both good people and evil people \f + \ft metaphor \f*.

\v 17 In those countries they saw those disgusting idols made of wood and stone and decorated with silver and gold.
\v 18 So be sure that no man or woman or family or tribe that is here today turns away from Yahweh our God, to worship any of the gods of those people groups. If you do that, you will bring disaster on yourselves.
\p
\v 19 Be sure that no one here today who hears the words of this covenant says to himself, 'Everything will go well with me, even if I stubbornly do what I want to.' If you do that, the result will be that Yahweh will eventually destroy all of you, both good people and evil people.

\v 17 You have seen their disgusting things: their idols of wood and stone, silver and gold, that were among them.
\v 18 Make sure there is not among you any man, woman, family, or tribe whose heart is turning away today from Yahweh our God, so as to go worship the gods of those nations. Make sure there is not among you any root that produces gall and wormwood.
\v 19 When that person hears the words of this curse, he will bless himself in his heart and say, 'I will have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart.' This would destroy the wet together with the dry.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **whose heart is turning away today from Yahweh our God** - Here "heart" refers to the whole person, and "turning away" means to stop obeying. AT: "who no longer obeys Yahweh our God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **root that produces gall and wormwood** - Moses speaks of someone who secretly worships another God as if he were a root, and the evil deeds he does to serve that god and encourages others to do as a bitter plant that poisons people. AT: "be among you any person who worships idols and causes others to disobey Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **that person** - The person described in verse 18.
  * **bless himself in his heart** - This is an idiom. AT: "congratulate himself" or "encourage himself" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart** - This is an idiom. AT: "even though I still refuse to obey Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **This would destroy the wet together with the dry** - Here the words "wet" and "dry" are metaphors for the righteous people and the wicked people. This forms a merism for "everyone." AT: "This would cause Yahweh to destroy both the righteous people and the wicked people in the land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **wet ... dry** - These nominal adjectives can be translated as nouns. Because the land was usually dry and the people needed rain so their crops would grow, these words are metaphors for "living ... dead" or "good ... bad."  AT: "wet things ... dry things" or "good people ... bad people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
