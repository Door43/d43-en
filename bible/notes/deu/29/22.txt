\v 22 In future years, your descendants and people from other countries will see the disasters and the illnesses that Yahweh has caused to happen to you.
\v 23 They will see that all your land has been ruined by burning sulfur and salt. Nothing will have been planted. Not even weeds will be there. Your land will resemble Sodom and Gomorrah \add cities\add*, and Admah and Zeboiim \add cities\add*, which Yahweh destroyed when he was very angry \f + \ft doublet \f* \add with the people who lived there\add*.
\v 24 And the people from those other nations will ask, 'Why did Yahweh do this to this land? Why was he very angry \add with the people who lived here\add*?'

\v 22 The generation to come, your children who will rise up after you, and the foreigner who comes from a distant land, will speak when they see the plagues on this land and the diseases with which Yahweh has made it sick—
\v 23 and when they see that the whole land has become sulfur and burning salt, where nothing is sown or bears fruit, where no vegetation grows, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboyim, that Yahweh destroyed in his anger and wrath—
\v 24 they will say together with all the other nations, 'Why has Yahweh done this to this land? What does the heat of this great anger mean?'
