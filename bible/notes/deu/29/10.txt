===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.
  * **among you in your camp ... your wood ... your water** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **the foreigner who is** - "the foreigners who are"
