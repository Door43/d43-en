This emphasizes God's power to destroy whatever makes him angry, and it can be stated in active form.

  * **that are written** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "that I have written" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Yahweh has uprooted them from their land ... and has thrown them** - Israel is compared to a bad plant that Yahweh has pulled up and thrown out of a garden. AT: "Yahweh has removed them from their land ... and has forced them to go." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in anger, in wrath, and in great fury** - The words "anger,​" "wrath,​" and "fury" mean basically the same thing and emphasize the great intensity of Yahweh's anger. AT: "in extremely great anger" or "because he was extremely angry." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
