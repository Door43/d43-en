===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the anger of Yahweh has been kindled against this land** - Moses compares Yahweh's anger to someone starting a fire. This emphasizes God's power to destroy whatever makes him angry. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **that are written** - AT: "that Moses wrote" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Yahweh has uprooted them from their land...and has thrown them** - Israel is compared to a bad plant that is pulled up and thrown out of a garden. AT: "Yahweh has removed them from their land...and has forced them"
  * **in anger, in wrath, and in great fury**  - These words have similar meaning; they are placed together to show God's extreme anger. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
