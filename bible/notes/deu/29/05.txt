===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I have led you** - Yahweh is speaking to the people of Israel.
  * **forty years** - "40 years" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **your sandals ... your feet** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the word "your" here is singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
