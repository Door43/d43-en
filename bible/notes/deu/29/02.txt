  * **the great sufferings that your eyes saw** - Here "eyes" means the whole person. AT: "you saw God cause the people to suffer terribly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **your eyes** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the word "your" here is singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **Yahweh has not given you a heart to know, eyes to see, or ears to hear** - The people do have hearts, eyes, and ears. This means God has not let them understand what all of these things really mean. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
