===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the anger of Yahweh and his jealousy will smolder** - Moses compares Yahweh's intense anger to a smoldering fire. This emphasizes God's power to destroy his enemies. AT: "Yahweh's jealous anger will grow like a fire" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **that are written** - "that I have written" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Yahweh will blot out his name from under heaven** - This means God will completely destroy the person and his familay. In the future people will not remember him. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[en:bible:notes:deu:07:23|7:24]].
