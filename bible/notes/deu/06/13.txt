===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **you will swear by his name**  - They are naming Yahweh as the power on which they make the oath. This means Yahweh will punish the person if he does not do what he swears he will do. AT: "you will swear and ask Yahweh to confirm it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **in the midst of you**  - AT: "who lives among you"
  * **lest the anger of Yahweh your God is kindled against you and he destroy you**  - Moses compares Yahweh's anger to someone starting a fire. This emphasizes Yahweh's power to destroy what makes him angry. AT: "or Yahweh your God will become very angry and destroy you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
