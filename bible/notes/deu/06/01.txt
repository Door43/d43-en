===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues the speech to the people of Israel he began in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:05:01|5:1]]. Beginning in verse 2, he speaks to the people of Israel as if they were one person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **might keep ... to keep** - "might obey ... to obey"
  * **going over the Jordan** - "going to the other side of the Jordan River"
  * **that your days may be prolonged** - Long days are a metaphor for a long life. This can be stated in active form. This can be translated similarly to "prolong your days" in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:04:25|4:26]]. AT: "that I may prolong your days" or "that I may cause you to live a long time" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) and ([[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
