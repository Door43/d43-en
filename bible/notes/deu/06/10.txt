<usfm>
\v 10 Yahweh our God solemnly promised to your ancestors Abraham and Isaac and Jacob that he will give you a land that already has in it large and prosperous cities that you did not build.
\v 11 He said that the houses in those cities will already be full of many good things that \add someone else put there\add*; you did not put them there. There will be wells that someone else dug. There will be vineyards and olive trees that someone else planted. So when Yahweh brings you into that land, and you have all that you want to eat,
\v 12 be sure that you do not forget Yahweh who rescued you from being slaves \add in Egypt and gave all these things to you\add*.

\v 10 When Yahweh your God brings you into the land that he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, that he would give you, with large and very good cities that you did not build,
\v 11 and houses full of all kinds of good things that you did not make, cisterns that you did not dig, and vineyards and olive trees that you did not plant, you will eat and be satisfied—
\v 12 then be careful so that you do not forget Yahweh, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
