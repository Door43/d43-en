  * **before Yahweh** - "in the presence of Yahweh"
  * **The Levite who is within your gates** - Here "gate" represents the entire city or town. AT: "Any Levite who lives in your towns" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])

  * **for he has no portion nor inheritance with you** - The tribe of Levi did not receive a portion of land as their inheritance.
