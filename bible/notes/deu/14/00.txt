====== Deuteronomy 14 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Law of Moses ==
This chapter is part of the law of Moses, which is part of the covenant Yahweh made with Moses. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses]])

== Clean animals ==
There are animals which the law considered to be clean and unclean. The people were not allowed to eat the unclean animals. Scholars are uncertain about the reasons for the animals to be considered to be clean or unclean. The result of these food restrictions was a nation that was different than the nations surrounding it. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:clean]] and [[:en:obe:kt:unclean]])
