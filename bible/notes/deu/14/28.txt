===== translationNotes: =====

  * **every three years you will present all the tithe of your produce** - Once every 3 years the Israelites were to store their tithes within their own towns so that it would be used to provide for the Levites, orphans, widows and foreigners. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **within your gates** - Here "gates" represents the entire city or town. AT: "inside your city"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **because he has no portion nor inheritance with you** - God not giving any land to the Levites is spoken of as if he were not giving them an inheritance. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **fatherless** - These are children whose parents have both died and do not have relatives to care for them.
  * **widow** - This is a woman whose husband has died and has no children to care for her in her old age.
  * **in all the work of your hand that you do** - Here "hand" represents the whole person. This refers to the work that someone does. AT: "in all the work you do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
