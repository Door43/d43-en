===== Translation Notes: =====

The narrative breaks to give a short account of where they traveled.

  * **The people of Israel…a land of streams of water**  - This gives background information about where the people of Israel traveled. It also covers Aaron's natural death in Moserah. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background|Writing Styles - Background Information]])
  * **Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah…Gudgodah…Jotbathah**  - These are names of different places the people of Israel went through while in the wilderness. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Beeroth Bene Jaakan**  - Translator may add a footnote: "The name 'Beeroth Bene Jaakan' means 'the wells that belonged to the people of Jaakan.'"
  * **Eleazar**  - This is the name of Aaron's son. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
