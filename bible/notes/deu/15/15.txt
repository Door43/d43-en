====== Deuteronomy 15:15-17 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 Do not forget that your ancestors were once slaves in Egypt, and Yahweh our God freed them. That is the reason that I am now commanding you to do this.
\p
\v 16 But one of your slaves may say, 'I do not want to leave you.' He loves you and your family, because you have treated him well.
\v 17 If he says that, take him to the door of your house and, \add while he stands against the doorway\add*, pierce one of his earlobes with an awl\f + \ft Or: a sharp pointed tool \f*. That will indicate that he will be your slave for the rest of his life. Do the same thing to any female slave \add who does not want to leave you\add*.

\v 15 You must remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and that Yahweh your God redeemed you; therefore I am commanding you today to do this.
\v 16 It will happen that if he says to you, 'I will not go away from you,' because he loves you and your house, and because he is well off with you,
\v 17 then you must take an awl and thrust it through his ear to a door, and he will be your servant forever. And also to your female servant you will do likewise.
