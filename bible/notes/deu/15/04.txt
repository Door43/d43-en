\v 4 However, there should be no poor among you (for Yahweh will surely bless you in the land that he gives you as an inheritance to possess),
\v 5 if only you diligently listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, to keep all these commandments that I am commanding you today.
\v 6 For Yahweh your God will bless you, as he promised you;  you will lend to many nations, but you will not borrow;  you will rule over many nations, but they will not rule over you.
