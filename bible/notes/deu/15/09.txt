====== Deuteronomy 15:9-10 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 Be sure that you do not say to yourself, 'The year when debts will be canceled is near, \add so I do not want to lend anyone any money now, because he will not need to pay it back when that year comes\add*.' It would be evil to even think that. If you act in an unfriendly way toward a needy fellow Israelite, and give him nothing, he will cry out to Yahweh against you, and \add Yahweh will say that\add* you have sinned \add by not helping that person\add*.
\v 10 Give freely to poor people and give generously [IDI].

\v 9 Be careful not to have a wicked thought in your heart, saying, 'The seventh year, the year of release, is near,' so that you not be stingy in regard to your poor brother and give him nothing;  he might cry out to Yahweh about you, and it would be sin for you.
\v 10 You must surely give to him, and your heart must not be sorry when you give to him, because in return for this Yahweh your God will bless you in all your work and in all that you put your hand to.
