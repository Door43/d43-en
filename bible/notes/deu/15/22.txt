===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **within your gates - **  “within your community” or “inside your city.” Cities often had walls around them to keep out enemies, and gates for people to go in and out. (See: Metonymy )
  * **as you would eat a gazelle or a deer**  - These are medium-sized animals that eat grass and run fast; they were hunted for food by the Israelites. Yahweh identified in the law the animals that were acceptable for food. (See: Simile)
  * **you must not eat its blood - ** Translators may add a footnote such as this: “The blood is a symbol for life.” They may also add a foot note saying something like this: “God commanded people not to eat meat while the blood was still in it. They had to drain out the blood first.” See how you translated in Gen 9:3,4.
  * **pour its blood out on the ground like water **- The blood should be poured on the earth as a common thing, like water. (See: Simile)
