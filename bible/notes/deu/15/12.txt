\v 12 If your brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, is sold to you and serves you for six years, then in the seventh year you must let him go free from you.
\v 13 When you let him go free from you, you must not let him go empty-handed;
\v 14 You must liberally provide for him out of your flock, out of your threshing floor, and out of your winepress; as Yahweh your God has blessed you, you must give to him.
