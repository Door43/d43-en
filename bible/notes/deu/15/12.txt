\v 12 If your brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, be sold to you, and serve you six years; then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from thee.
\v 13 And when you lettest him go free from thee, you shall not let him go empty:
\v 14 you shall furnish him liberally out of your flock, and out of your threshing-floor, and out of your winepress; as Jehovah your God has blessed you you shall give to him.
