\v 2 This is the manner of the release: every creditor will cancel that which he has lent to his neighbor; he will not demand it from his neighbor or his brother because Yahweh's cancellation of debts has been proclaimed.
\v 3 From a foreigner you may demand it; but whatever of yours is with your brother your hand must release.
