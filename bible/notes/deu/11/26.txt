\v 26 Look, I set before you today a blessing and a curse;
\v 27 the blessing, if you will listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God that I command you today;
\v 28 and the curse, if you will not listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God, but turn aside out of the way that I command you today, to go after other gods that you have not known.
