<usfm>
\v 4 Think about what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses and their chariots. Think about how he caused the Sea of Reeds to flood and sweep away their army as they were coming after your ancestors. Think about how they have suffered from that even until now.
\v 5 Think about what Yahweh did for your ancestors in the desert before you arrived at this place.

<usfm>
\v 4 Neither did they see what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, or to their chariots; how he made the water of the Sea of Reeds overwhelm them as they pursued after you, and how Yahweh has destroyed them until today;
\v 5 or what he did for you in the wilderness until you came to this place.
