\v 4 Think about what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses and their chariots. Think about how he caused the Sea of Reeds to flood and sweep away their army as they were coming after your ancestors. Think about how they have suffered from that even until now.

  * **what he did** - "what Yahweh did"
  * **they pursued after you** - Here "you" means the Israelites who were alive about 40 years earlier.
  * **to this place** - This means the plain of the Jordan River Valley where Moses is speaking to them before they cross over into Canaan.
