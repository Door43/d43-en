  * **from the river, the Euphrates River** - "from the Euphrates River"
  * **No man will be able to stand before you** - "No one will be able to stop you"
  * **the fear of you and the terror of you** - The words "fear" and "terror" mean the same thing. They are combined to emphasize that the people in Canaan will be very afraid of the Israelites. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
