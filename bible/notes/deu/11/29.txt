\v 29 It will happen, when Yahweh your God brings you into the land which you go to possess, that you will set the blessing on Mount Gerizim, and the curse on Mount Ebal.
\v 30 Are they not beyond the Jordan, west of the western road, in the land of the Canaanites who live in the Arabah, over against Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **that you will set the blessing on Mount Gerizim, and the curse on Mount Ebal** - Announcing on Mount Gerizim how God will bless the people if they obey, and announcing on Mount Ebal how God will curse the people if they disobey is spoken of as if the blessing and the curse were objects that they will set on the mountains. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Mount Gerizim ... Mount Ebal** - These are names of mountains on the west side of the Jordan River. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Are they not beyond the Jordan ... Moreh?** - The Israelites were on the eastern side of the Jordan River. Moses uses a question to remind the people about where these mountains are located. This question can be translated as a statement. AT: "As you know, they are beyond the Jordan ... Moreh." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **beyond the Jordan** - "on the west side of the Jordan River"
  * **west of the western road** - "in the west"
  * **over against Gilgal** - "near Gilgal." This is probably not the same place as the city near Jericho. Moses is probably referring to a place that was near Shechem. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **oaks of Moreh** - These are sacred trees near Gilgal. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
