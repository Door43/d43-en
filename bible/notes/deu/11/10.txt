\v 10 The land that you are about to enter and occupy is not like the land of Egypt, where your ancestors lived. In Egypt, after they planted seeds, it was necessary for them to work hard \f + \ft metonymy \f* to water \add the plants that grew\add*.
\v 11 But the land that you are about to enter is a land where there are many hills and valleys, where there is plenty of rain.
\v 12 Yahweh takes care of that land. He \f + \ft synecdoche \f* watches over it every day, from the beginning of each year to the end of each year.

\v 10 For the land, where you go in to possess it, is not like the land of Egypt, from where you came, where you sowed your seed and watered it with your foot, like a garden of herbs;
\v 11 but the land, where you go over to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinks water of the rain of the heavens,
\v 12 a land that Yahweh your God cares for; the eyes of Yahweh your God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.
