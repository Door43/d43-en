===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues what the Israelite must say when he brings his first crops to Yahweh.

  * **treated us badly and afflicted us** - These two phrases say basically the same thing. They emphasize that the Egyptians acted very harshly. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **treated us** - Here "us" refers to the people of Israel that were living in Egypt. The speaker includes himself as one of the people whether he lived in Egypt or not.
  * **he heard our voice** - "he heard our cries" or "he heard our prayers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **our affliction...our oppression** - These mean basically the same thing. They emphasize that God saw that they were suffering. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
