===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues what the Israelite must say when he brings his first crops to Yahweh. 

  * **first of the harvest** - "first fruits of the harvest" or "first crops of the harvest"
  * **You must set it down** - "You must set the basket down." Moses is speaking to the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
