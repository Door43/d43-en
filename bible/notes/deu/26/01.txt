===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **some of the first of all the harvest** - "some of the first fruits of the harvest" or "some of the first crops of the harvest." This "first" is the ordinal number for one. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal|Ordinal Numbers]])
