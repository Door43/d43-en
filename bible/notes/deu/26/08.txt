===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues what the Israelite must say when he brings his first crops to Yahweh. 

  * **Yahweh brought us** - Here "us" refers to the people of Israel that were living in Egypt. The speaker includes himself as one of the people whether he lived in Egypt or not.
  * **with a mighty hand, with a display of his power** - Both phrases mean basically the same thing. AT: "with his mighty power" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **with great fearsomeness**  - AT: "with acts that terrified the people who saw them"
  * **a land flowing with milk and honey** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:deu:06:03|6:3]].
