===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **with all your heart and with all your soul** - The idiom "with all ... heart" means "completely" and "with all ... soul" means "with all your being." These two phrases have similar meaning. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:04:29|4:29]]. AT: "with all your being" or "with all your energy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **that you will walk in his ways and keep his statutes, his commandments, and his decrees, and that you will listen to his voice** - The words "walk," "keep," and "listen" have similar meanings here. Here "voice" refers to what God has said. AT: "that you will completely obey everything Yahweh commands" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
