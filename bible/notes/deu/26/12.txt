\v 12 When you have finished giving all the tithe of your harvest in the third year, that is, the year of tithing, then you must give it to the Levite, to the foreigner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, so that they may eat within your city gates and be filled.
\v 13 You must say before Yahweh your God, 'I have brought out of my house the things that belong to Yahweh, and have given them to the Levite, to the foreigner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all your commandments that you have given me. I have not transgressed any of your commandments, neither have I forgotten them.

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **in the third year** - This "third" is the ordinal number for three. Every three years the people of Israel gave a tenth of the harvest to the poor. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **fatherless** - These are children whose parents have both died and do not have relatives to care for them.
  * **widow** - This means a woman whose husband has died and has no children to care for her now that she is old.
  * **eat within your city gates and be filled** - Here "gates" means towns or cities. AT: "so that those within your towns may have enough food to eat" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **I have brought out of** - These are the first words of another statement that the Israelite was supposed to say.
