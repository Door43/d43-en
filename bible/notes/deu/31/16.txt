===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Look, you** - "Pay attention to what I am going to tell you. You"
  * **you will sleep with your fathers** - This is a polite way to say "you will die." AT: "you will die and join your ancestors who have died before you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **this people will rise up and act like a prostitute going ... it is going. It will forsake ... break ... with it** - Yahweh is speaking of the Israelites as one people group, so all instances of "it" refer to the people as a group, not as many people. It is best to translate as plural throughout. "these people will rise up and act like prostitutes going ... they are going. They will forsake ... break ... with them"
  * **will rise up and act like a prostitute** - "will start to be unfaithful to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
