===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues speaking to the Israelites.

  * **he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites** - Here "Sihon"and " Og" refer to two Kings of the Amorites and their armies. See how you translated these names in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:01:03|1:4]]. AT: "he did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their armies." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Be strong and of good courage** - "Be strong and courageous"
  * **fear not, and do not be afraid of them** - Moses repeats this to emphasize to the people not to be be afraid. AT: "and do not fear them at all." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Yahweh your God ... with you ... fail you nor forsake you** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **he will not fail you nor forsake you** - "he will always fulfill his promise to you and will always be with you"
