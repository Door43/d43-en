\v 27 \add I say this\add* because I know that these people are very stubborn \f + \ft doublet \f*. They have rebelled against Yahweh all during the time that I have been \add with them\add*, and they will rebel much more after I die!
\v 28 So gather all the elders of the tribes and your officials, in order that I can tell them the words \add of this song\add*, and request all those who are in heaven and on the earth to be witnesses to testify against these people.
\v 29 I say that because I know that after I die, the people will become very wicked. They will turn away from doing all that I have commanded them to do. And in the future, because of all the evil things that they will do, they will cause Yahweh to become angry with them. And he will cause them to experience disasters."

\v 27 For I know your rebellion and your stiff neck; look, while I am still alive with you even today, you have been rebellious against Yahweh; how much more after my death?
\v 28 Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, so that I may speak these words in their ears and call heaven and earth to witness against them.
\v 29 For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves and turn aside out of the path that I have commanded you; disaster will come on you in the following days. This will happen because you will do what is evil in the sight of Yahweh, so as to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues speaking to the Levites about all the Israelite people.

  * **your rebellion and your stiff neck** - Moses speaks to the Levites as if they were one man, so the word "your" is singular. [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]]
  * **your stiff neck** - Translate this as you translated "stubborn" in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:09:06|9:6]].
  * **how much more after my death?** - This rhetorical question emphasizes how rebellious the people were. It can be translated as a statement. AT: "you will be even more rebellious after I die." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **so that I may speak these words in their ears** - Here "in their ears" means the people themselves.  AT: "so that I may speak the words of this song to them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **call heaven and earth to witness against them** - Possible meanings are 1) Moses is calling on all those who live in heaven and earth to be witnesses to what he says or 2) Moses is speaking to heaven and earth as if they are people, and he is calling them to be witnesses to what he says. A similar phrase appears in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:30:19|30:19]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
  * **you will utterly corrupt yourselves** - "you will do what is completely wrong." Similar words appear in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:04:15|4:16]].
  * **turn aside out of the path that I have commanded you** - "stop following the instructions I have given to you." Similar words appear in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:09:11|9:12]].
  * **because you will do what is evil in the sight of Yahweh** - Here "the sight of Yahweh" means "in Yahweh's opinion." AT: "because you will do what Yahweh says is evil" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **through the work of your hands** - Here "your hands" means the people themselves. AT: "because of what you have made" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
