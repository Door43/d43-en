\v 27 \add I say this\add* because I know that these people are very stubborn \f + \ft doublet \f*. They have rebelled against Yahweh all during the time that I have been \add with them\add*, and they will rebel much more after I die!
\v 28 So gather all the elders of the tribes and your officials, in order that I can tell them the words \add of this song\add*, and request all those who are in heaven and on the earth to be witnesses to testify against these people.
\v 29 I say that because I know that after I die, the people will become very wicked. They will turn away from doing all that I have commanded them to do. And in the future, because of all the evil things that they will do, they will cause Yahweh to become angry with them. And he will cause them to experience disasters."

\v 27 For I know your rebellion and your stiff neck; look, while I am still alive with you even today, you have been rebellious against Yahweh; how much more after my death?
\v 28 Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, so that I may speak these words in their ears and call heaven and earth to witness against them.
\v 29 For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves and turn away from the path that I have commanded you; disaster will come on you in the following days. This will happen because you will do what is evil in the sight of Yahweh, so as to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands."
