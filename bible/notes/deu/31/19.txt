\v 19 Now therefore write this song for yourselves and teach it to the people of Israel. Put it in their mouths, so that this song may be a witness for me against the people of Israel.
\v 20 For when I will have brought him into the land that I swore to give to his ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey, and when he will have eaten and become satisfied and fat, then he will turn to other gods and they will serve them; they will despise me and he will break my covenant.
