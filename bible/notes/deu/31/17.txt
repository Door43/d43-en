\v 17 When that happens, I will become very angry with them. I will abandon them and refuse to help them any longer. Many bad things will happen to them, and they will be destroyed. Then they will say among themselves, 'These things are happening to us because our God is no longer with us.'
\v 18 And because of all the evil things that they will have done, and especially because they will have started to worship other gods, I will refuse to help them.

\v 17 Then, on that day, my anger will be kindled against them, and I will abandon them. I will hide my face from them, and they will be devoured. Many disasters and troubles will find them, so that they will say on that day, 'Have these disasters not found me because our God is not in my midst?'
\v 18 I will surely hide my face from them on that day because of all the evil that they will have done, because they have turned to other gods.
