\v 24 It happened that when Moses had finished writing the words of this law in a book,
\v 25 that he gave a command to the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of Yahweh; he said,
\v 26 "Take this book of the law and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your God, so that it may be there as a witness against you.
