\v 1 If there arises among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams, and if he gives you a sign or a wonder,
\v 2 and if the sign or the wonder comes about, of which he spoke to you and said, 'Let us go after other gods, that you have not known, and let us worship them,'
\v 3 do not listen to the words of that prophet, or to that dreamer of dreams; for Yahweh your God is testing you to know whether you love Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **If there arises among you** - "If there appears among you" or "If someone among you claims to be"
  * **a dreamer of dreams** - This is someone who receives messages from God through dreams.
  * **a sign or a wonder** - These two words have similar meanings and refer to various miracles. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **comes about** - "takes place" or "happens"
  * **of which he spoke to you and said, 'Let us go after other gods, that you have not known, and let us worship them'** - This can be translated as an indirect quotation. AT: "and he tells you to serve and worship other gods which you have not known" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **Let us go after other gods** - Worshiping other gods is spoken of as if they were going after or following other gods. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **go after other gods, that you have not known** - The phrase "gods, that you have not known" refers to the gods that other people groups worship. The Israelites know Yahweh because he has revealed himself to them and they have experienced his power.
  * **do not listen to the words of that prophet, or to that dreamer of dreams** - Here "words" represent what is said. AT: "do not listen to what that prophet say nor to what the dreamer of dreams says" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **with all your heart and with all your soul** - The idiom "with all your heart" means "completely" and "with ... soul" means "with all your being." These two phrases have similar meaning. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:deu:04:29|4:29]]. AT: "with all your being" or "with all your energy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
