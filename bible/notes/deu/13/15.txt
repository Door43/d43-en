\v 15 —then you will surely attack the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it completely, and all the people who are in it, along with its livestock, with the edge of the sword.
\v 16 You will gather all the spoil from it into the middle of its street and will burn the city, as well as all its spoil—for Yahweh your God. The city will be a heap of ruins forever; it must never be built again.
