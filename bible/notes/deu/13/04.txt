\v 4 You shall walk after Jehovah your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and you shall serve him, and cleave to him.
\v 5 And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death, because he has spoken rebellion against Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to draw you aside out of the way which Jehovah your God commanded you to walk in. So shall you put away the evil from the midst of you.
