\v 12 If you hear anyone say about one of your cities, that Yahweh your God gives you to live in:
\v 13 Some wicked fellows have gone out from among you and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city and said, 'Let us go and worship other gods that you have not known.'

===== Translation Notes: =====
Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.
  * **Some wicked fellows have gone out from among you** - The phrase "from among you" means that these wicked men were Israelites who lived in their communities.
  * **have drawn away the inhabitants of their city and said, 'Let us go and worship other gods that you have not known** - This can be translated as an indirect quotation. AT: "have persuaded those who live in their city to go and worship other gods that they have not known" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **examine the evidence, make search, and investigate it thoroughly** - All of these phrases mean basically the same thing. Moses is emphasizing that they must carefully find out what truly happened at the city.
  * **that such a detestable thing has been done among you** - AT: "that the people of the city have done such a terrible thing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
