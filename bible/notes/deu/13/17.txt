\v 17 You must not take for yourselves [IDI] anything that Yahweh has said must be destroyed, because if you do what I say, Yahweh will stop being angry with you, and he will act mercifully toward you. And he will cause you to have many children\f + \ft Or: descendants \f*, which is what he promised our ancestors that he would do.
\v 18 Yahweh our God will do all those things if you do what he is telling you to do, and if you obey all the commandments that I am giving to you today and do what Yahweh says is right \add for you to do\add*."

\v 17 None of those things set apart for destruction must stick in your hand. This must be the case, so that Yahweh will turn from the fierceness of his anger, show you mercy, have compassion on you, and make you increase in numbers, as he has sworn to your fathers.
\v 18 He will do this because you are listening to the voice of Yahweh your God, to keep all his commandments that I am commanding you today, to do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh your God.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **None of those things set apart for destruction must stick in your hand** - Yahweh cursing something and promising to destroy it is spoken of as if Yahweh were setting the object apart from other things. This can be stated in active form. AT: "You must not keep any of the things God has commanded you to destroy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **must stick in your hand** - This is a way of saying a person keeps something. AT: "must you keep" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Yahweh will turn from the fierceness of his anger** - Yahweh no longer being angry is spoken of as his anger were an object and Yahweh physically turns away from it. AT: "Yahweh will stop being angry" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to your fathers** - Here "fathers" means ancestors or forefathers.
  * **you are listening to the voice of Yahweh** - Here "voice" represents what Yahweh says. AT: "you are obeying what Yahweh says" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh your God** - The eyes represent seeing, and seeing represents thoughts or judgment. AT: "that which is right in Yahweh's judgment" or "that which Yahweh your God considers to be right" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
