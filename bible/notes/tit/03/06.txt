===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Paul reminds Titus to teach humbly because we received grace.)
  * **poured the Holy Spirit on us** - This is a metaphor resembling the anointing of priests. (See: [[en:bible:notes:key-terms:anoint]]) This could be translated as "gave the Holy Spirit to us generously."
  * **everlasting** - "eternal"
  * **richly** - "abundantly" or "generously"
  * **through our Savior Jesus Christ**  - "when Jesus saved us"
  * **having been justified** - This could be translated as "We have already been justified by God"
  * **we are made heirs**  - This could be translated as "God makes us sons with rights of inheritance."
  * **according to the hope of everlasting life**  - "because of our certain hope that we have eternal life"
