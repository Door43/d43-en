\v 3 \add Remind your congregations about these things\add* because formerly we \add believers\add* ourselves were also foolish, just like \add all people who do not believe in Christ are now. We\add* did not obey \add God\add*\f + \ft Or: God's message \f*. \add We let\add* others deceive us. We spent all our time doing\f + \ft Or: continually did \f* what is evil and could not stop ourselves from doing all the things that our bodies liked \f + \ft doublet \f*. We were envying others\f + \ft Or: desiring to have what others have \f*. We were causing people to hate us and we were hating one another.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 For there was a time when we—all of us—were thoughtless and unpersuaded about these things. We were led astray and served various passions and pleasures as if we were their slaves. We spent our lives envying each other and doing evil. We caused people to hate us and we hated each another.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 For once we ourselves were thoughtless and disobedient. We were led astray and enslaved by various passions and pleasures. We lived in evil and envy. We were detestable and hated one another.
