====== Titus 03:9-11 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 but there are people who foolishly dispute\f + \ft Or: argue \f* \add with you, wanting you to believe\add* senseless \add myths\f + \ft Or: stories that came from your ancestors\add* \f*, stories in which there are genealogies\f + \ft Or: lists of your ancestors' names \f*. They argue and quarrel \add with you\add*, \add insisting\f + \ft Or: telling you\add* \f* \add that you must obey\add* the \add Jewish\add* laws. Keep \add completely\add* away from\f + \ft Or: Do not talk with \f* them, because \add arguing about such things\add* is not profitable \add for anyone. It is completely\add* worthless!
\v 10 Those people, \add by teaching things that are false\add*, are causing others to turn away from\f + \ft Or: to quit believing \f* the true teachings. You must warn them \add that God will judge them if they continue doing that. If they do not stop\add*, warn them one more time. \add If they still do not stop\add*, then no \add longer\add* allow them\add to influence the believers\add*.
\v 11 You will know \add clearly\add* that such persons have \add deliberately\add* turned away \add from\f + \ft Or: quit believing and obeying\add* \f* \add the true teachings\add*. They know that they are doing what is sinful, \add but they deliberately keep on doing it\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 But stay away from senseless debates, entanglements about Jewish genealogies, arguments and disputes about the religious law. Those are a useless waste of your time and energy.
\v 10 If people insist on engaging in these divisive activities after you have warned them one or two times, then have nothing more to do with them,
\v 11 because people like that have turned away from the truth; they live in sin and condemn themselves.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 But avoid foolish debates and genealogies and strife and conflict about the law. Those things are worthless and unprofitable.
\v 10 Reject anyone who is causing divisions among you after one or two warnings,
\v 11 and know that such a one has turned from the right way and is sinning and condemns himself.
