<usfm>
\v 11 Titus, all that I have written adds up to this: everyone is now able to know that God wishes to save them; this is his gift to them.
\v 12 This saving grace from God trains us, as if we were children, to say no to the desires that are found in this world. It helps us to think about things in the right way, to be honest, truthful, and fair to other people and to always keep God in our thoughts and actions while we live in this world.
\v 13 At the same time, God teaches us to wait for what he will certainly do in the future, which is something that will make us very happy: That is, Jesus the Messiah, our Savior and powerful God, will return to us in great splendor.

<usfm>
\v 11 You see, the grace of God that is able to bring salvation to everyone has appeared
\v 12 and trains us to deny ungodliness and worldly passions and to live sensibly, righteously, and in a godly way in this age
\v 13 while we look forward to receiving that which we are gladly anticipating, the appearance of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.
