\v 3 Similarly, \add tell\add* the older women that they should behave in a reverent manner that shows that they are devoted to God\f + \ft Or: in a manner that honors God \f*; \add specifically, they should\add* not slander others\f + \ft Or: talk evil about others \f*, and they should not be drinking much\add \f + \ft Or: habitually\add* drinking \f* \add alcohol\add*. Tell them that they should teach \add the younger women\add* what is good,
\v 4 in order that they may love their husbands and love their children.
\v 5 They should teach them to control what they say and do and to be pure in every way, to be good workers at home and submissive to their own husbands. \add The younger women should behave like this\add* in order that no one will speak against the message about God.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 The older women, like the men, should live so that everyone knows that they respect God very much. They must not say bad things about other people, and they must not drink very much wine. But they should teach others what is good.
\v 4 In this way, they should teach the younger women to think wisely and to love their own husbands and children.
\v 5 The older women should also teach the younger women to think good thoughts, not to act in a bad way toward any man, to work well at home, and to do what their husbands tell them. They should do all these things so that no one will mock God's Word.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Older women likewise should always present themselves as reverent, not gossips. They should not need to continually drink wine. They should teach what is good
\v 4 in order to call the younger women to be balanced in their thinking, to encourage them to love their own husbands and children, to be sensible,
\v 5 pure, good housekeepers, and to obey their own husbands, so that God's word may not be condemned.
