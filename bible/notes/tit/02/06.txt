====== Titus 02:6-8 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 As for the younger men, similarly, urge them to control themselves \add in all that they say and do\add*.
\v 7 You yourself must continually do what is good in order that others will see how they should behave. Teach \add the believers\add* sincerely and seriously;
\v 8 teach what is correct and what no one can \add justly\add* criticize. \add Do this\add* in order that \add when the believers\add* conduct their lives\add in a proper manner\add*, anyone who opposes \add us\f + \ft Or: our message\add* \f* will be disappointed because there will be nothing bad that they can \add justly\add* say about us.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 And concerning the younger men, teach them, too. Tell them to control themselves well.
\v 7 As for you, Titus my son, always show other people how to do good deeds. In what you teach show the believers what is true and also show them how serious you are about your work.
\v 8 Teach people in a way that no one can criticize, so that if anybody wants to stop you, other people will shame them because they really have nothing bad to say about any of us.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 In the same way, encourage the younger men to use good sense.
\v 7 In all ways present yourself as an example of good works. In your teaching, show integrity, dignity,
\v 8 and words that are above criticism, so that anyone who oppose you may be ashamed because they had nothing bad to say about us.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **In the same way** - Titus was to train the younger men like he was to train the older people.
  * **present yourself** - "show yourself to be"
  * **a model of good works** - "an example of one who does right and proper things"
  * **a message that is healthy** - Paul speaks of Titus' preaching and teaching as if they were a person who was healthy in his body. 
  * **so that anyone who is opposed may be put to shame** - This presents an imaginary situation where someone opposes Titus and then becomes ashamed for having done so. It is not expressing something that actually happened. Your language may have a way of expressing this. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
