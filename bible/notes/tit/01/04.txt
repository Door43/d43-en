\v 4 I am writing to you, Titus, because you are like a son to me because we both believe in Jesus Christ. May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior continue to be kind to you and to give you peace.
\v 5 I left you on the Island of Crete for this reason; that you do the work that has been unfinished and also appoint elders for the group of believers in every city, just as I told you to do.
