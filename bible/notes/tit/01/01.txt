\v 1 Dear Titus,
\p This is Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ. I work to help God’s people trust him more. God chose us all to be his people and I work to help them truly know how to live in a way that pleases God.
\v 2 His people can learn how to live like this, because they are confident that God will give them life that never ends. God tells no lies. Even before the world began, he promised to give us everlasting life.
\v 3 Then, at the right time, he made his word plain for all to understand because he trusted me to preach this message. I do this in order to obey the command of God, who saves us.
