\v 1 Dear Titus,
\p This is Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ. I work to help God’s people trust him more. God chose us all to be his people, and I work to help them truly know how to live in a way that pleases God.
\v 2 His people can learn how to live like this, because they are confident that God will give them life that never ends. God tells no lies: even before the world began, he promised to give us everlasting life.
\v 3 Then, at the right time, he made his word plain for all to understand because he trusted me to preach this message. I do this in order to obey the command of God, who saves us.
