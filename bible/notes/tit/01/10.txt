\v 11 \add You and the leaders whom you appoint\add* should prevent such people from teaching \add the believers\add*. They are causing whole families to stop believing in the correct teachings \f + \ft metaphor \f* by means of their teaching \add people wrong ideas\f + \ft Or: teachings \f*. They are teaching people only\add* in order that people will give them money, \add which is very\add* shameful \add for them to do\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 I tell you these things, because there are many people who do not want anyone to control them, especially the people who tell all followers of Christ to become circumcised. What they say has no value. They fool people and persuade them to believe wrong things.
\v 11 You and the leaders whom you appoint should prevent such people from teaching the believers. They have no right to teach what they do. They teach these things so that people will give them money. This is very shameful! They also cause entire families to believe wrong things.

\p
\v 10 For there are many undisciplined people, especially those of the circumcision. Their words are worthless. They deceive and lead people in the wrong direction.
\v 11 It is necessary to stop them. They teach what they should not teach for shameful profit and break up whole families.
