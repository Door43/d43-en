===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Paul continues to warn against the false teachers who have come into the churches.)
  * **One of them**  - "One of the Cretans" or "Someone from the people of Crete"
  * **a wise man of theirs**  - AT: "someone his people thought was a prophet" (UDB).
  * **Cretans are unceasing liars**  - "Cretans are lying all the time" or "Cretans never stop lying." The is an exaggeration. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole|Hyperbole]])
  * **bad and dangerous animals**  - This metaphor compares the Cretans to dangerous beasts. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **lazy bellies**  - "lazy gluttons" or "people who do nothing but eat too much food." This figure of speech uses the image of their stomachs to describe the whole person. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche|Synecdoche]])
  * **So sharply correct them**  - "Therefore tell them strongly that they are wrong"
  * **that they may be sound in the faith**  - "so they will have a healthy faith" or "so they will believe the truth" or "so their faith may be true"
