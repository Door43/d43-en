===== Observations on Writing Your language =====

These questions will give the wider community an understanding of some of the Preliminary Decisions made by the translator for writing the local language in the areas of punctuation, spelling and the writing of names in the Bible.

Q? Does your language have a way of highlighting direct or quoted speech? How do you show it?

A.  (When a language is first written the translator must decide how to indicate certain features of all written languages.  Has the translator satisfactorily thought of these matters?)

Q? What guidelines have you followed for indicating verse numbering, quoted speech and Old Testament quotations?

A.  (Is the style of the national language followed?  What variations have they decided to use to suit their language?)

Q? Have you decided to indicate section headings? Do you use summary statements, topical references or explanatory comments? How does the national language handle section headings?

A.  (Is the translator satisfied with the decisions they have taken?)

Q. What guidelines have you followed in writing names in the Bible? Do you use the names written in the national language Bible? Do you have guidelines from your own language as to how names are pronounced and if they need added titles?

A.  (Has this decision been acceptable to the community?)

Q? Have you taken note of any spelling rules for your language that you would like to share with others, such as where a word changes its form or two words combine?

A.  (Are these rules acceptable to the community?)
