====== Accurate Text ======

When listening to the message of the translation and following the message in the national translation, ask the following questions to see if the translator made an accurate translation:

Q? Was everything mentioned in the translation also mentioned in the flow of the national language version?  (Did the meaning of the translation follow the message (not necessarily the wording) of the national translation? Sometimes if the arrangement of words or the order of ideas is different than in the national translation, it sounds better that way and is still accurate.)

Q? Were the people introduced in each story doing the same things as those mentioned in the national language version?  (Was it easy to see who was doing the events of the translation when it was compared to the national language?)

Q? Are there Key Terms (important words) used in the translation that do not match your understanding of the words in the national version?  (Think about things like this: How do your people talk about a priest (one who sacrifices to God) or a temple (the sacrifice place of the Jews) without using a word borrowed from the national language?)

Q? Are the phrases used in the new translation helpful in understanding the more difficult phrases of the national translation?  (Are the phrases of the new translation put together in a way that brings better understanding and still fit with the meaning of the national language version?)

Added help:

One way to determine if the text is accurate is to ask comprehension questions, such as “who, what, when, where, how and why.”
