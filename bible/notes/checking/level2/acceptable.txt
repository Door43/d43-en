====== Acceptable Alphabet and Spelling ======

These questions will help to determine if an appropriate alphabet has been chosen to represent the sounds of the language and words have been written in a consistent way so that the translation will be easy to read:

Q? Is the alphabet suitable to represent the sounds of the language of the new translation?  (Are there any sounds that make a difference in meaning but have to use the same symbol as another sound? Does this make the words hard to read? Can additional marks be used to show adjust these letters and show the differences?)

Q? Is the spelling used in the book consistent?  (Are there rules that the writer should follow to show how words change in different situations? Can they be described so others will know how to read and write the language easily?)

Q? Did the writer use an appropriate form of the language acceptable to the wider language community?  (Is the writer familiar with the dialects of your language found throughout the area? Has the writer used expressions, phrases, connectors and spellings that will be recognized by a broad section of the language community?)
