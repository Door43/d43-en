==== Clear Text ====

Ask questions like the following to see if the translated message is clear:

Q? Do the words and phrases of the translation make the message understandable? (Are the words confusing, or do they tell you plainly what the translator means?)

Q? Do your community members use the words and expressions found in the translation, or has the translator borrowed many words from the national language? (Is this the way your people talk when they want to say important things in your language?)

Q? Can you read the text easily and understand what the writer might say next? (Is the writer a good story teller who is telling things in an interesting way?)

___

One way to determine if the text is clear is to read a few verses at a time out loud and ask someone listening to retell the story after each section. If the person can easily restate your message, then the writing is clear.
