====== Level 2 Checking (Language Community) ======

Level 2 checking will be done by a wider group of people from the language community. It is assumed that the checkers will be native speakers of the language. The purpose of this level of checking is to verify that a larger group of the target population agrees that the translation is a good one.

The primary questions that the community leaders should ask about the translator are:

  * Is the translator recognized as a qualified local language speaker?
  * Does the translator have adequate national language skills?
  * Is the translator respected in the community as a follower of Christ?

The primary questions that the community leaders should ask about the translation are:

  * Do the words and phrases of the translation make the message clear?
  * When compared verse by verse with the national translation, did the meaning of the translation follow the message (not necessarily the wording) of the national translation?
  * Does the flow of the language of the translation sound natural for the language group?
  * Does the translation include all the events of the book that was translated?
  * Is the translation written at a level and style appropriate for the local audience?
  * Is the alphabet and spelling used in the book appropriate for the wider language community?

Each of these topics are important, and will be further developed below.

==== Translator Qualifications ====

The primary questions that the community leaders should ask about the translator are:

Q? Is the translator recognized as a qualified local language speaker?

A. (Has the translator been living in the local community for much of their life? Do people respect the way the person speaks?)

Q? Does the translator(s) have adequate national language skills?

A. (Would they be asked to translate for a national language speaker to help the community members who do not understand the national language well?)

Q? Is the translator respected in the community as a follower of Christ?

A. (How has this person shown themselves to be committed to Christ as a disciple? Can the fruit of God's Holy Spirit be seen in this person's life?)

==== Clear Text ====

Ask questions like the following to see if the translated message is clear:

Q? Do the words and phrases of the translation make the message understandable?

A. (Are the words confusing, or do they tell you plainly what the translator means?)

Q? Do your community members use the words and expressions found in the translation, or has the translator borrowed many words from the national language?

A. (Is this the way your people talk when they want to say important things in your language?)

Q? Can you read the text easily and understand what the writer might say next?

A. (Is the writer a good story teller who is telling things in an interesting way?)

One way to determine if the text is clear is to read a few verses at a time out loud and ask someone listening to retell the story after each section.  If the person can easily restate your message, then the writing is clear.
