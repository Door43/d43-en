====== Level 2 Checking (Language Community) ======

Level 2 checking will be done by a representative group of people from the language community. It is assumed that the checkers will be native speakers of the local language. The purpose of this level of checking is to verify that a larger group of the local population agrees that the translation is a good one.

[[:en:bible:notes:checking:level2:qualifications|Translator's Qualifications:]] Community leaders should know the following information:

  * Is the translator recognized as a qualified local language speaker?
  * Does the translator have adequate national language skills?
  * Is the translator respected in the community as a follower of Christ?

Community leaders should also study the translation in the following areas:

  * [[:en:bible:notes:checking:level2:clear|Clear:]] Do the words and phrases of the translation make the message clear?
  * [[:en:bible:notes:checking:level2:accurate|Accurate: ]]When compared with the national translation, did the new translation follow the message accurately (not necessarily the same wording or the exact order)?
  * [[:en:bible:notes:checking:level2:natural|Natural:]] Does the flow of the language of the translation sound natural for the language group?
  * [[:en:bible:notes:checking:level2:alltext|All Text:]] Does the translation include all the events of the book that was translated?
  * [[:en:bible:notes:checking:level2:appropriate|Appropriate:]] Is the translation written at a level and style appropriate for the local audience?
  * [[:en:bible:notes:checking:level2:acceptable|Acceptable: ]] Is the alphabet and spelling used in the book acceptable to the wider language community?

Each of these topics are important, and will be further developed by clicking the highlighted words.
