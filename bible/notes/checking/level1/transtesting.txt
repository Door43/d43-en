==== Translation Checking with Comprehension Questions ====

The translators should verify that they have used the comprehension questions that have been developed for each chapter of a book. The translators should use these questions to test whether the translation is clear and that it accurately conveys the meaning of the verses.

When each portion of the translation is ready, it should be presented to local speakers of the language for them to hear or read. Next, the translators should ask the audience the comprehension questions for that portion of the book. This will allow the translators to determine if the meaning of the translation was correctly understood. It is important that the audience NOT have any other translation of the Bible in front of them when they are answering these questions. They need to get their understanding ONLY from the new translation they hear or read.
