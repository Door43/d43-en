\v 7 Now in a place near to where they were, there were some fields that belonged to a man whose name was Publius. He was the chief official on the island. He invited us to come and stay in his home. He took very good care of us for three days.
\v 8 At that time Publius' father had fever and dysentery, and he was lying in bed. So Paul visited him and prayed for him. Then Paul placed his hands on him and healed him.
\v 9 After Paul had done that, the other people on the island who were sick came to him, and he healed them, too.
\v 10 They brought us gifts and showed in other ways that they greatly respected us. When we were ready to leave three months later, they brought us food and other things that we would need on the ship.

\v 7 Now in a nearby place there were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, a man named Publius. He welcomed us and kindly provided for us for three days.
\v 8 It happened that the father of Publius had been made ill with a fever and dysentery. When Paul went to him, he prayed, placed his hands on him, and healed him.
\v 9 After this happened, the rest of the people on the island who were sick also came and were healed.
\v 10 The people also honored us with many honors. When we were preparing to sail, they gave us what we needed.
