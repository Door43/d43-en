\v 16 When we entered Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself with the soldier who was guarding him.
\p
\v 17 Then it came about that after three days Paul called together those men who were the leaders among the Jews. When they had come together, he said to them, "Brothers, although I have done nothing wrong against the people or the customs of our forefathers, I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
\v 18 After they questioned me, they wished to set me free, because there was no reason in me for a death penalty.
