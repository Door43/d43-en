===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **you think about this sect** - "you think about this self-chosen group"
  * **it is spoken against everywhere** - The Jewish people who rejected the gospel message throughout the roman empire were saying bad things about the Way. It was these messages that the Roman Jews were hearing reports from.
