He said, 'Go to this people and say, "By hearing you will hear, but not understand; and seeing you will see, but will not perceive** - This has quotations within quotations. You can translate one of the inner quotations as an indirect quotation as in the UDB. Or, you can translate two of the inner quotations as indirect quotations.

  * **By hearing you will hear ... and seeing you will see** - The words "hear" and "see" are repeated for emphasis. "You will listen carefully ... and you will look intently"
