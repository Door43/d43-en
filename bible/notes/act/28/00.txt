====== Acts 28 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter forms a rather abrupt ending to this historical book because it does not record the deaths of Peter or Paul, or the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem. Many scholars believe that this chapter forms an [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_ellipsis]] which implies that the church is responsible for continuing the story. Other scholars believe it is because Luke died. 

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 28:26-27 to set this apart from the rest of the chapter.

After extensive details of the events of Paul's life, this story glosses over two years in Rome without discussing what happened during this time. It is unknown why this is the case, but apparently the church did not need to learn anything from this time. 

== "You should know that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen" ==
This statement indicates that the Gentiles will become the focus of the plans of God in this world until a time when he will once again bring Israel back to him. From this time on, the church will be composed of more and more by Gentile Christians.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "Letters" ==
The letters mentioned would have been legal papers which authorized the persecution and imprisonment of the Christians. The translator's culture may have different terms for "legal papers" or "legally binding papers," which could be useful in translation.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "He was a god" ==
Just because the people believed this to be does not mean that it was true or that Paul did not correct them for this.
