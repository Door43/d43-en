===== Translation Notes: =====

Paul continues to speak.

  * **they will listen**  - "some of them will listen"
  * **verse 29**  - “And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, having much disputing among themselves.” This verse was omitted because some of the older, more reliable, ancient texts did not include the verse. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_textvariants]])
