\v 28-29 \add That is what God said to the prophet Isaiah about our ancestors. But you Jews today do not want to believe God's message\add*. Therefore, I am telling you that \add God\add* has sent to the non-Jews this message about how he saves people, and they will listen \add and accept it\add*!"

<usfm>
\v 28 Therefore, you should know that God is offering to save the non-Jews, and they will listen."
\v 29 \f + \ft Acts 28:29 - the oldest and most accurate ancient copies of the book of Acts do not include the additional words found in Acts 28:29; and for that reason they are not included here. \f*
