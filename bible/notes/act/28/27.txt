====== Acts 28:27 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 27 God also said to the prophet,
\q These people do not understand, because they have become stubborn.
\q They have ears, but they do not understand what they hear,
\q and they have closed their eyes \add because they do not want to see\add*.
\q If they wanted to obey what I say to them, they might understand with their hearts what they see \add me doing\add* and what they hear \add me saying\add*.
\q Then they might turn from their sinful behavior and I would save them.'
\p
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 27 
\q These people do not understand, because they have become stubborn.
\q their ears are almost deaf; 
\q and they have closed their eyes because they do not want to see.
\q They do not want to hear with their ears
\q or understand with their hearts,
\q for then they would come back to me
\q and I would heal them.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 27 For the heart of this people has become dull,
\q Their ears have heard with difficulty,
\q They have shut their eyes;
\q Lest they might perceive with their eyes,
\q And hear with their ears,
\q And understand with their heart,
\q And turn again,
\q And I would heal them."'
