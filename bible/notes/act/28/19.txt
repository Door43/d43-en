\v 19 But when the Jewish leaders there spoke against the desire of the Romans to set me free, I had to request that the Emperor judge me here in Rome. But my reason for doing that was not that I wanted to accuse our leaders about anything.
\v 20 So I have requested you to come here so that I can tell you why I am a prisoner. It is because I believe in what the people of Israel confidently expect God will do for us."
