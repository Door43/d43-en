\v 19 But when the Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* there opposed \add what the Roman authorities wanted to do\add*, I had to formally request that the Emperor \add judge me here in Rome\add*. But my reason for doing that was not that I wanted to accuse our leaders about anything.
\v 20 So I have requested you \add to come\add* here so that I can tell you why I am a prisoner. It is because I believe in \f + \ft metonymy \f* our Messiah, the one \add God long ago promised to send\add* to us\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* Jews."

\v 19 But when the Jewish leaders there spoke against the desire of the Romans to set me free, I had to request that the Emperor judge me here in Rome. But my reason for doing that was not that I wanted to accuse our leaders about anything.
\v 20 So I have requested you to come here so that I can tell you why I am a prisoner. It is because I believe in what the people of Israel confidently expect God will do for us."

\v 19 But when the Jews spoke against their desire, I was forced to appeal to Caesar, although it is not as if I were bringing any accusation against my nation.
\v 20 Because of my appeal, then, I have asked to see you and to speak with you. It is because of what Israel is confident about that I am bound with this chain."
