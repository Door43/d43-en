\v 7 Then I heard God \f + \ft metonymy \f* commanding me, 'Peter, rise up, kill \add some of these\add*, and \add cook and\add* eat \add their meat\add*!'
\v 8 But I replied, 'Lord, \add you\f + \ft singular \f*\add* surely do not \add really want me to do that\add*, because I have never eaten \f + \ft metonymy \f* meat \add from any animal\add* that \add our laws say\add* that we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* must not eat \f + \ft synecdoche \f*!'
\v 9 God spoke from heaven \add to me\add* a second time, '\add I am\add* God, \add so\add* if I have made something acceptable \add to eat\add*, do not say that it is not acceptable \add to eat\add*!'
\v 10 Then \add after that happened three times, the sheet with\add* all \add those animals and birds\add* was pulled up into heaven again."

\v 7 Then I heard God commanding me, 'Peter, get up, kill and eat them!'
\v 8 But I replied, 'Lord, you surely do not really want me to do that, because I have never eaten anything that our laws say that we must not eat!'
\v 9 God spoke from heaven to me a second time, 'I am God, so if I have made something acceptable to eat, do not say it is unacceptable.'
\v 10 This same thing happened two more times, and then the sheet with all those animals and birds was pulled up into heaven again.

\v 7 Then I heard  a voice say to me, "Get up, Peter; kill and eat!"
\v 8 I said, "Not so, Lord: for nothing unholy or unclean has ever entered into my mouth."
\v 9 But the voice answered again from heaven, "What God has declared clean do not call unclean."
\v 10 This happened three times, and then everything was taken back up into heaven again.
