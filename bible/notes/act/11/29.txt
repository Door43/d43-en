  * **So** - This word means marks an event that happened because of something else that happened first. In this case, they sent money because of Agabus' prophesy or the famine.
  * **as each one was able** - The richer people sent more; the poorer people sent less.
  * **the brothers in Judea** - "the believers in Judea"
  * **by the hand of Barnabas and Saul** - The hand is a synecdoche for the action of the whole person. AT: "by having Barnabas and Saul take to them"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
