\v 11 At that exact moment, three men who had been sent from Caesarea arrived at the house where I was staying.
\v 12 God's Spirit told me that I should not hesitate to go with them even though they were not Jews. Six Jewish believers also went with me to Caesarea, and then we went into that non-Jewish man's house.
\v 13 He told us that he had seen an angel standing in his house. The angel told him, 'Tell some men to go to Joppa and bring back Simon whose other name is Peter.
\v 14 He will tell you how you and everyone else in your house will be saved.'

\v 11 Behold, right away there were three men standing in front of the house where we were; they had been sent from Caesarea to me.
\v 12 The Spirit commanded me go with them, and that I should make no distinction regarding them. These six brothers went with me, and we went into the man’s house.
\v 13 He told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying, "Send men to Joppa and bring back Simon, whose other name is Peter.
\v 14 He will speak to you a message by which you will be saved--you and all your household."
