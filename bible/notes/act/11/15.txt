  * (Peter continues to speak.)
  * **the Holy Spirit came on them, just as on us in the beginning**  - "the Holy Spirit came on the Gentile believers, just as he came on the Jewish believers at Pentecost"
  * **On us in the beginning**  - “us” refers to Peter and those Jewish believers who were there in the beginning, but not everyone in the room was there in the beginning. If your language must decide, use the exclusive form. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive|Exclusive]])
  * **in the beginning**  - Peter is referring to the day of Pentecost.
  * **you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit**  - "God will baptize you in the Holy Spirit". (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
