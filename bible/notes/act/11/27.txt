===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Now in these days**  - This introduces a new part of the story. (see: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background|Writing Styles - Background Information]])
  * **came down from Jerusalem to Antioch **  - There was an elevation change from Jerusalem to Antioch. There is also an idea of Jerusalem, especially the Temple, being at the height of importance. Regardless of elevation, people always go up to Jerusalem and up to the Temple, and down when going away.
  * **a great famine would occur**  - "a great shortage of food would occur"
  * **over all the world**  - This probably refers to the entire Roman empire. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole|Hyperbole]])
