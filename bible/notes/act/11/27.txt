===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Now in these days**  - This introduces a new part of the story (see:  [[:en:ta:discourse:background]])
  * **came down from Jerusalem to Antioch ** - there was an elevation change from Jerusalem to Antioch. There is also an idea of Jerusalem, especially the Temple, being at the height of importance. Regardless of elevation, people always go up to the Jerusalem and up to the Temple, and down when going away.
  * **over all the world**  - (See hyperbole.) This probably refers to the entire Roman empire.
