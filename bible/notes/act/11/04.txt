\v 4 But Peter started to explain the matter to them in detail; he said,
\v 5 I was praying in the city of Joppa, and in a trance I saw a vision of a container coming down, like a large sheet let down from heaven by its four corners; it descended to me
\v 6 I gazed at it and I thought about it; I saw the four-legged animals of earth, wild beasts, creeping animals, and birds of the sky.
