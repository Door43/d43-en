\v 4 So Peter began to explain exactly \add what had happened concerning Cornelius\add*.
\v 5 He said, "I was praying \add by myself\add* in Joppa \add town\add* and in a trance I saw a vision. I saw that something like a large sheet was being lowered from heaven. \add It was tied with ropes\add* at its four corners, and it came down to where I was.
\v 6 As I was looking intently into it, I saw some tame animals \add but also animals that our laws forbid us to eat, including\add* wild animals, snakes, and wild birds.

\v 4 But Peter started to explain the matter to them in detail; he said,
\v 5 I was praying in the city of Joppa, and I had a vision of a container coming down, like a large sheet let down from heaven by its four corners. It descended to me.
\v 6 I gazed at it and I thought about it. I saw the four-legged animals of earth, wild beasts, creeping animals, and birds of the sky.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Peter responds to the Jews by telling them about his vision and about what had happened at Cornelius' house.

  * **Peter started to explain** - Peter did not criticize the Jewish believers but reacted in a friendly explanatory manner.
  * **in detail** - "exactly what happened" 
  * **like a large sheet** - The container holding the animals had the appearance of a large square piece of cloth. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:act:10:09|10:11]].
  * **by its four corners** - "with its four corners suspended" or "with its four corners higher than the rest of it." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:act:10:09|10:11]].
  * **four-legged animals of earth** - From Peter's response, it can be implied that the law of Moses commanded the Jews not to eat some of them. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:act:10:09|10:12]]. AT: "animals and birds that the Mosaic laws forbade Jews to eat" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **wild beasts** - This probably refer to the animals people do not or can not tame or control.
  * **creeping animals** - These are reptiles.
