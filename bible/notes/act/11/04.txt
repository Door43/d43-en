\v 4 So Peter began to explain exactly \add what had happened concerning Cornelius\add*.
\v 5 He said, "I was praying \add by myself\add* in Joppa \add town\add* and in a trance I saw a vision. I saw that something like a large sheet was being lowered from heaven. \add It was tied with ropes\add* at its four corners, and it came down to where I was.

\v 4 But Peter started to explain the matter to them in detail; he said,
\v 5 I was praying in the city of Joppa, and in a trance I saw a vision of a container coming down, like a large sheet let down from heaven by its four corners; it descended to me
\v 6 I gazed at it and I thought about it; I saw the four-legged animals of earth, wild beasts, creeping animals, and birds of the sky.
