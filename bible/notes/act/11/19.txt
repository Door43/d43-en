\v 19 Therefore the believers whom the suffering that began with Stephen's death scattered away from Jerusalem--these believers went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch. They told the message about Jesus only to Jews, to no one else. 
\v 20 But some of them, men from Cyprus and Cyrene came to Antioch and spoke to Greeks also and preached the Lord Jesus.
\v 21 And the hand of the Lord was with them; a great number believed and turned to the Lord.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Therefore the believers whom the suffering that began with Stephen's death scattered away from Jerusalem** - This is a summary from Acts 8 to introduce a new episode not related to the previous story of Peter.
  * **the believers whom the suffering that began with Stephen's death scattered away from Jerusalem** - "Many believers began suffering after the Jewish leaders killed Stephen. These believers left Jerusalem and went to other places…"
  * **only to Jews, to no one else** - They thought that God's message was only for the Jewish people, not the Gentiles (Greeks).
  * ** the hand of the Lord**  - This is an expression for "God was powerfully enabling". (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:metonymy]])
