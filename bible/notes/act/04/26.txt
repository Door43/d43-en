===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The believers complete their quotation from King David in the Psalms that they began in [[:en:bible:notes:act:04:23|4:25]].

  * **The kings of the earth set themselves together, and the rulers gathered together against the Lord** - These two lines mean basically the same thing. The two lines emphasize the combined effort of the earth's rulers to oppose God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **set themselves together ... gathered together** - These two phrases mean that they joined their armies together to fight a battle. AT: "set their armies together ... gathered their troops together" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **against the Lord, and against his Christ** - Here the word "Lord" refers to God. In the Psalms, the word "Christ" refers to the Messiah or God's anointed one.
