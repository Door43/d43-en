\v 15 The Jewish leaders told guards to take Peter, John, and the healed man outside of the room where they were meeting. After they did so, the leaders talked with each other about Peter and John.
\v 16 They said, "There is nothing that we can do to punish these two men! Everyone who is living in Jerusalem knows that they have done an amazing miracle, so we cannot tell people that it did not happen!
\v 17 However, we must not allow other people to hear what they have been teaching about this Jesus. So we must tell these men that we will punish them if they continue to tell other people about the one who they say gave them the power to heal this man."
\v 18 So the Jewish leaders told the guards to bring the two apostles into the room again. After the guards had done so, they told them both that they should no longer speak or teach about Jesus to anyone.

\v 15 But after they had commanded the apostles to leave the council meeting, they talked among themselves.
\v 16 They said, "What shall we do to these men? For the fact that a remarkable miracle has been done through them is known to everyone who lives in Jerusalem; we cannot deny it.
\v 17 But in order that it spreads no further among the people, let us warn them not to speak anymore to anyone in this name."
\v 18 They called Peter and John in and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.
