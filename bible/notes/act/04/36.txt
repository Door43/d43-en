===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Luke introduces Barnabas into the story. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_participants]])

  * **Joseph ... was given the name Barnabas by the apostles** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "The apostles gave Joseph ... the name Barnabas" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **which means son of encouragement** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Son of Encouragement was another name for Barabas"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Son of Encouragement** - The apostles used this to show that Joseph was a person who encouraged others. It is used as though encouragement were a person, Joseph's father. The literal meaning of "Barnabas" is difficult to translate as "son of encouragement" and may be more a description of Barnabas.  AT: "a person who always encourages others" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **laid it at the apostles' feet** - This means that they presented to money to the apostles. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:act:04:34|4:35]]. AT: "presented it to the apostles" or "gave it to the apostles" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
