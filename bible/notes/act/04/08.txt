\v 8 So as the Holy Spirit completely controlled Peter, he said to them, "You \add fellow Israelites\add* who rule us and \add all of you other\add* elders, \add listen\add*!
\v 9 Today you are questioning us concerning our performing a good deed for a man who was crippled, and you asked us how he became healed.
\v 10 So \add we\f + \ft exclusive \f* want\add* you and all \add of our other\add* fellow Israelites to know this: It is because Jesus the Messiah \f + \ft metonymy \f* from Nazareth healed him that this man is able to stand before you. \add God considers that\add* it was you who nailed Jesus to a cross, but God caused him to become alive again.

\v 8 As the Holy Spirit gave Peter power, Peter said to them, "You fellow Israelites who rule us, and all of you other elders, listen to me!
\v 9 Today you are questioning us about a good deed we did for a man who could not walk, and you ask us how he became healed. So let me tell you and all other Israelites this:
\v 10 It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth that this man was healed, so that he is now able to stand before you. It was you who nailed Jesus to a cross and killed him, but God caused him to become alive again.

\v 8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "You rulers of the people, and elders,
\v 9 if we this day are being questioned concerning a good deed done to a sick man, by what means was this man made well?
\v 10 May this be known to you all and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands here before you healthy.
