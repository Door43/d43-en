\v 1 Meanwhile, there were some priests in the temple courtyard. There was also the officer in charge of the temple guard, and some members of the Sadducee group. All these men came to Peter and John while the two of them were speaking to the people.
\v 2 These men were very angry because the two apostles were teaching the people about Jesus. What they were telling them was that God caused Jesus to become alive again after he had been killed.
\v 3 So these men arrested Peter and John and put them in jail. The Jewish council had to wait until the next day to question Peter and John, because it was already evening.
\v 4 However, many people who had heard Peter speak put their faith in Jesus.  The number of men who believed in Jesus increased to about five thousand.

\v 3 They arrested them and put them in jail until the next morning, since  it was now evening.
\v 4 But many of the people who had heard the message believed; and the number of the men who believed was about five thousand.
