\v 11 Jesus Christ of Nazareth is the one of whom the Scriptures speak:

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Peter competes his speech to the Jewish religious rulers that he began in [[:en:bible:notes:act:04:08|4:8]].

  * **Jesus Christ is the stone...which has been made the head cornerstone** - Peter is quoting from the Psalms. This is a metaphor that means the religious leaders, like builders, rejected Jesus, but God will made him the most important in his kingdom, like the cornerstone in a building. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you as builders despised** - "you as builders rejected as no good" 
  * **There is no salvation in any other person** - This can be stated positively. AT: "He is the only person who is able to save." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **no other name under heaven, that is given among men, by which** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "no other name under heaven that God has given among men, by which." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **no other name under heaven, that is given among men, by which** - The phrase "name...that is given among men" refers to the person of Jesus. AT: "no other person under heaven, by whom." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **under heaven** - This is a way of referring to everywhere in the world. AT: "in the world" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **by which we must be saved** - Here the word "we" refers to Peter as well as those to whom he is speaking. This can be stated in active form. AT: "which can save us" or "who can save us." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
