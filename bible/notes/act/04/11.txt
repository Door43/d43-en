<usfm>
\v 11 Jesus Christ of Nazareth is the one of whom the Scriptures speak: 
\q "The stone that the builders threw away has become the most important stone in the building."
\v 12 Only Jesus can save us, for God has given no other man in the world to us who can save us from the guilt of our sins!"

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 Jesus Christ is the stone which you as builders despised but which has been made the head cornerstone.
\v 12 In no other person is there salvation: for there is no other name under heaven, that is given among men, by which we must be saved."

===== Translation Notes: =====

Peter continues his speech to the Jewish religious rulers that he began in [[:en:bible:notes:act:04:08|4:8]].

  * **Jesus Christ is the stone**- This is a simile. As only one cornerstone is set for the foundation and reference point of a building, Jesus is the only foundation for Salvation.
