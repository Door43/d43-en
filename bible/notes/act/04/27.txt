  * **Connecting Statement:** - The believers continue their prayer.

  * **in this city** - This refers to Jerusalem.
  * **to do all that your hand and your desire decided** - Here the word "hand" is metonymy for God's power. Additionally, the phrase "your hand and your desire decided" is synecdoche for God deciding according to his power and plan. AT: "to do all that you had decided because you are powerful and had planned." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
