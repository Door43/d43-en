\v 5 So Peter was kept in the prison, but prayer was made earnestly by the assembly to God for him.
\v 6 The day before Herod was going to bring him out, that night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains; and guards in front of the door were watching over the prison.
 10 When they were past the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city, which opened to them by itself. They went out, and went down one street, and immediately the angel departed from him.
