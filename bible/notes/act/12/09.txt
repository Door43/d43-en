\v 9 So Peter followed the angel and went out. He did not know that what was done by the angel was real. He thought he was seeing a vision.
\v 10 After they had passed by the first guard and the second, they came to the iron gate that led into the city; it opened for them by itself. They went out and went down a street, and the angel left him right away.
