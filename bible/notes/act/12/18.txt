\v 18 Now when it became day, there was no small excitement among the soldiers, regarding what had happened to Peter.
\v 19 After Herod had searched for him and could not find him, he questioned the guards and ordered them to be put to
death. Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there.

 \v 21 On an appointed day, Herod dressed himself in royal clothing, sat on the throne, and gave a speech to them. 
 \v 22 The people shouted, “The voice of a god, and not of a man!” 
 \v 23 Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him, because he didn’t give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and died.
