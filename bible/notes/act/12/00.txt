====== Acts 12 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

== "This is the voice of a god, not of a man!" ==
Acts 12:20-22 can appear out-of-place in this chapter. It serves as a kind of interlude, interrupting the flow of events. It is included here to explain that this powerful man, who people claimed to be God, was not God and was immediately punished for these false claims. When the apostles claimed Jesus was God, they were affirmed by signs from heaven. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Personification ==
The "word of God" is personified as growing and multiplying. This is common in Scripture because the word is always used with the imagery of being alive. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:wordofgod|Word of God]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification|personified]])
