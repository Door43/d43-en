===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **when they arrived** - "When Paul and Barnabas arrived"
  * **God had done with them** - "God had done through Paul and Barnabas"
  * **How he had** - "How God had"
  * **he had opened a door of faith for the gentiles** - This metaphor can be translated as “God had made a way for the gentiles to believe,” or “God had made it possible for the gentiles to believe” or “God had given the Gentiles the opportunity to believe.” Just as a person cannot go through a closed door unless someone opens it, the gentiles could not have faith in God unless God made it possible. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
  * **They stayed** - "Paul and Barnabas stayed"
