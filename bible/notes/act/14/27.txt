===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **When they arrived** - "When Paul and Barnabas arrived"
  * **God had done with them** - "God had done through Paul and Barnabas"
  * **how he had** - "How God had"
  * **he had opened a door of faith for the Gentiles** - This metaphor can be translated as "God had made a way for the Gentiles to believe," or "God had made it possible for the Gentiles to believe" or "God had given the Gentiles the opportunity to believe." Just as a person cannot go through a closed door unless someone opens it, the Gentiles could not have faith in God unless God made it possible. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **They stayed** - "Paul and Barnabas stayed"
  * **disciples** - Anyone who obeys and follows Jesus is a disciple of Jesus.
