\v 8 In Lystra, a man was sitting there who was crippled in his legs. When his mother gave birth to him, he had crippled legs, so he was never able to walk.
\v 9 He listened as Paul was speaking about the Lord Jesus. Paul looked directly at him and could see in the man's face that he believed that the Lord Jesus could make him well.
\v 10 So with a loud voice, Paul called out to him, "Stand up!" When the man heard that, he immediately jumped up and began to walk around.

\v 8 At Lystra a certain man sat, powerless in his feet, a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked.
\v 9 This man heard Paul speaking. Paul fixed his eyes on him and saw that he had faith to be made well.
\v 10 So he said to him in a loud voice, "Stand up on your feet." And the man jumped up and walked around.
