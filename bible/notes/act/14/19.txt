===== translationNotes: =====

  * **persuaded the crowds** - It my be helpful to explicitly state what they persuaded the crowd to do. AT: "persuaded the people not to believe Paul and Barnabas, and to turn against them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

  * **thinking that he was dead** - "because they thought that he was already dead"
  * **the disciples** - These were new believers in the city of Lystra.
  * **he got up ... he went** - This refers to Paul.
