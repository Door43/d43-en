\v 26 When he had come to Jerusalem, Saul attempted to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he is a disciple.
\v 27 But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. And he told them how Saul had seen the Lord on the road and that the Lord had spoken to him, and how at Damascus Saul had boldly preached in the name of Jesus.
