===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Right away he began to preach** - "he" refers to Saul
  * **saying that he is the Son of God** - "he" here refers to Jesus.
  * **All who heard him ** - This is a hyperbole for "many who heard". If you express exaggeration differently then use your form. (See: [[en:ta:translate:hyperbole]])
  * **Is not this the man who destroyed those in Jerusalem who called on this name?** - This is a rhetorical and negative question that is emphasizing Saul was indeed the man who was persecuting the believers.
