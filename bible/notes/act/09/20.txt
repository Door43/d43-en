\v 20 Right away he began to preach about Jesus in the Jewish synagogues. He told them that Jesus is the Son of God.
\v 21 All the people who heard him preach were amazed.  Some of them were saying, "We can hardly believe that this is the same man who pursued the believers in Jerusalem and who has come here to take them as prisoners to the chief priests in Jerusalem!"
\v 22 But God enabled Saul to preach to many people even more convincingly. He was proving from the scriptures that Jesus is the Christ. So the Jewish leaders in Damascus could not think how to disprove what he said.

\v 20 Right away he proclaimed Jesus in the synagogues, saying that he is the Son of God.
\v 21 All who heard him were amazed and said, "Is not this the man who destroyed those in Jerusalem who called on this name? And he has come here in order to bring them bound to the chief priests."
\v 22 But Saul was empowered to preach and confuse the Jews that lived at Damascus by proving that this Jesus is the Christ.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Right away he proclaimed Jesus** - "He" refers to Saul.
  * **saying that he is the Son of God** - "He" refers to Jesus. Saul, soon after believing Jesus, proclaims Jesus as "the Son of God."
  * **Son of God** - This is an important title for Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **All who heard him** - This is a hyperbole for "many who heard." If you express exaggeration differently then use your form. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **Is not this the man who destroyed those in Jerusalem who called on this name?** - This is a rhetorical and negative question that is emphasizing Saul was indeed the man who was persecuting the believers. AT: "This is the man who destroyed those in Jerusalem who called on this name Jesus!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
