\v 20 Right away he began to preach about Jesus in the Jewish synagogues. He told them that Jesus is the Son of God.
\v 21 All the people who heard him preach were amazed. Some of them were saying, "We can hardly believe that this is the same man who pursued the believers in Jerusalem and who has come here to take them as prisoners to the chief priests in Jerusalem!"
\v 22 But God enabled Saul to preach to many people even more convincingly. He was proving from the scriptures that Jesus is the Christ. So the Jewish leaders in Damascus could not think how to disprove what he said.

\v 20 Right away he proclaimed Jesus in the synagogues, saying that he is the Son of God.
\v 21 All who heard him were amazed and said, "Is not this the man who destroyed those in Jerusalem who called on this name? And he has come here in order to bring them bound to the chief priests."
\v 22 But Saul became more and more powerful, and he was causing distress among the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Christ.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Here only the second "he" refers to Jesus, the Son of God. The first "he" and the other ones refer to Saul.

  * **Son of God** - This is an important title for Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **All who heard him** - This is a hyperbole for "Many who heard." If you express exaggeration differently, then use your form. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **Is not this the man who destroyed those in Jerusalem who called on this name?** - This is a rhetorical and negative question that emphasizes that Saul was indeed the man who had persecuted the believers. AT: "This is the man who destroyed those in Jerusalem who called on this name Jesus!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **this name** - Here "name" refers to Jesus. AT: "the name of Jesus" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **causing distress among the Jews** - They were distressed in the sense that they could not find a way to refute Saul's arguments that Jesus was the Christ.
