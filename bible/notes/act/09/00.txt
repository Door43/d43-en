====== Acts 09 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== The Way ==
This was apparently a name given to people who were Christians in the early church. 

== "Letters for the synagogues in Damascus" ==
The letters Paul asked for would have been legal papers, which authorized the persecution and imprisonment of the Christians. The translator's culture may have different terms for "legal papers" or "legally binding papers," which could be useful in translation.


=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "I am Jesus" ==
The text does not make it explicitly clear, but this is Jesus in bodily form (physically present) after he was raised from the dead. He was only visible to Saul.
