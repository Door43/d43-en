===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **"Lord, who are you?** - Saul had not yet come to know Jesus as the Lord. This was a matter of acknowledging that he was in the presence of a greater supernatural power.
     * **but rise, enter into the city...** - "get up and go into the city Damascus..."
   * **it will be told you**  - someone will tell you
    * **you...you...you**  - These are all singular.
    * **but seeing no one**  - Only Saul experienced the light.
