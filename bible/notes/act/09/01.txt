\v 1 But Saul, still speaking threats even of murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest
\v 2 and asked him for letters for the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any who belonged to the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **But Saul**  - The story changes from Philip to Saul. AT: "Meanwhile, Saul" (UDB).
  * **still speaking threats even of murder against the disciples**  - The noun "murder" can be translated as a verb: "still speaking threats, even to murder the disciples." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns|Abstract Nouns]])
  * **disciple**  - Anyone who believes in Jesus and obeys his teachings is called a disciple of Jesus.
  * **asked him for letters**  - "asked the high priest for letters of support"
  * **if he found…he might bring**  - The word 'he' refers to Saul.
  * **who belonged to the Way**  - "who followed the teachings of Jesus Christ"
  * **he might bring them bound to Jerusalem**  - "he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem". Paul's purpose can be made clear by adding "so that the Jewish leaders could judge and punish them" (UDB). (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Explicit and Implicit]])
