\v 19 But I said to him, 'Lord, they know that I went to many of our synagogues looking for people who believe in you. I was putting in jail those whom I found who believed in you, and I was even beating them.
\v 20 They remember that when Stephen was killed because he told people about you, I stood there watching and approving of what they were doing. I even guarded the outer clothes that those who were murdering him had thrown aside!'
\v 21 But the Lord said to me, 'No, do not stay here! Leave Jerusalem, because I am going to send you far away from here to other people groups, the non-Jews!'"

\v 19 I said, 'Lord, they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat those who believed in you in every synagogue.
\v 20 When the blood of Stephen your witness was spilled, I also was standing by and agreeing, and I was guarding the clothings of those who killed him.'
\v 21 But he said to me, 'Leave, because I will send you away to the Gentiles.'"
