\v 22 The people allowed him to speak up to this point. But then they shouted and said, "Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not right that he should live."

\v 24 the chief captain commanded Paul to be brought into the fortress. He ordered that he should be  questioned with scourging, so  that he himself might know why they were shouting against him like that.
