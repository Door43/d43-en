\v 22 They listened to him until he said this. Then they shouted and said, "Away with such a fellow from the earth, for it is not right that he should live."
\v 23 As they were shouting, throwing off their cloaks, and throwing dust into the air,
\v 24 the chief captain commanded Paul to be brought into the fortress. He ordered that he should be questioned with scourging, so that he himself might know why they were shouting against him like that.
