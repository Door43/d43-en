\v 3 "I am a Jew, as are all of you. I was born in Tarsus city, in Cilicia province, but I grew up here in Jerusalem. When I was young, I learned the laws that Moses gave to our ancestors. Gamaliel was my teacher. I obeyed those laws because I have wanted to obey God, and I am sure that all of you also obey those laws.
\v 4 That is why I tried to arrest those who believed the message of God about Jesus. I looked for ways to kill them. Whenever I found men or women who believed the message, I had them thrown into jail.
\v 5 The high priest knows this, and so do the other men who belong to our Jewish Council. They gave me letters to take to their fellow Jews in Damascus city. Those letters gave me power to go there and arrest people who believed in Jesus. I was then to take them as prisoners to Jerusalem, so that they would be punished here.

\v 3 "I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but educated in this city at the feet of Gamaliel. I was instructed according to the
strict ways of the law of our forefathers. I am zealous for God, just as all of you are today.
\v 4 I persecuted this Way to the death; I tied up both men and women and delivered them into prison .
\v 5 Also the high priest and all the elders can bear witness that I received letters from them for the brothers in Damascus, for me to journey there.   I was to bring back  in bonds to Jerusalem those of this way to be punished.
