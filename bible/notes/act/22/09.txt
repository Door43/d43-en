\v 9 Those who were with me saw the light, but they did not understand the voice of him who spoke to me.
\v 10 I said, 'What should I do, Lord?' The Lord said to me, 'Arise and go into Damascus; there you will be told everything that you must do.'
\v 11 I could not see because of that light's brightness, and being led by the hands of those who were with me, I came into Damascus.
