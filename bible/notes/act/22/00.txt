====== Acts 22 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This is the second account of Paul's conversion in the book of Acts. Because this is such an important event in the early church, there are three accounts of Paul's conversion. (See: Acts [[:en:bible:notes:act:09:01|9]] and [[:en:bible:notes:act:26:01|26]]).

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "In the Hebrew language" ==
The Hebrew language was not commonly spoken in Israel at this time. People would have spoken Aramaic and Greek. Typically, it was the educated Jewish scholars who were able to speak Hebrew. This is why the people paid attention when Paul started speaking in Hebrew. 

== "The Way" ==

This was apparently a name given to people who were Christians in the early church.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "I am Jesus" ==

The text does not make it explicitly clear, but this is Jesus after he was raised from the dead. He was only visible to Saul. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

== Roman citizenship ==

Men who had Roman citizenship were given many privileges. For example, they could appeal to Caesar if they were accused of a crime. Having Roman citizen was very valuable and people would go to great lengths to attain citizenship. This "chief captain" could have gotten into trouble for treating a Roman citizen in this way.
