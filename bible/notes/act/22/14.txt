\v 14 Then he said, 'The God of our forefathers has chosen you to know his will, to see the Righteous One, and to hear the voice coming from his own mouth.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Paul continues to speak.

  * **Then he said** - "Then Ananias said"
  * **his will** - "what God is planning and will cause to happen"
  * **why are you waiting?** - Alternate translation: "Do not wait!" or "Do not delay!" (UDB). This is a rhetorical question used to exhort Paul to be baptized.  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **wash away your sins** -As washing one's body removes dirt, calling on the name of Jesus for forgiveness cleanses one's inner being from sin. "ask forgiveness for your sins." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
