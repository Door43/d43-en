\v 14 Then he said, 'The God of our forefathers has chosen you to know his will, to see the Righteous One, and to hear the voice coming from his own mouth.
\v 15 For you shall be a witness for him to all men about what you have seen and heard.
\v 16 And now why are you waiting? Arise, be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on his name.'

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Paul continues to speak.)
  * **Then he said**  - "Then Ananias said"
  * **his will**  - "what God is planning and will cause to happen"
  * **why are you waiting?**  - Alternate translation: "Do not wait!" or "Do not delay!" (UDB). This is a rhetorical question used to rebuke Paul for inaction.  (See: rhetorical question)
  * **wash away your sins**  - Alternate translation: "ask forgiveness for your sins." This is a metaphor. Similar to washing a garment, calling on the name of Jesus cleanses a person's heart from sin. Baptism symbolizes this washing of sins. (see UDB) (See metaphor)
