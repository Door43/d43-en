===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul finishes telling what had happened to him in Damascus. He quotes what Ananias said to him. This is still part of his speech to the crowd in Jerusalem.
  * **General Information:** - The word "he" refers to Ananias. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:act:22:12|22:12]])

  * **his will** - "what God is planning and will cause to happen"
  * **to hear the voice coming from his own mouth** - Both "voice" and "mouth" refer to the one speaking. AT: "to hear him speak directly to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **to all men** - Here "men" means all people whether male or female. AT: "to all people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_gendernotations|When Masculine Words Include Women]])
  * **Now** - Here "now" does not mean "at this moment," but is used to draw attention to the important point that follows.

  * **be baptized** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "let me baptize you" or "receive baptism" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **wash away your sins** - As washing one's body removes dirt, calling on the name of Jesus for forgiveness cleanses one's inner being from sin. AT: "ask forgiveness for your sins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **calling on his name** - Here "name" refers to the Lord. AT: "calling on the Lord" or "trusting in the Lord"
