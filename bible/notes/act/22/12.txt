===== Translation Notes: =====

Paul continues to speak to the Jewish crowd on the fortress steps.

  * **devout man according to the law**  - Ananias was very serious about following God's law.
  * **well spoken of**  - "with a good reputation among others"
  * **In that very hour**  - "at that instant" or "instantly". This is an idiom which means something happens immediately. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom|Idiom]])
