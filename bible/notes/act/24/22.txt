\v 22 Felix was well informed about the Way, and so he made the Jews wait. He said, "Whenever Lusias the commander comes down from Jerusalem I will decide your case.”
\v 23 Then he commanded the centurion to guard Paul, but to have leniency, and that no one should stop his friends from helping him or from visiting him.
