\v 22 Felix already knew much about what people called the Way, and so he stopped the trial. He said to them, "Later, when Commander Lysias comes down here, I will decide this case."
\v 23 Then he told the officer who was guarding Paul to take Paul back to the prison and make sure that Paul was guarded all the time. But he said that Paul was not to be chained, and if his friends came to visit him, the officer should allow them to help Paul in any way that they wanted to.

\v 22 Felix was well informed about the Way, and so he ajourned the hearing. He said, "Whenever Lysias the commander comes down from Jerusalem, I will decide your case."
\v 23 Then he commanded the centurion to guard Paul, but to have leniency, and that no one should stop his friends from helping him or from visiting him.
