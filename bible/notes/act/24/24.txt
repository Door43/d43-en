\v 24 Several days later Felix came back with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jew, and called for Paul to speak with him. Felix listened to what Paul said to him about trusting in Jesus Christ.
\v 25 Paul talked to him about what God wants people to do in order to please him. He also explained how people should control how they act and that there would be a time when God will judge all people. Felix became afraid after hearing those things, so he said to Paul, "That is all I want to hear now. When I have time, I will ask you to come to me again."

\v 24 After some days, Felix returned with Druscilla his wife, a Jewess, and he sent for Paul and he heard from him about faith in Christ Jesus.
\v 25 But when Paul reasoned with him about righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became fearful; and, he answered, "Go away for the present, but when I have time again, I will call you."
