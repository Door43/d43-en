\v 4 So that I detain you no more, I ask you to briefly listen to me with kindness.
\v 5 For we have found this man to be a pest and one who causes all the Jews throughout the world to rebel. He is a leader of the Nazarene sect.
\v 6 \f + \ft Acts 24:6-8, the later and less reliable manuscripts add some material to verse 6, not included here; and the addition of material that in older translations was published as verse 7 (see the note on Acts 24:7), also not supported by the best manuscripts, and is not included here. In this set of unsupported readings that was also a short addition to verse 8, which also is not included. These are notes for reference. \f* He even tried to desecrate the temple; so we arrested him.
