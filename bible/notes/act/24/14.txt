\v 14 But I admit to you that this is true: I do worship the God that our ancestors worshiped. It is true that I follow the way that Jesus taught us. I also believe everything that Moses wrote in the laws that God gave him and everything that the other prophets wrote in their books.
\v 15 I believe, just like these men also believe, that some day God will cause everyone who has died to become alive again, both those who were good and those who were wicked.
\v 16 Because I believe that day will come, I always try to do what pleases God and what other people think is right.

\v 14 But I admit this to you, that according to the way that they call a sect, in that same way I serve the God of our fathers. I am faithful to all that is in the law and the writings of the prophets.
\v 15 I have the same confidence in God, just as these men also wait for it, the coming resurrection of the dead, of both the righteous ones and the unrighteous ones;
\v 16 and in this, I work to have a conscience without blame before God and men through all things.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I admit this to you** - "I acknowledge this to you" or "I confess this to you"
  * **that according to the way** - The phrase "the way" was a title used for Christianity during Paul's time.
  * **they call a sect** - This is a smaller group of people within a larger group group. Tertullus considers the Christians to be a small group within Judaism. See how you translated "sect" in [[:en:bible:notes:act:24:04|24:5]].
  * **in that same way I serve the God of our forefathers** - Paul uses the phrase "in that same way" to mean that he, as a believer in Jesus, serves God the same way as the Jewish forefathers did. He is not leading a "sect" or teaching something new that is opposed to their ancient religion.
  * **just as these men** - Here "these men" refers to the Jews who are accusing Paul in court.
  * **the coming resurrection of ... unrighteous ones** - The abstract noun "resurrection" can be stated as "God brings back to life." The nominal adjective "the dead" can be stated as "those who died." AT: "when God brings back to life all who have died, both the righteous and the unrighteous" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]])
  * **the righteous ones** - "those who have done what is right"
  * **the unrighteous ones** - "those who have done what is evil"
  * **I work** - "I do my best"
  * **to have a conscience without blame** - Here "conscience" refers to a person's inner morality that chooses between right and wrong. AT: "to be blameless" or "to always do what is right" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **before God** - "in the presence of God"
