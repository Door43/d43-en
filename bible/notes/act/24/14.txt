\v 14 But I admit this to you, that according to the way that they call a sect, in that same way I serve the God of our forefathers. I am faithful to all that is in the law and the writings of the prophets.
\v 15 I have the same confidence in God, just as these men also wait for it, the coming resurrection of the dead, of both the righteous ones and the unrighteous ones;
\v 16 and in this, I work to have a conscience without blame before God and men through all things.
