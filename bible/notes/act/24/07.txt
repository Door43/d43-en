Tertullus continues to speak to governor Felix.

  * **he forced Paul out of our hands** - "The soldiers of Lusias forced Paul out of our custody." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]]) "Forced" has the sense of using violent or strong force.

  * **we accuse him of** - "accuse Paul of doing" or "accuse Paul of being guilty of doing"
