\v 17 Now after many years I came to bring help to my nation and gifts of money.
\v 18 When I did this, certain Jews from Asia found me in a purification ceremony in the temple, not with a crowd or an uproar.
\v 19 These men ought to be before you now and say what they have against me, if they have anything.
