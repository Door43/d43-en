\v 3 When we had come in sight of the island of Cyprus, we left it on the left, and sailed to Syria, and landed at the city of Tyre, because it was there that the ship was to unload its cargo. 
\v 4 After we found the disciples, we stayed there seven days. These disciples said to Paul through the Spirit that he should not set foot in Jerusalem.
