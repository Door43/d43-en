\v 3 We traveled over the sea until we could see the Island of Cyprus. We passed to the south of the island and continued sailing until we arrived at the region of Phoenicia, in the province of Syria, at the city of Tyre. The ship was going to stay there several days because its workers had to unload the cargo.

\v 3 When we had come in sight of the island of Cyprus, we left it on the left, and sailed to Syria, and landed at the city of Tyre, because it was there that the ship was to unload its cargo. 
\v 4 After we found the disciples, we stayed there seven days. These disciples said to Paul through the Spirit that he should not set foot in Jerusalem.
