\v 20 When they heard that, James and the other elders thanked God. Then one of them said to Paul, "Brother, you know that there are very many thousands of us Jewish people here who have believed in the Lord Jesus. Also, you know that we all continue very carefully to obey the laws that Moses gave us.
\v 21 But our fellow Jewish believers have been told that when you are among non-Jews, you tell the Jewish believers who live there that they should stop obeying the laws of Moses. People say that you tell those Jewish believers not to circumcise their sons and not to practice our other customs. We do not believe that they are telling the truth about you.

\v 20 When they heard it, they praised God, and they said to him, "You see, brother, how many thousands have believed among the Jews. They are all determined to keep the law.
\v 21 They have been told about you, that you teach all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to abandon Moses, and that you tell them not to circumcise their children, and not to follow the old customs.

  * **brother** - Here "brother" means "fellow believer."
  * **They have been told about you ... not to follow the old customs** - Apparently here there are some Jews that are distorting what Paul is teaching. He does not discourage the Jews from obeying the Law of Moses. His message is that circumcision and the other customs are not necessary for Jesus to save them. You can make explicit that the leaders of the Jewish believers in Jerusalem knew that Paul was teaching God's true message. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **They have been told** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "People have told the Jewish believers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **to abandon Moses** - Here "Moses" stands for the law of Moses. AT: "to stop obeying the laws that Moses gave us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **not to follow the old customs** - To obey the old customs is spoken of as if the customs were leading them and the people follow behind. AT: "not to obey the old customs" or "not to practice the old customs" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the old customs** - "the customs that Jews normally do"
