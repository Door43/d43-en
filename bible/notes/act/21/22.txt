\v 22 But our fellow Jewish believers will hear that you have come, and they will be angry with you. So you need to do something to show them that what they heard about you is not true.
\v 23 So please do what we suggest to you. There are four men among us who have made a vow to God.
\v 24 Go with these men to the temple and do the ceremonies there necessary for you and them to be able to worship in the temple. Then, when it is time for them to offer the sacrifices, pay for what they offer. After that, they can shave their heads to show that they have done what they said they would do. When people see you in the courts of the temple with those men, they will know that what they have been told about you is not true. Instead, all of them will know that you obey all our Jewish laws.

\v 22 What should we do? They will certainly hear that you have come.
\v 23 So do what we say to you now: we have four men who made a vow.
\v 24 Take these men and purify yourself with them, and pay their expenses for them, so that they may shave their heads. So everyone will know that the things they have been told about you are false. They will learn that you also live so as to keep the law.

The Jerusalem elders continue to speak to Paul.

  * **What should we do?** - The word "we" refers to the elders. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **four men who made a vow** - This was the kind of vow where the person would not drink alcohol or cut their hair until the end of the set period of time. Alternate translation: "four men who made a promise to God".
  * **pay their expenses for them** - The expenses would go towards buying a male and female lamb, a ram, and grain and drink offerings. Alternate translation: "pay for what they will need."
