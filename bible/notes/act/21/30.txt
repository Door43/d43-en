===== translationNotes: =====

  * **All the city was excited** - The word "All" here is an exaggeration for emphasis. The word "city" represents the people in Jerusalem. AT: "Many people in the city became angry at Paul" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **laid hold of Paul** - "seized Paul" or "grabbed Paul"
  * **the doors were immediately shut** - They shut the doors so that there would not be rioting in the temple area. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Some of the Jews immediately shut the temple doors" or "The temple guards immediately shut the doors" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **news came up to the chief captain of the guard** - Here "news" refers to the messenger who went to speak the news. AT: "someone gave news to the chief captain of the guard" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **news came up to the chief captain** - The phrase "came up to" is used because the chief captain was in a fortress connected to the temple that was higher in elevation than the temple courtyard.
  * **the chief captain** - a Roman military officer or leader of about 600 soldiers
  * **all Jerusalem was in an uproar** - The word "Jerusalem" here represents the people of Jerusalem. The word "all" is an exaggeration to show a large crowd was upset. AT: "a lot of people in Jerusalem were in an uproar" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
