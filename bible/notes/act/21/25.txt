\v 25 As for the non-Jewish believers, we elders here in Jerusalem have talked about which of our laws they should obey, and we wrote them a letter, telling them what we decided. We wrote that they should not eat meat that people have offered as a sacrifice to any idol, that they should not eat blood from animals, and that they should not eat meat from animals that people have killed by strangling them. We also told them that they should not sleep with someone to whom they are not married."
\v 26 So Paul agreed to do what they asked, and the next day he took the four men, and together they purified themselves. After that, Paul went to the temple courts and told the priest what day they would finish purifying themselves and when they would offer the animals as sacrifices for each of them.

\v 25 But concerning the Gentiles who have believed, we wrote and gave the instructions that they should keep themselves from things sacrificed to idols, from blood, from what is strangled, and from sexual immorality."
\v 26 Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them went into the temple, announcing the period of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of them.

===== Translation Notes: =====

the Jerusalem elders continue to speak to Paul.

  * **we wrote** - The word "we" refers to the elders. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **from what is strangled** - "from animals killed for food without having the blood drained"
  * **purifying himself with them** - before entering the temple area the Jews were required to be ceremonially or ritually clean. This cleansing had to do with jews having contact with Gentiles.
  * ** the days of purification** - This is a separate purification process related to the vows the men made, separate from the purification processed they were required to fulfill to enter the temple area.
  * **until the offering was offered ** - "until they presented the animals for a offering"
