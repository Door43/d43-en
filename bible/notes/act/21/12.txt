\v 12 When we heard these things, both we and the people who lived in that place begged Paul not to go up to Jerusalem.
\v 13 Then Paul answered, "What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready, not only to be tied up, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."
\v 14 Since Paul did not wish to be persuaded, we stopped trying and said, "May the will of the Lord be done."
