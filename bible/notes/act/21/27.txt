Some Jews from Asia \add province\add* saw him there, \add and they were very angry at him\add*. On another day they had seen Paul \add walking around\add* in Jerusalem with Trophimus, who was a non-Jew. Their laws did not permit non-Jews to be in the Temple, and they thought that Paul had brought Trophimus into the Temple \add courtyard that day. So\add* they called out to many other Jews \add who were in the Temple courtyard\add* to \add help them\add* seize \f + \ft metonymy \f* Paul. They shouted, "Fellow Israelites, come and help \add us to punish this\add* man! This is the one who is \add constantly\add* teaching people wherever \add he goes that they\add* should despise the \add Jewish\add* people. \add He teaches people that they should no longer obey\add* the laws \add of Moses\add* nor respect this holy \add Temple\add*. He has even brought non-Jews here into \add the court of\add* our Temple, causing God to consider it no longer holy!"

\v 27 When the seven days for purifying themselves were nearly finished, Paul returned to the temple courtyard. Some Jews from Asia saw him there, and they were very angry at him. They called out to many other Jews who were in the temple courtyard to help them take hold of Paul.
\v 28 They shouted, "Fellow Israelites, come and help us to punish this man! This is the one who is teaching people wherever he goes that they should despise the Jewish people. He teaches people that they should no longer obey the laws of Moses nor respect this holy temple. He has even brought non-Jews here into the court of our temple, causing this place to become polluted!"
\v 29 They said these because they had seen Paul walking around in Jerusalem with Trophimus, who was a non-Jew. Their laws did not permit non-Jews to be in the temple, and they thought that Paul had brought Trophimus into the temple courtyard that day.

\v 27 When the seven days were almost finished, some Jews from Asia saw Paul in the temple, and excited all the multitude, and laid hands on him.
\v 28 They were shouting, "Men of Israel, help us. This is the man who teaches all men everywhere things that are against the people, the law, and this place. Besides, he has also brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place."
\v 29 For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, and they thought that Paul had brought him into the temple.
