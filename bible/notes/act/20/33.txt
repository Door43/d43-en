\v 33 I coveted no man's silver, gold, or clothing.
\v 34 You yourselves know that these hands served my own needs and the needs of those who were with me. 
\v 35 In all things I gave you an example of how you should help the weak by working, and of how you should remember the words of the Lord Jesus, words that he himself said: "It is more blessed to give than to receive."
