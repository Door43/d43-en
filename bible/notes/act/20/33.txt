\v 33 As for myself, I never wanted anyone's money or fine clothing.
\v 34 You yourselves know that I have worked with my hands to earn the money that my friends and I needed.
\v 35 In everything that I did, I showed you that we should work hard in order to have enough money to give some to those who are needy. We should remember that our Lord Jesus himself said, 'A person is happier when he gives to others than when he receives from them.'"

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 33 I coveted no man's silver, gold, or clothing.
\v 34 You yourselves know that these hands served my own needs and the needs of those who were with me.
\v 35 In all things I gave you an example of how you should help the weak by working, and of how you should remember the words of the Lord Jesus, words that he himself said: "It is more blessed to give than to receive."
