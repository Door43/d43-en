\v 28 You leaders must continue to believe and obey God's message. You must also help all the other believers for whom the Holy Spirit has given you to care for. Watch over yourselves and the group of the Lord's believers as a shepherd watches over his sheep. God bought them with the blood that flowed from his Son's body on the cross.
\v 29 I know very well that after I leave, people who teach lies will come among you and will do great harm to the believers. They will be like fierce wolves that kill the sheep.
\v 30 Even in your own group of leaders there will be some who will lie to other believers by teaching them the wrong things. They will teach those messages so that some people will believe them and will become their followers.

<usfm>
\v 28 Therefore be careful about yourselves, and about all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be careful to shepherd the assembly of the Lord, which he purchased with his own blood.
\v 29 I know that after my departure, vicious wolves will enter in among you, and not spare the flock.
\v 30 I know that from even among your own selves some men shall come and say corrupt things, in order to draw away the disciples after them.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Therefore** - This word marks a statement that is said because of what was said previously. In this case, it refers back to all that Paul has said so far in his speech about him leaving them.
  * **the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers** - Believers are likened to a "flock" of sheep here. Church leaders are entrusted by God with the care of the flock just as a shepherd would care for his flock of sheep and protect them from wolves. AT: "the group of believers the Holy spirit has entrusted to you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **the assembly of the Lord, which he purchased with his own blood** - The shedding of the "blood" of Christ here is likened to a payment to God for our sins. AT: "The people Christ bought by shedding his blood on the cross." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **draw away the disciples after them** - "Convince people who are followers of Christ to follow their own, false, teaching"
