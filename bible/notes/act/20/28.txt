\v 28 You leaders must continue to believe and obey God's message. You must also help all the other believers for whom the Holy Spirit has given you to care for. Watch over yourselves and the group of the Lord's believers as a shepherd watches over his sheep. God bought them with the blood that flowed from his Son's body on the cross.
\v 29 I know very well that after I leave, people who teach lies will come among you and will do great harm to the believers. They will be like fierce wolves that kill the sheep.
\v 30 Even in your own group of leaders there will be some who will lie to other believers by teaching them the wrong things. They will teach those messages so that some people will believe them and will become their followers.

<usfm>
\v 28 Therefore be careful about yourselves, and about all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be careful to shepherd the church of God, which he purchased with his own blood.
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa with his own blood \fqa* , some ancient copies read, \fqa with the blood of his own Son. \f* 
\v 29 I know that after my departure, vicious wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock.
\v 30 I know that from even among you some men shall come and distort the truth in order to draw away the disciples after them.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Therefore** - This word marks a statement that is said because of what was said previously. In this case, it refers back to all that Paul has said so far in his speech about his leaving them.
  * **the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be careful to shepherd the church of God** - Believers are likened to a "flock" of sheep here. Church leaders are entrusted by God with the care of the community of believers just as a shepherd would care for his flock of sheep and protect them from wolves. AT: "the group of believers the Holy spirit has entrusted to you. Be sure to take care of the church of God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the church of God, which he purchased with his own blood** - The shedding of the "blood" of Christ here is likened to a payment to God for our sins. AT: "the people Christ saved from their sins by shedding his blood on the cross" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **his own blood** - Here "blood" stands for Christ's death. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **vicious wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock** - This is a picture of people who teach false doctrine and who harm the community of believers as though they were wolves that eat the sheep of the flock. AT: "many enemies will come among you and try to harm the community of believers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in order to draw away the disciples after them** - A false teacher convincing believers to start believing his false teaching is spoken of as if he were leading sheep away from the flock to follow him. AT: "in order to convince people who are disciples of Christ to become his disciples instead" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
