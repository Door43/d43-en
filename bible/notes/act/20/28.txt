\v 28 You leaders must continue to believe and obey God's message. You must also help all the other believers for whom the Holy Spirit has given you to care for. Watch over yourselves and the group of believers as a shepherd watches over his sheep. God bought them with the blood that flowed from his Son's body on the cross.
\v 29 I know very well that after I leave, people who teach lies will come among you and will do great harm to the believers. They will be like fierce wolves that kill the sheep.
\v 30 Even in your own group of leaders there will be some who will lie to other believers by teaching them the wrong things. They will teach those messages so that some people will believe them and will become their followers.

<usfm>
\v 28 Therefore be careful about yourselves, and about all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, so that you shepherd the assembly of the Lord which he purchased with his own blood.
\v 29 I know that after my departure, vicious wolves will enter in among you, and not spare the flock.
\v 30 I know that from even among your own selves some men shall come and say corrupt things, in order to draw away the disciples after them.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Paul continues to speak.

  * **and about all the flock … and not spare the flock.**  - This is an extended metaphor. The leaders of the church are supposed to care for the people under them and protect them from enemies just as a shepherd would care for his flock of sheep and protect them from wolves. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **the assembly of the Lord which he purchased with his own blood**  - "The people Christ bought by shedding his blood on the cross". (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **draw away the disciples after them**  - "Convince people who are followers of Christ to follow their own, false, teaching"
