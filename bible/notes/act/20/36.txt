  * **kissed him**  - Kissing someone on the cheek is an expression of brotherly or friendly love in the Middle East.
  * **they would never see his face again**  - "they would never see (him) Paul again on this earth". The words "his face" is used here to refer to Paul as a person (UDB). (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche|Synecdoche]])
