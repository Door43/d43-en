===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **fell on Paul's neck** - "hugged him closely" or "put their arms around him"
  * **kissed him** - Kissing someone on the cheek is an expression of brotherly or friendly love in the Middle East.
  * **they would never see his face again** - "they would never see (him) Paul again on this earth". The words "his face" is used here to refer to Paul as a person (UDB). (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
