\v 9 In the window was sitting a young man named Eutychus, who fell into a deep sleep. As Paul spoke even longer, this young man, still sleeping, fell down from the third story and was picked up dead.
\v 10 But Paul went down, stretched himself out on him, and embraced him. Then he said, "Do not be upset any more, for he is alive."
