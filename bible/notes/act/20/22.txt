\v 22 "And now I am going to Jerusalem, because the Holy Spirit has clearly shown me that I must go there, and I must obey him. I do not know what will happen to me there.
\v 23 But I do know that in each city I have visited, the Holy Spirit has told me that in Jerusalem people will put me in prison and will cause me to suffer.
\v 24 But I do not care even if people kill me, if first I am able to finish the work that the Lord Jesus has told me to do. He called me to tell people the good message that God saves us by doing for us what we do not deserve.

<usfm>
\v 22 And now, look, I go bound in the Holy Spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that will happen to me there,
\v 23 except that the Holy Spirit witnesses to me in every city and says that chains and sufferings await me. 
\v 24 But I do not consider that my life is in any way precious to myself, so that I may finish my race and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to bear witness to the gospel of the grace of God.
