\v 25 I have preached to you the message about how God will show himself as king. But now I know that today is the last time that you fellow believers will see me.
\v 26 So I want you all to understand that if anyone who has heard me preach dies without trusting in Jesus, it is not my fault,
\v 27 because I told you everything that God has planned for us.

\v 25 Now look, I know that you all, among whom I went about proclaiming the kingdom, will see my face no more.
\v 26 Therefore I testify to you this day, that I am innocent of the blood of any man.
\v 27 For I did not hold back from declaring to you the whole will of God.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul continues to talk to the Ephesian elders. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:act:20:17|20:17]])

  * **Now look, I know** - "Now, pay careful attention, because I know"
  * **I know that you all** - "I know that all of you"
  * **among whom I went about proclaiming the kingdom** - Here "kingdom" stands for God's rule as king. AT: "to whom I preached the message about God's reign as king" or "to whom I preached about how God will show himself as king" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **will see my face no more** - The word "face" here represents Paul's physical body. AT: "will not see me anymore on this earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **I am innocent of the blood of any man** - Here "blood" stands for a person's death, which, in this case, is not physical death but spiritual death when God declares a person guilty of sin. Paul had told them God's truth. AT: "I am not responsible for anyone whom God judges guilty of sin because they did not trust in Jesus" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **any man** - Here this means any person whether male or female. AT: "any person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_gendernotations]])
