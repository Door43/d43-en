\v 26 Also, you know that \add this fellow\add* Paul has persuaded many people who live in Ephesus \add to no longer buy the images that we make. Now even the people from\add* many other towns in our province \add no longer want to buy what we make\add*. This fellow tells people that the gods that we have made \add and worship\add* are not gods \add and that we should not worship them\add*.
\v 27 \add If people continue to listen to him\add*, soon they will ruin our business. Besides, they will no longer think that they should \add come to\add* the temple of Artemis \add to worship her. People\add* all over our Asia \add province\add* and everywhere \f + \ft hyperbole \f* else worship \add our great\add* goddess \add Artemis. Soon people\add* may no longer consider that Artemis is great!"

\v 26 You know that Paul has taught many people who live in Ephesus to no longer buy the statues that we make. Now even the people from many other towns in our province no longer want to buy what we make. Paul tells people that the gods that we worship are not gods and that we should not worship them.
\v 27 If people listen to him, they will stop our business. People will not think that they should come any longer to the temple of Diana to worship her. People will no longer think that Diana is great. Yet all the province of Asia and even the whole world worship her!"

\v 26 You see and hear that, not only at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people.  He is saying that there are no gods that are made with hands.
\v 27 And not only is there danger that our trade will no longer be needed, but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana may be considered worthless.  Then she would even lose her greatness, she whom all Asia and the world worships."

===== Translation Notes: =====

Demetrius, the silversmith, continues to speak to the craftsmen.

  * **You see and hear that** - "you have come to know and understand"
  * **turned away many people**  - "persuaded many people to stop worshipping the local gods and turn to Christ"
  * **she would even lose her greatness** - Diana's greatness only comes from what people think of her. 
  * **whom all Asia and the world worships.**  - This is an hyperbole showing the popularity of the goddess Diana and the fact that many people worshipped her. (see: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole|Hyperbole]])
