===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 26 You know that Paul has taught many people who live in Ephesus to no longer buy the statues that we make. Now even the people from many other towns in our province no longer want to buy what we make. Paul tells people that the gods that we worship are not gods and that we should not worship them. \v 27 If people listen to him, they will stop our business. People will not think that they should come any longer to the temple of Diana to worship her. People will no longer think that Diana is great. Yet all Asia province and even the whole world worship her!" </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 26 You see and hear that, not only at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people. He is saying that there are no gods that are made with hands. \v 27 And not only is there danger that our trade will no longer be needed, but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana may be considered worthless. Then she would even lose her greatness, she whom all Asia and the world worships." </usfm>

  * **turned away many people.** - "persuaded many people to stop worshipping the local gods and turn to Christ"
  * **whom all Asia and the world worships.** - This is an hyperbole showing the popularity of the goddess Diana and the fact that many people worshipped her. (see: [[en:ta:translate:hyperbole]])
