\v 16 After saying that, suddenly the man who had the evil spirit jumped on the sons of Sceva. He knocked all of them down and hurt each of them. He tore off their clothes and wounded them. They became frightened and ran out of the house.
\v 17 All the people who lived in Ephesus, both Jews and non-Jews, heard what had happened. They became afraid  because they saw that the man with the evil spirit was very strong. At the same time, they honored the name of the Lord Jesus.

\v 15 An evil spirit answered them, "Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?"
\v 16 The evil spirit in the man leaped on the exorcists and overpowered them and beat them up. Then they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
\v 17 This became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who lived at Ephesus. They became very afraid, and the name of the Lord Jesus was honored.
