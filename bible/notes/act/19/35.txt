\v 35 When the town clerk had quieted the crowd, he said, "You men of Ephesus, what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great Diana and of the image which fell down from heaven?
\v 36 Seeing then that these things are undeniable, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash.
\v 37 For you have brought these men to this court who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.
