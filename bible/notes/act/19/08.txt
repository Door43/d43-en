\v 8 Paul went into the synagogue and spoke boldly for the space of three months. He was leading discussions and persuading people about the things concerning the kingdom of God.
\v 9 But when some Jews were hardened and disobedient, they began to speak evil of the way of Christ before the crowd, so Paul left them, and drew the believers away from them. He began to speak every day in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.
\v 10 This continued for two years, so that all who  lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.
