\v 38 Therefore, if Demetrius and his fellow-workmen want to accuse anyone \add about anything bad, they should do it in the right way\add*. There are courts \add that you can go to when you want to accuse someone\add*, and there are judges \add there who have been appointed by the government\add* \f + \ft Or:\add whom the government has appointed\add* \f*. You can accuse \add anyone there\add*.
\v 39 But if you want to ask about something else, \add you should ask\add* for \add other officials to\add* resolve it when \add those\add* officials legally assemble.
\v 40 \add And this is certainly not a legal meeting! Resolve this legally\add* because, if \add we\f + \ft inclusive \f* do\add* not, I am afraid \add that the governor\add* will hear about all this noise\add that you have made\add* and will say that we\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* were trying to rebel \add against the government\add*. If he would ask me what you were all shouting about, I would not be able to give him an answer."
\v 41 That is what the city secretary said \add to the crowd\add*. Then he told them all to go \add home. So they left\add*.

\v 38 Therefore, if Demetrius and his fellow-workmen want to accuse anyone of doing anything bad, they should do it in the right way. There are courts that they can go to if they want to, and there are judges who have been chosen by the government. You can accuse anyone there.
\v 39 But if you want to ask about anything else, you should ask for your rulers to take care of it when those rulers come together.
\v 40 This is not a good meeting! Take care of this trouble the right way because we do not want to go against the government. If the rulers asked me what you were all shouting about, I would not be able to give them a good answer."
\v 41 That is what the city ruler said to the crowd. Then he told them all to go home, and they did go to their homes.

\v 38 Therefore, if Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have an accusation against anyone, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. Let them accuse one another.
\v 39 But if you seek anything about other matters, it shall be settled in the regular assembly.
\v 40 For indeed we are in danger of being accused  concerning this day’s riot. There is no cause for this disorder, and we will not be able to explain it."
\v 41 When he had said this, he dismissed the assembly.
