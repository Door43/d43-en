====== Acts 08 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent all the lines of 8:32-33, which is a quotation from the Old Testament. 

The first verse appears connected to the narrative of chapter 7 and not the events of Chapter 8.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Receiving the Holy Spirit ==

Many scholars believe that this indicates the Spirit began to indwell them, or live inside their heart, in order to guide them. Others believe that this gave the ability to speak in tongues, in addition to indwelling them.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Preached the gospel ==
While "preaching" can take many forms, the general idea in this phrase is that they share the good news that Jesus died and rose again for the sins of man. It is message and not its presentation that is significant here.
