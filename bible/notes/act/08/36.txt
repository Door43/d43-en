\v 36 As they went on the road, they came to some water; the eunuch said, "Look, there is water here; what prevents me from being baptized?"
\v 37 \f + \ft Most ancient authorities omit Acts 8:37, either in whole, or parts of it. It is given here only for reference. \fqa Philip said, "If you believe with all your heart, you may be baptized." The Ethiopian answered, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God." \f*
