===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - This begins the story of Philip, whom the people had chosen as a deacon. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:act:06:05|6:5]])

  * **who had been scattered** - The cause for the scattering, the persecution, was stated previously. This can be stated in active form. AT: "who had fled the great persecution and had gone" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **went down to the city of Samaria** - The phrase "went down" is used here because Samaria is lower in elevation than Jerusalem.
  * **the city of Samaria** - It is unclear if the city of Samaria refers to a city called "the city of Samaria" (ULB) or to "a city in Samaria." .
  * **proclaimed to them the Christ** - The title "Christ" refers to Jesus, the Messiah. AT: "told them that Jesus is the Messiah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
