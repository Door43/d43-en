===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **who had been scatteredâ€¦**  - "who had been scattered by the great persecution". The cause for the scattering, the persecution, was specified previously. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background|Writing Styles - Background Information]])
  * **the city of Samaria**  - It is unclear if the city of Samaria refers to "the city" (ULB) or "a city" (UDB). Suggest translating this as "the city."
