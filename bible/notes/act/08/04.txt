  * **who had been scattered...**  - "who had been scattered by the great persecution". The cause for the scattering, the persecution, was specified previously. (See: [[en:ta:translate:writingstyles]])
  * **the city of Samaria**: It is unclear if the city of Samaria refers to "the city" (ULB) or "a city" (UDB). Suggest translating this as "the city".
