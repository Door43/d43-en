===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Do you understand what you are reading?** - The Ethiopian was intelligent and could read, but he lacked spiritual discernment. AT: "Do you understand the meaning of what you are reading?"
  * **How can I, unless someone guides me?** - This question was asked to emphatically state that he could not understand without help. AT: "I cannot unless someone guides me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **He begged Philip to…sit with him** - It is implied here that Philip agreed to travel down the road with him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
