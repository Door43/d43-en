===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Do you understand what you are reading?**  - Can be translated as, "Do you understand the meaning of what you are reading?" The Ethiopian could read and was intelligent. This was an issue of spiritual understanding.
  * **How can I, unless someone guides me?**  - This is a rhetorical question for "I can not unless someone guides me." It is used to emphatically stress that he could not understand. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]].)
  * **He begged Philip to…sit with him.**  - Also implied, Philip agreed to traveled down the road with him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Explicit and Implicit]])
