\v 32 The part of the Scriptures that the official was reading was this: "He was silent like a sheep when people lead it away to kill it. As a young sheep is silent when its wool is being cut off, he does not speak.
\q
\v 33 He will be humiliated and not receive justice. No one will possibly be able to tell about his descendants, because he will be killed."

\v 32 Now the passage of the scripture which the Ethiopian was reading was this,
\q "He was led as a sheep to the slaughter;
\q And as a lamb before his shearer is silent,
\q He does not open his mouth:
\q
\v 33 In his humiliation his judgment was taken away:
\q Who will declare his generation?
\q For his life was taken from the earth."
