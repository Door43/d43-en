\v 32 The part of the scriptures that the official was reading was this: "He is as calm as a sheep that people lead to the place where they are going to kill it, or as a lamb stands in silence while its wool is being cut off. 
\q
\v 33 He will be humiliated. He will not receive justice. No one will be able to tell about his descendants—for he will have no descendants—because they will take away his life on this earth."

\v 32 Now the passage of the scripture which the Ethiopian was reading was this,
\q "He was led as a sheep to the slaughter;
\q and as a lamb before his shearer is silent,
\q he does not open his mouth:
\q
\v 33 In his humiliation his judgment was taken away:
\q Who will declare his generation?
\q for his life was taken from the earth."
