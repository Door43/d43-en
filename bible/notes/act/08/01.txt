\c 8
\v 1 Saul was in agreement with his death.
\p So there began on that day a great persecution against the church that was in Jerusalem; and the believers were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.
\v 2 Devout men buried Stephen and made great lamentation over him.
\v 3 But Saul greatly harmed the church; he went into house after house and dragged out men and women, and put them into prison.
