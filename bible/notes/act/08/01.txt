\v 1 Saul was in agreement with his death.
\p So there began on that day a great persecution against the church that was in Jerusalem; and the believers were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.
\v 2 Devout men buried Stephen and made great lamentation over him.
\v 3 But Saul greatly harmed the church; he went into house after house and dragged out men and women, and put them into prison.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The story shifts from Stephen to Saul in these verses. 
  * **General Information:** - It may be helpful to your audience to move these parts of the story about Stephen together by using a verse bridge as the UDB does. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_versebridge]])

  * **So there began ... except the apostles** - This part of verse 1 is background information about the persecution that began after Stephen's death. This explains why Saul was persecuting the believers in verse 3. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **that day** - This refers to the day that Stephen died. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:act:07:59|7:59-60]])
  * **the believers were all scattered** - The word "all" is a generalization to express that a large number of the believers left Jerusalem because of the persecution. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **except the apostles** - This statement implies that the apostles remained in Jerusalem even though they also experienced this great persecution. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Devout men** - "God-fearing men" or "Men who feared God"
  * **made great lamentation over him** - "greatly mourned his death"
