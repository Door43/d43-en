\v 26 One day an angel whom the Lord God had sent commanded Philip, "Get ready and go south along the road that extends from Jerusalem to the city of Gaza." That was a road in a desert area.
\v 27 So Philip got ready and went along that road. On the road he met a man from the land of Ethiopia. He was an important official who took care of all the funds for the queen of Ethiopia. In his language people called their queen Candace. This man had gone to Jerusalem to worship God,
\v 28 and he was returning home and was seated riding in his chariot. As he was riding, he was reading aloud in the book of the prophet Isaiah.

\v 26 Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip and said, "Arise and go toward the south to the road that goes down from
Jerusalem to Gaza." (This road is in a desert.)
\v 27 He arose and went. Behold, there was a man from Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians. He was in charge of all her treasure. He had come to Jerusalem to worship.
\v 28 He was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Now**  - This marks a transition in the story.
  * **Behold** - The word “behold” alerts us to a new person in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this. English uses “There was a man who was…”
  * **eunuch**  - The emphasis of "eunuch" here is about the Ethiopian being a high government official, not his physical state of being castrated.
  * **Candace**  - A title used for the queens of Ethiopia, like that of Pharaoh was used for the kings of Egypt. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|How to Translate Names]])
  * **chariot**  - "wagon" or "carriage" is more fitting in this context. Chariots are normally mentioned as a vehicle for war, not as a vehicle for long distance travel.
  * **reading the prophet Isaiah**  - Can be translated as, "reading from the book of the prophet Isaiah". This is the Old Testament book Isaiah.
