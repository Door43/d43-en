\v 51 You people who are stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit; you act just as your fathers acted.
\v 52 Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? They killed the prophets who appeared in advance of the coming of the Righteous One; and you have now become the betrayers and murderers of him also,
\v 53 you people who received the law that angels had established, but you did not keep it."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - With a sharp rebuke, Stephen finishes his response to the high priest and the council which he began in [[:en:bible:notes:act:07:01|7:2]].

  * **You people who are stiff-necked** - Stephen shifted from identifying with the Jewish leaders to rebuking them.
  * **stiff-necked** - This does not mean their necks were stiff but rather that they were "stubborn." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **uncircumcised in heart and ears** - The Jews regarded uncircumcised people as disobedient to God. Stephen uses "hearts and ears" to represent to the Jewish leaders who acted the way Gentiles act when they do not obey or listen to God. AT: "you refuse to obey and hear" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute?** - Stephen asked this question to show them that they learned nothing from the errors of their forefathers. AT: "Your forefathers persecuted every prophet!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Righteous One** - This refers to the Christ, the Messiah.
  * **you have now become the betrayers and murderers of him also** - "you have also betrayed and murdered him"
  * **murderers of him** - "murderers of the Righteous One" or "murderers of the Christ"
  * **the law that angels had established** - "the laws that God caused angels to give to our ancestors"
