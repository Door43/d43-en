===== Translation Notes: =====

Stephen continues his defense before the Jewish council that he began in [[:en:bible:notes:act:07:01|7:2]].

  * **You people who are stiff-necked...** - Stephen shifted from identifying with the Jewish leaders to rebuking them.
  * **uncircumcised in heart** - "disobedient in heart." Stephen may have been comparing them to the Gentiles, which they would have understood as an insult.
  * **Which of the prophets did your forefathers not persecute?** - This is a rhetorical question where Stephen was rebuking them. Can be translated as, "Your forefathers persecuted every prophet!" (See: [[en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion]])
  * **Righteous One** - This refers to the Christ, the Messiah.
  * **murderers of him** - "murderers of the Righteous One" or "murderers of the Christ."
