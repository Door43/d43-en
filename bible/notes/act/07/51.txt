\v 51 You people who are stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit; you act just as your forefathers acted.
\v 52 Which of the prophets did your forefathers not persecute? They killed the prophets who appeared before of the coming of the
Righteous One; and you have now become the betrayers and murderers of him, also--
\v 53 you people who received the law that angels had established, but you did not keep it "

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Stephen continues to speak.)
  * **uncircumcised in heart**  - "disobedient in heart". Stephen may have been comparing them to the Gentiles, which they would have understood as an insult.
  * **Which of the prophets did your forefathers not persecute?**  This is a rhetorical question. The answer is: they persecuted all of the prophets.
