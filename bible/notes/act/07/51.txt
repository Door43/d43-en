\v 51 You people who are stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit; you act just as your forefathers acted.
\v 52 Which of the prophets did your forefathers not persecute? They killed the prophets who appeared in advance of the coming of the Righteous One; and you have now become the betrayers and murderers of him also,
\v 53 you people who received the law that angels had established, but you did not keep it "

===== Translation Notes: =====

Stephen continues his defense before the Jewish council that he began in [[:en:bible:notes:act:07:01|7:2]].

  * **You people who are stiff-neckedâ€¦**  - Stephen shifted from identifying with the Jewish leaders to rebuking them.
  * **uncircumcised in heart**  - "disobedient in heart". Stephen may have been comparing them to the Gentiles, which they would have understood as an insult.
  * **Which of the prophets did your forefathers not persecute?**  - This is a rhetorical question where Stephen was rebuking them. Can be translated as, "Your forefathers persecuted every prophet!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **Righteous One**  - This refers to the Christ, the Messiah.
  * **murderers of him**  - "murderers of the Righteous One" or "murderers of the Christ"
