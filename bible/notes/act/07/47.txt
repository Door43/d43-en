\v 49-50 Heaven is my throne\f + \ft Or: the place from which I rule the entire universe \f*, and the earth is my footstool\f + \ft Or: \add merely like\add* a stool on which I may rest my feet \f*. I myself \f + \ft synecdoche \f* have made everything \add both in heaven and on the earth\add*.

\v 48 "However, we know that God is greater than everything, and he does not live in houses that people have made. It is like the prophet Isaiah wrote: 
\q
\v 49-50 God said, "Heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool. I myself  have made everything both in heaven and on the earth. So you human beings cannot make a place good enough for me to live in!"

\v 47 But Solomon built God a house.
\v 48 However, the Most High does not live in houses made with hands; it is like the prophet says,
\q
\v 49 'Heaven is my throne,
\q And the earth the footstool for my feet.
\q What kind of house can you build me? says the Lord:
\q Or where is the place for my rest?
\q
\v 50 Did not my hand make all these things?'

===== Translation Notes: =====

Stephen continues his defense before the Jewish council that he began in [[:en:bible:notes:act:07:01|7:2]].

  * **made with hands** - This is synecdoche for "made by people". (See: [[en:ta:translate:synecdoche]])
  * **Heaven is my throne...earth the footstool for my feet** - The prophet is comparing God's presence being so great that whole universe is his throne with how impossible it is for man to build a place for God to rest on earth since the whole earth is nothing but a mere footstool to Him.
  * **What kind of house can you build for me?** This is a rhetorical question for "You can not build a house adequate enough for me!" (See [[en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion]])
  * **where is the place for my rest?** - "There is no place of rest good enough for me!" (See [[en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion]])
  * **Did not my hand make all these things? ** - This is a rhetorical question for "My hand made all these things!" (See [[en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion]])
