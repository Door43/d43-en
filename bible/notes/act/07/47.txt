\v 48 "However, \add we\f + \ft inclusive \f* know that\add* God is greater than everything, and he does not live in \add houses that\add* people \f + \ft synecdoche \f* have made. It is like the prophet \add Isaiah\add* wrote. He wrote \add these words that God had spoken:\add*
\q
\v 49-50 Heaven is my throne\f + \ft Or: the place from which I rule the entire universe \f*, and the earth is my footstool\f + \ft Or: \add merely like\add* a stool on which I may rest my feet \f*. I myself \f + \ft synecdoche \f* have made everything \add both in heaven and on the earth\add*. So you \add human beings\add*, \add you\add* really cannot build a house that would be \add adequate\add* for me!\f + \ft Or: do you think you can build a house that would be \add appropriate\add* for me? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* You cannot \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* make a place good enough for me \add to live in!\add*"

\p
\v 48 "However, we know that God is greater than everything, and he does not live in houses that people have made. It is like the prophet Isaiah wrote: 
\q
\v 49-50 God said, "Heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool. I myself  have made everything both in heaven and on the earth. So you human beings cannot make a place good enough for me to live in!"

\v 47 But Solomon built God a house.
\v 48 However, the Most High does not live in houses made with hands; it is like the prophet says,
\q
\v 49 'Heaven is my throne,
\q And the earth the footstool for my feet.
\q What kind of house can you build me? says the Lord:
\q Or where is the place for my rest?
\q
\v 50 Did not my hand make all these things?'
