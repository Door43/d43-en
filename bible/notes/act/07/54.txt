===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **council**  - This was the most important Jewish Council, which was called the Sanhedrin.
  * **cut to the heart**  - This is an idiom for, "overcome by anger." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom|Idiom]])
  * **heard these things **- This is the turning point; the sermon ends and the council reacts.
  * **ground their teeth **- This is an idiom for expressing strong anger or hatred. This can be translated as "they became so angry that they ground their teeth together." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom|Idiom]])
  * **looked…up into heaven**  - "Looked…up into the sky". It appears that only Stephen saw this vision and not anyone else in the crowd.
  * **he saw Jesus standing**  - Note that Jesus was "standing" not "sitting" at the right hand of God. It was an honor when a king would stand to welcome a guest.
  * **glory of God**  - the glory or majesty of God as light. Translated as, "a bright light from God."
  * **Son of Man**  - Stephen is identifying Jesus by the title "Son of Man."
