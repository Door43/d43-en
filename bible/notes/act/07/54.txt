===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **cut to the heart** - This is an idiom for, "overcome by anger." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **heard these things **- This is the turning point; the sermon ends and the council reacts.
  * **ground their teeth **- This is an idiom for expressing strong anger or hatred. Can be translated as "they became so angry that they ground their teeth together". (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
