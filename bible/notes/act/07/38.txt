\v 38 It was this man Moses who was among the Israelites who were together in the wilderness; he was with the angel who had spoken to him on Mount Sinai. It is Moses to whom God had the angel on Mount Sinai give him our laws, and he was the one who told our ancestors what the angel had said. He was the one who received from God words that tell us how to live eternally and passed them on to us.


\p
\v 39 However, our ancestors did not want to obey Moses. Instead, they rejected him as their leader and wanted to return to Egypt.
\v 40 So they told his older brother Aaron, 'Make idols for us who will be our gods to lead us. As for that fellow Moses who led us out of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him!'

\v 38 This is the man who was in the assembly in the wilderness with the angel who had spoken to him on Mount Sinai. This is the man who was with our forefathers; this is the man who received living words to give to us.
\v 39 This is the man whom our forefathers refused to obey; they pushed him away from themselves, and in their hearts they turned back to Egypt.
\v 40 At that time they said to Aaron, 'Make us gods who will lead us. As for this Moses, who led us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him.'

Stephen discusses Moses in his defense before the Jewish council.
  * **This is the man who was in the assembly**  - "This is the man Moses who was among the Israelites" (UDB)
  * **this is the man who received living words to give us** - This could be translated in active form as "this is the man to whom God spoke living words to give to us." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **living words** - Possible meanings are 1) "a message that endures" or 2) "words that give life."
  * **pushed him away from themselves** - This metaphor emphasizes their rejection of Moses. It can be translated as "they rejected him as their leader" (UDB). (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **At that time** - "When they decided to return to Egypt"
