\v 17 As the time of the promise drew near which God had promised to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,
\v 18 until there arose another king over Egypt, a king who did not know about Joseph. 
\v 19 This same king deceived our people and ill-treated our forefathers, so they had to throw out their infants so they might not survive.
