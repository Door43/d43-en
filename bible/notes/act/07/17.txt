\v 17 As the time of the promise drew near which God had promised to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,
\v 18 until there arose another king over Egypt, a king who did not know about Joseph. 
\v 19 This same king deceived our people and treated our forefathers so badly, they had to throw out their infants in order to survive.

  * **who did not know about Joseph**  - This is metonymy. "Joseph" was substituted for "Joseph greatly helping the people of Egypt." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
  * **our people**  - "Our" includes Stephen and his audience. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive|Inclusive]])
  * **treated our forefathers so badly**  - "treated our ancestors so poorly" or "took advantage of our ancestors"
  * **throw out their infants**  - To abandon their infants so that the infants would die
