\v 4 Then he left the land of the Chaldaeans and lived in Haran; from there, after his father died, God brought him into this land, where you live now.
\v 5 He gave none of it as an inheritance to him, no, not even enough to set a foot on. But he promised--even though Abraham had no child yet--that he would give the land as a possession to him and to his descendants after him.
