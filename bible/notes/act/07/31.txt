\v 31 When Moses saw it, he was amazed, because the bush was not burning up. As he went over to look more closely, he heard the Lord God say to him,
\v 32 'I am the God whom your ancestors worshiped. I am the God that Abraham, Isaac and Jacob worship.' Moses was so afraid that he began to shake. He was afraid to look at the bush any longer.

\v 31 When Moses saw the fire, he marveled at the sight; and as he approached to look at it, there came a voice of the Lord, saying,
\v 32 'I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob.' Moses trembled and did not dare to look.
