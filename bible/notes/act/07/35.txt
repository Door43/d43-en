\v 35 This Moses is the one who had tried to help our Israelite people, but whom they rejected by saying, 'No one appointed you ruler and judge!' Moses is the one whom God himself sent to rule them and to free them from being slaves. He is the one whom an angel in the bush commanded to do that.
\v 36 Moses is the one who led our ancestors out from Egypt. He did many kinds of miracles in Egypt in order to show that God was with him, at the Sea of Reeds, and during the forty years that the Israelite people lived in the wilderness.
\v 37 This Moses is the one who said to the Israelite people, 'God will cause another man from among your own people to be a prophet like me for you.'

\v 35 This Moses whom they rejected, when they said, 'Who made you a ruler and a judge?'—he was the one whom God sent as both a ruler and deliverer. God sent him by the hand of the angel who appeared to Moses in the bush.
\v 36 Moses led them out of Egypt, after doing miracles and signs in Egypt and at the Sea of Reeds, and in the wilderness during forty years.
\v 37 It is the same Moses who said to the people of Israel, 'God will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers, a prophet like me.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Verses 35-38 contains a series of connected phrases referring to Moses. Each phrase begins with statements such as "This Moses" or "This same Moses" or "This is the man" or "It is the same Moses." If possible, use similar statements to emphasize Moses.
  * **General Information:** - After the Israelites left Egypt, they spent 40 years wandering around the wilderness before God led them into the land he had promised them.

  * **This Moses whom they rejected** - This refers back to the events recorded in [[:en:bible:notes:act:07:26|7:27-28]].
  * **Who made you a ruler and a judge?** - This question was used to rebuke Moses. See how you translated this rhetorical question in [[:en:bible:notes:act:07:26|7:27]]. AT: "You have no authority over us!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **a ruler and deliverer** - "to rule over them and to free them from being slaves"
  * **by the hand of the angel ... bush** - The hand is a metonym for the action performed by the person. In this case, the angel had commanded Moses to return to Egypt. Stephen speaks as if the angel had a physical hand. You may need to make explicit what action the angel did. AT: "by the action of the angel" or "by having the angel ... bush command him to return to Egypt" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **during forty years** - Stephen's audience knew about the forty years the Israelites spent in the wilderness. AT: "during the 40 years that the Israelite people lived in the wilderness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **raise up a prophet** - "cause another man to be a prophet"
  * **from among your brothers** - "from among your own people"
