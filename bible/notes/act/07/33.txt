===== Translation Notes: =====

Stephen continues his defense before the Jewish council that he began in [[:en:bible:notes:act:07:01|7:2]].

  * **for the place you are standing on is holy ground**  - The implied information is that where God is present, the immediate area around God is considered or made holy by God. (See :[[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]])
  * **certainly seen**  - adds emphasis to "seen"
  * **my people**  - The descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
  * **I have come down**  - will personally see to their release
