\v 6 God was speaking to him like this, that his descendants would live for a while in a foreign land, and that the inhabitants there would bring them into slavery and treat them badly for four hundred years.
\v 7 'And I will judge the nation to which they will be slaves,' said God, 'and after that shall they will come out and worship me in this place.'
\v 8 And he gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision, so Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day; Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of the twelve patriarchs.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Stephen continues his defense before the Jewish council that he began in [[:en:bible:notes:act:07:01|7:2]].

  * **to which they will be slaves - **"to which your descendants will be slaves"
  * **so Abraham became the father of Isaacâ€¦**  - The story transitions to Abraham's descendents.
