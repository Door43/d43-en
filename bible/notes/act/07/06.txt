\v 7 'But I will punish the people who make them work as slaves. After that, your descendants will leave that land, and they will come and worship me in this land.'
\p
\v 8 Then God commanded that every male in Abraham's household and all of his male descendants should be circumcised to show that they all belonged to God. Later Abraham's son, Isaac, was born, and when Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him. Later Isaac's son, Jacob, was born.

\v 6 God was speaking to him like this, that his descendants would live for a while in a foreign land, and that the inhabitants there would bring them into slavery and treat them badly for four hundred years.
\v 7 'But I will judge the nation that they serve,' said God, 'and after that they will come out and worship me in this place.'
\v 8 Then God gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision, so Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day; Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of the twelve patriarchs.

  * **I will judge the nation** - "nation" refers to the people in it. AT: "I will judge the people of the nation" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the nation that they serve** - "the nation that they will serve"
  * **gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision** - The Jews would have understood that this covenant required Abraham to circumcise the males of his family. AT: "made a covenant with Abraham to circumcise the males of his family" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **so Abraham became the father of Isaac** - The story transitions to Abraham's descendants.
