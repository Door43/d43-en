Stephen continues his defense before the Jewish council that he began in [[:en:bible:notes:act:07:01|7:2]].

  * **Moses was educated**  - "the Egyptians educated Moses". (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **all the learning of the Egyptians**  - This is an exaggeration for "many things that the Egyptians knew." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole|Hyperbole]])
  * **mighty in his words and works **  - "effective in action and speech", or "powerful in words and actions" (UDB), or "influential in what he did and said"
  * **visit his brothers**  - To investigate their living conditions
  * **striking the Egyptian**  - Moses hit the Egyptian so hard that he died.
  * **he thought**  - He imagined
  * **by his hand **  - through him
  * **was rescuing them**  - This could also be translated, "was rescuing them right then."
