\v 44 "While our ancestors were in the desert, they worshipped God at the tent that showed\add that he was there with them\add*. They had made the tent exactly like God had commanded Moses \add to make it. It was\add* exactly like the model that Moses had seen \add when he was up on the mountain\add*.
\v 45 \add Later on\add*, other ancestors of ours carried that tent with them when Joshua led them \add into this land\add*. That was during the time that they took this land for themselves, when God forced the people \add who previously lived here\add* to leave. So the Israelites were able to possess this land. \add The tent remained in this land and was still here\add* when \add King\add* David ruled.
\v 46 David pleased God, and he asked God to let him build a house where \add he and\add* all of our Israelite people could worship God.

\v 44 Our forefathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness, just as God  commanded when he spoke to Moses, that he
should make it like the pattern that he had seen.
\v 45 This is the tent that our forefathers, in their turn, brought into the land with Joshua. This happened when they entered in on the possession of the nations that God drove out before the presence of our forefathers. It was like this until the days of David,
\v 46 who found favor in the sight of God; he asked to find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.
