\v 45 \add Later on\add*, other ancestors of ours carried that tent with them when Joshua led them \add into this land\add*. That was during the time that they took this land for themselves, when God forced the people \add who previously lived here\add* to leave. So the Israelites were able to possess this land. \add The tent remained in this land and was still here\add* when \add King\add* David ruled.

\v 44 Our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness, just as God commanded when he spoke to Moses, that he should make it like the pattern that he had seen.
\v 45 This is the tent that our fathers took possess of, and they brought it into the land with Joshua. In the presence of our fathers, the possessions of the nations that God had driven out of the land were taken as their own possessions. The tent remained in the land until the time of David, 
\v 46 and he found favor in the sight of God and asked if he might find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.
