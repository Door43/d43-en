===== Translation Notes: =====

Stephen continues his defense before the Jewish council that he began in [[:en:bible:notes:act:07:01|7:2]].

  * **Sirs, you are brothers**  - This is addressing the two israelites fighting.
  * **wronged** - To wrong someone is to treat that person unjustly or dishonestly.
  * **Who made you a ruler and a judge over us? **  - This a rhetorical question was used to rebuke Moses. It means "You have no authority over us!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **judge over us? **  - The Israelite excluded Moses as part of them.
