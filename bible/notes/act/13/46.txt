\v 46 Then, speaking very boldly, Paul and Barnabas said to those Jewish leaders, "We had to speak the message from God about Jesus to you Jews first before we proclaim it to non-Jews, because God commanded us to do that. But you are rejecting God's message. By doing that, you have shown that you are not worthy of eternal life. Therefore, we are leaving you, and now we will go to the non-Jewish people to tell them the message from God.
\v 47 We are doing this also because the Lord God has commanded us to do it. He said in the scriptures,
\q 'I have chosen you to reveal things about me to non-Jewish people that will be like a light to them. I have chosen you to tell people everywhere in the world the message that I want to save them.'"

\v 46 But Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and said, "It was necessary that the word of God should first be spoken to you. Seeing you push it away from yourselves and consider yourselves unworthy of eternal life, see, we will turn to the Gentiles.
\v 47 For so has the Lord commanded us, saying,
\q 'I have placed you as a light for the Gentiles,
\q that you should bring salvation to the uttermost parts of the earth.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The first two instances of the word "you" are plural and refer to the Jews to whom Paul is speaking.
  * **General Information:** - Here the word "we" refers to Paul and Barnabas but not the crowd that was present. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **General Information:** - Paul's quotation is from the prophet Isaiah in the Old Testament. In the original passage, the word "I" refers to God and the word "you" is singular and refers to the Messiah. Here, Paul and Barnabas seem to be saying that the quotation also refers to their ministry. 

  * **It was necessary** - This implies that God had commanded this be done. AT: "God commanded" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **that the word of God should first be spoken to you** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "that we speak the word of God to you first" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Seeing you push it away from yourselves** - Their rejection of the word of God is spoken of as if it were something they pushed away. AT: "Since you reject the word of God"
  * **consider yourselves unworthy of eternal life** - "have shown that you are not worthy of eternal life" or "act as though you are not worthy of eternal life"
  * **we will turn to the Gentiles** - Here "turn" refers to a change in to whom they would teach. AT: "we will now tell the message to the Gentiles"
  * **as a light** - Here the truth about Jesus that Paul was preaching is spoken of as if it were a light that allowed people to see. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **bring salvation to the uttermost parts of the earth** - The abstract word "salvation" can be translated with the verb "to save." The phrase "uttermost parts" refers to everywhere. AT: "tell people everywhere in the world that I want to save them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
