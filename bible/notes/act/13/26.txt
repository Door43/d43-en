\v 26 Brothers, children of the line of Abraham, and those among you who worship God, it is to us that the message about this salvation has been sent.
\v 27 For they who live in Jerusalem, and their rulers, did not really know him, nor did they really understand the voices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath; so they fulfilled the prophets' messages by condemning Jesus to death.
