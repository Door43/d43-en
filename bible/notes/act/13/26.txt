\v 27 The people who were living in Jerusalem and their rulers did not realize that this man Jesus was the one whom God had sent to save them. Although messages from the prophets were read aloud every Sabbath, they did not understand what the prophets wrote about the Messiah. So the Jewish leaders condemned Jesus to die, which was just what the prophets predicted.

<usfm>
\v 26 Brothers, children of the line of Abraham, and those among you who worship God, it is to us that the message about this salvation has been sent.
\v 27 For they who live in Jerusalem, and their rulers, did not really know him, nor did they really understand the voices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath; so they fulfilled the prophets' messages by condemning Jesus to death.
