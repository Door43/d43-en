\q 'You who ridicule me, you will certainly be astonished when you see what I am doing, and then you will be destroyed. You will be astonished because I will do something terrible to you while you are living. You would not believe that I would do that even though someone told you!'"

\q For I am doing a work in your days,
\q A work that you shall never believe, even if someone announces it to you.'"
