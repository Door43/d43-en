\v 35 So in writing another Psalm, David said this to God about the Messiah: 'Because I am devoted to you and always obey you, when I die you will not let my body decay.'
\v 36 While David was living, he did what God wanted him to do. And when he died, his body was buried, as his ancestors' bodies had been buried, and his body decayed. So he could not have been speaking about himself in this Psalm.
\v 37 Instead, he was speaking about Jesus. Jesus also died, but God raised him from the dead, and therefore his body did not decay."

\v 35 This is why he also says in another psalm, 

\q 'You will not allow your Holy One to experience decay.'

\v 36 For after David had in his own generation served the desires of God, he fell asleep, was laid with his fathers, and experienced decay,
\v 37 but he whom God raised up experienced no decay.
