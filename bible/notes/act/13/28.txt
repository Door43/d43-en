===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Paul continues to speak.)
  * **they** - Multiple "they" refers to the Jewish leaders
  * **him** - Multiple "him" refers to Jesus
  * **they found no good cause for death** - The Jewish leaders just wanted to kill Jesus for no good reason. This can be translated as, "the Jewish leaders found no good reason for Jesus to die."
  * **they asked Pilate** - The word "asked" here is a strong word meaning to demand, beg or plead for.
  * **When they had completed all the things that were written about him** - "When the Jewish leaders did all the things to Jesus that were written in the books of the prophets including Jesus dying"
  * ** they took him down from the tree** - "Some of the leaders took Jesus down from the cross after Jesus died"
