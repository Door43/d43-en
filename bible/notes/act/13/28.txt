===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Here the word "they" refers to the Jewish people and their religious leaders in Jerusalem. The word him" here refers to Jesus.

  * **they found no good cause for death** - "they did not find any reason why Jesus should be killed"
  * **they asked Pilate** - The word "asked" here is a strong word meaning to demand, beg or plead for.
  * **When they had completed all the things that were written about him** - "When thy did to Jesus all the things that the prophets said would happen to him"
  * **they took him down from the tree** - It may be helpful to explicitly say Jesus died before this happened. AT: "they killed Jesus and then took him down from the cross after he died" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **from the tree** - "from the cross." This was another way people at that time referred to the cross. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
