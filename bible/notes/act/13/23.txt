\v 23 From this man's descendants God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised to do.
\v 24 This began to happen when, before Jesus came,  John first announced the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
\v 25 As John was finishing his work, he said, 'Who do you think I am? I am not the one. But listen, one is coming after me, the shoes of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.'
