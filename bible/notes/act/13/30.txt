===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But God raised him** - "But" indicates a strong contrast between what the people did and what God did.
  * **raised him from the dead ones** - "raised him from the ones that were dead." To be with "the dead ones" means that Jesus was dead.
  * **raised** - "made alive again"
  * **He was seen ... Galilee to Jerusalem** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "The disciples who traveled with Jesus from Galilee to Jerusalem saw him for many days" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **many days** - We know from other writings that this period was 40 days. Translate "many days" with a term that would be appropriate for that length of time.
  * **are now his witnesses to the people** - "are now testifying to the people about Jesus"
