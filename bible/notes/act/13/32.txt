\v 32 So we are bringing you good news about the promises made to our forefathers:
\v 33 God has kept these promises to us, their children, in that he raised up Jesus from the dead. This is also what was written in the second psalm:
\q 'You are my Son, today I have become your Father.'
\v 34 Also about the fact that he raised him up from the dead so that his body will not decay, he has spoken like this: 
\q 'I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.'
