===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Now in the assembly in Antioch **  - "At that time in the church at Antioch"
  * **Symeon (called Niger), Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen (the foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch)**  - (See: How to translate names)
  * **foster-brother of Herod **  - Manaen was probably Herod's playmate or close friend growing up.
  * **Set apart for me**  - "Appoint to serve me" or "sanctify"
  * **Have called them-**  The verb here means that God chose them before now to do this work.
  * **assembly**  - "congregation" or "group of believers"
  * **laid their hands on these men**  - "laid their hands on those set apart for God's service". There is no evidence of spiritual gifts being imparted through laying on of hands in this instance. But this was elders custom of affirming the Holy Spirit's calling on Barnabas and Saul.
  * **sent them off**  - "sent those men off" or "sent those men off to do the work the Holy Spirit told them to do"
