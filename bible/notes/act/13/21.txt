\v 21 After this, the people asked for a king, so God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for the time of forty years.
\v 22 Then after God removed him from the kingship, he raised up David to be their king. It was about David that God said, 'I have found David the son of Jesse to be a man after my heart; he shall do everything I desire.'
