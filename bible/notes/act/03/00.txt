=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "You delivered up" ==
There are many references to the "men of Israel" as "you." While it is true that the leaders of Israel were responsible for these events, ultimately it was Jesus' choice to be delivered up and the need for his death was the sin of mankind. Therefore, the author is not bringing judgment upon these people, but is urging repentance for their condemnation of Jesus. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sin|Sin]], [[:en:obe:kt:judge|judgment]], [[:en:obe:kt:repent|repentance]] and [[:en:obe:kt:condemn|condemnation]])
