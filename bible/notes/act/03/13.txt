\v 13 So I will tell you what is really happening. Our ancestors, including Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, worshiped God. And now God has greatly honored Jesus. Your leaders brought Jesus to the governor, Pilate, so that his soldiers would execute him. You were the ones who rejected Jesus in the presence of Pilate, after Pilate had decided that he should release Jesus.
\v 14 Although Jesus was God's own Messiah of Israel, the Righteous One, you asked for a killer to be set free instead of him!

<usfm>
\v 13 The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus. He is the one whom you delivered up and rejected before the face of Pilate, when he had decided to release him.
\v 14 You rejected the Holy and Righteous One, and you asked instead for a murderer to be released to you.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Peter continues speaking to the crowd.)
  * **whom you delivered up** - "whom  you brought to Pilate"
  * **and denied before the face of Pilate** - "and you rejected him in Pilate's presence"
  * **when he had decided to release him** - "when Pilate had decided to set Jesus free"
  * **for a murderer to be released to you** - This can be translated with an active verb: "for Pilate to give a murderer to you." 
  * **to be released to you**  - "to be given to you." This means "to be given as a favor." It does not mean "to be freed" as from a trap.
