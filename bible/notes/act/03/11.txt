\v 11 As he was holding on to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly marveling.

  * **General Information:** - Here the words "us" and "we" refer to Peter and John but not to the crowd to whom  Peter is talking. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
