<usfm>
\v 15 God considers that you killed Jesus, the one who gives people eternal life. But God has caused him to become alive again. We saw Jesus many times after he became alive again.
\v 16 It is because this man trusts in Jesus that he is strong again and able to walk in front of you all."

<usfm>
\v 15 You killed the Founder of life, whom God raised from the dead—and we are witnesses of this.
\v 16 Now, by faith in his name—this man whom you see and know—this same name made him strong. The faith that is through Jesus gave to him this complete health in the presence of all of you.
