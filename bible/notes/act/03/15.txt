===== Translation Notes: =====

Peter continues his speech to the Jews that he began in [[:en:bible:notes:act:03:11|3:13]].

  * **Prince of life**  - "The author of life" (UDB) or "ruler of life"
  * **has made this man strong**  - "has given this man complete health"
  * **faith in his name**  - Languages that don't have a noun meaning "faith" might need to use a verb meaning believe or trust. If they need to tell who believed, they can specify "we."
