\v 24 Yes, and all the prophets from Samuel and those  who followed after him, all who spoke, they also told of these days.
\v 25 You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your ancestors, as he said to Abraham, 'In your seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.'
\v 26 After God raised up his Servant, he sent him to you first, in order to bless you by turning every one of you from your wickedness."
