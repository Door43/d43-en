<usfm> \v 24 Peter continued, "All the prophets have told about what would happen during these days. Those prophets include Samuel and all the others who later also spoke about these events before they happened. \v 25 When God strongly promised to bless our ancestors, he also surely promised to bless you. He said to Abraham about the Messiah, 'I will bless all the people-groups on the earth as a result of what your descendant will do.'" \v 26 Peter concluded, "So when God sent Jesus to the earth to serve him as Messiah, the one who always obeys God, he sent him first to you Israelites to bless you, in order to stop you doing what is wicked." </usfm>

<usfm> \v 24 Yes, and all the prophets from Samuel and those who followed after him, all who spoke, they also told of these days. \v 25 You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your ancestors, as he said to Abraham, 'In your seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.' \v 26 After God raised up his Servant, he sent him to you first, in order to bless you by turning every one of you from your wickedness." </usfm>
