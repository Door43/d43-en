\v 4 So Paul reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath. He persuaded both Jews and Greeks.
\v 5 But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was compelled by the Spirit to testify to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.
\v 6 When the Jews opposed and insulted him, Paul shook out his garment at them and said to them, "May your blood
be upon your own heads; I am innocent. From now on I will go to the Gentiles."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **reasoned ** - "debated" or "discussed" or "asked and answered questions" There is more interaction from the listeners than in preaching.
  * **He persuaded** - This can also be translated as "He kept trying to persuade."
  * **was compelled by the Spirit ** - The text has “compelled by the word or message."
  * **shook out his garment** - This is a symbolic action to indicate that Paul is cutting ties with the unbelieving Jews and leaving them to God's judgment.
  * **"May your blood be upon your own heads; ** - This is a metaphor. It means that the Jews are solely responsible for the judgment they will face for their stubbornness if they refuse to repent. (See: [[en:ta:translate:Metaphor]])
