\v 4 Every Sabbath, Paul went to the Jewish meeting place, where he spoke to both Jews and non-Jews. He taught them about Jesus.
\p
\v 5 When Silas and Timothy came from the region of Macedonia, Paul was strongly moved by the Spirit to tell the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.
\v 6 But the Jews began to turn against Paul and to say evil things about him. So he shook the dust from his clothes and he said to them, "If God punishes you, it is your responsibility, not mine! From now on I will talk to those who are not Jewish!"

\v 4 So Paul reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath. He persuaded both Jews and Greeks.
\v 5 But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was compelled by the Spirit to testify to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.
\v 6 When the Jews opposed and insulted him, Paul shook out his garment at them and said to them, "May your blood be upon your own heads; I am innocent. From now on I will go to the Gentiles."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Silas and Timothy rejoin Paul.

  * **So Paul reasoned** - "So Paul debated" or "So Paul discussed." He gave reasons. This means that rather than just preaching, Paul talked and interacted with the people. 
  * **He persuaded both Jews and Greeks** - Possible meanings are 1) "He caused both Jews and Greeks to believe" or 2) "He kept trying to persuade the Jews and the Greeks."
  * **Paul was compelled by the Spirit** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the Spirit compelled Paul" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **shook out his garment** - This is a symbolic action to indicate that Paul will no longer try to teach the Jews there  about Jesus. He is leaving them to God's judgment. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **May your blood be upon your own heads** - Here "blood" stands for the guilt of their actions. Here "heads" refers to the whole person. Paul tells the Jews they are solely responsible for the judgment they will face for their stubbornness if they refuse to repent. AT: "You alone bear the responsibility for your punishment for sin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
