\v 24 While Paul was going through Galatia and Phrygia, a Jewish man named Apollos came to Ephesus. He was from the city of Alexandria and spoke very well about the Scriptures.
\v 25 Other believers had taught Apollos how the Lord Jesus wanted people to live, and he taught those things to the people. However, he was not teaching everything about Jesus, because he only knew about the baptism of John the Baptizer.
\v 26 Apollos went to the Jewish meeting place, and he told the people there about the things that he had learned. When Priscilla and Aquila heard what he taught, they asked him to come to their home where they taught him more about Jesus.

\v 24 Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, came to Ephesus. He was eloquent in speech and mighty in the Scriptures.
\v 25 Apollos had been instructed in the teachings of the Lord. Being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, but he knew  only the baptism of John.
\v 26 Apollos began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they befriended him and explained to him the way of God more accurately.
