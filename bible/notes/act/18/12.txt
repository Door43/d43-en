  * **Gallio** - This is the name of a man. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Achaia** - This was a Roman province where Corinth was located. Achaia is modern-day southern Greece. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|How to Translate Names]])

  * **rose up together** - "came together" or "joined together"
  * **brought him before the judgment seat** - The Jews took Paul by force and brought Paul before the court. Here "judgment seat" refers to where Gallio sat when he made legal decisions in court. AT: "took him so that the governor could judge him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **contrary to the law** - Possible meanings are 1) the Jewish leaders are referring specifically to the Jewish law (UDB) or 2) the Jews are purposely making Paul's offenses against Jewish laws and customs sound like crimes against Roman law.
