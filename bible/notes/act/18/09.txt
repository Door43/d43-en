  * **speak and do not be silent** - The Lord gives the same command in two different ways to strongly command Paul to speak.  AT: "you must certainly continue to speak" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet|Doublet]])
  * **do not be silent** - It can be stated explicitly what the Lord wants Paul to speak. AT: "do not stop speaking about the gospel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **I have many people in this city** - "there are many people in this city who have put their faith in me" or "many people in this city will put their faith in me"
