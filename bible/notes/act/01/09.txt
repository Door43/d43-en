\v 10 While the apostles were still staring towards the sky as he was going up, suddenly two men wearing white clothes stood beside them. They were angels.
\v 11 One of them said, "You men from Galilee, you do not need to stand here any longer looking up at the sky! Some day this same Jesus, whom God took from you up to heaven, will come back to earth. He will return in the same manner as you just now saw him go when he went up to heaven."

\v 9 When the Lord Jesus had said these things, as they were looking up, he was raised up, and a cloud hid him from their eyes.
\v 10 While they were looking intensely to heaven as he went, suddenly, two men stood by them in white clothing.
\v 11 They said, "You men of Galilee, why do you stand here looking into heaven? This Jesus who ascended up into heaven will return in the same manner as you saw him going into heaven."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **as they were looking up**  - "as the apostles were looking up at the sky"
  * **he vanished into a cloud out of their sight**  - "He went up into the sky, and a cloud blocked their view of him and they could not see Him anymore."
  * **looking intensely to heaven**  - "staring at the sky" or "gazing at the sky"
  * **You men of Galilee**  - Specifically "you apostles." Though the angels spoke to the apostles, other verses suggest that other disciples, both men and women, were present at this event.
  * **why do you stand looking into heaven?**  - This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement as in the UDB. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
