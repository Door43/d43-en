===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **as they were looking up**  - "as the apostles were looking up at the sky"
  * **he vanished into a cloud out of their sight** - "He went up into the sky, and a cloud blocked their view of him and they could not see Him anymore."
  * **looking intensely to heaven**  - "staring at the sky" or "gazing at the sky"
  * **You men of Galilee** - Specifically "you apostles". Though the angels spoke to the apostles, other verses suggest that other disciples, both men and women,  were present at this event.
  * **why do you stand looking into heaven?**  - This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement as in the UDB. (See:  [[en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion]])
