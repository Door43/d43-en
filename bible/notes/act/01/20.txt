\v 20 Peter also said, "I see that what happened to Judas is like what the Psalms says: 'May his family line die out; may there be no one left in it at all.' ' And it seems that these other words that David wrote also refer to Judas: 'Let someone else take over his work as a leader.'"

===== Translation Notes: =====

Peter continues his speech to the believers that he began in [[:en:bible:notes:act:01:15|1:16]].

  * **For it is written in the book of Psalms** - Based on the situation with Judas that he just recounted, Peter is recalling a passage in the book of Psalms that he believes relates to the current situation.
  * **the book of Psalms** - This can be translated as "the book of Hymns" or "the book of Songs." This book is part of the Scriptures.
  * **Let his field be made desolate** - A property falling apart and overgrown suggests the owner is dead.
  * **And do not let even one person live there** - The land is unclean (taboo) or is unfit to live on.
  * **let someone else take his position of leadership**  - "may he be replaced in his leadership position"
