\v 17 Although Judas was an apostle like us, he guided the people who arrested Jesus and killed him."
\p
\v 18 Now this man earned money by doing this evil. With this money he bought a field. Then he fell there onto the ground, his body split wide open, and all his intestines fell out.
\v 19 All the people who reside in Jerusalem heard about that, so they called that field according to their own Aramaic language, Akeldama, which means "Field of Blood," because it was where someone died.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - In verse 17 Peter continues his speech to the believers that he began in [[:en:bible:notes:act:01:15|1:16]].
  * **General Information:** - In verses 18-19 the author tells the reader background information about how Judas died and what people called the field where he died. This is not part of Peter's speech. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **General Information:** - Although Peter is addressing the entire group of people, here the word "us" refers only to the apostles. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])

  * **Now this man** - The words "this man" refers to Judas Iscariot.
  * **the earnings he received for his wickedness** - "the money that he earned from the evil thing that he did." The words "his wickedness" refer to Judas Iscariot's betraying Jesus to the people who killed him. (See [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **there he fell headfirst, and his body burst open, and all his intestines poured out** - This suggests that Judas fell from a high place, rather than just falling down. The fall was severe enough to cause his body to burst open. Other passages of scripture mention that he hanged himself. (See [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Field of Blood** - When the people living in Jerusalem heard of the way in which Judas died, they renamed the field.
