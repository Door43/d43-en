\v 1 Dear Theophilus,
\p In my first book that I wrote for you, I wrote about many of the things that Jesus did and taught
\v 2 until the day on which God took him up to heaven. Before he went to heaven, he told the apostles by the power of the Holy Spirit the things that he wanted them to know.
\v 3 After he had suffered and died on the cross, he became alive again. As he appeared often during the next forty days, the apostles saw him many times. He proved to them in many ways that he was alive again. He talked with them about how God would rule the lives of people in his kingdom.

\v 1 The former book I wrote, Theophilus, told all that Jesus began to do and to teach,
\v 2 until the day that he was received up. This was after he had given a command through the Holy Spirit to his chosen apostles,
\v 3 the ones to whom he appeared alive after his suffering. For forty days he kept appearing to them, saying things about the kingdom of God.
