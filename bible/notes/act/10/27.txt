\v 29 So when you sent some men to ask me to come here, I came right away without objection. So, please tell me, why have you asked me to come here?"

\v 27 While Peter was talking with him, he went in and found many people gathered together.
\v 28 He said to them, "You yourselves know that it is not lawful for a Jewish man to associate with or to visit someone from another nation. But God has shown me that I should not call any man defiled or unclean.
\v 29 That is why I came without arguing, when I was sent for. So I ask you why you sent for me."
