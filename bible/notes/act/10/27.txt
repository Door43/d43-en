\v 27 While he was talking to Cornelius, Peter and the others entered the house and saw that many people had gathered together there.
\v 28 Then Peter said to them, "You all know that any of us Jews think we are disobeying our Jewish laws if we associate with those who are descendants of non-Jewish parents or if we even visit in their homes. However, God has shown me in a vision that I should not say anyone is so defiled and unclean that God would not accept him.
\v 29 So when you sent some men to ask me to come here, I came right away without objection. So, please tell me, why have you asked me to come here?"

\v 27 While Peter was talking with him, he went in and found many people gathered together.
\v 28 He said to them, "You yourselves know that it is not lawful for a Jewish man to associate with or to visit someone from another nation. But God has shown me that I should not call any man defiled or unclean.
\v 29 That is why I came without arguing, when I was sent for. So I ask you why you sent for me."
