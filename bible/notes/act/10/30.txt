\v 30 Cornelius said, "Four days ago at this very hour, I was praying at the ninth hour in my house; and see, a man stood before me in bright clothing.
\v 31 He said, 'Cornelius, your prayer has been heard by God, and your gifts to the poor have reminded God about you.
\v 32 So send someone to Joppa, and call to you a man named Simon, who is also called Peter. He is staying in the house of a tanner named Simon, by the seaside.'
