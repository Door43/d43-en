\v 30 Cornelius replied, "About this time three days ago I was praying to God in my house, as I regularly do at three o'clock in the afternoon. Suddenly a man whose clothes shone brightly stood in front of me
\v 31 and said, 'Cornelius, God has heard your prayer. He has also noticed that you have often given money to help poor people, and he is pleased with that.
\v 32 So now, send messengers to go to the city of Joppa in order to ask Simon whose other name is Peter to come here. He is staying near the ocean in a house that belongs to another man named Simon, who makes leather.'

\v 30 Cornelius said, "Four days ago at this very hour, I was praying at the ninth hour in my house; and see, a man stood before me in bright clothing.
\v 31 He said, 'Cornelius, your prayer has been heard by God, and your gifts to the poor have reminded God about you.
\v 32 So send someone to Joppa, and call to you a man named Simon who is called Peter. He is staying in the house of a tanner named Simon, by the seaside.'
\f + \ft Some ancient copies add:
\fqa When he comes, he will speak to you. \f*

\v 33 So at once I sent for you. You are kind to have come. Now then, we are all here present in the sight of God, to hear everything that you have been instructed by the Lord to say."
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa instructed by the Lord to say \fqa*  ,  some ancient copies have,
\fqa instructed by God to say. \f*

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Cornelius responds to Peter's question. 
  * **General Information:** - In verses 31 and 32 Cornelius quotes what the angel had said to him when he appeared to him at the ninth hour.
  * **General Information:** - The words "you" and "your" are all singular. The word "we" here does not include Peter. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])

  * **Four days ago** - Cornelius is referring to the day before the third night before he is speaking to Peter. Biblical culture counts the current day, so the day before three nights ago is "four days ago." Current Western culture does not count the current day, so many Western translations read, "three days ago."
  * **praying** - Some ancient authorities say "fasting and praying" instead of simply "praying." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_textvariants]])
  * **at the ninth hour** - The normal afternoon time that the Jews pray to God.
  * **your prayer has been heard by God** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God has heard your prayer" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **reminded God about you** - "brought you to God's attention." This does not imply that God had forgotten.
  * **call to you a man named Simon who is called Peter** - "tell Simon who is also called Peter to come to you"
  * **at once** - "right away"
  * **You are kind to have come** - This expression is a polite way of thanking Peter for coming. AT: "I certainly thank you for coming" 
  * **in the sight of God** - This refers to the presence of God.
  * **that you have been instructed by the Lord to say** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "that the Lord has told you to say" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
