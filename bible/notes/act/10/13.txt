\v 13 Then he heard God say to him, "Peter, stand up, kill some of these and eat them!"
\v 14 But Peter replied, "Lord, surely you do not really want me to do that since I have never eaten anything that our Jewish law says is unacceptable to you or something that we must not eat!"
\v 15 Then Peter heard God talk to him a second time. He said, "I am God, so if I have made something acceptable to eat, do not say that it is not acceptable to eat!"
\v 16 This happened three times. Immediately after that, the sheet with the animals and birds was then pulled back into the sky.

\v 13 Then a voice spoke to him: "Rise, Peter, kill and eat."
\v 14 But Peter said, "Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that was defiled and unclean."
\v 15 But the voice came to him again a second time: "What God has cleansed, do not call it defiled."
\v 16 This happened three times; then the container was immediately taken back up into the sky.

  * **Lord** - Peter used the term for respect that could be translated as "Lord" or "Sir."
  * ** I have never eaten anything that was defiled and unclean.** - It is implied that the animals presented were unclean as defined by the Law of Moses and were not to be eaten. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
