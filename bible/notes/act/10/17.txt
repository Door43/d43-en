===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Peter was very confused** - This means that Peter was having difficulty understanding what the vision meant.
  * **behold** - The word "behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows, in this case, the two men standing at the gate.
  * **stood before the gate** - "stood before the gate to the house." It is implied that this house had a wall with a gate in it to enter the property. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **after they had asked their way to the house** - This happened before they arrived at the house. This could be stated earlier in the verse, as the UDB does.
  * **They called out** - Cornelius' men remained outside the gate while asking about Peter.
