\v 39 "We all saw the things Jesus did in Jerusalem and around every part of the country of Israel where he lived. His enemies killed him by nailing him to a wooden cross.
\v 40 Then God raised him back to life on the third day after he died, and he made sure that many people would see him alive after he was brought back to life. People were sure it was him who had died, and now they saw with their own eyes, and were fully convinced, that he was alive again.
\v 41 At that time God did not let everyone see him, only those he selected to spend time with him and to eat a meal together in those first days just after God raised him back to life.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 39 We are witnesses of all things that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem—this Jesus whom they killed, hanging him on a tree.
\v 40 This man God raised up on the third day and gave him to be made known,
\v 41 not to all the people, but to the witnesses who were chosen beforehand by God—we ourselves, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.
