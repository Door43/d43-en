\v 39 We are witnesses of all things that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem—this Jesus whom they killed, hanging him on a tree.
\v 40 This man God raised up on the third day and gave him to be made known,
\v 41 not to all the people, but to the witnesses who were chosen beforehand by God—we ourselves, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.
