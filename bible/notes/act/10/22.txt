\v 22 They said, "A centurion named Cornelius, a righteous man and one who worships God, and is well spoken of by all the nation of the Jews, was told by a holy angel of God to send for you to come to his house, so he could listen to a message from you."
\v 23 So Peter invited them to come in and stay with him.
\p On the next morning he got up and went with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The words "They" and "them" here refer to the two servants and the soldier from Cornelius. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:act:10:07|10:7]])

  * **A centurion named Cornelius ... listen to a message from you** - This can be divided into several sentences and stated in active form as the UDB does. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **worships God** - The word for "worship" here has the sense of deep respect and awe.
  * **all the nation of the Jews** - This number of people is exaggerated with the word "all" to emphasize how widely this was known among the Jews. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **So Peter invited them to come in and stay with him** - The journey to Caesarea was too long for them to begin that afternoon.
  * **stay with him** - "be his guests"
