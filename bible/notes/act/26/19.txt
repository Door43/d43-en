\v 19 "So, King Agrippa, I did what God told me in a vision to do.
\v 20 First, I spoke to the Jews in Damascus and those in Jerusalem, and in all the countryside of Judea, and to the non-Jews there also. I told them that they should stop sinning and ask God for help. I told them also that they should do those things that show that they have stopped sinning.


\p
\v 21 It is because I preached this message that some Jews seized me when I was in the temple courtyard and tried to kill me.

\v 19 Therefore, king Agrippa, I did not disobey the heavenly vision;
\v 20 but, to those in Damascus first, and then at Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, I preached that they should repent and turn to God, doing deeds worthy of repentance.
\v 21 For this cause the Jews arrested me in the temple and tried to kill me.
