\v 9 There was a time in the past when I, too, was sure that I should do everything that I could to stop people from believing in Jesus from Nazareth town.
\v 10 So that is what I did when I lived in Jerusalem. I shut up many of the believers in prison, as the chief priests there had given me power to do. And when their people killed believers, I voted in favor of that.
\v 11 Often I punished in all the synagogues. I tried to force them to insult the memory of Jesus. I was angry towards them so much, that I even went to foreign cities to find them.

\v 9 At one time I thought to myself that I should do many things against the name of Jesus of Nazareth. 
\v 10 I did these in Jerusalem; I locked up many of the saints in prison, and I had authority from the chief priests to do this; and when they were killed, I gave my vote against them also.
\v 11 I punished them often in all the synagogues and I tried to make them blaspheme. I was very angry at them and I chased them even to foreign cities.
