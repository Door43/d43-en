\v 24 Before Paul could say anything \add further\add* to defend himself, Festus shouted: "Paul, you are crazy! You have studied too much, and it has made you insane!"
\v 25 But Paul answered, "Your Excellency, Festus, I am not raving \add insanely\add*! On the contrary, what I am saying is true and sensible!
\v 26 King Agrippa knows the things \add that I have been talking about\add*, and I can speak confidently to him \add about them\add*. I am sure that he knows \f + \ft litotes \f* these things, because people everywhere \f + \ft idiom \f* have heard \f + \ft litotes \f* about what happened \add to Jesus\add*."

\v 24 Before Paul could say anything further, Festus shouted out in a loud voice: "Paul, you are crazy! You have studied too much, and it has made you insane!"
\v 25 But Paul answered, "Your Excellency Festus, I am not insane! On the contrary, what I am saying is true and quite  sane!
\v 26 For King Agrippa knows the things that I have been talking about, and I can speak freely to him about them. I am sure that none of these things could have escaped his notice, because none of these things happened in secret."

\v 24 As Paul completed his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, "Paul, you are insane; your great learning makes you insane."
\v 25 But Paul said, "I am not insane, most excellent Festus; but with courage I speak words of truth and soberness.
\v 26 For the king knows about these things; and so, I speak freely to him, for I am persuaded that none of this is hidden from him; for this has not been done in a corner.
