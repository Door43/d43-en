===== Translation Notes: =====

Paul continues to speak.

  * **Do you believe the prophets?** - Paul asks this to remind Agrippa that Agrippa already believed what the Jewish prophets said. Thus Agrippa should accept what Paul is saying about Jesus. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **In a short time would you persuade me and make me a Christian?** - Agrippa is saying there is no way Paul could make him believe in Christ by such a short speech. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
