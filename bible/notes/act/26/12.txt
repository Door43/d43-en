===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 "The chief priests gave me power to arrest believers in Damascus, so I went there. While I was on my way,
\v 13 at about noon I saw on the road a bright light in the sky. It was even brighter than the sun! It shone all around me, and also around those who were traveling with me.
\v 14 We all fell to the ground. Then I heard the voice of someone speaking to me in my own Hebrew language. He said, 'Saul, Saul, why are you hurting me? It is hard to kick like an ox against the shepherd's sharp prodding stick.'
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 While I was doing this, I went to Damascus with authority and orders from the chief priests;
\v 13 and on the way there, at midday, King, I saw a light from heaven that was brighter than the sun and it shone around both me and the men who were traveling with me.
\v 14 When we all fell to the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me that said in the Hebrew language, 'Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick a goad.'

===== Translation Notes: =====

Paul continues to speak.

  * **with authority and orders** - Paul had written letters from the Jewish leaders granting him authority to persecute the Jewish believers.
  * **hard for you to kick a goad** - God compares Paul's resistance to God's plan to an ox kicking against a farmer's prodding stick (UDB). This means it is hard for Paul to escape what God has planned for him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
