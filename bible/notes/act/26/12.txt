\v 12 "The chief priests gave me power to arrest believers in Damascus, and that is where I went. But while I was on my way,
\v 13 at about noon, I saw on the road a bright light in the sky. It was even brighter than the sun! It shone all around me, and also around those who were traveling with me.
\v 14 We all fell to the ground. Then I heard the voice of someone speaking to me in the Hebrew language. He said, 'Saul, Saul, why are you attacking me? It is hard to kick like an ox against the shepherd's sharp prodding stick.'

<usfm>
\v 12 While I was doing this, I went to Damascus with authority and orders from the chief priests;
\v 13 and on the way there, at midday, King, I saw a light from heaven that was brighter than the sun and it shone around both me and the men who were traveling with me.
\v 14 When we all fell to the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me that said in the Hebrew language, 'Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick a goad.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **While I was doing this** - Paul uses this phrase to mark another shift in his defense. He is now telling about when he saw Jesus and became his disciple.
  * **While** - This word is used to mark two events that are happening at the same time. In this case, Paul went to Damascus during the time when he persecuted Christians.
  * **with authority and orders** - Paul had written letters from the Jewish leaders, granting him authority to persecute the Jewish believers.
  * **I heard a voice speaking to me that said** - Here "voice" stands for the person speaking. AT: "I heard someone speaking to me who said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **It is hard for you to kick a goad** - For Paul to resist Jesus and to persecute believers is spoken of as if he were an ox kicking at the sharp stick that a person uses to prod the animal. It means that Paul is only harming himself. AT: "You will only harm yourself like an ox kicking a goad" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
