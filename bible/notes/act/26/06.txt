\v 6 Today I am on trial because I am confidently expecting that God will do what he promised to our ancestors.
\v 7 Our twelve Jewish tribes are also confidently waiting for God to do for us what he promised, as they honor him and worship him, day and night. Honored King, I confidently expect that God will do what he promised, and they also believe that! But it is for what I expect God to do that they say I have done wrong.
\v 8 O King, do you really think that God cannot raise the dead?

\v 6 Now I stand here to be judged because I hope for the promise that God made to our fathers.
\v 7 For this reason our twelve tribes earnestly serve God night and day, and we hope to reach it. It is for this hope the Jews accuse me, O King!
\v 8 Why do you think it to be incredible for God to raise the dead?
