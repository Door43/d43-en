\v 6 Today I am being put on trial \f + \ft Or:\add they\add* are putting me on trial \f* because I am confidently expecting that God will do what he promised our\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* ancestors.
\v 7 Our twelve tribes are \add also\add* confidently waiting for God to do \add for us what he promised\add*, as they respectfully worship him, day and night. \add Respected\add* king, I confidently expect\add that God will do what he promised, and they also believe that! But that is the reason\add* that these Jewish leaders \f + \ft synecdoche \f* are accusing me!
\v 8 You \add people\add* believe that God can cause those who have died to become alive again, so why \add do you refuse to believe that he raised Jesus from the dead?\f + \ft Or: you should not refuse to believe that he raised Jesus from the dead!\add* \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*"

\v 6 Today I am on trial because I am confidently expecting that God will do what he promised to our ancestors.
\v 7 Our twelve Jewish tribes are also confidently waiting for God to do for us what he promised, as they honor him and worship him, day and night. Honored king, I confidently expect that God will do what he promised, and they also believe that! But it is for what I expect God to do that they say I have done wrong.
\v 8 Why would any of you think that God could not raise the dead?

\v 6 Now I stand here to be judged because I look for the promise that God made to our fathers.
\v 7 For this is the promise our twelve tribes hoped to receive as they earnestly worshiped God night and day. It is for this hope, King Agrippa, that the Jews accuse me.
\v 8 Why should any of you think it is incredible that God raises the dead?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Now** - This word marks a shift from Paul discussing his past to talking about himself in the present.
  * **I stand here to be judged** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "I am here, where they are putting me on trial" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **I look for the promise that God made to our fathers** - This speaks about a promise as if it were something a person could look for and see. AT: "I am waiting expectantly for God to do what he promised our forefathers he would do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For this is the promise our twelve tribes hoped to receive** - The phrase "our twelve tribes" stands for the people in those tribes. AT: "This is also what our fellow Jews in the twelve tribes were waiting for" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the promise ... hoped to receive** - This speaks about a promise as if it were an object that can be received. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **worshiped God night and day** - The extremes "night" and "day" mean they "worshiped God continually." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **that the Jews** - This does not mean all the Jews. AT: "that the leaders of the Jews" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Why should any of you think it is incredible that God raises the dead?** - Paul uses a question to challenge the Jews present. They believe God can raise the dead but do not think God brought Jesus back to life. This can be expressed as a statement. AT: "You should not think it is incredible that God brings a dead person back to life." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **any of you** - Here "you" is plural and refers to the Jews at Paul's trial. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
