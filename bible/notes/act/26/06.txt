\v 6 Today I am being put on trial \f + \ft Or:\add they\add* are putting me on trial \f* because I am confidently expecting that God will do what he promised our\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* ancestors.
\v 7 Our twelve tribes are \add also\add* confidently waiting for God to do \add for us what he promised\add*, as they respectfully worship him, day and night. \add Respected\add* king, I confidently expect\add that God will do what he promised, and they also believe that! But that is the reason\add* that these Jewish leaders \f + \ft synecdoche \f* are accusing me!
\v 8 You \add people\add* believe that God can cause those who have died to become alive again, so why \add do you refuse to believe that he raised Jesus from the dead?\f + \ft Or: you should not refuse to believe that he raised Jesus from the dead!\add* \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*"

\v 6 Today I am on trial because I am confidently expecting that God will do what he promised to our ancestors.
\v 7 Our twelve Jewish tribes are also confidently waiting for God to do for us what he promised, as they honor him and worship him, day and night. Honored king, I confidently expect that God will do what he promised, and they also believe that! But it is for what I expect God to do that they say I have done wrong.
\v 8 O King, do you really think that God cannot raise the dead?

<usfm>
\v 6 Now I stand here to be judged because I look for the promise that God made to our fathers.
\v 7 For this reason our twelve tribes earnestly serve God night and day, and we hope to reach it. It is for this hope the Jews accuse me, King!
\v 8 Why do you think it to be incredible for God to raise the dead?

===== Translation Notes: =====

Paul continues to speak.

  * **I stand here to be judged** - "I am here, where they are putting me on trial" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **I look for the promise that God made to our fathers** - Paul hopes for the coming of the Messiah.
  * **we hope to reach it** - "we hope that we will receive what God has promised"
  * **Why do you think it is incredible that God will raise the dead?** - Paul says this to make Agrippa connect what Paul is saying with what Agrippa already believes about how God can resurrect dead people. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
