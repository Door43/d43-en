\v 15 When I went to Jerusalem, the chief priests and \add the other\add* Jewish elders told me that this man had done many things \add against their laws\add*. They asked me to condemn him \add to be executed\add* \f + \ft Or:judge him \add so that people could kill him\add* \f*.
\v 16 But I told them that when someone has been accused \add of a crime, we\add* Romans do not immediately condemn that person\f + \ft Or: declare that person to be guilty \f*. First, we \add command\add* him to stand before the people who are accusing him and to say whether or not he has done those things. \add After that, the judge will decide what to do with\add* him.

\v 13 After several days, King Herod Agrippa arrived at Caesarea, along with his sister Bernice. They had come to pay their respects to Festus.
\v 14 King Agrippa and Bernice stayed many days in Caesarea.  After some time had past, Festus told Agrippa about Paul. He said, "There is a man here whom Felix kept in prison.
\v 15 When I went to Jerusalem, the chief priests and the Jewish elders came before me and asked me to condemn him to death.
\v 16 But I told them that when someone has been accused of a serious crime, it is not a custom for Romans to condemn a person immediately. Instead, we allow the accused man to stand face to face with his accusers and defend himself what they say about him.

\v 13 Now after some days, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to pay an official visit to Festus.
\v 14 After he had been there for many days, Festus presented Paul’s case to the king; he said, "A certain man was left behind here by Felix as a prisoner.
\v 15 When I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews brought charges against this man to me, and they asked for condemnation against him. 
\v 16 To this I answered that it is not the custom with Romans to give up a man as a favor; rather, the accused man should have an opportunity to face his accusers and to make a defense against the charges.”
