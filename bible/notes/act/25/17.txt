\v 17 So those Jews came \add here to Caesarea\add* when I came. I did not delay. The day after \add we\f + \ft exclusive \f* arrived\add*, after I sat down at the place where I make decisions, I \add commanded\add* that Paul be brought \f + \ft Or:\add soldiers\add* to bring Paul \f* into \add the courtroom\add*.
\v 18 The Jewish leaders did accuse him, but the things about which they accused him were not any of the \add evil\add* crimes about which I thought \add they would accuse him\add*.
\v 19 Instead, what they argued about with him were some teachings that \add some\add* Jews believe \add and others do not believe. They argued\add* about a man whose name was Jesus who had died, \add but the man they were accusing, whose name is\add* Paul, kept saying, 'Jesus is alive again.'
\v 20 I did not know what questions to ask \add them, and I did not know how to judge\add* concerning their dispute. So I asked Paul, 'Are you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* willing to go \add back\add* to Jerusalem and have the dispute \add between you and these Jews\add* judged there \f + \ft Or:and \add let me\add* judge there the dispute \add between you and these Jews\add* \f*?'

\v 17 So when those Jews came here to Caesarea, I did not delay the trial at all. The day after they arrived, I sat in the judge's seat and ordered the guard to bring in the prisoner.
\v 18 But when the Jewish leaders told me what the prisoner had done wrong, I did not think that anything they said was serious.
\v 19 Instead, what they argued with him about things in their own religion and about a man whose name was Jesus who had died, but whom Paul said was alive.
\v 20 I did not understand these matters, or how to find out the truth. So I asked Paul, 'Are you willing to go to Jerusalem, so I can judge you there about these things?'

\v 17 Therefore, when they came together here, I did not wait, but the next day I sat in the judgment seat and I ordered the man to be brought in.
\v 18 When the accusers stood up and accused him, I thought that none of the charges that they brought against him were serious.
\v 19 Instead, they had certain disputes with him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus who was dead, whom Paul claims to be alive.
\v 20 I was puzzled about how to investigate this matter, and I asked him if he would go to Jerusalem to be judged there about these things.
