====== Acts 25 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Favor ==
It was highly unusual for the Jewish leaders to try to get a favor from the Roman officials. They often viewed the Gentile leaders as evil. The governor though wanted peace with the Jews, so he sought to gain favor with the Jewish leaders. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:favor|Favor]] and [[:en:obe:kt:evil|evil]]).

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Roman citizenship ==

Men who had Roman citizenship were given many privileges. For example, they could appeal to Caesar if they were accused of a crime. Having Roman citizen was very valuable and people would go to great lengths to attain citizenship. Roman officials could have gotten into trouble for treating a Roman citizen in this way.
