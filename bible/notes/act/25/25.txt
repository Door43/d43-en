\v 25 But \add when I asked them to tell me what he had done, and they told me\add*, I found out that he had not done anything for which he should be executed \f + \ft Or:\add anyone should\add* execute him \f*. However, he has asked that our emperor \add should judge his case\add*, so I have decided to send him to Rome.
\v 26 But I do not know what specifically I should write to the emperor concerning him. That is why I have brought him here. I \add want\add* you all \add to hear him speak\add*, and I especially want you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add*, King Agrippa, to hear him. Then, after we\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* have questioned him, I may know what I should write \add to the emperor about him\add*.
\v 27 It seems to me \add that it would be\add* unreasonable to send a prisoner \add to the emperor in Rome without my\add* specifying the \add things about which people\add* are accusing him."

\v 25 But I found nothing that he had done to deserve death. Even so, he has asked Caesar to judge his case, so I have decided to send him to Rome.
\v 26 But I do not know what exactly  I should write to the emperor about him. That is why I have brought him here to speak to you all, and especially to you, King Agrippa! I have done this so that you may question him. Then I may know what to write to the Emperor.
\v 27 I think that it would be unreasonable to send a prisoner to the Emperor in Rome without telling exactly what were the wrong things people say that he has done."

\v 25 But I learned that he had done nothing worthy of death' but because he called upon the Emperor, I decided to send him.
\v 26 But I do not have something logical to write to Emperor. For this reason, I have brought him to you, especially to you, King Agrippa, so that I might have something to write about the case.
\v 27 For it seems unreasonable for me to send a prisoner and to not also state the charges against him.”
