\v 2 So, after the twelve apostles had heard what they were saying, they summoned all the other believers in Jerusalem to meet together. Then the apostles said to them, "We would not be doing right if we stopped preaching and teaching God's message in order to distribute food to people!
\v 3 So, fellow believers, carefully choose seven men from among you, men whom you know that the Spirit of God directs and who are very wise. Then we will instruct them to do this work.
\v 4 As for us, we will keep on using our time to pray and to preach and teach the message about Jesus."

\v 2 The twelve called the multitude of the disciples to them and said, "It is not right for us to give up the word of God in order to serve tables.
\v 3 You should therefore choose, brothers, seven men from among yourselves, men of good reputation, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.
\v 4 As for us, we will always continue in prayer and in the ministry of the word."
