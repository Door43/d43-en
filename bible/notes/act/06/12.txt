\v 13 They also brought in some men who accused him falsely. These men said, "This fellow keeps saying bad things about this holy Temple and about the laws that Moses received from God.
\v 14 What we mean is that we have heard him say that this Jesus from the town of Nazareth will destroy this Temple and will tell us to obey different customs than Moses taught our ancestors."
\p
\v 15 All the people in the Council room stared at Stephen and saw that his face resembled the face of an angel.

\v 12 They incited the people, the elders, and the scribes, and they confronted Stephen, seized him, and brought him to the council.
\v 13 They brought false witnesses, who said, "This man does not stop speaking words against this holy place and the law.
\v 14 For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs that Moses handed down to us."
\v 15 Everyone who sat in the council fixed their eyes on him and saw his face was like the face of an angel.
