\v 10 So that same night, the believers sent Paul and Silas out of Thessalonica to the town of Berea. When Paul and Silas arrived there, they went to the Jewish meeting place.
\v 11 Most of the Jews in Thessalonica had not been willing to listen to God's message, but the Jews who lived in Berea were very willing to listen, so they listened closely to the message about Jesus. Every day they read the Scriptures for themselves to find out if what Paul said about Jesus was true.
\v 12 Because of Paul's teaching, many of the Jewish people believed in Jesus, and also some of the important non-Jewish women and many non-Jewish men believed in him.

\v 10 That night the brothers sent Paul and Silas to Berea.  When they arrived there, they went into the synagogue of the Jews.
\v 11 Now these people were of a higher mind than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with all readiness of mind, examining the scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.
\v 12 Therefore many of them believed, including some influential Greek women and many men.
