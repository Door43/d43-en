===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - This is the end of the part of the story about Paul in Athens. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_endofstory]])
  * **General Information:** - Here the word "We" refers to the men of Athens. They were talking directly to Paul but not including Paul in their group. Possibly they were just being polite though some really did want to hear Paul again.(See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])

  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Here Luke shifts from Paul's teachings to the reaction of the people of Athens.
  * **the men of Athens** - These are the people who were present at the Areopagus listening to Paul.
  * **some mocked Paul** - "some ridiculed Paul" or "some laughed at Paul." These did not believe it was possible for someone to die and then return to life. 
  * **Dionysius the Areopagite** - Dionysius is a man's name. Areopagite implies that Dionysius was one of the judges at the council of Areopagus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Damaris** - This is the name of a woman. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
