<usfm>
\v 28 As someone has said, '\add It is only\add* because he enables us that we\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* live and move and do \add what we do\add*.' And, as some of your own poets have said, 'We\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* are God's children.'
\p
\v 29 Therefore, because we are God's children, we\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* should not think that he is anything like an image \add that people have made\add* of gold or silver or stone. Those images are designed and skillfully made \f + \ft Or:People design and make those images \f*, \add but they are not alive\add*.

<usfm>
\v 28 For in him we live and move and have our being, just as one of your own poets has said,
\p 'For we also are his offspring.'
\v 29 Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the divinity is like gold, or silver, or stones, sculptured with the art and thought of man.
