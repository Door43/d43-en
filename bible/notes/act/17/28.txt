===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 As someone has said, '\add It is only\add* because he enables us that we\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* live and move and do \add what we do\add*.' And, as some of your own poets have said, 'We\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* are God's children.'
\p
\v 29 Therefore, because we are God's children, we\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* should not think that he is anything like an image \add that people have made\add* of gold or silver or stone. Those images are designed and skillfully made \f + \ft Or:People design and make those images \f*, \add but they are not alive\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 It is because of God that we live, move, and exist, as one of you has said, 'Because we are his chldren.'
\p
\v 29 Therefore, because we are God's children, we should not think that God is like gold, silver, or stone, made into something by man .
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 For in him we live and move and have our being, just as one of your own poets has said,
\p 'For we also are his offspring.'
\v 29 Therefore, since we are God's offspring, we ought not to think that the qualities of deity are like gold, or silver, or stone—images created by the art and imagination of man.
