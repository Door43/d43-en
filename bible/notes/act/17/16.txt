\v 16 Now while Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw the city full of idols.
\v 17 So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and those who worshiped God and also with those he met every day in the marketplace.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This is another part of the story of Paul and Silas' travels. Paul is now in Athens where he is waiting for Silas and Timothy to join him.

  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Here Luke starts to tell a new part of the story.
  * **his spirit was provoked within him as he saw the city full of idols** - Here "spirit" stands for Paul himself. This can be stated in active form. AT: "he became upset because he saw that there were idols everywhere in the city" or "seeing the idols everywhere in the city upset him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **he reasoned** - "he debated" or "he discussed." This means that there is interaction from the listeners rather than only his preaching. They are talking with him as well.
  * **those who worshipped God** - This refers to Gentiles who give praise to God and follow him but do not obey all of the Jewish laws.
  * **in the marketplace** - "in the public square." This is a public place of business, where buying and selling of goods, cattle, or services take place.
