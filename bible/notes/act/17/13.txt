\v 13 But when the Jews of Thessalonica learned that Paul was also proclaiming the word of God at Berea, they went there and stirred up and troubled the crowds.
\v 14 Then immediately, the brothers sent Paul to go to the sea, but Silas and Timothy stayed there.
\v 15 Those who were leading Paul took him as far as the city of  Athens. As they left Paul there, they received from him instructions for Silas and Timothy to come to him as quickly as possible.
