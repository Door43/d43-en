===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He was opening the scriptures** - Possible meanings are 1) to explain the scriptures in a way that people can understand is spoken of as if Paul were opening something so people can see what is inside of it (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) or 2) Paul was literally opening a book or scroll and reading from it.
  * **it was necessary** - "it was part of God's plan"
  * **to rise again** - "to come back to life"
  * **from the dead ones** - "from among the dead ones." The phrase "the dead ones" refers to the spirits of people who have died. To come back from among them means to become alive again.
