===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **babbler **- The word was used to refer to birds picking up seeds and scraps as food.. Used in this context that the philosphers think that Paul is either someone who has bits of information and passing them to others as if an expert or someone who has bits of information he cannot pass on in an understandable way.
  * **What is this babbler trying to say? **- "What is this uninformed individual trying to explain?" or "What is this foolish talker trying to say?"
  * **He seems to be a preacher **- "He seems to be a proclaimer" or "He seems to be in a mission of spreading the message"
  * **Strange gods**  - not in the sense of "odd", but in the sense of "foreign". People in the Roman Empire were suspicious of gods worshipped by foreigners, since they were thought to detract from the traditional heavenly protectors of Rome.
  * **Epicureans**  - They affirm all to be formed by chance and also believe that the gods are too busy being blessed and happy to be bothered with the governance of the universe
