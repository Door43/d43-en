\v 18 But also some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. Some said, "What is this babbler trying to say?" Others said, "He seems to be one who calls people to follow strange gods," because he was proclaiming Jesus and the resurrection.

  * **General Information:** - Here the words "him," "He, "and "he" refer to Paul.

  * **Epicurean and Stoic philosophers** - These people believed all things were formed by chance and that the gods were too busy being happy to be bothered with governing the universe. They rejected the resurrection and wanted only simple pleasures. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|How to Translate Names]])
  * **Stoic philosophers** - These people believed freedom comes from resigning oneself to fate. They rejected a personal loving God and the resurrection. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|How to Translate Names]])
  * **encountered him** - "happened upon him"
  * **Some said** - "Some of the philosophers said"
  * **What is this babbler** - The word "babbler" was used to refer to birds picking up seeds as food. It refers negatively to a person who only knows a little bit of information. The philosophers said Paul had bits of information which were not worth listening to. AT: "What is this uneducated person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Others said** - "Other philosophers said"
  * **He seems to be one who calls people to follow** - "He seems to be a proclaimer" or "He seems to be on a mission to add people to his philosophy"
