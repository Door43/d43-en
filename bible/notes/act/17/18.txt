\v 18 But also some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. And some said, "What is this babbler trying to say?"
Others said, "He seems to be a preacher of strange gods," because he was preaching about Jesus and the resurrection.

  * **And some said** - "And some of the philosophers said"

  * **He seems to be a preacher ** - "He seems to be a proclaimer" or "He seems to be on a mission of spreading the message"
