\v 29 But Peter and the apostles answered, "We must obey God rather than men.
\v 30 The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you killed, by hanging him on a tree.
\v 31 God exalted him to his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.
\v 32 We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him."
