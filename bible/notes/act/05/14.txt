\v 14 Many more men and women started believing in the Lord Jesus, and they joined the group of believers.
\v 15 As a result, people were bringing those who were sick into the streets and laying them on stretchers and mats, in order that when Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on some of them and heal them.
\v 16 Large crowds of people were also coming to the apostles from the towns near Jerusalem. They were bringing the sick and those who were being tormented by evil spirits, and God healed all of them.

\v 14 Still more believers were being added to the Lord, multitudes of men and women,
\v 15 so that they even carried the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches, so that as Peter came by his shadow might fall on some of them.
\v 16 There also came together a great number of people from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those afflicted with unclean spirits, and they were all healed.
