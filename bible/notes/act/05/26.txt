\v 26 So the captain went with the officers, and brought them back, but without violence, for they feared that the people might stone them.
\v 27 When they had brought them, they set them before the council. The high priest interrogated them,
\v 28 saying, "We strictly charged you not to teach in this name, and yet, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and desire to bring this man's blood upon us."
