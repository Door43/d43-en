\v 3 Then Peter said, “Ananias, you let Satan completely control you so that you tried to deceive the Holy Spirit. Why did you do such a terrible thing? You have kept for yourself some of the money you received for selling the land. You did not give us all of it.
\v 4 Before you sold that land, you truly owned it. And after you sold it, the money was still yours. So why did you ever think about doing this wicked thing? You were not trying to deceive only us! No, you tried to deceive God himself!”
\v 5 When Ananias heard these words, immediately he fell down dead. And all who heard about Ananias' death became terrified.
\v 6 Some young men came forward, wrapped his body in a sheet, and carried it out and buried it.

\v 3 But Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back part of the price of the land?
\v 4 While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not in your control? How is it that you thought of this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God.
\v 5 Hearing these words, Ananias fell down and breathed his last. And great fear came upon all who heard it.
\v 6 The young men came forward and wrapped him up, and they carried him out and buried him.
