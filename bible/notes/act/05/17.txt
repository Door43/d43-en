  * **But** - This begins a contrasting story. You may translate this in the way that your language introduces a contrasting narrative.
  * **the high priest rose up** - Here the phrase "rose up" means that the high priest decided to take action, not that he stood up from a seated position. AT: "the high priest took action." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **they were filled with jealousy** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "they became very jealous." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **laid hands on the apostles** - This means that they seized the apostles by force. They would have ordered the guards to do this. AT: "had the guard arrest the apostles." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
