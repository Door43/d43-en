\v 9 Then Peter said to her, "How is it that you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Look, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out."
\v 10 She instantly fell down at his feet, and breathed her last, and the young men came in and found her dead; they carried her out and buried her by her husband.
\v 11 Great fear came upon the whole church, and upon all who heard these things.

  * **breathed her last** - This is a more gentle way of saying that "she died." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **The feet of those** - Here "the feet" refer to the men who buried Ananias. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
