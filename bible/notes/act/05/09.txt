\v 9 Then Peter said to her, "How is it that you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Look, the feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out."

  * **How is it that you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord?** - Peter asks this question to rebuke Sapphira. AT: "You should not have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **you have agreed together** - "the two of you have agreed together"
  * **to test the Spirit of the Lord** - Here the word "test" means to challenge or to prove. They were trying to see if they could get away with lying to God without receiving punishment.
