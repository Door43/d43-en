===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Now**  - or "But now". This marks a new part of the story. You need to know how contrasting stories are introduced in your language.
  * **a certain man**  - This is a way of introducing a new person. Check with your language on how people are introduced in a story.
  * **he kept back part of the sale money**  - He was not honest in reporting the full amount of the sale to the apostles. This implied information can be made explicit: "He secretly kept back part of the sale money." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Explicit and Implicit]])
  * **laid it at the apostles’ feet**  - This was the common way for the early believers to give. Putting it at the apostles's feet symbolized giving them the authority over how the gift should be used.
  * **his wife also knew it**-This can also be translated as, "she knew and agreed to do it."
