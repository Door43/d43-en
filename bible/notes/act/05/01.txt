===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Now** - "But now...." This marks a new part of the story. You may translate this in a way that contrasting stories are introduced in your language.
  * **a certain man** - This is a way of introducing a new person. You may translate this in a way people are introduced in a story in your language.
  * **he kept back part of the sale money** - He was not honest in reporting the full amount of the sale to the apostles. This implied information can be made explicit: "He secretly kept back part of the sale money." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **laid it at the apostles' feet**  - Putting a gift at the apostles's feet symbolized giving them the authority over how the gift should be used. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **his wife also knew it** - This can also be translated as, "his wife also knew and agreed to do it."
