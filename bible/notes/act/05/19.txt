\v 19 Yet during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the jail and led them out, and said,
\v 20 "Go, stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this Life."
\v 21 When they heard this, they entered into the temple about daybreak and taught. But the high priest came, and those who were with him, and called the council together, all the elders of the people of Israel, and sent to the jail to have the apostles brought.
