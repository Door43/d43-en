<usfm>
\v 34 We know that David was not speaking about himself because David did not go up into heaven as Jesus did. Besides that, David himself said this about Jesus the Messiah:
\q The Lord God said to my Lord the Messiah, 'Rule here at my right hand,
\v 35 while I completely defeat your enemies.'"
\p
\v 36 Peter ended by saying, "So I want you and all other Israelites to know that God made Jesus both Lord and Messiah, this same Jesus whom you had nailed to a cross and killed."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 34 For David did not ascend to the heaven, but he says,
\q 'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand,
\q
\v 35 until I make your enemies the stool for your feet."'
\m
\v 36 Therefore, let all the house of Israel certainly know that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified."

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Peter finishes his speech to the Jews that he began in [[:en:bible:notes:act:01:15|1:16]].

  * **until I make your enemies the stool for your feet** - This means that God will completely defeat the Messiah's enemies and make them subject to him. AT: "until I make you victorious over all of your enemies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **all the house of Israel** - This refers to the entire nation of Israel. AT: "every Israelite" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
