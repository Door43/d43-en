"Men of Judea and all you who live at Jerusalem, let be this known to you; pay attention to my words.

  * **stood with the eleven**  - All the apostles stood up in support of Peter's statement.
  * **it is the third hour of the day**  - "It is only nine o'clock in the morning" (UDB). Peter expected his audience to know that people don't get drunk that early in the day. It is implicit information that can be made explicit if needed. (See: [[en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit]])
