===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **stood with the eleven**  - All the apostles stood up in support of Peter's statement.
  * **it is the third hour of the day**  - "It is only nine o'clock in the morning" (UDB). Peter expected his audience to know that people do not get drunk that early in the day. It is implicit information that can be made explicit if needed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **third hour of the day**  - "nine o'clock in the morning" (UDB). (See: [[:en:obe:other:biblicaltime|biblical time]])
