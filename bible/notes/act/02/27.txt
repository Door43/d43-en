===== Translation Notes: =====

Peter continues to quote David in the Psalms in his speech to the Jews that he began in [[:en:bible:notes:act:01:15|1:16]].

  * **Your holy one** - "Your anointed or chosen one"
  * **To see decay** - His body will not remain dead long enough to decompose. This may be translated as "to rot."
  * **ways of life** - "life-giving truth"
