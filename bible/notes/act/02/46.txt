\v 46 Every day they continued meeting together in the temple area. They would have a meal together going from house to house, and when they did, they were happy and shared what they had together.
\v 47 As they did so, they kept praising God, and all the other people in Jerusalem respected them. As those things were happening, every day the Lord Jesus increased the number of people who were being saved from the punishment of their sins.
