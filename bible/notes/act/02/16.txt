===== Translation Notes: =====

Peter continues his speech to the Jews that he began in [[:en:bible:notes:act:02:14|2:14]].

  * **this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel**  - "This is what God said and told the prophet Joel to write" or "The prophet Joel wrote these things that God had said."
  * **what was spoken**  - This can be translated with an active verb: "what God said" or "what God spoke about." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:active|Active or Passive]])
  * **It will be in the last days**  - This can be translated as "In the last days." The things that he is about to speak of will happen in the last days. This is the first part of what God said. The words "God says" can come first as in the UDB.
  * **pour out Spirit upon all flesh**  - This is a figure of speech telling how abundantly God will give his Spirit to all people.
  * **all flesh**  - "all people." The word "flesh" refers to people because people are made of flesh. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:synecdoche|Synecdoche]])
