\v 37 When the people heard what Peter and the other apostles said, they knew they had done wrong. The people said to them, "What should we do?"
\p
\v 38 Peter answered them, "Each of you should turn away from your sinful behavior. If you now believe in Jesus we will baptize you. God will forgive your sins, and he will give you his Holy Spirit.
\v 39 God has promised to do this for you and your children, and for all others who believe in Jesus, even those who live far away from here. The Lord our God will give his Holy Spirit to everyone whom he calls to become his people!"

\p
\v 37 Now when they heard this, they were pierced in their hearts, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Brothers, what shall we do?"
\v 38 And Peter said to them, "Repent and be baptized, each of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
\v 39 For to you is the promise and to your children and to all that are far off, as many people as the Lord our God will call."
