\v 22 Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man shown to you by God to be genuine by the mighty deeds, the wonders, and the signs which God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know.
\v 23 This man was handed over by God's predetermined plan and foreknowledge; and you, by the hand of lawless men, put him to death by nailing him to a cross. 
\v 24 But God raised him up, freeing him from the pains of death, because it was impossible for him to be held by it.
