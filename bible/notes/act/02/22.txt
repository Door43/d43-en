\v 23 \add Even though you knew that\add*, you put this man \add Jesus\add* into the hands of his enemies. \add However\add*, God had already planned for that, and he knew all about it.

\v 22 Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man authenticated by God to you by mighty works and wonders and
signs which God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know--
\v 23 because of the determined plan and foreknowledge of God, he was delivered up, and you, by the hand of lawless men, crucified
and killed him;
\v 24 whom God raised up, having loosed the pains of death from him, because it was not possible that he should be held by it.
