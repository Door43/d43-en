\v 22 Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man authenticated by God to you by mighty deeds and wonders and signs which God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know—
\v 23 because of the determined plan and foreknowledge of God, he was delivered up, and you, by the hand of lawless men, crucified and killed him;
\v 24 whom God raised up, having loosed the pains of death from him, because it was not possible that he should be held by it.
