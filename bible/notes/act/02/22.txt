You yourselves know \add that this is true\add*.
\v 23 \add Even though you knew that\add*, you put this man \add Jesus\add* into the hands of his enemies. \add However\add*, God had already planned for that, and he knew all about it. Then you urged men \f + \ft synecdoche \f* who do not obey \add God's\add* law to kill Jesus. They did that by nailing him to a cross.
\v 24 He suffered terribly \add when he died, but God\add* did not let him continue to be dead, because it was not possible for him \f + \ft personification \f* to remain dead. God caused him to become alive again."

\v 22 Peter continued speaking, "My fellow Israelites, listen to me! When Jesus from Nazareth lived among you, God proved to you that he had sent him by making him able to do many amazing miracles that showed that he was from God. You yourselves know that this is true.
\v 23 Even though you knew that, you handed this man Jesus over into the hands of his enemies. However, God had already planned for that, and he knew all about it. Then you urged men who do not obey God's law to kill Jesus. They did that by nailing him to a cross.
\v 24 He died, but God raised him up again, because it was not possible for him  to remain dead. God caused Jesus to become alive again."

\v 22 Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man authenticated by God to you by mighty works and wonders and
signs which God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know--
\v 23 because of the determined plan and foreknowledge of God, he was delivered up, and you, by the hand of lawless men, crucified
and killed him;
\v 24 whom God raised up, having loosed the pains of death from him, because it was not possible that he should be held by it.
