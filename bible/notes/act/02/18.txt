Peter continues to quote the prophet Joel in his speech to the Jews that he began in [[:en:bible:notes:act:01:15|1:16]].

  * **I will pour out my Spirit ** - God gives his Spirit generously.
  * **prophesy** - God inspires them to speak God's truth
  * **vapor** - "mist" or "fog"
  * **pour out** -This is like someone emptying out a lot of water from a pitcher or a bucket. Translate this the same way you did on the last frame.
