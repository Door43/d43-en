Peter continues to quote the prophet Joel in his speech to the Jews that he began in [[:en:bible:notes:act:01:15|1:16]].

  * **servants...female servants** - In the Old Testament, God's prophets and other people who worshiped God are often referred to as his "servants."
  * **I will pour out my Spirit** - God gives his Spirit generously.
  * **prophesy** - God inspires them to speak God's truth.
  * **vapor** - "mist" or "fog"
  * **pour out** - This is like someone emptying out a lot of water from a pitcher or a bucket.
