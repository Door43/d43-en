\v 29 \add Peter\add* continued, "My fellow Jews, I can tell you confidently that \add our royal\add* ancestor, \add King\add* David, died, and that his \add body\add* was buried \f + \ft Or:that \add people\add* buried his \add body\add* \f*. And the place \add where they\add* buried his body is \add still\add* here today.
\v 30 So \add we\f + \ft inclusive \f* know that David was not speaking those words about himself. But\add* because he was a prophet, \add he spoke about the Messiah\add*.

\v 31 David knew beforehand \add what God would do\add*, so he \add was able to\add* say that God would cause the Messiah to live again \add after he died\add*. He said that God would not let the Messiah remain in the place of the dead, nor let his body decay."

\v 29 Peter continued, "My fellow Jews, I am sure that our forefather, King David, died, and that the people buried him. And the place where they buried his body is still here today.
\v 30 King David was a prophet and he knew that God promised to him that one of his descendants would become king.
\v 31 A long time ago, David knew what God would do, so said that God would cause Jesus the Messiah to live again after he died. He said that God would not make Jesus the Messiah remain in the place of the dead, nor let his body waste away."

\v 29 Brothers, I can speak to you confidently about the patriarch David: he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.
\v 30 Therefore, he was a prophet and knew that God had sworn with an oath to him that from the fruit of his loins he would set one upon his throne.
\v 31 He foresaw this and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ: 
    
\q he was neither abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see decay.
