\v 29 Peter continued, "My fellow Jews, I am sure that our forefather, King David, died, and that the people buried him. And the place where they buried his body is still here today.
\v 30 King David was a prophet and he knew that God promised to him that one of his descendants would become king.
\v 31 A long time ago, David knew what God would do, so said that God would cause Jesus the Messiah to live again after he died. He said that God would not make Jesus the Messiah remain in the place of the dead, nor let his body waste away."

\v 29 Brothers, I can speak to you confidently about the patriarch David: he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us
to this day.
\v 30 Therefore, he was a prophet and knew that God had sworn with an oath to him that from the fruit of his loins he would
set one upon his throne.
\v 31 He foresaw this and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ: 
    
\q he was neither abandoned to Hades,
nor did his flesh see decay.
