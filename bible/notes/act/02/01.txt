  * **there came from heaven a sound**  - "a noise came from the sky"
  * **like the rush of a violent wind**  - "like the blowing of a very strong wind" or "like a very strong wind blowing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
  * **the whole house**  - This may have been a house or a larger building.
  * **tongues like fire**  - Possible meanings are 1) tongues that looked like they were made of fire, or 2) small flames of fire that looked like tongues. When fire burns in a small space, such as on a lamp, the flame can be shaped like a tongue. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
