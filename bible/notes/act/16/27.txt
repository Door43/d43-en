  * **was about to kill himself**  - "was ready to kill himself." The jailer preferred to commit suicide rather than suffer the consequences of letting the prisoners escape.
  * **we are all here** - The word "we" is inclusive and refers to Paul, Silas and all of the other prisoners. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
