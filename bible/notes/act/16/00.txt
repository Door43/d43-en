====== Acts 16 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== They "circumcised him" ==
This was not done in an attempt to follow the Law of Moses, but was done because he was ministering in a Jewish context. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|Law of Moses]])

== Divination and Fortunetelling ==
These action were against the law of Moses and were considered to be sinful. This is probably one of the reasons why Paul rebuked this woman, even though she was telling the truth. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sin|Sinful]])
