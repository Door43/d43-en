\v 1 Paul also came to Derbe and to Lystra; and behold, a certain disciple named Timothy was there, the son of a Jewish woman who believed; his father was a Greek.
\v 2 He was well spoken of by the brothers who were at Lystra and Iconium.
\v 3 Paul wanted him  to travel with him; so he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews that were in those parts, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
