\v 1 Paul also came to Derbe and to Lystra; and behold, a certain disciple named Timothy was there, the son of a Jewish woman who believed; his father was a Greek.
\v 2 He was well spoken of by the brothers who were at Lystra and Iconium.
\v 3 Paul wanted him  to travel with him; so he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews that were in those parts, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **behold**  - The word “behold” alerts us to a new person in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this. English uses “There was a man who was…”
  * **the son of a Jewish woman who believed**  - "the son of a Jewish woman who believed in Christ"
  * **He was well spoken of**  - "Timothy had a good reputation" or "the believers said good things about him"
  * **Paul wanted him to travel with him; so he took him**  - "Paul wanted Timothy to travel with him (Paul); so Paul took Timothy". All other third person pronouns (he, him, his) throughout these verses refer to Timothy.
  * **his father was a Greek **  - As a Greek, Timothy's father would not have personally circumcised Timothy; so Paul circumcised him. Circumcision was often performed by a Jewish Rabbi, such as Paul.
