\v 12 From there we went to Philippi, which is a city of Macedonia, the most important city in the district and a Roman colony, and we stayed in this city for  several days.
\v 13 On the Sabbath day we went outside the gate by the river, where we thought there would be a place of prayer.  We sat down and spoke to the women who had come together.
