\v 37 But Paul said to the jailer, "The city rulers told men to beat us in front of a crowd, even though we are Roman citizens, and put us in prison. And now they want to send us away without telling anyone! We will not accept that! Those city rulers must come themselves and free us from prison."
\v 38 So the soldiers went and told the city rulers what Paul had said. When the city rulers heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, they were afraid because they had done the wrong thing.
\v 39 So the city rulers came to Paul and Silas and told them that they were sorry for what they had done to them. The city rulers brought them out of the prison and asked them to leave the city.

\v 37 But Paul said to them, "They have publicly beaten us, men who are uncondemned Romans, and have thrown us into prison; and do they now drive us out secretly? No indeed; let them come themselves and bring us out."
\v 38 The guards reported these words to the magistrates; the magistrates were afraid when they heard that Paul and Silas were Romans.
\v 39 The magistrates came and begged them; and when they had brought them out of prison, they asked Paul and Silas to leave the city.
