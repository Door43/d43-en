===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **said to them ** - "said to the jailer" (UDB) or "said to the persons who came to release them from jail". It seems to be more than one person as the pronoun "them" was used.
  * **They and them** - These pronouns refer to the magistrates or city leaders who ordered that Paul and Barnabas be beaten and imprisoned. (see: [[en:ta:translate:Metonymy]])
  * **No indeed ** - "Definitely not!" Paul is responding here to the magistrates or city leaders, even though he is speaking to the jailor. (See: [[en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit]])
  * **Romans ** - This refers to people from all over the Empire, who had legal citizenship. Among their rights were freedom from torture and the right to have a trial. The city leaders were afraid of what would happen if the Empire learned the city leaders had mistreated Paul and Silas.
  * **Let them come ** - "The city rulers should come."
