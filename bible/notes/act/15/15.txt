\v 15 The words that God spoke long ago, words that were written by one of the prophets, agree with that:
\q
\v 16 Later on I will return and I will choose a king from the descendants of David. It will be like someone who builds a house again after it was been torn down.
\v 17 I will do this in order that all other people might try to know me, the Lord God. This will include even the non-Jews whom I have called to belong to me. You can be certain that this will happen because I the Lord God have spoken these words.
\v 18 I caused my people to know about these things long ago."

<usfm>
\v 15 The words of the prophets agree with this, as it is written, 
\q
\v 16 After these things I will return,
\q And I will build again the tent of David, which has fallen down;
\q I will set up and restore its ruins again,
\q
\v 17 So that the remnant of men may seek the Lord,
\q  including all the Gentiles called by my name.
\q
\v 18 This is what the Lord says, who makes these ancient things known.
