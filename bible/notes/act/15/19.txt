\v 19 \add James continued by saying\add*, "Therefore I have decided \add that we\f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* should stop bothering the non-Jewish people who are turning \add away from their sins and turning\add* to God. \add That is, we should stop demanding that they obey\add* all \add our laws\add* and rituals.
\v 20 Instead, we should write \add a letter\add* to them, \add one requiring only four things: They should\add* not eat \add meat\f + \ft Or: food \f* that people\add* have offered to idols, they should not have sex with someone to whom they are not married, they should not \add eat meat from animals that have been killed by\add* being strangled \f + \ft Or:\add people have strangled\add* \f*, and \add they should not eat\add* the blood \add of animals\add*.
\v 21 In many cities, for a very long time people have been proclaiming \add the laws that\add* Moses \add wrote\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*, \add laws prohibiting those things\add*.

\v 19 James continued to speak. He said, "Therefore I think that we should stop bothering the non-Jewish people who are turning away from their sins and turning to God. That is, we should stop demanding that they obey all our laws and rituals.
\v 20 Instead, we should write a letter to them, requiring only four things: They should not eat meat that people have offered to idols, they should not sleep with someone to whom they are not married, they should not eat meat from animals that have been killed by being strangled, and they should not eat the blood of animals.
\v 21 In many cities, for a very long time people have been proclaiming the laws that Moses wrote, laws prohibiting those things. And every Sabbath those laws are read in the Jewish meeting places. So if the non-Jews want to know more about those laws, they can find out in our meeting houses."

\v 19 Therefore, my opinion is, that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God.
\v 20 But we will write to them that they must keep away from the pollution of idols, from sexual immorality, and from the meat of strangled animals, and from blood.
\v 21 For Moses has been proclaimed in every city from the ancient times and he is read in the synagogues every Sabbath."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - James finishes speaking to the apostles and elders. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:act:15:03|15:2]] and [[:en:bible:notes:act:15:13|15:13]])
  * **General Information:** - Here "we" includes James, the apostles, and the elders. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])

  * **we should not trouble those of the Gentiles** - You can make explicit in what way James does not want to trouble the Gentiles. AT: "we should not require the Gentiles to become circumcised and obey the laws of Moses" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **who turn to God** - A person who starts obeying God is spoken of as if the person is physically turning towards God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **they must keep away from the pollution of idols ... sexual immorality ... strangled ... blood** - Sexual immorality, strangling animals, and consuming blood were often part of ceremonies to worship idols and false gods. 
  * **pollution of idols** - This possibly refers to eating the meat of an animal that someone has sacrificed to an idol or to anything to do with idol worship. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **from the meat of strangled animals, and from blood** - God did not allow Jews to eat meat that still had the blood in it. Also, even earlier in Moses' writings in Genesis, God had forbidden the drinking of blood. Therefore, they could not eat an animal that someone strangled because the blood was not properly drained from the body of the animal. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Moses has been proclaimed in every city ... and he is read in the synagogues every Sabbath** - James is implying that Gentiles know how important these rules are because Jews preach them in every city where there is a synagogue. It also implies the Gentiles can go to the teachers from the synagogues to learn more about these rules. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Moses has been proclaimed** - Here "Moses" represents the law of Moses. This can be stated in active form. AT: "The law of Moses has been proclaimed" or "Jews have taught the law of Moses" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **in every city** - The word "every" here is a generalization. AT: "in many cities" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **and he is read** - Here "he" refers to Moses, whose name here represents his law. AT: "and the law is read" or "and they read the law" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
