\v 19 \add James continued by saying\add*, "Therefore I have decided \add that we\f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* should stop bothering the non-Jewish people who are turning \add away from their sins and turning\add* to God. \add That is, we should stop demanding that they obey\add* all \add our laws\add* and rituals.
\v 20 Instead, we should write \add a letter\add* to them, \add one requiring only four things: They should\add* not eat \add meat\f + \ft Or: food \f* that people\add* have offered to idols, they should not have sex with someone to whom they are not married, they should not \add eat meat from animals that have been killed by\add* being strangled \f + \ft Or:\add people have strangled\add* \f*, and \add they should not eat\add* the blood \add of animals\add*.
\v 21 In many cities, for a very long time people have been proclaiming \add the laws that\add* Moses \add wrote\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*, \add laws prohibiting those things\add*. And every Sabbath\f + \ft Or: Jewish day of rest \f* \add those laws\add* are read \f + \ft Or:someone reads \add those laws\add* \f* in the Jewish meeting places. \add So if the non-Jews want to know more about those laws, they can find out in our meeting houses\add*."

\v 19 Therefore, my opinion is, that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God;
\v 20 but that we write to them that they must keep from the pollution of idols, from fornication, and from what is strangled, and from blood.
\v 21 For Moses from generations of old has people in every city who are preaching and reading him in the synagogues every Sabbath."
