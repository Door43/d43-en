  * **to circumcise them and to command them**  - "them" refers to non-Jewish believers who were not previously circumcised.
  * **to keep the law**  - "to obey the law" or "to follow the law"
  * **to consider this matter**  - "to discuss the difference in beliefs". That is, to debate the different salvation messages between Paul's gospel (salvation in Jesus) and the Pharisee's gospel (salvation in circumcision and law).
