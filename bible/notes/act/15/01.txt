\v 2 Paul and Barnabas strongly disagreed with those Jews and started arguing with them. So the believers at Antioch appointed Paul and Barnabas and some of the other believers to go to Jerusalem, in order that they might discuss this matter with the apostles and other leaders.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting statement:** - Paul and Barnabas are still in Antioch when there is a dispute about the Gentiles and circumcision.

  * **Certain men** - "Some men." You can make explicit that these men were Jews who believed in Christ. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **came down from Judea** - The phrase "came down" is used here because Judea is higher in elevation than Antioch.
  * **taught the brothers** - Here "brothers" stands for believers in Christ. It is implied that they were in Antioch. AT: "taught the believers at Antioch" or "were teaching the believers at Antioch" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Unless you are circumcised after the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Unless someone circumcises you after the custom of Moses, God cannot save you" or "God will not save you from your sins unless you receive circumcision according to the law of Moses" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **after the custom** - "according to the custom" or "following the teaching"
  * **had a confrontation and debate with them** - The abstract nouns "confrontation" and "debate" can be stated as verbs and where the men came from can be made explicit. AT: "had confronted and debated with the men from Judea" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **go up to Jerusalem** - Jerusalem was higher than almost any other place in Israel, so it was normal for Israelites to speak of going up to Jerusalem. 
  * **this question** - "this issue"
