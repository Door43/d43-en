===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Certain men**  - "some men"
  * **came down from Judea**  - "came down from" is less of a literal expression of elevation (Judea being higher in elevation than Antioch), than that of the Jewish world view. The Jews viewed travel to Jerusalem and the temple, as going “up”, and travel away from Jerusalem and the temple as going “down.”
  * **taught the brothers**  - "continued to teach the believers at Antioch" or "were teaching the believers at Antioch"
  * **after the custom**  - "according to the custom" or "following the teaching"
  * **with them **  - "with the men from Judea"
  * **go up to Jerusalem**  - (see note above on "came down…")
  * **this question**  - "this issue"
