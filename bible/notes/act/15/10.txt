\v 10 Why do you want to force the non-Jewish believers to obey our Jewish rituals and laws? Doing that is like putting a heavy burden on them, because it forces them to obey laws that neither our ancestors or we Jews today have ever been able to keep! So then, stop making God angry by doing that!
\v 11 We know that God saves us Jews from our sins because of what the Lord Jesus did for us. God saves us Jews exactly like he saves those non-Jews who believe in the Lord Jesus."

\v 10 Now therefore why do you test God, that you should put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
\v 11 But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they were."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Peter continues to speak.)
  * **why do you test God, that you should put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?**  - This is a rhetorical question where Peter is saying to the Jewish believers that they should not require the non-Jewish believers to follow the law of Moses and specifically circumcision. This could also be translated as "Do not test God by putting a burden on the non-Jewish believers which we Jews were not able to bear!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]]).
  * **neither our fathers nor we**  -Peter is including his audience in the use of "our" and "we." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive|Inclusive]])
  * **But we believe that we shall be saved**  - Peter is including his Jewish audience with himself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive|Inclusive]])
  * **just as they were**  - "just as the non-Jewish believers were"
