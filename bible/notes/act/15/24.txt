<usfm>
\v 24  We have heard that certain men to whom we gave no such commandment, went out from us and  have troubled you with teachings that make trouble for your souls. this is because they were saying that you must be circumcised and keep the law.
\v 25  So it seemed good to all of us to agree to choose men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
\v 26 people who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
