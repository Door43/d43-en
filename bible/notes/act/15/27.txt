<usfm>
\v 27 We have also sent Judas and Silas to you. They will tell you the same things that we are writing.
\v 28 It seemed right to the Holy Spirit and to us that you should not be required to obey a lot of burdensome Jewish laws. Instead, we only require you to obey the following instructions,
\q1
\v 29 You should not eat food that people have sacrificed to idols.
\q1 You should not eat blood from animals, and you should not eat meat from animals that people have killed by strangling them.
\q1 Also, you should not sleep with someone to whom you are not married.
\p If you avoid doing these things, you will be doing what is right. Farewell."

\v 27 We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who will also tell you the same things
\v 28 For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things:
\v 29 that you turn away from things sacrificed to idols, blood, things strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, it shall be well with you. Farewell."
