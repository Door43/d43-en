===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Paul the prisoner called me to him** - "Paul the prisoner asked me to come and talk with him"
  * **this young man ... chief captain took him by the hand** - Since the chief captain took the young man by the hand, this suggests Paul's nephew may have been 12 to 15 years old.
