\v 14 They went to the chief priests and the elders and said, "We have put ourselves under a great curse, to eat nothing until we have killed Paul.
\v 15 Now, therefore, let the council tell the chief captain to bring him down to you, as if you would decide his case more precisely. As for us, we are ready to kill him before he comes here."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **They went** - "The forty Jews went"
  * **We have put ourselves under a great curse, to eat nothing until we have killed Paul** - To make a vow and to ask God to curse them if they do not fulfill their vow is spoken of as if the curse were an object that they carry on their shoulders. AT: "We have sworn to eat nothing until we have killed Paul. And, we asked God to curse us if we do not do what we promised to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Now** - This does not mean "at this moment," but is used to draw attention to the important point that follows. 
  * **therefore** - This word marks a statement that is said because of what was said previously. In this case, the Jews had told the council about their pact.
  * **bring him down to you** - "bring Paul from the fortress to meet with you"
  * **to you** - Here "you" is plural and refers to the chief priests and elders. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **you would decide his case more precisely** - "you want to learn more about what Paul has done"
  * **As for us, we are ready** - Both "us" and "we" refer to the forty Jews who planned to kill Paul. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
