\v 28 I wanted to know what those Jews were saying that he had done wrong, so I took him to their Jewish Council.
\v 29 I listened \add while they asked this man questions and he answered them\add*. The things \add they\add* accused him about were entirely concerned with their \add Jewish\add* laws. But Paul has not disobeyed any of our \add Roman\add* laws. \add So our officials\add* should not execute him or \add even\add* put him in prison \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 30 \add Someone\add* told me that some \f + \ft synecdoche \f* Jews were secretly planning to kill this man, so I immediately sent him to you, \add so that you\f + \ft singular \f* may give him a fair trial there\add*. I have also \add commanded\add* the Jews who have accused him to \add go there to Caesarea and\add* tell you\add \f + \ft singular \f* what they are accusing him about\add*."

\v 28 I wanted to know what those Jews were saying that he had done wrong, so I took him to their Jewish Council.
\v 29 I listened while they asked this man questions and he answered them. The things they accused him about had to do with their Jewish laws. But Paul has not disobeyed any of our Roman laws. So our officials should not execute him or even put him in prison.
\v 30 Someone told me that some Jews were planning to kill this man, so I sent him to you, so that you may give him a fair trial there. I have also commanded the Jews who have accused him to go there to Caesarea and tell you what they are accusing him about. Goodbye."

\v 28 I wanted to know why they accused him, so I took him down to their council.
\v 29 I learned that he was being accused about questions concerning their own law, but that  there was no accusation against him that deserved death or imprisonment.
\v 30 Then it was made known to me that there was  a plot against the man, so I immediately sent him to you, and instructed his accusers also to bring their charges against him in your presence. Farewell."
