===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The chief captain brought Paul down to stand before the chief priests and the council members. [[:en:bible:notes:act:22:30|22:30]].

  * **Brothers** - This means "Fellow Jews."
  * **I have lived before God in all good conscience until this day** - "I know that even to this day I have done everything God has wanted me to do"
  * **Ananias** - This is the name of a man. This is not the same Ananias as in [[:en:bible:notes:act:05:01|5:1]] nor the same Ananias as in [[:en:bible:notes:act:09:10|9:10]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **whitewashed wall** - This refers to a wall that was painted white to make it look clean. Paul told Ananias that just as a wall can be painted to look clean, so Ananias appeared to look morally clean but he was really full of evil intent. AT: "whitepainted wall" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Are you sitting to judge ... law?** - Paul uses a question to point out Ananias' hypocrisy. AT: "You sit there to judge ... law." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **order me to be struck** - This can be stated in active form. Use the same word for "strike" as you did in the phrase "God will strike you." AT: "command people to strike me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
