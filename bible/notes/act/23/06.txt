I have been put \f + \ft Or:\add You\add* have put me \f* on trial \add here\add* because I confidently expect that \add some day God\add* will cause people who have died to become alive again\f + \ft Or: raise people from the dead \f*."
\v 7 When he said that, the Pharisees and Sadducees started to argue with one another \add about whether people who have died will become alive again or not\add*.
\v 8 The Sadducees believe that after people die, they will not become alive again. They also believe that there are no angels and no \add other kinds of\add* spirits.

\v 6 When Paul saw that the one part of the council were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he spoke loudly in the council, "Brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. It is because of the hope for the resurrection of the dead that I am being judged."
\v 7 When he said this, an argument began  between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.
\v 8 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, no angels, and no spirits, but the Pharisees say that all of these exist.
