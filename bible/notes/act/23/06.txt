\v 6 Paul realized that some of the \add Council members\add* were Sadducees and others were Pharisees.

I have been put \f + \ft Or:\add You\add* have put me \f* on trial \add here\add* because I confidently expect that \add some day God\add* will cause people who have died to become alive again\f + \ft Or: raise people from the dead \f*."
\v 7 When he said that, the Pharisees and Sadducees started to argue with one another \add about whether people who have died will become alive again or not\add*.
\v 8 The Sadducees believe that after people die, they will not become alive again. They also believe that there are no angels and no \add other kinds of\add* spirits. But the Pharisees believe \add that all people who have died will one day become alive again. They also believe\add* that there are \add angels and other kinds of spirits\add*.

\v 6 Paul knew that some of the council members were Sadducees and others were Pharisees. So he called out in the council hall, "My fellow Jews, I am a Pharisee, and all in my family were Pharisees, as well. I have been put on trial here because I am sure that one day God will cause those who have died to become alive again."
\v 7 When he said that, the Pharisees and Sadducees started to argue with one another about whether or not people who have died will become alive again, and each of them were arguing with the other.
\v 8 The Sadducees believe that after people die, they will not become alive again. They also believe that there are no angels and no other kinds of spirits. But the Pharisees believe all these things.

\v 6 When Paul saw that the one part of the council were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he spoke loudly in the council, "Brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. It is because I have the certain hope of the resurrection of the dead that I am being judged."
\v 7 When he said this, an argument began between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the crowd was divided.
\v 8 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, no angels, and no spirits, but the Pharisees acknowledge all of them.
