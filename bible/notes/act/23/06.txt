I have been put \f + \ft Or:\add You\add* have put me \f* on trial \add here\add* because I confidently expect that \add some day God\add* will cause people who have died to become alive again\f + \ft Or: raise people from the dead \f*."
\v 7 When he said that, the Pharisees and Sadducees started to argue with one another \add about whether people who have died will become alive again or not\add*.
\v 8 The Sadducees believe that after people die, they will not become alive again. They also believe that there are no angels and no \add other kinds of\add* spirits.

\v 7 When he said that, the Pharisees and Sadducees started to argue with one another about whether or not people who have died will become alive again.
\v 8 The Sadducees believe that after people die, they will not become alive again. They also believe that there are no angels and no other kinds of spirits. But the Pharisees believe all these things.

\v 6 When Paul saw that the one part of the council were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he spoke loudly in the council, "Brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. It is because I confidently expect the resurrection of the dead that I am being judged."
\v 7 When he said this, an argument began  between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.
\v 8 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, no angels, and no spirits, but the Pharisees say that all of these exist.
