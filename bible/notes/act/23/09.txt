\v 9 So a large uproar occurred, and some of the scribes belonging to the Pharisees stood up and argued, saying, "We find nothing wrong with this man. What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?"
\v 10 When there arose a great argument, the chief captain feared that Paul would be torn to pieces by them, so he commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among the council members, and bring him into the fortress.

  * **Paul would be torn to pieces by them** - "they would cause him great physical harm"
  * **take him by force** - "use physical force to take Paul away"
