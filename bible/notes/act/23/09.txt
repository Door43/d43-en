\v 9 They began shouting at one another as they argued. Some of the teachers of the laws who were Pharisees stood up. One of them said, "We think that this man has done nothing wrong. Maybe an angel or some other spirit spoke to him and what he says is true."
\v 10 Then the Pharisees and Sadducees became violent with one another. So the commander was afraid that they would tear Paul to pieces. He told soldiers to go down from the prison and take Paul away from the council members and bring him up into the barracks.

\v 9 So a large uproar occurred, and some of the scribes belonging to the Pharisees stood up and argued, saying, "We find nothing wrong with this man. What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?"
\v 10 When there arose a great argument, the chief captain feared that Paul would be torn to pieces by them, so he commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among the council members, and bring him into the fortress.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **So a large uproar occurred** - "So they began shouting loudly at one another." The word "so" marks an event that happened because of something else that happened previously. In this case, the previous event is Paul's stating his belief in the resurrection. 
  * **What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?** - The Pharisees are rebuking the Sadducees by affirming that spirits and angels do exist and can speak to people. AT: "Maybe a spirit or an angel has spoken with him!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **When there arose a great argument** - The words "a great argument" can be re-stated as "argue violently." AT: "When they began to argue violently" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **chief captain** - a Roman military officer or leader of about 600 soldiers 
  * **Paul would be torn to pieces by them** - This can be stated in active form. The phrase "be torn to pieces" might be an exaggeration of how the people might harm Paul. AT: "they might tear Paul to pieces" or "they would cause Paul great physical harm" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **take him by force** - "use physical force to take him away"
  * **into the fortress** - This fortress was connected to the outer temple court. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:act:21:34|21:34]].
