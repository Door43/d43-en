\v 4 Then the ship set sail from there. We went along the coast of Cyprus, on the side that kept the wind from blowing us the wrong way.
\v 5 After that, we crossed over the sea close to the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia. The ship arrived at Myra, which is in Lycia. We got off the ship there.

\v 3 The next day we landed at the city of Sidon, where Julius treated Paul kindly and allowed him to go to his friends to receive their care.
\v 4 From there, we went to sea and sailed around the island of Cyprus that was sheltered from the wind, because the wind was against us. 
\v 5 When we had sailed across the water that is near Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.
\v 6 There, the centurion found a ship from Alexandria that was going to sail to Italy. He put us in it.
