After that\add*, the wind \add was very strong and\add* did not allow the ship to move straight ahead \add westward. So instead\add*, we sailed \add southward\add* along the side of Crete \add Island that is\add* sheltered \add from the wind\add*, and we passed \add near Cape\add* Salmone.
\v 8 \add The wind was still strong, and it prevented the ship from moving ahead fast\add*. So we moved slowly along the coast \add of Crete\add*, and we arrived at a harbor that was called Fair Havens, near Lasea town.

\v 7 We sailed slowly for many days and came near to Cnidus, but we got there with difficulty, because the winds were against us. After that, the wind was very strong and did not allow the ship to move straight ahead westward. Instead, we sailed along the coast of the Island of Crete, where the wind was not blowing strongly, and we passed near Salmone, a piece of land sticking out into the water.
\v 8 The wind was still strong, and it prevented the ship from moving ahead fast. So we moved slowly along the coast of Crete, and we arrived at a town that was called Fair Havens, near Lasea.

\v 7 When we had sailed slowly for many days and had finally arrived with difficulty near Cnidus, the wind no longer allowed us to go that way, so we sailed along the sheltered side of Crete, opposite Salmone.
\v 8 We sailed along the coast with difficulty, until we came to a certain place called Fair Havens which is near the city of Lasea.
