\v 39 At dawn we could see land, but the sailors did not know where we were. However, they could see a bay and a wide area of sand at the water's edge. They decided to try to run the ship up onto the beach.
\v 40 So they cast off the anchors and let them fall loose into the sea. At the same time, they untied the ropes that fastened the rudders, and they raised the front sail so that the wind would blow into it. They they steered the ship toward the shore.
\v 41 But the ship sailed into turbulent waters and ran hard onto a sandbank that was just under the waves. The front of the ship stuck there and could not move, and big waves beat against the back of the ship, so that it began to break apart.

\v 39 When it was day, they did not recognize the land, but they saw a bay with a beach, and they discussed whether they could drive the ship onto it.
\v 40 So they cut loose the anchors and left them in the sea. At the same time they loosed the ropes of the rudders and raised the foresail to the wind; and so they headed to the beach.
\v 41 But they came to a place where two currents met, and the ship ran into the ground. The bow of the ship stuck there and remained unmoveable, but the stern began to break up because of the waves' violence.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **bay** - a large area of water partly surrounded by land
  * **did not recognize the land** - "saw land but could not recognize it as any place they knew"
  * **cut loose the anchors and left them** - "cut the ropes and left the anchors behind"
  * **rudders** - large oars or pieces of wood at the back of the ship used for steering
  * **the foresail** - "the sail at the front of the ship." The sail was a large piece of cloth that catches the wind, which moves the ship.
  * **they headed to the beach** - "they steered the ship toward the beach"
  * **they came to a place where two currents met** - A current is water flowing in one continuous direction. Sometimes more than one water current can flow across another. This may cause the sand under the water to pile up making the water more shallow.
  * **The bow of the ship** - "The front of the ship"
  * **the stern** - "the back of the ship"
