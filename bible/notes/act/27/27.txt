\v 27 On the fourteenth night after the storm had begun, the ship was still being blown across the Adriatic sea. About midnight, the sailors thought that the ship was getting close to land.
\v 28 So they lowered a rope to measure how deep the water was. When they pulled the rope up again, they measured it and saw that the water was forty meters deep. A little later, they measured again and found thirty meters.
\v 29 They were afraid that the ship might go onto some rocks, so they threw out four anchors from the ship's stern. Then they prayed  that it would soon be dawn so that they could see where the ship was going.

\p
\v 27 When the fourteenth night had come, as we were driven this way and that in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors thought that they were approaching some land.
\v 28 They took soundings and found twenty fathoms; after a little while, they took more soundings and found fifteen fathoms.
\v 29 They were afraid that we might crash on the rocks, so they lowered four anchors from the stern and prayed that morning would come soon.
