\v 30 The sailors were looking for a way to abandon the ship and had lowered the lifeboat into the sea, and pretended that they would throw down the anchors from the bow.
\v 31 But Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, "Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved."
\v 32 Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat and let it drift away.

  * **the lifeboat** - This is a smaller boat that is sometimes pulled behind the ship and sometime it was brought onto the ship and tied down. The smaller boat was used for various reasons, including escaping from a sinking ship. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:act:27:14|27:16]].
  * **from the bow** - "from the front of the ship"
  * **Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved** - The negative words "Unless" and "cannot" can be stated in positive form. The passive phrase "be saved" can be stated in active form. AT: "These men must stay in the ship in order for you to survive" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **you cannot** - Here "you" is plural and refers to the centurion and the Roman soldiers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
