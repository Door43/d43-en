\v 14 But after a while, a wind that was very strong blew across the island \add from the north side and hit the ship. That wind was called\add* \f + \ft Or:\add People\add* called that wind \f* "the Northeast Wind."
\v 15 It blew strongly against the \add front of\add* the ship. The result was that we could not keep going in the direction \add in which we had been going\add*. So the sailors let the wind move the ship in the direction \add that the wind\add* was blowing.
\v 16 The ship then passed a small island named Cauda. We passed along the side \add of the island that\add* sheltered \add the ship from the wind\add*. Then \add while the ship was moving along\add*, the sailors lifted the lifeboat up \add out of the water\add* and tied it \add on the deck. But the strong wind made it\add* difficult even to do that.

\v 14 After a short time, however, a stormy wind blew down from the shore. It blew across the island from the north side and hit the ship. That wind is called Euroclydon, "the Northeast Wind."
\v 15 It blew strongly against the front of the ship, and we could not sail against it. So the sailors let the wind move the ship in the direction that the wind was blowing.
\v 16 The ship then sailed along the coast line of a small island named Cauda. We were able, with difficulty, to fasten the lifeboat securely to the ship.

\v 14 But after a short time a wind of hurricane force, called the northeaster, began to beat down from the island.
\v 15 When the ship was caught by the storm and could no longer head into the wind, we had to give way to the storm and were driven along by the wind.
\v 16 We sailed along the lee of a small island called Cauda, and with difficulty we were able to secure the lifeboat.

  * **after a short time** - "after a little while"
  * **a wind of hurricane force** - "a very strong, dangerous wind"
  * **called the northeaster** - "called 'a strong wind from the northeast.'" The word for "the northeaster" in the original language is "Euroclydon." You can transliterate this word for your language. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_transliterate]])
  * **began to beat down from the island** - "came in from the island of Crete, and it blew strongly against our ship"
  * **When the ship was caught by the storm and could no longer head into the wind** - "When the wind blew so strongly against the front of the ship that we could not sail against it"
  * **we had to give way to the storm and were driven along by the wind** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "we stopped trying to sail forward, and we let the wind push us whichever way it blew" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **We sailed along the lee of a small island** - "We sailed on the side of the island where the wind was not so strong"
  * **a small island called Cauda** - This island was located on the south coast of Crete. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **lifeboat** - This is a smaller boat that is sometimes pulled behind the ship, and sometimes it was brought onto the ship and tied down. The smaller boat was used for various reasons, including escaping from a sinking ship.
