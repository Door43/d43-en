\v 14 But after a while, a wind that was very strong blew across the island \add from the north side and hit the ship. That wind was called\add* \f + \ft Or:\add People\add* called that wind \f* "the Northeast Wind."
\v 15 It blew strongly against the \add front of\add* the ship. The result was that we could not keep going in the direction \add in which we had been going\add*. So the sailors let the wind move the ship in the direction \add that the wind\add* was blowing.
\v 16 The ship then passed a small island named Cauda. We passed along the side \add of the island that\add* sheltered \add the ship from the wind\add*. Then \add while the ship was moving along\add*, the sailors lifted the lifeboat up \add out of the water\add* and tied it \add on the deck. But the strong wind made it\add* difficult even to do that.

\v 14 After a short time, however, a stormy wind blew down from the shore. It blew across the island from the north side and hit the ship. That wind is called Euroclydon, "the Northeast Wind."
\v 15 It blew strongly against the front of the ship, and we could not sail against it. So the sailors let the wind move the ship in the direction that the wind was blowing.
\v 16 The ship then sailed along the coast line of a small island named Cauda. We were able, with difficulty, to fasten the lifeboat securely to the ship.

\v 14 But after a short time a tempestuous wind, called The Northeaster, began to beat down on us from across the island.
\v 15 When the ship was caught head on and could not face the wind, we gave in to it and were driven along by it.
\v 16 We ran along the sheltered side of a small island called Cauda; and with difficulty we were able to secure the lifeboat.

  * **after a short time** - "after a little while"
  * **tempestuous wind** - "a very strong, dangerous wind"
  * **called The Northeaster** - "called 'a strong wind from the northeast.'" The word for "The Northeaster" in the original language is "Euroclydon." You can transliterate this word for your language. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_transliterate]])
  * **began to beat down on us from across the island** - "came in from across the island of Crete and it blew strongly against our ship"
  * **When the ship was caught head on and could not face the wind** - "When the wind blew so strongly against the front of the ship that we could not sail against it"
  * **we gave in to it and were driven along by it** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "we stopped trying to sail forward, and we let the wind push us whichever way it blew" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **We ran along the sheltered side** - "We sailed on the side where the wind was less strong"
  * **a small island called Cauda** - This island was located on the south coast of Crete. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
