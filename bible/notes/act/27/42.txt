\v 42 The soldiers said \add to one another, "Let's\add* kill \add all\add* the prisoners \add on the ship\add*, so that they will not \add be able to\add* swim \add away and\add* escape." \add They planned to do that because they were sure\add* that officials \add would order them to be executed if they let the prisoners escape\add*.
\v 43 But \add Julius\add*, the army captain, wanted to save Paul, so he stopped the soldiers from doing what they planned to do. Instead, he \add commanded\add* first that everyone who could swim should jump into the water and swim to land.
\v 44 \add Then he told\add* the others \add to hold\add* onto planks or pieces from the ship \add and go towards shore. We\f + \ft exclusive \f* did what he said, and\add* in that way all of us arrived safely on land.

\v 42 The soldiers' plan was to kill the prisoners so that none of them could swim away and escape.
\v 43 But the centurion wanted to save Paul, so he stopped their plan; and he ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land.
\v 44 Then the rest of the men should follow, some on planks, and some on other things from the ship. In this way it happened that all of us came safely to land.
