\v 9 Much time had passed, so it would have been dangerous if we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* had traveled \add farther\add* by ship \add because after that time of the year\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add the sea often became very stormy\add*. So Paul said to the men \add on the ship\add*,
\v 10 "Men, I perceive that \add if we\f + \ft inclusive \f* travel by ship\add* now, it will be disastrous for us. A storm may destroy the ship and the cargo, and possibly we will drown."
\v 11 But the officer \add did not listen to\add* what Paul said. Instead, he decided to do what the pilot \add of the ship\add* and the owner of the ship advised.

\v 9 Much time passed, and it had now become dangerous to sail, because the Jewish fasting period had already passed and the sea would become very stormy. So Paul said to the men on the ship,
\v 10 "Men, I see that if we sail now, it will be disastrous for us with much injury and loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives."
\v 11 But the Roman captain did not believe Paul. Instead, he believed what the pilot and the owner of the ship said, and he decided to do what they advised.

\v 9 We had now taken much time, the time of the Jewish fast also had passed, and it had now become dangerous to sail. So Paul warned them,
\v 10 and said, "Men, I see that the voyage we are about to take will be with injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives."
\v 11 But the centurion paid more attention to the master and to the owner of the ship, than to those things that were spoken by Paul.

  * **We had now taken much time** - Because of the direction the wind was blowing, the journey from Caesarea to Fair Havens had taken more time than planned.
  * **the time of the Jewish fast also had passed, and it had now become dangerous to sail** - This fast took place on the Day of Atonement, which was usually either in the last part of September or the first part of October according to Western calendars. After this time, there was a higher risk of seasonal storms.
  * **I see that the voyage we are about to take will be with injury and much loss** - "if we travel now, we will suffer much injury and loss"

  * **loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives** - Here "loss" means destruction when referring to things and death when referring to people.
  * **not only of the cargo and the ship** - Cargo is something that a person transports from one place to another by boat. AT: "not only the ship and the goods on the ship"
