\v 23 For last night an angel of the God to whom I belong, whom also I worshipâ€”his angel stood beside me
\v 24 and said, 'Do not be afraid, Paul. You must stand before Caesar, and see, God in his kindness has given to you all those who are sailing with you.'
\v 25 Therefore be cheerful, men! For I trust God that it will happen just as it was told to me.
\v 26 But we must run aground upon some island."
