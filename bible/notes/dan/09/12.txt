<usfm>
\v 12 You warned us and our rulers that you would punish Jerusalem severely by causing a great disaster there, a disaster that would be worse than any disaster that any other city had ever experienced, and you have done what you said that you would do.
\v 13 You punished us just like Moses wrote that you would do. But Yahweh our God, we still have not tried, by turning away from our sinning and by heeding your truth, to persuade you to act mercifully toward us.
\v 14 So, because we did not obey you, you prepared to punish us, and then you did punish us, because you always do what is righteous\f + \ft Or: just \f*\f + \ft Or: fair \f*.

\v 13 You punished us just like Moses wrote that you would do. But we still have not turned away from our bad deeds, and turned to the truth, and begged Yahweh our God for mercy.
\v 14 So, because we did not obey you, Yahweh, you prepared to punish us, and then you did punish us, because you always do what is righteous.

\v 12 He has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us and against our rulers that ruled over us, by bringing upon us a great disaster. For under the whole of heaven there has not been done anything that could compare with what has been done to Jerusalem.
\v 13 As it is written in the law of Moses, all this disaster has come upon us, yet have we not begged for mercy from Yahweh our God, by turning away from our iniquities and paying attention to your truth.
\v 14 Therefore, Yahweh has kept the disaster ready and has brought it upon us, for Yahweh our God is righteous in all the works he does, and, yet, we have not obeyed his voice.
