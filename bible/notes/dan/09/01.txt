===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Chapters 7 and 8 were not in chronological order. They happened while Belshazzar was still the king. Chapter 9 now returns to the events of the reign of Darius who became king in chapter 6. 

  * **It was Ahasuerus who had been made king over the realm of the Babylonians** - This is background information about who Ahasuerus was. The UDB places this in parentheses to make that clear. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **who had been made king over the realm of the Babylonians** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "who became king over the realm of the Babylonians" or "who conquered the Babylonians." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **over the realm** - "over the country" or "over the kingdom"
  * **Yahweh** - This is the name of God that he revealed to his people in the Old Testament. See the translationWord page about Yahweh concerning how to translate this.
  * **there would be seventy years until Jerusalem's abandonment would end** - "from the time Jerusalem was destroyed, it would remain in ruins for 70 years" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **abandonment** - this means no one would help or rebuild Jerusalem during that time
