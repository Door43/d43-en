<usfm>
\v 27 That ruler will make a strong agreement with many people. He will promise to do what he has said in that agreement for seven years. But when that time is half finished, he will prevent priests from giving any more offerings and sacrifices to God. A disgusting idol will be put on the highest part of the temple, and it will stay there until \add God\add* gets rid of the one who put it there, which is what he said that he would do."

\v 27 That ruler will make a covenant with many people. He will do what he promised for seven years. But when that time is half finished, he will prevent priests from giving any more offerings and sacrifices to God. After this ruler does these disgusting things, someone will pollute the temple by putting an idol in the very holy place. It will stay there until God completely destroys the one who put it there."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 27 He will confirm a covenant with many for one seven. In the middle of the seven he will put an end to the sacrifice and the offering. On the wing of abominations will come someone who makes desolate. A full end and destruction are decreed to be poured out on the one who has made the desolation."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **one seven** - AT: "a single seven" or "one period of seven years"
  * **the sacrifice and the offering** - These words basically mean the same thing. The repetition is to show that the ruler will prevent all types of sacrifices. AT: "all forms of sacrificing" or "every type of offering" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **the wing of abominations** - This may refer to the defensive structures on top of the walls of the temple, which is called "abominations" because it is full of idols. AT: "On the walls of the temple that is full of abominations" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **someone who makes desolate ... the one who is making desolation** - "a desolation-maker" AT: "the person who makes things desolate"
  * **a full end and the destruction** - These two words or expressions are basically the same. They emphasize how serious and complete the destruction will be. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  *  **the destruction that is decreed is poured out** - AT: "God causes the destruction that he has decreed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
