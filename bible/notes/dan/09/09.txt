\v 9 To the Lord our God belong compassion and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against him.
\v 10 We have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh our God by walking in his laws he gave us through his servants the prophets.
\v 11 All Israel has transgressed your law and turned aside, refusing to obey your voice. The curse and oath that are written in the law of Moses, the servant of God, have been poured out on us, for we have sinned against him.
