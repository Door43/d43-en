\v 17 Now, our God, listen to the prayer of your servant and to his pleas for mercy; make your face shine on your sanctuary that is desolate for the Lord’s sake.
\v 18 My God, listen to me and hear my request. Open your eyes and see that we have been devastated; look at the city that is called by your name. We do not beg for your help because of our righteousness, but because of your great mercy.
\v 19 Lord, hear! Lord, forgive! Lord, listen and take action! For your own sake, do not delay, my God, for your city and your people are called by your Name."
