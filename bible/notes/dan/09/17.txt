\v 17 Now therefore, O our God, listen to the prayer of your servant, and to his supplications, and cause your face to shine upon your sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord’s sake.
\v 18 O my God, incline your ear, and hear; open your eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by your name: for we do not present our supplications before you for our righteousnesses, but for your great mercies’ sake.
\v 19 O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, listen and do; defer not, for your own sake, O my God, because your city and your people are called by your name.
