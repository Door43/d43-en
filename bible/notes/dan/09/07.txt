\v 7 Lord, you always do what is righteous\f + \ft Or: just \f*\f + \ft Or: fair \f*, but we have caused ourselves to be ashamed [IDI].

It is also true about all us Israelites whom you scattered, who \add were taken to\add* other countries, some near \add Israel\add* and some far away, because we were very unfaithful\f + \ft Or: disloyal \f* to you.
\v 8 Lord, we and our kings and our other rulers and our other ancestors have done very shameful things and have sinned against you.

<usfm>
\v 7 Lord, righteousness belongs to you, but we are the owners of shame. This is true for the people of Judah who live in Jerusalem and who live in other  places in Judea. It is also true about your people the Jews, that you scattered to other countries, because we were very unfaithful to you.
\v 8 Lord, we and our kings and our other rulers and our other ancestors are the owners of shame because we have sinned against you.

<usfm>
\v 7 To you, Lord, belongs righteousness, but to us open shame—this day the men of Judah, and those who live in Jerusalem, and to all Israel—those who are near, and those who are far away, in all the lands where you scattered them, because of the great treachery they committed against you. 
\v 8 To us, O Yahweh, belongs open shame—to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against you.
