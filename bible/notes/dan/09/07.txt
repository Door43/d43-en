====== Daniel 09:7-8 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 Lord, you always do what is righteous\f + \ft Or: just \f*\f + \ft Or: fair \f*, but we have caused ourselves to be ashamed [IDI]. This is still true about all of the Israelites who live in Jerusalem and who live in other places in Judea. It is also true about all us Israelites whom you scattered, who \add were taken to\add* other countries, some near \add Israel\add* and some far away, because we were very unfaithful\f + \ft Or: disloyal \f* to you.
\v 8 Lord, we and our kings and our other rulers and our other ancestors have done very shameful things and have sinned against you.
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 Lord, you act justly. However, we are covered in shame. This is true for the people of Judah who live in Jerusalem and who live in other places in Judea. It is also true about your people the Jews, that you scattered to other countries because we were very unfaithful to you.
\v 8 Yahweh, we and our kings and our other rulers and our other ancestors are ashamed because we have sinned against you.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 To you, Lord, belongs righteousness. To us today, however, belongs shame on our faces—for the people of Judah and those who live in Jerusalem, and to all Israel. This includes those who are near and those who are far away in all the lands where you scattered them. This is because of the great treachery that we committed against you. 
\v 8 To us, Yahweh, belongs shame on our faces—for our kings, to our leaders, and to our ancestors—because we have sinned against you.
</usfm>

  * **because of the great treachery that we committed** - AT: "because we greatly betrayed you" or "because we were very unfaithful to you" (UDB)
