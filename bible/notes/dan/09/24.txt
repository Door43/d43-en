\v 24 Seventy sevens are decreed for your people and your holy city to finish the transgression and put an end to sin, and to atone for wickedness; to bring everlasting righteousness; and to seal up vision and prophet; and to anoint the holy of holies.
\v 25 Know, and you will understand, that from the issuing of the order to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem, to the coming of the Anointed One (who is a prince), will be seven sevens, and sixty-two sevens; and it will be built with streets and a trench, despite the times of distress.
