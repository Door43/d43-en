\v 24 God has decided that there will be 490 years until he frees your people and city that belongs to him from the guilt of their sins and to atone for the evil things that they have done. Then God will rule everyone justly, and he will do that forever. What you saw in the vision and what Jeremiah prophesied will come true, and the sacred temple will be dedicated to God again.
\p
\v 25 You need to know and understand this: There will be forty-nine years and then 434 years between when a king commands that Jerusalem be rebuilt, and when the leader comes, the one whom God chooses. Then Jerusalem will be rebuilt, and it will have streets and will have a moat around it to protect the city, in spite of the fact it will be a time of great trouble.

\p
\v 24 Seventy sevens of years are decreed for your people and your holy city to end the guilt and put an end to sin, to atone for wickedness, to bring everlasting righteousness, to carry out the vision and the prophecy, and to consecrate the most holy place.
\v 25 Know and understand that from the issuing of the order to restore and rebuild Jerusalem to the coming of the anointed one (who will be a leader), there will be seven sevens and sixty-two sevens. Jerusalem will be rebuilt with streets and a moat, despite the times of distress.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Seventy sevens of years are decreed for your people and your holy city to** - God decreed that he would do the things in this verse for the people and the holy city.
  * **Seventy sevens of years ... seven sevens ... and sixty-two sevens** - This is not the normal way the Israelites counted. If possible, try to translate in a way that preserves this use of the number seven. AT: "Seventy times seven years ... seven times seven years ... and sixty-two times seven years"
  * **seven sevens … and sixty-two sevens** - These added together are 69 of the 70 sevens spoken of in verse 24.
  * **your people and your holy city** - The word "your" here refers to Daniel. The people are the Israelites and the holy city is Jerusalem. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **to end the guilt and put an end to sin** - The idea is repeated to emphasize how certain it is that this will happen. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **to carry out the vision** - AT: "to accomplish the vision" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **the vision and the prophecy** - These words in this context mean the same thing. They ensure Daniel that Jeremiah's vision was indeed a prophecy. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Know and understand** - These words share similar meanings and emphasize how important it is that he understand this. AT: "You must clearly understand" or "You must know for sure" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **the anointed one** - AT: "the person that God anoints" or "the person that God chooses"
  * **Jerusalem will be rebuilt** - AT: "People will rebuild Jerusalem" (see: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **moat** - a deep ditch around a city or building, usually with water in it
