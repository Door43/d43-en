  * **insight and understanding** - The two words "insight" and "understanding" mean the same thing and are repeated for emphasis.
  * **the order was given** - AT: "God gave the order" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **consider this word** - "think about this message". The word "word" is the same the word as "order" earlier in this verse. Translate the same way if possible.
  * **the revelation** - This refers back to the prophesy of Jeremiah in [[:en:bible:notes:dan:09:01|9:2]].
