====== Daniel 09 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Daniel told the future ==
Gabriel told Daniel a prophecy that Jerusalem would be rebuilt. Then later an anointed person would be killed and the worship at the temple stopped. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:obe:kt:anoint]])

== The unusual expression of numbers in 9:24-26 ==

This passage uses the expressions "Seventy sevens of years," "seven sevens and sixty-two sevens," and "sixty-two sevens of years" to denote ""490 years," "forty-nine years and then 434 years," and "434 years" respectively. The original language uses the idea of "week" to express the idea of a group of sevens, but these numbers are clearly meant to denote years, not weeks. Most translators should use the ways normal in their languages to express these numbers.
