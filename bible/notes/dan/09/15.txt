\v 15 Lord our God, you brought your people out of Egypt by your great power, and by doing that you have caused people from that time until the present time to know that you are great even though we have sinned and done wicked things.
\v 16 But now, because everything you do is righteous, we request you to not be angry with Jerusalem any longer, O Lord. Jerusalem is your city, and your temple was built there on your sacred hill. Now all the people who live in nearby countries despise Jerusalem because of our sins and because of the evil things that our ancestors did.

<usfm>
\v 15 Now, Lord our God, you brought out your people from the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and you have made a famous name for yourself, as in this present day. But still we sinned; we have done wicked things.
\v 16 Lord, because of all your righteous deeds, let your anger and your wrath turn away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain. Because of our sins, and because of the iniquities of our ancestors, Jerusalem and your people have become an object of scorn to all those around us.

  * **still we sinned; we have done wicked things** - These two clauses mean basically the same thing and are used together to emphasize how bad sin is. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **we sinned; we have done wicked things** - Daniel and Israel sinned and did wicked things, not God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **your anger and your wrath** - The words "anger" and "wrath" mean basically the same thing and emphasize how terrible God's anger is when he acts on it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **your holy mountain** - This mountain may be holy because God's temple is there. AT: "the mountain where your holy temple is".
  * **our sins ... our ancestors** - The sins and ancestors of Daniel and Israel, not of God.
