===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This is still about the king of the North.

  * **he will go out with great rage** - The abstract noun "rage" can be expressed with the word "angry." It can be stated clearly that he would go out with his army. AT: "he will be very angry and will go out" or "he will become very angry and will go out with his army" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **go out** - Here this represents the action of attacking the enemy. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **to set many apart for destruction** - "to destroy many people"
  * **the tent of his royal residence** - This refers to the king's luxurious tents that he lived in when he was with his army in time of war. 
  * **between the seas and the mountain of the beauty of holiness** - This probably refers to the region between the Mediterranean Sea and Temple Mount in Jerusalem.
  * **the mountain of the beauty of holiness** - This refers to the hill in Jerusalem where God's temple was. See how you translated somewhat similar phrases in [[:en:bible:notes:dan:09:15|9:16]] and [[:en:bible:notes:dan:09:20|9:20]].  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
