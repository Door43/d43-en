\v 36 And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall
speak marvelous things against the God of gods; and he shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished; for that which is
determined shall be done.
\v 37 Neither shall he regard the gods of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god; for he shall magnify
himself above all.
