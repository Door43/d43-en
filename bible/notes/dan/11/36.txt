\v 36 The king will do whatever he wants. He will exalt and magnify himself above every god, and will speak astonishing things against the God of gods. He will succeed until the wrath is completed. For what has been decreed will be done.
\v 37 He will show no consideration for the gods of his ancestors, for the god desired by women, or for any other god. He will act proudly and claim to be above them all.

  * **The king** - AT: "The king of the North"
  * **exalt and magnify** - The words "exalt" and "magnify" mean the same thing and emphasize how prideful the king is. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]]).
  * **astonishing things** - "terrible things" or "shocking things"
  * **the God of gods** - If this phrase would make people think that there really are more than one god, then it might be necessary to translate it differently. AT: "the supreme God" or "the only true God"
