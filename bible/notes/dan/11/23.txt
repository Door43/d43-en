\v 23 From the time an alliance is made with him, he will act deceitfully; with only a small number of people he will become strong.
\v 24 Without warning he will come into the richest part of the province, and he will do what neither his father nor his father's father did. He will spread among his followers the booty, the plunder, and the wealth. He will plan the overthrow of fortresses, but only for a time.
