\v 15 Then the king of the North will come with his army and pile up dirt against the walls of a city that is well protected, and they will break through those walls and will capture the city. The soldiers from the South who have come to defend that city, even the best troops, will not be strong enough to continue to fight.
\v 16 So the king of the North will do whatever he wants against the king of the South, and no one will be able to oppose him. He will occupy the glorious land of Israel and will have the power to destroy it.

\v 15 The king of the North will come and construct ramps on a mound and capture a fortified city. The forces of the South will not be able to stand; even their best soldiers will have no strength to stand.
\v 16 But the king of the North will do whatever he wants against the king of the South, and no one will stop him; he will establish himself in the beautiful land with complete destruction in his hand.
