\v 20 Then another man will succeed him. He is one who will force taxes upon the people to supply the beauty of the palace, but that king will die after a short time. However, he will not die as a result of people being angry with him or in a battle.
\p
\v 21 The next king will be an evil man who is hated because he is not the son of the previous king, and he will not have the right to become king. But he will come in without any objection when people do not expect it, and he will become king by tricking the people.
\v 22 When his army advances, they will attack any armies that oppose him and their enemies will be swept away before them like a flood. Their enemies and the head of the priests will be swept away.

\v 20 Then one will rise up in his place who will force taxes to be paid to provide for the splendor of the kingdom. But in only a few days he will be destroyed, but not in anger or in battle. 
\v 21 In his place will rise up a despised person to whom the people will not have given the honor of royalty; he will come in quietly and will take over the kingdom by flattery.
\v 22 A great army will be swept away like a flood before him. Both that army and the leader established by the covenant will be destroyed.
