\v 33 And they that are wise among the people shall instruct many; yet they shall fall by the sword and by flame, by captivity and by spoil, many days.
\v 34 Now when they shall fall, they shall be helped with a little help; but many shall join themselves to them with flatteries.
\v 35 And some of them that are wise shall fall, to refine them, and to purify, and to make them white, even to the time of the end; because it is yet for the time appointed.
