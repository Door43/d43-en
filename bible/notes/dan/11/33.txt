\v 34 When they stumble, they will receive a little help, and many will join them who do not mean what they say.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **will give understanding to many** - "will help many people understand" 
  * **they will fall by the sword** - The word "sword" here is used to refer to battles. AT: "they will be killed in battle." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **they will fall ... When they stumble ... the wise will stumble** - The same word is translated as "fall" and "stumble." It means to suffer severely or to die. It does not imply that they sinned. If your language has a single term with the same meaning, you may want to use it here.
  * **they will be taken as prisoners and robbed of their possessions** - "their enemies will put them in prison and steal their possessions" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Some of the wise will stumble ... until the time of the end** - This persecution will continue until the time when God has decided that it will end. It does not mean that the wise are only cleansed and purified until then.
  * **that they may be refined, cleansed, and made pure** - "that God may refine them, cleanse them, and make them pure" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **refined** - this refers to the purifying of metal by melting it in a fire
  * **time of the end** - "end of time" or "when time is no more"
  * **the appointed time is still to come** - "it is not yet time for the end to happen." Here "appointed" implies that God has set the time. AT: "Yahweh has decided to end the persecution at a time that will come later"
