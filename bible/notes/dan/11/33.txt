\v 33 And wise \add Israelite\add* leaders will teach others also. But for a while, some of those wise leaders will be killed in battles, and some will be burned to death, and some will be robbed, and some will be put in prison.

\v 34 While God's people are being persecuted, some people will help them a little bit, although some of those who help them will not do it sincerely.
\v 35 Some of those wise leaders will be killed \f + \ft euphemism \f*, but as a result the others will be purified \f + \ft doublet \f*. This suffering will continue until it is the time \add that God\add* has appointed \add for it to\add* end.

\v 33 The wise among the leaders of Israel will teach others also. But for a while, they will be killed in battles, or burned to death, or made slaves, or robbed.
\p
\v 34 While God's people are being persecuted, some people will help them a little, although some of those who help them will not do it for good reasons.
\v 35 After some of those wise leaders suffer these things, God will make his people become the best possible people for himself. Also, God has set a time in the future when he will finish doing all these things.

\v 33 The wise among the people will make many understand. But they will stumble by the sword and by flame; they will stumble into captivity and into being robbed for days.
\v 34 In their stumbling, they will be helped with a little help. In hypocrisy many will join themselves with them.
\v 35 Some of the wise will stumble so that refining will happen to them, and cleansing, and purifying, until the time of the end. For the appointed time is still to come.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **they will stumble** - Here "stumble" represents experiencing a disaster of one kind or another, including death itself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **they** - This refers to the wise persons among the Israelites.  
  * **the sword** - Here "sword" represents battles and warfare. AT: "they will die in battle." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **and by flame** - Here "flame" represents fire. AT: "and by burning to death" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **into captivity** - "into being made slaves" 
  * **into being robbed** - This can be put into active form. AT: "their enemies will rob them of their possessions" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **they will be helped with a little help** - This may be put into active form. AT: "others will give them a little help" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **In hypocrisy many will join themselves with them** - This refers to other people who will pretend to help the wise persons, but not because they truly wish to help them.
  * **will join themselves** - Here "join themselves" represents "come to help." AT: "will come to help them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Some of the wise will stumble** - Here "stumble" represents experiencing a disaster of one kind or another, including death itself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **so that refining will happen to them** - Here "so that" means "with the result that." AT: "with the result that refining will happen to them"
  * **refining will happen to them, and cleansing, and purifying** - These three activities are expressed here as if they were things. However, they may be expressed as actions, either in passive form or in active form. AT: "they will be refined, cleansed, and purified" or "their suffering will refine, cleanse, and purify them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Some of the wise will stumble ... until the time of the end** - This suffering will continue until the time when God has decided that it will end.
  * **refining** - This refers to the purifying of metal by melting it in a fire. When God makes his people more faithful to himself, this is spoken of as if they were metal that a worker was making more pure by putting it into fire.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **cleansing** - This refers to making people, places, or objects suitable for God's use by separating them from sin and other forms of evil. It speaks of evil as if it were physical dirtiness that could be removed by washing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **purifying** - This idea is very similar to refining, discussed earlier. Metal that is refined can also be said to be purified. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **time of the end** - "the final days" or "the end of the world." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:dan:08:15|8:17]].
  * **the appointed time is still to come** - Here "appointed time" implies that God has set the time. This can be put into active form. AT: "Yahweh has set the time in the future"
