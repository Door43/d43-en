<usfm>
\v 3 A mighty king will rise up who will rule a very great kingdom, and he will do everything he wants. 
\v 4 When he rises up, his kingdom will be broken and divided to the four winds of heaven. However, it will not be given to his own descendants, and it will not have the power that it had when he was ruling over it. For his kingdom will be uprooted and given to others who are not his own descendants.
