\v 25 The king of the North will gather a large and powerful army to attack the army of the king of the South. The king of the South will meet him in battle with a huge and powerful army. However, he will fail, and his plan will not succeed because of all the plots that are devised against him.
\v 26 Even his most trusted advisors will plan to get rid of him. His army will be defeated and many of his soldiers will be killed.

\v 25 He will stir up his power and his courage against the king of the South with a great army. The king of the South will wage war with a powerful army, but he will not be able to stand because of all the plots devised against him. 
\v 26 Even those who eat food from the king's table will try to destroy him. His army will be swept away like a flood, and many of them will be killed.
\v 27 Both these kings, with their hearts set on evil against each other, will sit at the same table and lie to each other, but for no purpose. For the end will come at the time that has been fixed.
