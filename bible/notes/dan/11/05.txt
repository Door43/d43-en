<usfm> \v 5 Then the king of the South will become very powerful. But one of his army generals will become more powerful than he is and will rule a bigger area. \v 6 After a few years, the king of the South and one of his commanders will become stronger than he is and rule a larger kingdom than he ruled. After a few years, at the right time, they will make an agreement. The daughter of the king of the South will come to the king of the North to make the agreement secure. Members of her family will go with her. But she will lose her power and will be left—she and all who accompanied her, and her father and the one who helped her in that time.
