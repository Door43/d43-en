\v 5 The king of the South will become strong, but one of his commanders will become stronger than he and will rule an even greater kingdom. 
\v 6 After a few years, when the time is right, they will make an alliance. The daughter of the king of the South will come to the king of the North to confirm the agreement. But she will lose her power, and she will be abandoned—she and those who brought her, and her father, and the one who supported her in those times.

===== Translation Notes: =====

The angel continues speaking to Daniel.

  * **they will make an alliance** - The king of the South will make an alliance with the king of the North. This alliance would be a formal agreement that both nations are required to follow. AT: "the king of the South and the king of the North will promise to work together."
