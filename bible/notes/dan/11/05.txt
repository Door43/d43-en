\v 5 Then the king of the South will become very powerful. But one of his army generals will become more powerful than he is and will rule a bigger area.
\v 6 At the right time, they will make an agreement. The daughter of the king of the South will come to the king of the North to make the agreement secure. But she will lose her power and will be left—she and all who accompanied her, and her father and the one who helped her in that time.

\v 5 The king of the South will become strong, but one of his commanders will become stronger than he and will rule an even greater kingdom. 
\v 6 After a few years, when the time is right, they will make an alliance. The daughter of the king of the South will come to the king of the North to confirm the agreement. But she will lose her power, and she will be abandoned—she and those who brought her, and her father, and the one who supported her in those times.
