\v 38 Instead of them, he will honor the god of fortresses. He will honor a god whom his ancestors did not know with gold and silver, with precious stones and costly gifts.
\v 39 He will attack the strongest fortresses with the help of people who belong to a foreign god. He will give honor to whoever acknowledges him. He will make them rulers over many people and he will divide up the land for a price.
