\v 4 On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was beside the Great River (that is, the Tigris),
\v 5 I looked up and saw a man dressed in linen, with a belt around his waist made of pure gold from Uphaz.
\v 6 His body was like topaz, his face was like lightning, his eyes were like flaming torches, his arms and his feet were like polished bronze, and the sound of his words was like the sound of a great crowd.
