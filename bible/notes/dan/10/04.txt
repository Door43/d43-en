\v 6 His body shone like a precious beryl stone. His face was as bright as a flash of lightning. His eyes were like flaming torches. His arms and legs shone like gleaming bronze. His voice was very loud like the roar of a huge crowd.

\v 4 On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was beside the great river (that is, the Tigris),
\v 5 I looked up and saw a man dressed in linen, with a belt around his waist made of pure gold from Uphaz.
\v 6 His body was like topaz, his face was like lightning, his eyes were like flaming torches, his arms and his feet were like polished bronze, and the sound of his words was like the sound of a great crowd.
