\v 7 I, Daniel, was the only one who saw this vision. The men who were with me did not see anything, but \add they sensed that someone was there, and they\add* became terrified. They ran away and hid themselves.
\v 8 So I was left there by myself, looking at this very unusual vision. I had no strength left. My face became very pale, with the result that no one would have recognized me.
\v 9 I saw a man there, and when I heard him speak, I fell to the ground. I fainted\f + \ft Or: became unconscious \f*, \add and I lay there\add* with my face on the ground.

\v 7 I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, for the men who were with me did not see the vision. However, a great terror came on them, and they ran away to hide themselves.
\v 8 So I was left alone and saw this great vision. No strength remained in me; my bright appearance was turned into a ruined look, and no strength remained in me.
\v 9 Then I heard his words—and as I heard them, I fell on my face in deep sleep with my face to the ground.
