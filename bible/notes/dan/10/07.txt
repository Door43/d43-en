===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 7 I, Daniel alone saw the vision, for the men who were with me did not see the vision. However, a great terror came on them, and they ran away to hide themselves. \v 8 So I was left alone and saw this great vision. No strength remained in me; my radiant appearance was fearfully changed, and no strength remained in me. \v 9 Then I heard his words—and as I heard them, I fell on my face in deep sleep with my face to the ground. </usfm>
