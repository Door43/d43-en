\v 13 Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regards not thee, O king, nor the interdict that you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day.
\v 14 Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him; and he labored
till the going down of the sun to rescue him.
