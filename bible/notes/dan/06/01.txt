\p
\v 1 It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, who should be throughout the whole kingdom;
\v 2 and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one; that these satraps might give account to them, and that the king
should have no damage.
\v 3 Then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the
king thought to set him over the whole realm.
