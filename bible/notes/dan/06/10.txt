\v 10 But when I found out that \add the king\add* had written \add and signed\add* that law, I went home. I knelt down in my upstairs room and prayed. I looked toward Jerusalem, and the windows were open \add with the result that everyone could see me while I was praying\add*. I prayed three times each day, just as I always did, thanking God.
\v 11 The officials went together \add to my house\add* and they saw me praying and requesting God to help me.

\v 10 When Daniel found out that the king had written and signed that law, he went home, knelt in his upstairs room, and prayed. The room had a window that looked toward Jerusalem and the windows were open. Anyone could see that he was praying. This is what he did every day, three times a day.
\v 11 The officials followed their plot against Daniel, and they found him praying and asking God for help.

\v 10 When Daniel learned that the document had been signed into law, he went into his house (now his windows were open in his upper room toward Jerusalem), and he got down on his knees, as he did three times a day, and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he had done before.
\v 11 Then these men who had formed the plot together saw Daniel make requests and seek help from God.
