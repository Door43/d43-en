\v 4 I, Nebuchadnezzar, was living happily in my house, and I was enjoying prosperity in my palace.
\v 5 But a dream I had made me afraid. As I lay there, the images I saw and the visions in my mind troubled me.
\v 6 So I gave a decree to bring before me all the men of Babylon who had wisdom so they could interpret the dream for me.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I was living happily ... in my palace** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **But a dream I had ... my mind troubled me** - Both "dream" and "visions" are parallel because they mean the same thing. Also, "afraid" and "troubled me" are parallel. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **all the men of Babylon who had wisdomâ€‹** - "all the wise men of Babylon"
