\v 4 I, Nebuchadnezzar, was living in my palace. I was living luxuriantly, and everything was going very well for me.
\v 5 But one night I had a dream that caused me to be very afraid. I saw visions that terrified me as I lay on my bed.
\v 6 So I summoned all the wise men in Babylon, in order that they would come and tell me what it meant.

\v 4 I, Nebuchadnezzar, was living happily in my house, and I was enjoying prosperity in my palace.
\v 5 But a dream I had made me afraid. As I lay there, the images I saw and the visions in my mind troubled me.
\v 6 So I gave a decree to bring before me all the men of Babylon who had wisdom so they could interpret the dream for me.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **was living happily in my house ... was enjoying prosperity in my palace** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **But a dream I had ... my mind troubled me** - Both "dream" and "visions" are parallel because they mean the same thing. Also, "afraid" and "troubled me" are parallel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **all the men of Babylon who had wisdom​** - "all the wise men of Babylon"
