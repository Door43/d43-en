\v 15 Leave the stump of its roots in the earth, bound with a band of iron and brass, in the midst of the tender grass of the field. Let it be wet with the dew of heaven. Let it live with the beasts in the grass of the earth.
\v 16 Let his mind be changed from man’s mind, and let a beast’s mind be given to him, until seven periods of times pass over it."
