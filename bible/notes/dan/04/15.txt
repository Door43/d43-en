\v 15 Leave the stump of its roots in the earth, bound with a band of iron and bronze, in the middle of the tender grass of the field. Let it be wet with the dew from the heavens. Let it live with the animals among the plants on the ground.
\v 16 Let his mind be changed from man’s mind, and let an animal’s mind be given to him until seven years pass by.
