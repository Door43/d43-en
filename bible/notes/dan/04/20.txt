\v 20 The tree that you saw—which grew and became strong, and its top reached up to heaven, and it could be seen to the end of the whole earth,
\v 21 whose leaves were beautiful, and its fruit was abundant, and in it was food for all; under which the animals of the field found shade, and in which the birds of the heavens lived—
\v 22 it is you, O king, who have grown and become strong. Your greatness has grown and reaches to heaven, and your dominion to the ends of the earth.
