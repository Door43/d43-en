<usfm>
\v 7 All the men who worked magic, the fortune-tellers, the men who worked sorcery, and men who studied the stars came to me. I told them what I had dreamed, but they could not tell me what it meant.
\v 8 Finally, Daniel came to me, and I \add decided to\add* tell him what I had dreamed. One of my officials had given him a new name, Belteshazzar, to honor my own god. I knew that the spirit of the holy gods was in him.
\pi
\v 9 So, \add using the name that had been given to him\add*, I said, 'Belteshazzar, you are the most important of all my fortune-tellers. I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and that you can reveal all mysteries. There is none that is too difficult for you. So, tell me what my dream means.

\v 7 All the men who worked magic, those who claimed to speak with the dead, the wise men, and those who made predictions from the stars, they came to me. I told them what I had dreamed, but they could not tell me what it meant.
\v 8 At last, Daniel came to me, and I decided to tell him what I had dreamed (he was called Belteshazzar, to honor my own god—I knew that the spirit of the holy gods was in him).
\pi
\v 9 I said to him, 'Belteshazzar, you are the most important of all my magicians. I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and that you can reveal all mysteries. There is none that is too difficult for you. So, tell me what my dream means.'"

\v 7 Then the magicians came, those who claimed to speak with the dead, the wise men, and the astrologers—and I told them the dream, but they could not interpret it for me. 
\v 8 But at last Daniel came in—who was called Belteshazzar according to the name of my god, and in him is the spirit of the holy gods—and I told him the dream.
\v 9 "O Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians—because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no mystery is too difficult for you—tell me the visions of my dream that I saw and their interpretation.
