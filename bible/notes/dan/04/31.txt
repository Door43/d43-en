\v 31 While he was still saying this, God \f + \ft metonymy \f* spoke from heaven and said, "King Nebuchadnezzar, this is what I am saying must happen: You are no longer the ruler of this kingdom!
\v 32 Your advisors will force you to live away from other people. You will live in the fields with wild animals, and you will eat grass like cows do. You will live that way for seven years, until you learn that it is I, the Supreme God, who rules over the kingdoms of this world, and I appoint the ones whom I have chosen to rule them."

\v 32 You will live away from human society. You will live in the fields with wild animals, and you will eat grass as an ox does. You will live that way for seven years until you learn that it is I, the Most High, who rules over the kingdoms of this world, and I appoint whomever I wish to rule over them.'

\v 31 While the king was still saying this, a voice came from heaven: "King Nebuchadnezzar, it has been decreed against you that this kingdom no longer belongs to you.
\v 32 You will be driven away from people, and your home will be with the wild animals in the fields. You will be made to eat grass like an ox. Seven years will pass until you acknowledge that the Most High rules over the kingdoms of people and he gives them to anyone he wishes."
