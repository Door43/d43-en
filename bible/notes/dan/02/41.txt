====== Daniel 02:41-43 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 41 The feet and toes of the statue that you saw, that were a mixture of iron and clay, indicate that the kingdom they represent will later be divided.
\v 42 Some parts of that kingdom will be as strong as iron, but some parts will not remain together, just as iron an clay do not stay together.
\v 43 The mixture of iron and clay \add in the statue\add* shows also that the rulers of those kingdoms that separate from each other will try to form alliances with each other as a result of members of the royal families of these kingdoms marrying each other. But that will not succeed, just as iron and clay do not stick together.

\v 41 And whereas you saw the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay, and part of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom; but
there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as you saw the iron mixed with miry clay.
\v 42 And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly
broken.
\v 43 And whereas you saw the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men; but they shall
not cleave one to another, even as iron does not mingle with clay.
