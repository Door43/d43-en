\v 10 The men who studied the stars replied to the king, "There is no one on the earth who can do what you ask! There is no king, even a great and mighty king, who has ever asked his men who work magic or his fortune-tellers or men who study the stars to do something like that!
\v 11 What you are asking us to do is impossible. Only the gods can tell you what you dreamed, and they do not live among us!"

\v 10 The wise men replied to the king, "There is no one on the earth who can do what you ask! There is no king, even a great and mighty king, who has ever asked his astrologers or those who claim to speak with the dead, or wise men like ourselves to do something like that!
\v 11 What you are asking us to do is impossible. Only the gods can tell you what you dreamed, and they do not live among us!"

\v 10 The wise men replied to the king, "There is not a man on earth able to meet the king's demand. There is no great and powerful king who has demanded such a thing from any magician, or from anyone who claims to speak with the dead, or from a wise man.
\v 11 What the king demands is difficult, and there is no one who can tell it to the king except the gods, and they do not live among humans."
