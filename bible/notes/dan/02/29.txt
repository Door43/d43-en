<usfm>
\v 29 O King, while you were sleeping, you dreamed about events that will happen in the future. The one who reveals mysteries has shown you what is going to happen.
\v 30 And it is not because I am wiser than anyone else on earth that I know the meaning of this mysterious dream. It is because God wanted you to understand what you were thinking.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 29 As for you, king, your thoughts on your bed were about things to come, and the one who reveals secrets  has made known to you what is about to happen.
\v 30 As for me, this secret was not revealed to me because of any wisdom that I have more than any other living person. This secret was revealed to me so that you, king, may understand the meaning, and so that you may know the thoughts deep within you.
