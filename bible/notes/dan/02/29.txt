\v 29 As for you, O king, your thoughts on your bed were about things to come, and the Revealer of Mysteries has made known to you what is about to happen.
\v 30 As for me, this secret was not revealed to me because of any wisdom I have more than any other living person, but so that you, O king, may understand the interpretation and that you may know your thoughts deep within you.
