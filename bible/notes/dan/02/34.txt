<usfm>
\v 34 As you watched, something cut a rock \add from a mountain\add*, but it was not a human who cut it. The rock \add tumbled down and\add* smashed the feet of the statue that were made of iron and clay. It smashed them to bits.
\v 35 Then the rest of the statue collapsed into a big heap of iron, clay, bronze, silver, and gold. The pieces of the statue were as small as bits of chaff on the ground where it is threshed, and the wind blew away all the tiny pieces. There was nothing left. But the rock that smashed the statue became a large mountain that covered the whole earth.

\v 34 You saw till that a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image upon its feet that were of iron and clay,
and brake them in pieces.
\v 35 Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of
the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them: and the stone that struck the
image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.
