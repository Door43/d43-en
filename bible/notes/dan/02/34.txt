====== Daniel 02:34-35 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 34 As you watched, something cut a rock \add from a mountain\add*, but it was not a human who cut it. The rock \add tumbled down and\add* smashed the feet of the statue that were made of iron and clay. It smashed them to bits.
\v 35 Then the rest of the statue collapsed into a big heap of iron, clay, bronze, silver, and gold. The pieces of the statue were as small as bits of chaff on the ground where it is threshed, and the wind blew away all the tiny pieces. There was nothing left. But the rock that smashed the statue became a large mountain that covered the whole earth.

\v 34 You looked up, and a stone was cut out, although not by human hands, and it struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay, and it shattered them.
\v 35 Then the iron, clay, bronze, silver, and gold at the same time were broken into pieces and became like the chaff of the threshing floors in the summer. The wind carried them away and there was no trace of them left. But the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.
