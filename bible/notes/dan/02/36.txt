\v 36 This was your dream. Now we will tell the king the meaning.
\v 37 You, king, are king of the kings to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, the strength, and the honor.
\v 38 He has given into your hand the place where the human beings live. He has given over the animals of the fields and the birds of the heavens into your hand, and he has made you rule over them all. You are the statue's head of gold.
