\v 9 If you do not tell me what I dreamed, you know what I promised to do to you. I think that you have all agreed to tell me lies and other wicked things before your time is up. So then, you have only one choice. Tell me the dream, and I will know you can tell me what it means."

\v 7 They replied again and said, "Let the king tell us, his servants, the dream and we will tell you its meaning."
\v 8 The king answered, "I know for certain that you want more time because you see how firm my decision is about this.
\v 9 But if you do not tell me the dream, there is only one sentence for you. You have decided to prepare false and deceptive words that you agreed together to say to me until I change my mind. So then, tell me the dream, and then I will know you can interpret it for me."

  * **there is only one sentence for you** - "there is only one punishment for you"
  * **false and deceptive words** - These two words mean approximately the same thing and emphasize that these are "lies intended to deceive." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
