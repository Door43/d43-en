\v 7 They replied again and said, "Let the king tell us, his servants, the dream and we will tell you its meaning."
\v 8 The king answered, "I know for certain that you want more time because you see how firm my decision is about this.
\v 9 But if you do not tell me the dream, there is only one sentence for you. You have decided to prepare false and deceptive words that you agreed together to say to me until I change my mind. So then, tell me the dream, and then I will know you can interpret it for me."
