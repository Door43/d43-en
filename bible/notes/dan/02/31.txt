\v 33 Its legs were made of iron, and its feet were a mixture of clay and iron.

\v 31 King, you looked up and you saw a large statue. This statue, which was very powerful and bright, stood before you. Its brightness was terrifying.

\v 33 and its legs were made of iron. Its feet were made partly of iron and partly of clay.
