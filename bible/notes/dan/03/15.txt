\v 15 I will give you one more chance. If you bow down to worship the statue that I have set up when you hear the sounds of the musical instruments, fine. But if you refuse, you will be thrown into the blazing furnace. Then who is the god who is able to rescue you from my power?

\v 15 Now if you are ready—when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, and pipes, and all kinds of music—to fall down and worship the statue which I have made, all is well. But if you do not worship, you will immediately be thrown into a burning fiery furnace. And who is the god who is able to deliver you out of my hands?"
