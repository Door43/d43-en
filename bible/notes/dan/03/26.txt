\v 26 Nebuchadnezzar came closer to the opening of the flaming furnace, and he shouted, "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, you who worship the Supreme God, come out of there! Come here!" So they stepped out of the fire.
\p
\v 27 Then all the king's officials crowded around them. They saw that the flames had not harmed them. The flames had not even singed any of the hair on their heads or scorched any of their clothes! There was not even any smell of smoke on them!

\v 26 Then Nebuchadnezzar came near the door of the blazing furnace and called out, "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of God Most High, come out! Come here!" Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the fire.
\v 27 The provincial governors, regional governors, other governors, and the king's counselors who had gathered together saw these men. The fire had not hurt their bodies; the hair on their heads was not singed; their robes were not harmed; and there was no smell of fire on them.
