\v 16 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered the king, "O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.
\v 17 If there is an answer, it is that our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king.
\v 18 But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods with reverence, and we will not give our worship to the golden statue you set up.
