\v 21 So the soldiers tied them up and threw them into the furnace, while they were wearing their clothes.
\v 22 Because the fire had been made very hot because the king had very strongly ordered them to do that, the flames leaped out and killed the soldiers as they were throwing the men into the fire!
\v 23 So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego fell into the roaring flames.

<usfm>
\v 21 When the soldiers tied them up and threw them into the furnace, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were wearing their robes, their tunics, their turbans, and their other clothes.
\v 22 Because the king's orders were given when he was so angry and were to be followed without any delay, and because the fire was so hot, the flames leaped out of the blaze and killed the soldiers that took Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego up into the fire.
\v 23 So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, tied up, fell into the burning flames of the fire.

\v 21 They were tied up still wearing their robes, tunics, turbans, and other clothing, and they were thrown into the blazing furnace.
\v 22 Because the king's command was strictly followed and the furnace was very hot, the flames killed the men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
\v 23 These three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell into the blazing furnace while they were tied up.
