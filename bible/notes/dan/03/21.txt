\v 21 So the soldiers tied them up and threw them into the furnace, while they were wearing their clothes.

\v 23 So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego fell into the roaring flames.

<usfm>
\v 21 When the soldiers tied them up and threw them into the furnace, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were wearing their robes, their tunics, their turbans, and their other clothes.
\v 22 Because the king's orders were given when he was so angry and were to be followed without any delay, and because the fire was so hot, the flames leaped out of the blaze and killed the soldiers that took Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego up into the fire.
\v 23 So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, tied up, fell into the burning flames of the fire.

\v 23 These three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell into the blazing furnace while they were tied up.
