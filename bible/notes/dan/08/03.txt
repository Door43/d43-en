\v 3 I looked up and saw a ram that was standing alongside the canal. It had two long horns, but the one that grew last was longer than the one that grew first.
\v 4 The ram butted\f + \ft Or: knocked \f* away \add with its horns\add* everything that was west and everything that was north and everything that was south of it. There were no other animals that were able to oppose it, and none that could rescue\f + \ft Or: save \f* other animals from its power. The ram did whatever it wanted to do and became very powerful.

\v 4 The ram butted away with its horns at everything that was west and everything that was north and everything that was south of it. There were no other animals that were able to oppose it, and none who could stop him. The ram did whatever it wanted to do and became very powerful.

\v 3 I looked up and saw before me a ram with two horns, standing beside the canal. One horn was longer than the other, but the longer one grew more slowly than the shorter and was passed up in length by it. 
\v 4 I saw the ram charging west, then north, and then south; no other animal could stand before him. None of them was able to rescue anyone out of his hand. He did whatever he wanted, and he became great.
