<usfm>
\v 11 It became great, even as great as the divine commander of the army. The regular burnt offering was taken away from him, and the place of his sanctuary was polluted.
\v 12 Because of rebellion, the army will be given over to the goat's horn, and the burnt offering will be stopped. The horn will throw truth down to the ground, and it will succeed in what it does.
