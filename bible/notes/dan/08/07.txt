\v 8 The goat became very powerful. But when its power was very great, its horn was broken off. But four other large horns took its place. They each pointed in a different direction.

\v 8 The goat became very powerful. But when its power was very great, its great horn was broken off. Four other distinctive horns grew up in its place. They each pointed to one of the four winds of heaven: north, south, east, and west.

\v 7 I saw the goat come close to the ram. He was very angry at the ram, and he hit the ram and broke off its two horns. The ram was powerless to stand before him. The goat knocked him down to the ground and trampled on him. There was no one who rescue save the ram from his power.
\v 8 Then the goat became very large. But when he became strong, the large horn was broken, and in the place of it there grew up four other large horns that pointed toward the four winds of heaven.
