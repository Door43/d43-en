\v 24 He will become very powerful, but it will not be because of what he himself does. He will terribly destroy things in many places, and he will succeed in doing everything that he wants to. He will get rid of many powerful men, and also some of God's people.
\v 25 Because he is very cunning\f + \ft Or: clever \f*, he will succeed by doing things that deceive many people. He will be proud of himself. He will get rid of many people when they think that they are safe. He will also rebel against \add God\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f*, who is the greatest king. But \add God\add* will destroy him, without the help \f + \ft metonymy \f* of any human being.

<usfm>
\v 24 His power will be great—but not by his own power. He will cause widespread devastation, and he will succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy powerful people, people who are holy. 
\v 25 By his craftiness he will make deceit prosper under his hand. He will even rise up against the King of kings, and he will be broken—but not by human power.
