\v 13 Then I heard two angels who were talking to each other. One of them asked, "How long will the things\f + \ft Or: events \f* that were in this vision continue? How long will the man who rebels against God and causes \add the temple\add* to be defiled be able to prevent priests from offering sacrifices? How long will he trample on the temple and on the armies of heaven?"
\p
\v 14 The other angel replied, "It will continue for 1,150 days. During each of those days, \add people will not be permitted to offer sacrifices\add* in the morning or in the evening. After that, the temple will be purified."

\v 13 Then I heard a holy one speaking and another holy one answering him, "How long will these things last, this vision about the burnt offering, the sin that brings destruction, the handing over of the sanctuary, and heaven's army being trampled on?" 
\v 14 He said to me, "It will last for 2,300 evenings and mornings. After that the sanctuary will be put right."
