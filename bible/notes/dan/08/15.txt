\v 15 When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I tried to understand it. And there stood before me one who looked like a man.
\v 16 I heard a man's voice calling between the banks of the Ulai Canal. He said, "Gabriel, help this man understand the vision."
\v 17 So he came near where I stood. When he came, I was frightened and prostrated myself on the ground. He said to me, "Understand, son of man, that the vision is for the time of the end."
