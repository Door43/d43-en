<usfm>
\v 22 As for the four horns that grew after the first horn was broken off, they represent four kingdoms into which that first kingdom will be divided. Those four kingdoms will not be as strong as the first kingdom.
\p
\v 23 But then the time will come for those kingdoms to end. This will be after those wicked leaders will have done all the evil that God will allow them to do. Then one of those kingdoms will have a king rise up who will be very proud and very intelligent in doing evil.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 As for the horn that was broken, in the place of which four others arose—four kingdoms will arise from his nation, but not with his great power.
\v 23 At the latter time of those kingdoms, when the transgressors shall have reached their limit, a grim-faced king, one who is very intelligent, will arise.
