\v 11 Ashpenaz had ordered a guard to watch me, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.
\v 12 So I said to this guard: "Please test us for ten days. During that time give us only vegetables to eat and water to drink.
\v 13 After ten days, see how we look, and see how the other young men look, the ones who are eating the kind of food that the king eats. Then you can decide about \add what food you will let us eat\add*."

\v 11 The chief official assigned a servant to give Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah their food and drink. Daniel spoke to him.
\v 12 He said, "Please test your servants! For ten days give us only vegetables to eat and water to drink.
\v 13 After ten days, see whether we look healthy or not. Also see how those who eat the king's food look. Then you do to us whatever you think is best."

\v 11 Then Daniel spoke to the steward whom the chief official had assigned over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.
\v 12 He said, "Please test us, your servants, for ten days. Give us only some vegetables to eat and water to drink. 
\v 13 Then compare our appearance with the appearance of the young men who eat the king's delicacies, and treat us, your servants, based on what you see."
