\v 20 In every question requiring wisdom and understanding, the king found these men advised him ten times more effectively than his magicians and those who claimed to speak with the dead. There were none better than these four in his entire kingdom.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The king spoke with them** - The king spoke with the "four young men" ([[:en:bible:notes:dan:01:17|1:17]]).
  * **among the whole group there were none to compare with Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah** - "Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah pleased him much more than anyone else in the whole group"
  * **Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah** - See how you translated these names in [[:en:bible:notes:dan:01:06|1:6-7]].
  * **ten times better** - Here "ten times" is an exaggeration representing great quality. AT: "much better" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
