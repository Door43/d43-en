===== translationNotes: =====

  * **God gave them knowledge and insight** - This can be reworded so that the abstract nouns "knowledge" and "insight" can be expressed as the verbs "learn" and "understand." AT: "God gave them the ability to learn and understand clearly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **in all literature and wisdom** - Here "all" is a generalization to show that they had a very good education and understanding. AT: "in many things that the Babylonians had written and studied" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
