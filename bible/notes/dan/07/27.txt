===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The man in Daniel's vision continues talking to Daniel.
  * **General Information:** - Most of the text of verses 23-27 is symbolic language. For this reason, the ULB presents them in poetic form. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_symlanguage]])

  * **an everlasting kingdom** - "a kingdom that will exist forever" or "a kingdom that will never end"
