\v 4 The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings: I [*]saw till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from
the earth, and made to stand upon two feet as a man; and a man’s heart was given to it.
\v 5 And, behold, another beast, a second, like to a bear; and it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth
between its teeth: and they said thus to it, Arise, devour much flesh.
