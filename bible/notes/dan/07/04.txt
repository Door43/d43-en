\v 4 The first was like a lion but had eagle’s wings. As I was looking, its wings were torn off and it was lifted from the ground and made to stand on two feet, like a man. The mind of a man was given to it. 
\v 5 Then there was a second animal, like a bear, and it was raised to a crouching position; it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, 'Get up and devour many people.'
