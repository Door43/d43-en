\v 20 \add I also wanted to know about\add* the ten horns on its head, and about the horn that appeared later, which got rid of three of the other horns. \add I wanted to know what it meant that\add* it had eyes and a mouth with which it spoke very boastfully. \add The beast that was represented by\add* that horn was more terrifying than the other beasts.

\v 19 Then I wanted to know what the fourth animal signified—the animal that was different from the other three, the animal that crushed those that it attacked with its bronze claws and then ate their flesh with its iron teeth, the animal that trampled with its feet the parts of their bodies that it did not eat.
\v 20 I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the horn that appeared later, which got rid of three of the other horns. I wanted to know what it meant that it had eyes and a mouth with which it spoke very boastfully. The animal that was represented by that horn was more terrifying than the other animals.

\v 19 Then I wanted to be certain about the fourth animal—it was so different from the others and very horrific with its iron teeth and its bronze claws; it devoured, broke into pieces, and trampled on what was left with its feet.
\v 20 I wanted to know about the ten horns on its head, and about the other horn that grew up before which the three horns fell down. I wanted to know about the horn that had eyes and about the mouth that boasted about great things and that seemed greater than its companions.
