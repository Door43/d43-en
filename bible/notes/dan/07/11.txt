\v 11 I continued to look because of boastful words spoken by the horn. I watched even while the animal was killed and its body was destroyed and it was given over to be burned with fire.
\v 12 And as for the rest of the animals, their authority to rule was taken away, but their lives were prolonged for a period of time.
