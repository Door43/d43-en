===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The man in Daniel's vision continues talking to Daniel.
  * **General Information:** - Most of the text of verses 23-27 is symbolic language. For this reason, the ULB presents them in poetic form. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_symlanguage]])

  * **He will speak words against the Most High** - This means that the newest king will openly disagree with and say bad things about the Most High. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **He will try ... into his hand** - The words "He" and "his" refer to the newest king, not the Most High.
  * **the holy people** - "God's holy people"
  * **change the festivals and the law** - Both terms refer to the law of Moses. The festivals were an important part of the religion of Israel in the Old Testament.
  * **These things will be given into his hand** - Here "his hand" refers to his control. This can be stated in active form. AT: "The newest king will control the religous festivals and laws" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **one year, two years, and half a year** - This means "three and half years." This is not the normal way the Israelites counted. Try to translate it in a way that preserves this way of counting. AT: "one year plus two years plus six months"
  * **the court will be in session** - This means that the judge will be ready to investigate evidence and make his judgment. AT: "the judge will judge" or "The judge will sit down"
  * **they will take his royal power away** - "the members of the court will take the royal power away from the newest king"
  * **royal power** - This, here, refers to "authority." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:dan:07:13|7:14]].
  * **to be consumed and destroyed at the end** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "and consume and destroy it in the end" or "and completely destroy his royal power in the end" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
