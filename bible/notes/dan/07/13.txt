\v 13 I also saw that night someone coming who resembled a son of man, that is, he had a human figure. He was coming close, surrounded by clouds, and he came to The One who Lives Forever and was presented to him in honor.
\v 14 He was given authority to rule over all the nations in the world; royal honor was given to him. He will rule foreverâ€”he will never stop ruling. The kingdom that he rules will never be destroyed.

<usfm>
\p
\v 13 In my visions that night,
\q I saw one coming with the clouds of heaven like a son of man; 
\q he came to the Ancient of Days 
\q and was presented before him.
\q
\v 14 Authority to rule and glory and royal power were given to him 
\q so that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him. 
\q His authority to rule is an everlasting authority that will not pass away, 
\q and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.
