\v 6 After this I looked again. There was another animal, one that looked like a leopard. On its back it had four wings like bird wings, and it had four heads. It was given authority to rule.
\v 7 After this I saw in my dream at night a fourth animal, terrifying, frightening, and very strong. It had large iron teeth; it devoured,  broke in pieces, and trampled underfoot what was left. It was different from the other animals, and it had ten horns.
