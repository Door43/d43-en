\v 23 This is what that person said, 'As for the fourth animal,
\q it will be a fourth kingdom on earth
\q that will be different from all the other kingdoms.
\q It will devour the whole earth,
\q and it will trample it down
\q and break it into pieces.
\q
\v 24 As for the ten horns,
\q out of this kingdom ten kings will arise,
\q and another will arise after them.
\q He will be different from the previous ones,
\q and he will conquer the three kings.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Most of the text of verses 23-27 is symbolic language. For this reason, the ULB presents them in poetic form. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_symlanguage]])

  * **This is what that person said** - This is the person that Daniel approached in [[:en:bible:notes:dan:07:15|7:16]].
  * **that person said** - "that person answered"
  * **As for the fourth animal ... As for the ten horns** - "Concerning the fourth animal ... Concerning the ten horns" or "Now, about the fourth animal ... Now, about the ten horns"
  * **It will devour ... it into pieces** - This does not mean the fourth kingdom will destroy the planet, but that it will brutally attack, conquer, and destroy all other kingdoms on earth. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **out of this kingdom ten kings will arise** - They will rule one after the other. This can be stated explicitly. AT: "ten kings will rule over this fourth kingdom, one after another" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **another will arise after them** - This other king is not one of the ten. It may be helpful to refer to him as "the eleventh king." AT: "after that an eleventh king will become powerful" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **He will be different from the previous ones** - "He will be different from the other ten kings"
  * **he will conquer the three kings** - He will defeat three of the original ten kings. It may be helpful to state that those three kings are represented by the three horns that were pulled out. AT: "he will defeat the three kings that were represented by the three horns that were pulled out" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
