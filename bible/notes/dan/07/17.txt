===== translationNotes: =====

  * **These large animals, four in number,** - "These four large animals"
  * **are four kings** - "represent four kings"
  * **four kings that will arise from the earth** - Here "from the earth" means they are real people. AT: "four kings who will come to power on the earth" or "four men who will rise up from among the people of the earth and become kings" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **they will possess it** - "they will rule over it"
  * **forever and ever** - This repetition of ideas emphasizes that this kingdom will never come to an end. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
