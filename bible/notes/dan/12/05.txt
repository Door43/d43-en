===== Translation Notes: =====

The angel has finished speaking, and Daniel goes on to tell what he saw next in this vision that began in [[en:bible:notes:dan:10:04|10:4]].

  * **"How long will it be to the end of these amazing events?"** -  AT: "How long will these amazing events happen" or "How long will these amazing events last?"
  * **the man clothed in linen** - This refers to the man who has been speaking to Daniel, not to one of the men that were standing beside the river.
