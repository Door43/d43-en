<usfm>
\v 7 The one wearing the linen clothes and standing further up the river raised his hands toward the sky and solemnly promised to the one who lives forever, "It will be three and a half years, and when God's holy people and their strength are no longer being shattered to pieces, then all these things are finished."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 I heard the man clothed in linen, who was upstream along the river—he raised his right hand and his left hand to heaven and swore by the one who lives forever that it would be for a time, times, and half a time. When the power of the holy people has been finally broken, all these things will be completed.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the man clothed in linen** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the man who was wearing linen clothes" or "the angel who was wearing linen clothes" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **upstream along the river** - Possible meanings are 1) the man clothed in linen was above the river or 2) the man was further upstream along the river.
  * **the one who lives forever** - "God, who lives forever"
  * **it would be for a time, times, and half a time** - It is best to leave it ambiguous as to when this begins. If you must choose a starting point, the three and a half years probably start with the events of [[:en:bible:notes:dan:12:01|12:1-4]]. 
  * **a time, times, and half a time** - "three and a half years." These "times" are generally understood to refer to years. One and two and a half equal three and a half.
  * **all these things will be completed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "all these things will have happened" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **all these things** - At the time when the man clothed in linen spoke to Daniel, none of the events in this vision had happened. This refers to the the events in [[:en:bible:notes:dan:12:01|12:1-4]], and may include the events in the vision from chapter 11.
