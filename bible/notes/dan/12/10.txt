===== Translation Notes: =====
The angel continues speaking to Daniel.

  * **Many will be purified, cleansed, and refined** - AT: "God will purify, cleanse, and refine many people." These three terms mean basically the same thing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **refined** - purified by removing anything that does not belong in them
  * **the regular burnt offering is ... is set up** - AT: “the king of the North takes away the regular burnt offering and sets up the abomination that causes complete desolation” (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the abomination that causes complete desolation** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:dan:11:31|11:31]].
  * **1,290 days** - (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
