\v 3 Those who were wise will shine as brightly as the sky \add is bright when the sun is shining\add*. And those who have shown to others the way to live righteously will shine forever, like the stars \f + \ft simile \f*.
\v 4 But as for you, Daniel, close up the scroll\f + \ft Or: book \f* \add in which you are writing\add*, and seal it \add in order that no one can open it\add* until the end \add of the world\add* is near. \add Before that happens\add*, many people will travel rapidly here and there, leaning more and more \add about many things\add*."

\v 3 Those who were wise will shine as brightly as the sky. Those who have shown to others the way to live righteously will shine forever like the stars.
\v 4 But as for you, Daniel, close up the scroll in which you are writing and seal it until the time of the end. Before that happens, many people will travel here and there, learning more and more about many things."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the sky above, and those who turn many to righteousness, are like the stars forever and ever.
\v 4 But you, Daniel, close up these words; keep the book sealed until the time of the end. Many will run here and there, and knowledge will increase."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the sky above** - This refers to God's people who will share their wisdom with those around them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **those who turn many to righteousness** - This refers to those who help others understand that they are separated from God, as if they were changing the direction in which they were going. AT: "those who teach others to live righteously" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **those who turn ... are like the stars forever and ever** - These people are compared to the stars that shine. AT: "those who turn ... will shine brightly like the stars forever and ever" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **close up these words; keep the book sealed** - Here "words" represents the book. AT: "close this book and keep it sealed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **time of the end** - "the final days" or "the end of the world." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:dan:08:15|8:17]].
  * **Many will run here and there, and knowledge will increase** - This seems to happen before "the time of the end" during which time the book is sealed. This can be made explicit. AT: "Before that happens, many people will travel here and there, learning more and more about many things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
