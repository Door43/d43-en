\v 4 But as for you, Daniel, close up the scroll\f + \ft Or: book \f* \add in which you are writing\add*, and seal it \add in order that no one can open it\add* until the end \add of the world\add* is near. \add Before that happens\add*, many people will travel rapidly here and there, leaning more and more \add about many things\add*."

\v 3 Those who were wise will shine as brightly as the sky. Those who have shown to others the way to live righteously will shine forever like the stars.
\v 4 But as for you, Daniel, close up the scroll in which you are writing and seal it until the time of the end. Before that happens, many people will travel here and there, learning more and more about many things."
