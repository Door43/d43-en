===== translationNotes: =====

  * **of all these things** - At the time when the angel spoke to Daniel, none of the events in this vision had happened. This definitely refers to the the events in [[:en:bible:notes:dan:12:01|12:1-4]], and may possibly also include the events in the vision from chapter 11.
  * **the words are shut up and sealed** - AT: "you have closed up and sealed the words you have written" or "you have closed and sealed the book" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **time of the end** - "the final days" or "the end of the world." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:dan:08:15|8:17]].
