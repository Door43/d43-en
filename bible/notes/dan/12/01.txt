\v 1 And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince who stands for the children of your people; and there shall be
a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time your people shall be
delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.
\v 2 And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and
everlasting contempt.
