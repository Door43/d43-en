\v 20 But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly, he was deposed from his kingly
throne, and they took his glory from him:
\v 21 and he was driven from the sons of men, and his heart was made like the beasts’, and his dwelling was with the wild
asses; he was fed with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; until he knew that the Most High God
rules in the kingdom of men, and that he sets up over it whoever he will.
