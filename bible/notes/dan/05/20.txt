\v 20 But when his heart was arrogant, and his spirit was hardened so that he acted presumptuously, he was brought down from his kingly throne, and they took away from his glory.
\v 21 He was driven away from humanity, and his mind was like the animals, and he lived with the wild donkeys. He ate grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, until he learned that the Most High God
