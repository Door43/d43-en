===== translationNotes: =====


  * **Mene, Mene, Tekel, and Pharsin** - Spell these words as much like this as will fit with the sounds of your language. They are the Aramaic words that were written on the wall.
  * **you are weighed in the scales and are found lacking** - Judging the king and his worthiness to rule is spoken of as weighing him. This means that the king is not worthy to rule. AT: "God has examined your worthiness to rule, and he has found that it is not enough"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
