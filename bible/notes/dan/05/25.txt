===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN** - Spell these words as much like this as will fit with the sounds of your language. They are the Aramaic words that were written on the wall.
    * **you are weighed in the scales and found lacking** - Judging the king and his worthiness to rule is spoken of as weighing him. AT: "God has weighed your worthiness to rule, and he has found that it is not enough." This means that the king is not worthy to rule. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
