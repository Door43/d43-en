\v 11 There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods, and in the days of your father light and understanding, and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him. And king Nebuchadnezzar—your father the king, I say—your father made him chief of the magicians, those who claim to speak with the dead, wise men, and the astrologers,
\v 12 because an excellent spirit, knowledge, understanding, interpreting of dreams, and explaining riddles and solving problems, these qualities were found in the very Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now call for Daniel and he will make known the interpretation.
