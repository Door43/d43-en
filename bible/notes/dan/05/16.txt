You will become a very important official in my kingdom; there will be only two others who will be more important than you will be."

\v 16 But I have heard that you can give interpretations and solve problems. Now if you can read the writing and make its interpretation known to me, you will be clothed with purple, and have a gold chain placed around your neck, and you will have the authority of the third highest ruler in the kingdom.
