\v 5 At that moment the fingers of a human hand appeared in front of the lampstand and wrote on the plaster wall in the king’s palace. The king could see part of the hand as it wrote.
\v 6 Then the king’s face changed and his thoughts frightened him; his limbs could not support him, and his knees were knocking together.
