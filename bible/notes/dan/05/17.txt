\p
\v 17 Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let your gifts be to yourself, and give your rewards to another; nevertheless
I will read the writing to the king, and make known to him the interpretation.
\v 18 O you king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father the kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and majesty:
\v 19 and because of the greatness that he gave him, all the peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him:
whom he would he slew, and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he raised up, and whom he would he put down.
