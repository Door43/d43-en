\v 4 But God acts very mercifully, and he loves us very much.
\v 5 We were like dead people, powerless to obey God, but then he made us live again by joining us to Christ. God has saved us because he has been very, very kind to us.
\v 6 He raised us up from among those who are like dead people, and he gave us seats of honor to rule with Christ Jesus in heavenly places.
\v 7 He did this to show in future times how kind he has been to us, for we are joined to Christ Jesus.
