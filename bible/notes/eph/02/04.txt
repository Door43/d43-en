\v 4 But God acts very mercifully, and he loves us very much.
\v 5 We were like dead people, powerless to obey God, but then he made us live again by joining us to Christ. God has saved us because he has been very, very kind to us.
\v 6 He raised us up from among those who are like dead people, and he gave us seats of honor to rule with Christ Jesus in heavenly places.
\v 7 He did this to show in future times how kind he has been to us, for we are joined to Christ Jesus.

\v 4 But since God is rich in mercy because of his great love with which he loved us,
\v 5 while we were dead in trespasses, he brought us to new life together with Christ—by grace you have been saved—
\v 6 and raised us up together and made us sit together in the heavenly places with Christ Jesus.
\v 7 He did this so that in the ages to come he might show to us the great riches of his grace by his kindness in Christ Jesus.
