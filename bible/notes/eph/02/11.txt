<usfm>
\v 11 You \add Ephesians\add* were non-Jews from the time that you were born. The Jews \add insult you\f + \ft Or: say that you are not God's people\add* \f* \add by\add* calling you 'those who are not circumcised.' They \add proudly\add* call themselves 'we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* who are circumcised.' \add They have allowed people to\add* circumcise \add them to indicate that they are God's people, but\add* that has \add only\add* changed their bodies, \add not their\add* \add inner beings\f + \ft Or: hearts\add* \f*.
\v 12 You should constantly remember these things: Formerly you did not have any relationship with Christ. You did not belong to the people of Israel, \add the people whom God chose\add*. You did not know about the things God promised in his agreements \add with his people\add*. You did not confidently expect to go to heaven after you die \f + \ft Or: \add that God would save you\add* \f*. You \add lived\add* in this world without knowing God.

\v 11 Do not forget that you non-Jewish believers were previously called Gentiles because you were not born as Jews. The Jews insulted you by calling you "uncircumcised pagans." They call themselves "the circumcision"; by this they mean that they, not you, are God's people, although circumcision is something that only humans do, not God.
\v 12 At that time, you did not have any part of Christ and you were not part of his people Israel. You did not know God's promises and law. You did not have confidence in the future that God promised you, and as you lived your lives, you did not know God.

\p
\v 11 Therefore remember that once you were Gentiles in the flesh. You are called "uncircumcision" by what is called the "circumcision" in the flesh made by human hands.
\v 12 For at that time you were separated from Christ, foreigners to the people of Israel, strangers to the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world.
