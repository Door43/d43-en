\v 11 You \add Ephesians\add* were non-Jews from the time that you were born. The Jews \add insult you\f + \ft Or: say that you are not God's people\add* \f* \add by\add* calling you 'those who are not circumcised.' They \add proudly\add* call themselves 'we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* who are circumcised.' \add They have allowed people to\add* circumcise \add them to indicate that they are God's people, but\add* that has \add only\add* changed their bodies, \add not their\add* \add inner beings\f + \ft Or: hearts\add* \f*.
\v 12 You should constantly remember these things: Formerly you did not have any relationship with Christ. You did not belong to the people of Israel, \add the people whom God chose\add*. You did not know about the things God promised in his agreements \add with his people\add*. You did not confidently expect to go to heaven after you die \f + \ft Or: \add that God would save you\add* \f*. You \add lived\add* in this world without knowing God.

\v 11 Don't forget that you non-Jewish believers  were previously labeled "the Gentiles" because you were not Jewish from birth. You were insulted by the Jews who called you "uncircumcised pagans." They called themselves "the circumcision," which means  they, not you, were God's people, although circumcision is only done to the body by human hands.
\v 12 Before you learned of Christ you could not know him. You could not join God's community of Israel without knowing about the true God, nor could you receive what God had promised to his people in his agreements with them. You could not even expect to trust in God in this world because you did know who God is.

\v 11 Therefore remember that once you were the Gentiles by birth, who are called "uncircumcised pagans" by the Jews who are called "the circumcision," which is done on the body by the hands of man.
\v 12 At that time you were separated from Christ, alienated from citizenship in Israel, and excluded from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world.
