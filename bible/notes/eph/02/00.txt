====== Ephesians 02 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter focuses on a Christian's life before coming to [[:en:obe:kt:faith|faith]] in Jesus. Paul then uses this information to explain how this is distinct from a Christian's new identity "in Christ."

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== One body ==
Paul teaches about the church in this chapter. The church is two different groups of people (Jews and Gentiles) who are now one. It is known as Jesus's body because Jesus unites them.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== "Dead in trespasses and sins" ==
Paul teaches that someone who is not a Christian is "[[:en:obe:kt:death|dead]]" in their [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]]. This means that they are in bondage or enslaved to their sin, which leads to death unless they come to faith in Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]).

== Metaphors for worldly living ==
Paul uses many different metaphor to describe how the non-Christian world acts. They "walked according to the age of this world," "walked according to the ruler of the authorities of the air," "acting according to the evil desires of our flesh" and "doing the will of the flesh and the mind."

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "It is a gift of God" ==
Most scholars believe that "it" refers to salvation, while others believe that it is faith that is the gift of God. Because of agreement in the Greek wording, it is probable that salvation is what Paul refers to as the gift of God here.

== Flesh ==

This is a complex issue and it is possible that “flesh” is a metaphor for a person's sinful nature. "Gentiles in the flesh" would indicate that the Ephesians once lived without any concern for God. To cmoplicate matters, flesh is also used in this verse to refer to the physical part of man.
