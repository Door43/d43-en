\p
\v 14 Christ himself \add has caused us Jewish and non-Jewish believers\add* to have peace \add with each other\add*. He has made both \add of our groups\add* to become one \add group\add*. \add Just like people\add* tear down\f + \ft Or: demolish \f* a wall that separates \add groups of people\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, he has destroyed the hatred \add between Jews and non-Jews\add*.
\v 15 By dying \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add for us on the cross\add* he made it no longer \add necessary for us to obey\add* all the \add Jewish\add* laws and rituals \add in order to be saved\add*. He did that in order to enable the two \add groups\add* to become one new group because of our relationship with him. The result was that he has caused us to have peace \add with each other\add*.
\v 16 By \add dying on\add* the cross \f + \ft metonymy \f* he caused both Jews and non-Jews to have a peaceful relationship with God. That is how he caused us to no longer be \f + \ft metaphor \f* enemies \add with God\add* \f + \ft Or: \add with each other\add* \f*.

\v 13 But now because of what Christ Jesus has done, you have been able to trust in him because Christ agreed to die on the cross.
\p
\v 14 Christ has brought peace and unity between Jews and non-Jews by destroying the barrier between us, as if he had destroyed a wall of hate that separated our peoples from one another.
\v 15 He made it no longer necessary for us to obey all the Jewish laws and commandments. He made Jews and non-Jews into one people instead of two because he made peace between us.
\v 16 Jesus caused Jews and non-Jews together to both become friends with God in one new group of believers. By dying on the cross, Jesus made it possible for them to stop hating each other.

\v 13 But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away from God have been brought near by the blood of Christ.
\v 14 For he is our peace. He made the two one. By his flesh he destroyed the wall of hostility that divided us.
\v 15 That is, he abolished the law of commandments and regulations so that he might create one new man in himself, and so making peace.
\v 16 Christ reconciles both peoples into one body to God through the cross, putting to death the hostility.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But now in Christ Jesus** - Paul is marking a contrast between the Ephesians before they believed in Christ and after they believed in Christ.
  * **you who once were far away from God have been brought near by the blood of Christ** - Not belonging to God due to sin is spoken of as being far away from God. Belonging to God because of the blood of Christ is spoken of as being brought near to God. AT: "you who once did not belong to God now belong to God because of the blood of Christ" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **by the blood of Christ** - The blood of Christ is a metonym for his death. AT: "by Christ's death" or "when Christ died for us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **he is our peace** - "Jesus gives us his peace"
  * **He made the two one** - "He made the Jews and Gentiles one"
  * **By his flesh** - "By the death of his body on the cross" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the wall of hostility** - "the wall of hatred" or "the wall of ill will"
  * **that divided us** - The word "us" refers to Paul and the Ephesians. The Ephesians, as Gentiles, were separated from Paul and the other Jews. AT: "that separated us Jews and Gentiles from one another" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
  * **he abolished the law of commandments and regulations** - Jesus' blood satisfied the law of Moses so that both the Jews and Gentiles can live at peace in God.
  * **one new man** - a single new people, the people of redeemed humanity (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in himself** - It is union with Christ that makes reconciliation possible between Jews and Gentiles.
  * **Christ reconciles both peoples** - "Christ brings the Jews and the Gentiles together in peace"
  * **through the cross** - The cross here represents Christ's death on the cross. AT: "by means of Christ's death on the cross" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **putting to death the hostility** - Stopping their hostility is spoken of as if he killed their hostility. By dying on the cross Jesus eliminated the reason for Jews and Gentiles to be hostile toward each other. Neither are now required to live according to the law of Moses. AT: "stopping them from hating one another" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
