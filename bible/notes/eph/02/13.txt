\p
\v 14 Christ himself \add has caused us Jewish and non-Jewish believers\add* to have peace \add with each other\add*. He has made both \add of our groups\add* to become one \add group\add*. \add Just like people\add* tear down\f + \ft Or: demolish \f* a wall that separates \add groups of people\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, he has destroyed the hatred \add between Jews and non-Jews\add*.
\v 15 By dying \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add for us on the cross\add* he made it no longer \add necessary for us to obey\add* all the \add Jewish\add* laws and rituals \add in order to be saved\add*. He did that in order to enable the two \add groups\add* to become one new group because of our relationship with him. The result was that he has caused us to have peace \add with each other\add*.
\v 16 By \add dying on\add* the cross \f + \ft metonymy \f* he caused both Jews and non-Jews to have a peaceful relationship with God. That is how he caused us to no longer be \f + \ft metaphor \f* enemies \add with God\add* \f + \ft Or: \add with each other\add* \f*.

\v 13 But now because of what Christ Jesus has done, you have been able to trust in him because Christ agreed to die on the cross.

\p
\v 14 Christ has brought peace and unity between Jews and non-Jews by destroying the barrier between us, as if he had destroyed a wall of hate that separated our peoples from one another.
\v 15 He made it no longer necessary for us to obey all the Jewish laws and commandments. He made Jews and non-Jews into one people instead of two because he made peace between us.
\v 16 Jesus caused Jews and non-Jews together to both become friends with God in one new group of believers. By dying on the cross, Jesus made it possible for them to stop hating each other.

\v 13 But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away from God have been brought near to God by the blood of Christ.
\v 14 For he is our peace because he made both Jews and Gentiles one people. By his body He destroyed the wall of hostility that divided us from each other.
\v 15 That is, he abolished the law of commandments and regulations so that he might create one new people out of two peoples, thus making peace.
\v 16 He did this to reconcile both peoples into one body to God through the cross, putting to death the hostility between them.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **But now in Christ Jesus** - Paul is marking a stark contrast before the Ephesians believed in Christ and after they believed in Christ.
  * **you who were once far away from God have been brought near to God** - Due to the believers sins, they were separated far from God. However, now Jesus has brought them near to God by his blood.
  * **he is our peace** - AT: "Jesus gives us his peace"
  * **By his body** - AT: "By his death on the cross"
  * **the wall of hostility** - AT: "the wall of hatred" or "ill will"
  * ** divided us from each other** - "Us" refers to both Paul and the Ephesians, that separated the Jewish believers from the Gentile believers. (See [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
  * **he abolished the law of commandments and regulations** - Jesus's blood satisfied the Law of Moses so that both the Jews and Gentiles can live at peace in Him.
  * **to reconcile both peoples** - AT: "bring together both the Jews and the Gentiles"
  * **putting to death the hostility between them** - Jesus eliminated the reason for Jews and Gentiles to be hostile towards each other. That is they were no longer required to live according to the Mosaic Law.
