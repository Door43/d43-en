====== Ephesians 02:1-3 ======

<usfm>
\v 1 Formerly, because you were habitually sinning \f + \ft doublet \f*, you were \add spiritually\add* dead\f + \ft Or: \add as unable to please God as a\add* corpse \f + \ft metaphor \f* is \f*.
\v 2 You were acting in the same \add evil\add* way as those who oppose Christ \f + \ft metonymy \f* act. That is, you were behaving in the \add evil\add* ways \add that Satan wanted you to behave\add*. He rules over evil spiritual beings that no person can see \f + \ft metonymy \f*. He is the spirit who now powerfully controls the people who disobey God.
\v 3 Formerly, we all used to disobey God as they do. We did the things that our self-centered nature wanted us to do. We habitually did those \add evil\add* deeds that our bodies and our minds wanted. When we were acting like that, it was certain that \add God\add* would punish \f + \ft metonymy \f* us, just like he will certainly punish all other \add evil people\add*.

\v 1 Before you trusted Christ, you were powerless to stop disobeying God and sinning, as if your life with God was dead.
\v 2 You once lived like most people in the world today who now follow Satan, the evil ruler over the evil spirits whom we do not see. Satan is the evil spirit who is now controlling the people who disobey God.
\v 3 We all once joined those who disobey God and acted like they do, allowing the evil desires from our bodies and in our minds to lead us to obey those desires. Just like all people, deep in our human thoughts, even as children, were the sinful desires that arouse God's anger.

\p
\v 1 You were dead in your disobedience and your sins
\v 2 in which you once lived, just like those living in the world right now who live following the evil ruler, who rules over the spiritual powers of the air, Satan, the evil spirit who is now working in the sons of disobedience. 
\v 3 We all once acted like these unbelievers, following the evil desires in our bodies and doing the evil things our minds wanted to do. Our sinful nature from childhood aroused God's wrath, just like everyone else.
