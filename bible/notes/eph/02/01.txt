====== Ephesians 02:1-3 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Formerly, because you were habitually sinning \f + \ft doublet \f*, you were \add spiritually\add* dead\f + \ft Or: \add as unable to please God as a\add* corpse \f + \ft metaphor \f* is \f*.
\v 2 You were acting in the same \add evil\add* way as those who oppose Christ \f + \ft metonymy \f* act. That is, you were behaving in the \add evil\add* ways \add that Satan wanted you to behave\add*. He rules over evil spiritual beings that no person can see \f + \ft metonymy \f*. He is the spirit who now powerfully controls the people who disobey God.
\v 3 Formerly, we all used to disobey God as they do. We did the things that our self-centered nature wanted us to do. We habitually did those \add evil\add* deeds that our bodies and our minds wanted. When we were acting like that, it was certain that \add God\add* would punish \f + \ft metonymy \f* us, just like he will certainly punish all other \add evil people\add*.

<usfm>
\v 1 Before you trusted Christ you were powerless to obey God. You were as helpless as a person who is dead.
\v 2 You were like most people in the world today, and you, too, did what Satan wants—Satan is the ruler the evil spirits who have such power over the world. Satan is the evil spirit who is at work in the lives of people who disobey God.
\v 3 We were at one time among those who disobeyed God; we did the evil things that we desired, things that would bring pleasure to our bodies and our minds. So God was very angry with us, just as with the others.

\c 2
\p
\v 1 As for you, you were dead in your trespasses and sins.
\v 2 It was in these that you once walked according to the age of this world. You were walking according to the ruler of the authorities of the air. This is the spirit of him who is working in the sons of disobedience.
\v 3 We all were once among these unbelievers. We were acting according to the evil desires of our flesh. We were doing the will of the flesh and of the mind. We were by nature children of wrath like the others.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul reminds the believers of their past and the way they now are before God.

  * **you were dead in your trespasses and sins** - This shows how sinful people are unable to obey God in the same way a dead person is unable to respond physically. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **your trespasses and sins** - The words "trespasses" and "sins" have similar meanings. Paul uses them together to emphasize the greatness of the people's sin. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **you once walked** - This expresses the behavior of how people live. AT: "you once lived" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **according to the age of this world** - The apostles also used "world" to refer to the selfish behaviors and corrupt values of the people living in this world. AT: "according to the values of people living in the world" or "following the principles of this present world" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the ruler of the authorities of the air** - This refers to the devil or Satan.
  * **the spirit of him who** - "the spirit of Satan, who"
  * **We were acting according to the evil desires of our flesh. We were doing the will of the flesh and of the mind** - The words "flesh" and "mind" represent the entire person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **children of wrath** - people with whom God is angry (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
