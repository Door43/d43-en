\v 9 You masters, just like your slaves \add should serve you well\add*, you similarly must treat them well. Stop threatening \add to beat\add* them \add if they do not do their work well\add*. Do not forget that the one who is their Lord and your Lord is in heaven. \add So he is the one who will say to you and your slaves whether he approves of what you and they have done\add*, and \add when he judges people\add*, he does not act more favorably \add toward some than he acts toward others\add*.

\v 9 And you masters, do the same things for your slaves. Do not threaten them. You know that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven. You know that there is no favoritism with him.
