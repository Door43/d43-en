\v 5 Slaves, be obedient  to your earthly masters with deep respect and trembling, in the honesty of your heart, as to Christ,
\v 6 not only to please them when they are watching you, but as slaves of Christ himself, sincerely doing the will of God from your heart,
\v 7 serving cheerfully as for the Lord  and not just for people,
\v 8 remembering that whatever good deed each person does, he will receive a reward from the Lord, whether that person is slave or free.
