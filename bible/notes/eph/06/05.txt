\v 5 You slaves, obey those who are your masters here on the earth. Obey them very respectfully and sincerely just like you obey Christ.
\v 6 Obey them not only when they are watching you. Instead, obey them as though you were slaves of Christ, not slaves of your masters. Do enthusiastically what God wants you to do.
\v 7 Happily serve your masters, as you would serve the Lord Jesus, not as you would serve ordinary people.
\v 8 Do this because you know that one day the Lord Jesus will reward each person for whatever good deeds that person has done. It makes no difference whether that person was slave or free.

\v 5 Slaves, be obedient to your earthly masters with deep respect and trembling, in the honesty of your heart. Be obedient to them as you would be obedient to Christ.
\v 6 Be obedient not only when your masters are watching in order to please them. Instead, be obedient as slaves of Christ, who do the will of God from your heart.
\v 7 Serve with all your heart, as though you were serving the Lord and not people,
\v 8 because we know that for whatever good deed each person does, he will receive a reward from the Lord, whether he is slave or free.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **be obedient to** - "obey." This is a command.
  * **deep respect and trembling** - The phrase "deep respect and trembling" uses two similar ideas to emphasize the importance of honoring their masters. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **and trembling** - Here "trembling" is an exaggeration used to emphasize how important it is that slaves obey their masters. AT: "and fear" or "as though you were shaking with fear" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **in the honesty of your heart** - "being completely honest" 
  * **as slaves of Christ** - Serve your earthly master as though your earthly master were Christ himself.
  * **Serve with all your heart, as though you were serving the Lord and not people** - "work joyfully, since you are working for the Lord and not only pleasing people"
