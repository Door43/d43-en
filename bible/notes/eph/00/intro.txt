=== What is the book of Ephesians about? ===

Ephesians is a letter about God’s relation to his people, the riches and blessings he gives to them in Christ, and how God’s people relate to one another and the love and unity they should have in the church. The letter begins with the theology of salvation—what God did to save his people. God acted with sovereign power to choose those who would believe, and he did that before the world was made. Salvation is a gift of God and it is the plan that was God’s pleasure and his will.  
 
The great themes of Ephesians caused Paul to praise and prayer as he was writing. Christ’s work of redemption not only forgives our sins, but it accomplishes reconciliation on many levels. The reconciling working of Christ gives us peace with God. His work reconciles everything that exists to God (1:10). His work makes peace between Jews and Greeks (2:11-22) and with all within the body of Christ. These themes in Ephesians, the work of God, the sacrifice of Christ, the church, Christian maturity, the new life, all work in us because we are now in Christ and we live in him, and he lives in us.

=== Who wrote the Book of Ephesians? ===

Ephesians was written by Paul from Rome, when he was in prison there. It was written about AD 60 (the same times as Colossians was written). Ephesians may have been a letter intended for several churches in the region near the city of Ephesus, and it may have been addressed to each church separately. Most ancient manuscripts have “in Ephesus” in the greeting.
