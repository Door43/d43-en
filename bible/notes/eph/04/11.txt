<usfm>
\v 11 Christ gave gifts like these: apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers,
\v 12 to equip those set apart for God for the work of service, for the building up of the body of Christ,
\v 13 until we all reach the unity of faith and knowledge of the Son of God, and reach complete adulthood as those who have grown into the full measure of Christ.
