<usfm>
\v 25 Therefore, quit lying to one another. As the scripture says, "Speak truthfully to one another because we now are each other's fellow believers." We now belong to one another in God's family.
\v 26 If you get angry, do not let your anger become sin. Before the end of the day, stop being angry
\v 27 so that you will not allow the devil to attack you.
</usfm>
