===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 25 Therefore, quit lying to one another. Instead, speak truthfully to one another because we now are each other's fellow believers; we now belong to one another in God's family.
\v 26 If you get angry, do not let your anger become sin. Before the end of the day, stop being angry
\v 27 so that you will not allow the devil to tempt you to do evil.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 25 Therefore put away falsehood. "Speak truth, each one with his neighbor," because we are members of each other.
\v 26 "Be angry, but do not sin." Do not let the sun go down upon your anger,
\v 27 nor give an opportunity to the devil.
