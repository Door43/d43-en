\v 22 \add You were taught\add* \f + \ft Or:\add They taught you\add* \f* that you must put aside \f + \ft metaphor \f* your evil nature\add ; that is, that you must not behave like you formerly did\add*. Your evil desires deceived you, making you want to do evil things and causing you to think that \add doing that was good for you\add*; and your thinking like that was destroying you \add spiritually\add*.

<usfm>
\v 20 But when you learned about Christ you did not learn to live like that.
\v 21 Now that you have heard about Jesus and he has taught you, you know that his way is the true way to live.
\v 22 Jesus taught that you must stop living the way you used to live. You were like corpses that were decaying because you were deceiving yourselves with what you desired.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 But this is not how you learned about Christ.
\v 21 I suppose that you have heard about him. I suppose that you have been taught in him, just as the truth is in Jesus.
\v 22 You must put off what is according to your former conduct, the old man. It is the old man that is rotting away because of deceitful desires.
