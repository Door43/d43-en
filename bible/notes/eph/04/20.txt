\v 20 But when you learned about Christ you did not learn to live like that.
\v 21 Now that you have heard about Jesus and he has taught you, you know that his way is the true way to live.
\v 22 Jesus taught you to stop living the way you used to live, when you did what your evil desires deceived you into doing.

\v 20 But this is not how you learned about Christ.
\v 21 If you have heard about him and have been taught about him, that this is the truth about Jesus,
\v 22 you must put off the old man—that which accords with your old conduct, which is being corrupted according to deceitful desires,
