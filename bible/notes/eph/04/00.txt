=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent all the lines of 4:8, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Spiritual gifts ==
Spiritual gifts are specific supernatural abilities given to Christians after they come to [[:en:obe:kt:faith|faith]] in Jesus. This is not an exhaustive list of the spiritual gifts. Some scholars believe that there are some gifts only given in the early church because they were foundational to the development of the church.

== Unity ==
Paul places a great importance on unity in the church. This is a major theme of this chapter. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Old man and new man ==
The term "old man" probably refers to the sinful nature that a person is born with, while the "new man" is the new nature or new life that is given to a person after they come to faith in Christ.
