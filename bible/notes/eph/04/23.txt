===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **you may be renewed** - AT: "you may be changed" or "you may be transformed"
  * **so that you may put on the new man** - An unbeliever becomes a new person when he becomes a believer in Christ just as a person puts on new clothes and looks totally different. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
