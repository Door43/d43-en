===== translationNotes: =====

  * **you may be renewed in the spirit of your mind** - AT: "God may help you grow closer to him and think in new ways"
  * **so that you may put on the new man** - An unbeliever becomes a new person who lives differently when he becomes a believer in Christ just as a person puts on new clothes and looks totally different. Having "put off" the old way of living ([[:en:bible:notes:eph:04:20|4:22]]), he now needs to "put on the new." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **which is according to God** - "which reflects the nature of God" or "which shows what God is like"
