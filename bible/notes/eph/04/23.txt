===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **you may be renewed** - AT: "you may be changed" or "you may be transformed"
  * **so that you may put on the new man**  - This shows how an unbeliever becomes a new person when he becomes a believer by the power of God, just as a person puts on new clothing and looks totally different. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
