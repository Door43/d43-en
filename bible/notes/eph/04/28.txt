<usfm>
\v 28 Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing that is good, that he may have whereof to give to him that has need.
\v 29 Let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth, but such as is good for edifying as the need may be, that it may give grace to them that hear.
\v 30 And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed to the day of redemption.
