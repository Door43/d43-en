\v 28 Whoever steals must steal no longer, but rather, he must labor, working usefully with his hands, so that he may be able to share with the person who has need.
\v 29 No corrupt speech must come out of your mouth, but instead words that are useful for building up others as they need it, to give grace to them who are listening.
\v 30 And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you have been sealed for the day of redemption.
