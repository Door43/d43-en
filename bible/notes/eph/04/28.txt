\v 28 Those who have been stealing must not steal any longer. Instead, they must work hard to earn their living by their own efforts, so that they may have something to give to those who are needy.
\v 29 Do not use foul language. Instead, say good things that will help people when they need help, things that help those who hear.

<usfm>
\v 28 Whoever steals must steal no longer. Instead, he must labor. He must work usefully with his hands, so that he may be able to share with the person who has need.
\v 29 No bad speech must come out of your mouth. Instead, words must come out that are useful for meeting needs, to provide benefit to those who are listening.
\v 30 And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God. It is by him that you have been sealed for the day of redemption.
