====== Ephesians 03 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

== "I pray" ==

This chapter is structured loosely as a prayer, but it is not a typical prayer. This is a unique “prayer” where Paul is not just talking to God directly, but is giving written instructions to the church in Ephesus.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Mystery ==
Paul refers to the church as a mystery. The role of the church in the plans of God was once not known, but has now been revealed by God. Part of this mystery involve the Gentile's equal standing with the Jews in the current plans of God.
