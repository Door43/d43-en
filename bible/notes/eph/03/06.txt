\v 6 This hidden truth is that the non-Jews now share together with Jews the spiritual riches of God, and belong to the same group of God's people, and will share all the things God has promised them, because they trust in Christ Jesus—this is the gospel.
\v 7 I am now God's servant to spread the good news, a work I did not deserve to do, but which God gave me working in me with his power.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 This hidden truth is that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body and fellow sharers in the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.
\v 7 For this I became a servant by the gift of God's grace given to me through the working of his power.
