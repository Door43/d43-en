===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 I pray that Christ may live in your hearts because you trust in him, and that you will be like a firmly rooted tree and a building founded upon stone,
\v 18 so that you may be fully able to understand, along with the all those set apart for God, how wide and long and high and deep is the love Christ.
\v 19 For this love is so great that we cannot understand it, but because of this love, I pray that God may fill you all with himself.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 I pray that Christ may live in your hearts through faith. I pray that you will be rooted and grounded in his love.
\v 18 May you be in his love so that you can understand, along with all the believers, what is the width, the length, the height, and the depth of Christ's love.
\v 19 I pray that you may know the greatness of Christ's love, which exceeds knowledge. May you do this so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **hearts through faith** - Here "heart" represents a person's soul, and "through" expresses the idea of means. Christ lives in the hearts of believers by means of God's gift of faith. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **that you will be rooted and grounded in his love** - Paul speaks of their faith as if it were a tree that has deep roots or a house built on a solid foundation. AT: "that you will be like a firmly rooted tree and a building built on stone." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **all the believers** - "all believers in Christ" or "all the saints"
  * **the width, the length, the height, and the depth of Christ's love** - Paul uses these expressions to describe the intensity with which Christ loves us. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
