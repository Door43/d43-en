\v 8 Although I am the least worthy of all God's people, God has enabled me by his kindness and mercy to proclaim to non-Jews the good news about what Christ has done for us, which is so much no one can describe it all.
\v 9 My mission is to explain to everyone what God's plan is, somethig that God has kept hidden from long ago, from the time when he created everything.

\v 8 To me this gift was given, although I am less than the lowest of those set apart for God, to proclaim to the Gentiles the gospel of the infinite riches of Christ
\v 9 and to enlighten everyone about what God's plan is, the hidden truth that was hidden from ages past by God, who created all things.
