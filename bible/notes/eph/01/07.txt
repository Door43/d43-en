===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **his **– This pronoun refers to God..
  * **beloved one **– This is referring to Jesus Christ.
  * **we **– This pronoun is referring to Paul and all other believers.
  * **riches of his grace **– This is referring to the greatness or abundance of his grace.
  * **us **– This pronoun is referring to Paul and all other believers.
  * **in all wisdom and understanding **– Since the Greek language has no punctuation, many versions assume this is saying God has given believers “all wisdom and understanding” which would make this is a hyperbole meaning God has given believers great wisdom and understanding. However many other versions assume this phrase in the beginning of a new sentence; therefore it would be translated “In all wisdom and understanding, God … “ (see verse 9)
