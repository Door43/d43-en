====== Ephesians 01 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

== "I pray" ==

This chapter is structured loosely as a prayer, but it is not a typical prayer. This is a unique "prayer" where Paul is not just talking to God directly, but is giving written instructions to the church in Ephesus. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Predestination ==
Many scholars believe this chapter teaches on a subject known as "predestination." This is related to the biblical concept of "to [[:en:obe:kt:predestine|predestine]]" and some scholars take this to indicate that God has chosen some to be eternally saved before the foundation of the world. Since this is a source of theological diversity, extra care should be taken in translation, especially with regards to elements of causation in this chapter.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "In Christ" ==
This is an important phrase used by Paul to illustrate many different truths. Typically, it is used to 
connect a person with their new identity in Christ, but it is not limited to this meaning. With its simple form, the term's complexity may be difficult to translate.
