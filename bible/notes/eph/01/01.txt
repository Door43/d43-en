===== Translation Notes: =====

This book is a letter from Paul to members of the church at Ephesus.

  * **through the will of God** - "by the will of God" or "chosen by God"
  * **set apart for God** - "morally blameless" or "holy ones"
  * **May grace be to you and peace** - This is a common greeting and blessing Paul often uses in his letters. The word "you" refers to the Ephesian believers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
