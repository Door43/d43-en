\v 11 Long ago God chose to unite us to Christ. He planned to do this, and he always does exactly what he wishes to do.
\v 12 God did that so that we who believe in Christ would live to give praise to God's glory. We were the first ones to trust in Christ.

\v 11 In Christ we were chosen as God's inheritance. We were decided on beforehand, in the plan of the one who does all things by the purpose of his will.
\v 12 God did this so that we might exist for the praise of his glory. We were the first to have confidence in Christ.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **we were chosen as God's inheritance** - The word "we" is includes of all believers. This can be stated in active form. AT: "God chose us as his inheritance" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **inheritance** - The Christian believers are presented here as God's own people. They are spoken of as if they were something that he inherited. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **We were the first** - Here Paul refers to the Jewish believers who first heard the good news, not the believers at Ephesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **the plan of the one who does** - "the plan of God, who does"
