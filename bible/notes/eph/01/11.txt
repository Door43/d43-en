\v 11 Long ago God chose to unite us to Christ. He planned to do this, and he always does exactly what he wishes to do.
\v 12 God did that so that we who believe in Christ would live to give praise to God's glory. We were the first ones to trust in Christ.

\v 11 In Christ we were appointed as heirs. We were decided on beforehand according to the plan of him who works out everything according to the purpose of his will.
\v 12 God appointed us as heirs so that we might be the first to have confident hope in Christ, so we would be for the praise of his glory.
