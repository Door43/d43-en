\v 11 Long ago God chose us to be joined to Christ, just as he had planned—and he always does exactly what he wishes to do.
\v 12 He did those so that the Jews, who confidently expected the Messiah to come and save them before the non-Jews knew anything about Christ, would praise him for his kindness.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 In Christ we were chosen and set beforehand, according to the plan of the one who does all things by the intent of his will,
\v 12 so that we might exist for the praise of his glory, we who were the first to trust in Christ.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **we were chosen** - AT: “we were made to be God's inheritance” or “we were chosen to receive God's inheritance”
  * **we were chosen...we who were the first** - The word "we" now refers to Paul, his Jewish brothers in Christ but not the Gentile (non-Jewish) believers. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **the plan of the one ** - AT: "The plan of God"
  * **intent of his will ** - AT: "intent of God's will"
  * **we who were the first ** - Paul continues to exclude the Gentiles (non-Jews) from his use of "we."
