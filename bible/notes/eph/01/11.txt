\v 11 Long ago God chose us to be joined to Christ, just as he had planned—and he always does exactly what he wishes to do.
\v 12 He did those so that the Jews, who confidently expected the Messiah to come and save them before the non-Jews knew anything about Christ, would praise him for his kindness.

  * **the plan of the one ** - "The plan of God"
  * **intent of his will ** - "intent of God's will"
  * **we who were the first ** - Paul continues to exclude the Gentiles (non-Jews) from his use of "we".
