<usfm>
\v 11 Long ago God chose to unite us to Christ. He planned to do this, and he always does exactly what he wishes to do.
\v 12 God did that so that we who believe in Christ would live to give praise to God's glory. We were the first ones to trust in Christ.

\v 11 In Christ we were appointed as heirs. We were decided on beforehand according to the plan of him who works out everything according to the purpose of his will.
\v 12 God appointed us as heirs so that we might be the first to have a certain hope in Christ, so we would be for the praise of his glory.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **we were appointed as heirs** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God chose us to be heirs" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **We were decided on beforehand** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God chose us ahead of time" or "God chose us long ago" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **we were appointed as heirs ... We were decided on beforehand** - By means of these pronouns "we," Paul is referring to himself and the other Jewish Christians, those who trusted Christ before the Ephesian believers did. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **so that we might be the first** - Again, the word "we" refers to the Jewish believers who first heard the good news, not the believers at Ephesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **so we would be for the praise of his glory** - "so that we would live to praise him for his glory"
  * **so that we might be the first ... so we would be for the praise** - Once again, the pronouns "we" refer to Paul and the other Jewish believers, not to the Ephesian believers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
