===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Because he loves us, God planned long ago to adopt us as his own children because of what Jesus Christ has done. He planned to adopt us because it pleased him to have us as his children, so he did what he wanted to do.
\v 6 Because of this we now praise God for his amazing kindness given to us by his Son whom he loves, kindness that we did not deserve.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 \f + \ft Some interpreters place the last phrase of EPH 1:4 \fqa in love \fqa* with verse 5 so that it reads, \fqa In love God chose us ... \f* God chose us beforehand for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of his will. 
\v 6 Our adoption results in the praise of his glorious grace that he has freely given us in the One he loves.
