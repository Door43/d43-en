<usfm>
\v 5 Because he loves us, God planned long ago to adopt us as his own children because of what Jesus Christ has done. He planned to adopt us because it pleased him to have us as his children, so he did what he wanted to do.
\v 6 Because of this we now praise God for his amazing kindness given to us by his Son whom he loves, kindness that we did not deserve.
