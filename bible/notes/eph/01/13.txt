===== translationNotes: =====

  * **it was in him that you also have believed and were sealed** - The Ephesian Christians believed in Christ and are spoken of as being in union with him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit** - Wax was placed on a letter and stamped with a symbol representing the person who wrote the letter. Paul uses this custom as a picture to show how God has used the Holy Spirit to assure us that we belong to him.

  * **The Spirit is the guarantee** - "The Holy Spirit is a pledge." God gave us the Holy Spirit as a promise of his gift of eternal life. 
  * **inheritance** - Receiving what God has promised believers is spoken of as though one inherits property or wealth from a family member. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **until the possession is gained** - This can be stated in the active tense. AT: "until we obtain what God will give us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
