\v 13 Now you Ephesians and other non-Jews have heard the true message, the good news that Jesus saves everyone who believes him. And you have believed in Christ, so it is as if God's Spirit had marked you on your foreheads to show that you belong to God.
\v 14 The Holy Spirit proves to us that we will receive all that God has promised; that is, that God forgives us and accepts us as his own people. All this is great reason to praise him!
