\v 19 And I pray that you will know how very powerfully God acts for us who are trusting in Christ. He works powerfully for us,
\v 20 just like he acted powerfully for Christ when he caused Christ to become alive again after he died, and raised him to the place of highest honor in heaven.
\v 21 In that place, Christ rules as supreme over every powerful spirit on every level of authority and over every name that exists. Jesus is much higher than any other being, not only now, but forever.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 In my prayers I ask that you may know the incomparable greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to the working of his great strength.
\v 20 This is the same power that God worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead ones and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places.
\v 21 He seated Christ far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named. Christ will rule, not only in this age, but also in the age to come.
