<usfm>
\v 19 And I pray that you will know how very powerfully God acts for us who are trusting in Christ. He works powerfully for us,
\v 20 just like he acted powerfully for Christ when he caused Christ to become alive again after he died, and raised him to the place of highest honor in heaven.
\v 21 In that place, Christ rules as supreme over every powerful spirit on every level of authority and over every name that exists. Jesus is much higher than any other being, not only now, but forever.

<usfm>
\v 19 and what is the exceeding greatness of his power in us who believe, according to the working of the strength of his power.
\v 20 This is the power that worked in Christ when  God raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places,
\v 21 far above all rule, authority, power, dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in the age to come.
