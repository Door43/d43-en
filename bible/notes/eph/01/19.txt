<usfm>
\v 19 And I pray that you will know how very powerfully God acts for us who are trusting in Christ. He works powerfully for us,
\v 20 just like he acted powerfully for Christ when he caused Christ to become alive again after he died, and raised him to the place of highest honor in heaven.
\v 21 In that place, Christ rules as supreme over every powerful spirit on every level of authority and over every name that exists. Jesus is much higher than any other being, not only now, but forever.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 I pray that you may know the exceeding greatness of his power in us who believe. This greatness is according to the working of the strength of his power.
\v 20 This is the power that worked in Christ when God raised him from the dead ones and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places.
\v 21 He seated Christ far above all rule, authority, power, dominion, and every name that is named. He seated Christ not only for this age, but also for the age to come.
