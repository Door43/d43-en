===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Look carefully how you live—not as unwise but as wise** - Unwise people do not guard themselves against sin. Wise people, however, can identify sin and flee from it. AT: "Therefore you must be careful to live as a wise person rather than a foolish person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Redeem the time** - Using time wisely is spoken of as if it were redeeming the time. AT: "Do the best things you can with your time" or "Use time wisely" or "Put time to its best use" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **because the days are evil** - The word "days" is a metonym for what people do during those days. AT: "because the people around you are doing all kinds of evil things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
