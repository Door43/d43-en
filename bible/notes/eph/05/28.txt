<usfm>
\v 28 Each man should love his wife as he loves his own body. When men love their wives, it is as though they loved themselves,
\v 29-30 because no one ever hated his own body. Instead, he feeds his own body and cares for it, just like Christ also cares for all us believers in his worldwide assembly. We have become one group of believers that belongs to him.

\v 29 No one ever hated his own body, but instead he nourishes and loves it, as Christ also loves the Church,
\v 30 because we are members of his body.
