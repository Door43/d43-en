===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Do not suggest any kind of immoral act and do not desire what others have or wrong things others do. Such sins can cause people to say bad things about God's people, who are together set apart for God, not for sin.
\v 4 Do not tell obscene stories to others or say foolish things or joke about committing sins. Such things are not what people who belong to God talk about. Instead, thank God for his love when you talk to others.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 3 Sexual immorality or any impurity or sensual greed must not be suggested among you, as is proper for those set apart for God—
\v 4 nor obscenity, foolish talk, or degrading jokes, which are proper, but rather thankfulness.
</usfm>
