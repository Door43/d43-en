===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul continues to tell the believers how they should and should not live as God's children.

  * **Therefore be imitators of God** - "Therefore you should do what God does." Therefore refers back to [[:en:bible:notes:eph:04:31|4:32]] which tells why believers should imitate God, because Christ forgave believers.
  * **as dearly loved children** - God desires us to imitate or follow him since we are his children. AT: "as dearly loved children imitate their fathers" or "because you are his children and he loves you dearly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **walk in love** - Walking is a common way to express the idea of living one's life. AT: "live a life of love" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God** - "like a sweet-smelling offering and sacrifice to God"
