====== Ephesians 05:8-12 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 because formerly you \add did not know God's truth\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add as those who\add* are in darkness \add do not know what is around them\add*. But now \add it is as though\add* you are in the light \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add because you know God's truth\add* because of your relationship with the Lord \add Jesus\add*. So do those things that those who know God's truth \f + \ft metaphor \f* should do.
\v 9 Keep in mind that \add as\add* light \f + \ft metaphor \f* produces \add things that are good, those who know God's truth should do those things\add* that are good, righteous, and honest.
\v 10 And as \add you do that\add*, try to find out\f + \ft Or: to discover \f* what pleases the Lord.
\v 11 Do not do the worthless deeds that the people who are in \add spiritual\add* darkness\f + \ft Or: who do not know God's truth \f* \f + \ft metaphor \f* do. Instead, let others know that those people's deeds are worthless.
\v 12 It is shameful for God's people to even talk \add among themselves about\add* those evil deeds that evil people do secretly and habitually.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Before you believed in the Lord Jesus, you were living in sinful disobedience, as if a dark night surrounded you all the time. But now live in the light of the Lord.
\v 9 Like light produces good things, so also those who live in the light of Jesus know and do what is good, right, and true.
\v 10 Test and find out what pleases the Lord.
\v 11 Do not participate together with those who are doing the worthless deeds done in spiritual darkness. Instead, just say, "Those sinful acts are worthless,"
\v 12 because the evil things people do in the secret of darkness are too shameful to describe in the light.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light
\v 9 (for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness, and truth),
\v 10 and find out what is pleasing to the Lord.
\v 11 Do not associate with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather expose them.
\v 12 For it is shameful even to mention the things they do in secret.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For you were once darkness** - Just as one cannot see in the dark, so people who love to sin lack spiritual understanding. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness, and truth** - Just as a healthy tree produces good fruit, a believer will do what is good, do the righteous things God wants him to do, and will speak true words. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Do not associate with the unfruitful works of darkness** - Paul speaks of the useless, sinful things that unbelievers do as if they are evil deeds people do in the dark so no one will see them.
