====== Ephesians 05:8-12 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 because formerly you \add did not know God's truth\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add as those who\add* are in darkness \add do not know what is around them\add*. But now \add it is as though\add* you are in the light \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add because you know God's truth\add* because of your relationship with the Lord \add Jesus\add*. So do those things that those who know God's truth \f + \ft metaphor \f* should do.
\v 9 Keep in mind that \add as\add* light \f + \ft metaphor \f* produces \add things that are good, those who know God's truth should do those things\add* that are good, righteous, and honest.
\v 10 And as \add you do that\add*, try to find out\f + \ft Or: to discover \f* what pleases the Lord.
\v 11 Do not do the worthless deeds that the people who are in \add spiritual\add* darkness\f + \ft Or: who do not know God's truth \f* \f + \ft metaphor \f* do. Instead, let others know that those people's deeds are worthless.
\v 12 It is shameful for God's people to even talk \add among themselves about\add* those evil deeds that evil people do secretly and habitually.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Before you believed in the Lord Jesus, you were living in sinful disobedience, as if a dark night surrounded you all the time. But now you live in the light of the Lord.
\v 9 Like light produces good things, so also those who live in the light of Jesus know and do what is good, right, and true;
\v 10 they openly show what pleases the Lord.
\v 11 Do not participate together with those who are doing the worthless deeds done in spiritual darkness. Instead, just say, "Those sinful acts are worthless,"
\v 12 because the evil things people do in the secret of darkness are too shameful to describe in the light.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. So walk as children of light—
\v 9 because the fruit of the light is all goodness, righteousness, and truth,
\v 10 —showing what is pleasing to the Lord.
\v 11 Have no participation with the unfruitful works of the darkness, but rather expose them,
\v 12 for the things done by them in secret are too shameful even to describe.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **For you were once darkness** - Just as one can not see in the dark, so people who live in sin lack spiritual understanding. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **but now you are light in the Lord** - Just as one can see in the light, so people who live in righteousness have spiritual understanding. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **because the fruit of the light is all goodness, righteousness, and truth** - The works coming from the life of a believer (goodness, righteousness, and truth) are like the good fruit produced by a healthy tree. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **Have no participation with the unfruitful works of the darkness** - AT: "Do not be involved with the unfruitful works of sin or unbelievers"
    * **the unfruitful works of the darkness** - The works of someone living in spiritual darkness are like the evil actions of people who do evil works hidden by the darkness at night. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **but rather expose them** - AT: "but rather show them to be wrong"
