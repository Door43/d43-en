===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 You can be sure of this: No person who is sexually immoral or indecent, or who is greedy (for this is the same as worshiping idols) will be among God's people over whom Christ rules as king.
\v 6 Do not let anyone deceive you with false arguments. Because they do these sinful things, God will be angry with the people who disobey him.



\p
\v 7 So do not join with those who do these kinds of sins.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 For you can be certain that no sexually immoral, impure, or greedy person, that is, one who worships idols, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.
\v 6 Let no one deceive you with empty words. Because of these things the anger of God is coming upon the children of disobedience.
\v 7 So do not be participants with them.
