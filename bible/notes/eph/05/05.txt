<usfm>
\v 5 You can be sure of this: No person who is sexually immoral or indecent, or who is greedy (for this is the same as worshiping idols) will be among God's people over whom Christ rules as king.
\v 6 Do not let anyone deceive you with false arguments. Because they do these sinful things, God will be angry with the people who disobey him.

\v 7 So do join with those who do these kinds of sins.
