====== Ephesians 05:13-14 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 But when \add God's people rebuke those evil people about their deeds, it will be clear\f + \ft Or: evident \f* how evil their deeds really are, just like\add* everything exposed to the light becomes visible \f + \ft Or:as light ( metaphor ) reveals everything \add that we cannot see in the darkness\add* \f*.
\v 14 \add Just like something on which a light shines reflects that light\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add whoever has learned God's truth reveals that truth to others\add*. That is why \add we believers\add* say this:
\q You who are not aware of your sins, become aware of them \f + \ft metaphor \f*!
\q It is as though you are sound asleep, so wake up!
\q Be like dead people who are becoming alive again!
\q Christ will cause you to know God's truth, just like a light \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\q that shines causes people to know what is in the darkness.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 Everything that light exposes can then be clearly seen and better understood
\v 14 because the light shows what it truly is. It is like when God's word explains the sins that destroy people and Jesus who forgives and renews people. So believers say, 
\q "Wake up from your sleep 
\q and arise from living like dead people. 
\q Christ will enable you to understand 
\q his forgiveness and new life."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 Everything is revealed by the light,
\v 14 because the light is shining on it all. Therefore it has been said, 
\q "Awake, you who sleep, 
\q and rise from the dead, 
\q and Christ will shine on you."
</usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **Everything is revealed by the light** - Just as light reveals things that were hidden in the physical world, so the light of Christ reveals the evil spiritual actions of unbelievers in the spiritual world. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **Awake, you who sleep, and rise from the dead** - Unbelievers need to wake up from being dead spiritually just as a person who has died must come alive again in order to respond. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **Christ will shine on you** - Christ will enable an unbeliever to understand his provision of forgiveness and new life just as light shows what is actually there that was hidden by darkness. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
