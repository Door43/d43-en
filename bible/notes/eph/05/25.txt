====== Ephesians 05:25-27 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 25 Each of you husbands, love your wife as Christ loved all of \add us who would become\add* believers, with the result that he willingly died for our sake,
\v 26 in order that he might set us apart for himself\f + \ft Or: cause us to belong to him \f*. That is, by \add revealing his\add* message \add to us\add*, he wanted to \add remove the guilt of our sin, just like people remove dirt from something\add* by washing it \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 27 \add Christ did that\add* in order that he might cause all of us believers to be a glorious group of people that belong to him, people that do not have any moral flaws\f + \ft Or: imperfections \f*, but instead might be completely pure \f + \ft doublet \f* when he gathers us to his presence\f + \ft Or: to himself \f*.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 25 Each of you husbands, love your wife as Christ loved all believers and gave up his own life for us on the cross,
\v 26 so that he might set us apart for himself. By the power of his word Jesus purified believers by removing the punishment for our sins, as if he had washed us with water.
\v 27 Now Christ can present all believers to himself as a completely clean, forgiven, faultless group, without sin.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 25 Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.
\v 26 Christ gave himself for the church so that he might make her holy, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word.
\v 27 Christ cleansed the church so that he might present her to himself as glorious, without stain or wrinkle or any such thing, that she is be holy and without fault.

  * **General Information:** - Here the words "himself" and "he" refer to Christ. The word "her" refers to the church.

  * **love your wives** - Here "love" refers to unselfish serving or giving love to wives.
  * **gave himself up** - "allowed people to kill him"
  * **having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word** - Possible meanings are 1) Paul is referring to God's making Christ's people clean by God's word and through water baptism in Christ or 2) Paul is saying God made us spiritually clean from our sins by the word of God as we make our bodies clean by washing with water. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **for her ... make her holy ... cleansed her** - Paul speaks of the assembly of believers as though it were a woman whom Jesus will marry. AT: "for us ... make us holy ... cleansed us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **without stain or wrinkle** - Paul speaks of the church as though it were a garment that is clean and in good condition. He uses the same idea in two ways to emphasize the church's purity. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **holy and without fault** - The phrase "without fault" means basically the same thing as "holy." Paul uses the two together to emphasize the church's purity. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
