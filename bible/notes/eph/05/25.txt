===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 25 Each of you husbands, love your wife as Christ loved all of \add us who would become\add* believers, with the result that he willingly died for our sake,
\v 26 in order that he might set us apart for himself\f + \ft Or: cause us to belong to him \f*. That is, by \add revealing his\add* message \add to us\add*, he wanted to \add remove the guilt of our sin, just like people remove dirt from something\add* by washing it \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 27 \add Christ did that\add* in order that he might cause all of us believers to be a glorious group of people that belong to him, people that do not have any moral flaws\f + \ft Or: imperfections \f*, but instead might be completely pure \f + \ft doublet \f* when he gathers us to his presence\f + \ft Or: to himself \f*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 25 Each of you husbands, love your wife as Christ loved all believers and gave up his own life for us on the cross,
\v 26 so that he might set us apart for himself. By the power of his word Jesus purified believers by removing the punishment for our sins, as if he had washed us with water.
\v 27 Now Christ can present all believers to himself as a completely clean, forgiven, faultless group, without sin.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 25 Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the Church and gave himself up for her,
\v 26 that he might make her holy because he cleansed us by the washing of water by the word,
\v 27 that he might present to himself the Church as glorious, without  stain or wrinkle or any such thing, but instead holy and without fault.
