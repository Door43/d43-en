\v 18 And do not get drunk with wine, for that leads to reckless behavior. Instead, be filled with the Holy Spirit,

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul ends his instructions on how all believers should live.

  * **And do not get drunk with wine** - "You should not get drunk from drinking wine"
  * **Instead, be filled with the Holy Spirit** - "Instead, you should be controlled with the Holy Spirit"
  * **psalms and hymns and spiritual songs** - Possible meanings are that 1) Paul is using these words as a merism for "all sorts of songs to praise God" or 2) Paul is listing specific forms of music. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism|Merism]])
  * **psalms** - These are probably songs from the Old Testament book of Psalms that Christians sang.
  * **hymns** - These are songs of praise and worship that may have been written specifically for Christians to sing.
  * **spiritual songs** - Possible meanings are 1) these are songs that Holy Spirit inspires a person to sing right at that moment or 2) "spiritual songs" and "hymns" are doublets and mean basically the same thing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
