\v 23 And God raised up another adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer
king of Zobah.
\v 24 And he gathered men to him, and became captain over a troop, when David killed them
of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and lived therein, and reigned in Damascus.
\v 25 And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief that Hadad
did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.
