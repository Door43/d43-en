\v 23 God also raised up another adversary to Solomon, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his master Hadadezer, king of Zobah.
\v 24 Rezon gathered men to himself and became captain over a small force, when David defeated the men of Zobah. Rezon's men went to Damascus and lived there, and Rezon controlled Damascus.
\v 25 He was an enemy of Israel all the days of Solomon, along with the trouble that Hadad
caused. Rezon abhorred Israel and reigned over Aram.
