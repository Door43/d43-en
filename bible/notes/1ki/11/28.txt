<usfm> \v 28 Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor. Solomon saw that the young man was industrious, so he gave him command over all the labor of the house of Joseph. \v 29 At that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him on the road. Now Ahijah had dressed in a new garment, and the two men were alone in the field. \v 30 Then Ahijah grabbed hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore it into twelve pieces. </usfm>
