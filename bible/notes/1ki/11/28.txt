\v 28 And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he gave him charge over all the labor of the house of Joseph.
\v 29 And it came to pass at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in
the way; now Ahijah had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field.
\v 30 And Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore it in twelve pieces.
