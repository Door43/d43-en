\p
\v 14 Then Yahweh raised up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite. He was from the royal family of Edom.
\v 15 When David was in Edom, Joab the captain of the army had gone up to bury the dead, every man who had been killed in Edom.
\v 16 Joab and all Israel remained there six months until he had killed every male in Edom.
\v 17 But Hadad was taken with other Edomites by his father’s servants into Egypt, since Hadad was still a little child.
