\v 14 And Jehovah raised up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king’s seed in Edom.
\v 15 For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, and had
struck every male in Edom
\v 16 (for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom);
\v 17 that Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father’s servants with him, to go into Egypt, Hadad being yet a little
child.
