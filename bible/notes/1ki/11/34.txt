\v 34 However, I will not take the whole kingdom out of Solomon's hand. Instead, I have made him ruler all the days of his life, for David my servant’s sake whom I chose, the one who kept my commandments and my statutes.
\v 35 But I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand, and I will give it to you, ten tribes.
\v 36 I will give one tribe to Solomon's son, so that David my servant may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city in which I have chosen to put my name.
