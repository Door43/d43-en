\v 11 and said to him, "You have chosen to disobey the agreement that I made with you and to disobey what I commanded you. So I am surely not going to allow you to rule all of your kingdom. I am going to allow one of your officials to rule it.
\v 12 But, because of what \add I promised\add* your father David, I will allow you to rule all your kingdom while you are still \add living\add*. \add After you die\add*, I will not allow your son to rule the whole kingdom \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 13 But I will not take all the kingdom away from him. Instead, I will allow him to rule one tribe, because of what I promised to David, who served me \add well\add*, and because \add I want David's descendants to rule in\add* Jerusalem, \add where my temple is located\add*."

<usfm>
\v 11 Yahweh said to him, "You have chosen to disobey the covenant that I made with you and to disobey what I commanded you. So I am certainly not going to allow you to rule all of your kingdom. I am going to allow one of your officials to rule.
\v 12 But because of what I promised your father David, I will allow you to rule all your kingdom while you are still living. After you die, I will not allow your son to rule the whole kingdom.
\v 13 But I will not stop him from ruling some of the kingdom. I will allow him to rule one tribe, because of what I promised to David, who served me well, and because I want David's descendants to rule in Jerusalem, where my temple is located."

<usfm>
\v 11 Therefore Yahweh said to Solomon, "Because you have done this and have not kept the covenant and my statutes that I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you and give it to your servant.
\v 12 However, for David your father's sake, I will not do it in your lifetime, but I will tear it out of the hand of your son.
\v 13 Yet I will not tear away all the kingdom; I will give one tribe to your son for David my servant's sake, and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen."
