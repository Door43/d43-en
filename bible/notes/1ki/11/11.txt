\v 11 Therefore Yahweh said to Solomon, "Because you have done this and have not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you give it to your servant.
\v 12 However in your days I will not do it, for David your father’s sake, but I will tear it out of the hand of your son.
\v 13 Yet I will not tear away all the kingdom; but I will give one tribe to your son, for David my servant’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake whom I have chosen."
