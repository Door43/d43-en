Ahijah continues to tell Jeroboam what Yahweh has said.

  * **I will take you** - Here the word "I" refers to Yahweh and the word "you" refers to Jeroboam.
  * **what is right in my eyes** - See how you translated this phrase in [[en:bible:notes:1ki:11:31|11:33]].
  * **build you a sure house** - AT: "establish for you a lasting kingdom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
