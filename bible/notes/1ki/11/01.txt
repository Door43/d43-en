===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Now King Solomon** - The word "Now" is used here to mark a break in the main storyline where the narrator starts to tell a new part of the story.
  * **turn your heart to their gods** - AT: "persuade you to worship the gods that they worship"(UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
