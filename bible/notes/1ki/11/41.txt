===== translationNotes: =====

  * **are they not written in the book of the events of Solomon?** - This can be expressed in active form and assumes that the answer is positive. The question is rhetorical and is used for emphasis. AT: "you can find them in the book of the events of Solomon." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the book of the events of Solomon** - This book no longer exists.
  * **He slept with his ancestors and he was buried** - The clause "slept with his ancestors" is a metaphor that expresses as a euphemism the death of a person in more gentle words. AT: "He died and he was buried with his ancestors" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **he was buried** - This can be expressed in active form. AT: "people buried him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
