\v 8 And though this temple is so beautiful now,  everyone who passes by it will be astonished and will hiss and they will ask,  'Why has Yahweh done this to this land and to this temple?'
\v 9 and they will answer, 'Because they ignored Yahweh their God, who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt,
and they followed other gods and worshipped them and served them. So Yahweh has brought all this disaster upon them.' "
