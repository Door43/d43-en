===== translationNotes: =====

  * **if you walk before me as David your father walked** - The way a person lives is spoken of as if that person were walking on a path. AT: "if you live the way I want you to live, just as David your father did" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in integrity of heart and in uprightness** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize how righteous David was. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **the throne of your kingdom** - Here "throne" refers to his reign. AT: "your dynasty" or "your reign" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **will never fail to be on the throne of Israel** - The action of ruling a kingdom is spoken of as if it were a person sitting on a throne. This can be expressed positively. AT: "will always rule over Israel" (See:  [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
