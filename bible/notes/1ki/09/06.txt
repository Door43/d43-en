\v 6 But if you turn away, you or your children, and do not keep my commandments and my statutes that I have placed before you, and if you go and worship other gods and bow down to them,
\v 7 then will I cut off Israel from off the ground that I have given them; and this house that I have consecrated for my namex97I will cast it out of my sight. Then the name 'Israel' will become just a proverb and a joke among all the peoples.
