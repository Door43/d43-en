\v 12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had instructed when he said, “Come back to me on the third day.”
 
\v 13 The king answered the people roughly and ignored the advice of the old men that they had given him.
\v 14 He spoke to them following the advice of the young men; he said, "My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke. My father scourged you with whips, but I will scourge you with scorpions."
