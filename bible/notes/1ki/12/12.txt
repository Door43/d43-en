\v 12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had said, saying, "Come to me again the third day."
\v 13 The king answered the people roughly, and ignored the counsel of the old men whom they had given him.
\v 14 He spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, "My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke. My father scouraged you with whips, but I will whip you with scorpions."
