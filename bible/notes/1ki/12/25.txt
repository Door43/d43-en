\v 25 Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and lived there. He went out from there and built Peniel.
\v 26 Jeroboam thought in his heart, "Now the kingdom will return to the house of David.
\v 27 If these people go up to offer sacrifices in the temple of Yahweh at Jerusalem, then the heart of these people will turn again to their master, to Rehoboam king of Judah. They will kill me and return to Rehoboam king of Judah."
