===== translationNotes: =====

  * **all Israel was coming** - Here "Israel" represents all the men of Israel capable of fighting. "All Israel" is a generalization which means almost all the men of Israel. AT: "all the men of Israel were coming"​ (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **It happened that** - This phrase is used here to mark where the action starts. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **Jeroboam ... Nebat** - These are the names of men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
