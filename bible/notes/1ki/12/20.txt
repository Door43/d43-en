===== translationNotes: =====

  * **It happened that** - This phrase is used here to mark an important event in the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **when all Israel heard** - "All Israel" is a generalization that means the capable men of Israel who represent the rest of the people by a synecdoche. AT: "when all the leaders of Israel heard" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **king over all Israel** - "Israel" implicitly means the northern ten tribes that rebelled against Rehoboam. AT: "king over all of the 10 tribes of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
