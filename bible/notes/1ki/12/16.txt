\v 16 When all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered him and said,
\q "What share do we have in David?
\q2 We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse!
\q Go to your tents, Israel.
\q2 Now see to your own house, David."
\p
So Israel went back to their tents.
\v 17 But as for the people of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam became king over them.
