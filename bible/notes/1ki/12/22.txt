\v 22 But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
\v 23 Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, saying,
\v 24 Thus says Jehovah, You shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his
house; for this thing is of me. So they listened to the word of Jehovah, and returned and went their way, according to the
word of Jehovah.
