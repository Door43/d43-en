\v 28 Therefore King Jeroboam took counsel and made two calves of gold, and he said to them, "It is too much for you to go up to
Jerusalem. Look, your gods, O Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt."
\v 29 And he set the one in Bethel and the other put he in Dan.
\v 30 So this act became a sin. The people went to worship before one or the other, even all the way  to Dan.
