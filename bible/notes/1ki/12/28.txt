\v 28 So he consulted his advisors, and then he did what they suggested. He told his workers to make gold statues of two calves. Then he said to the people, "You have been going to Jerusalem to worship for a long time. You are making too big an effort to keep going there. You people of Israel, look! These statues are the gods that brought our ancestors up from Egypt! So you can worship these, here!"
\v 29 He told his workers to place one of the statues in the city of Bethel in the south and one in the city of  Dan in the north.
\v 30 So what Jeroboam did caused the people to sin. Some of them went and worshiped the calf at Bethel, and others went and worshiped the other calf at Dan.

\v 28 So King Jeroboam sought advice and made two calves of gold; he said to the people, "It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Look, these are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt."
\v 29 He set up one in Bethel and the other in Dan.
\v 30 So this act became a sin. The people went to one or the other, all the way  to Dan.
