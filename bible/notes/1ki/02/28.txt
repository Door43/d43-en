\v 28 The news came to Joab, for Joab had supported Adonijah, though he did not support Absalom. So Joab fled to the tent of Yahweh and took hold of the horns of the altar.
\v 29 It was told King Solomon that Joab had fled to the tent of Yahweh and was now beside the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, "Go, execute him."
