===== Translation Notes: =====

Benaiah goes to execute Joab.

  * **take away from me and from my father's house the blood which Joab shed without cause**  - Here "house" stands for the descendants of David while "blood" represents guilt. AT: "remove the guilt for the murders Joab committed from me and my family" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
