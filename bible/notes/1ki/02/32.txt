<usfm>
\v 32 May Yahweh return his blood on his own head, because he attacked two men more righteous and better than himself and killed them with the sword, Abner son of Ner, the captain of the army of Israel, and Amasa son of Jether, the captain of the army of Judah, without my father David knowing it.
\v 33 So may their blood return on the head of Joab and on the head of his descendants forever. But to David and his descendants, and to his house, and to his throne, may there be peace forever from Yahweh."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - King Solomon explains why Joab should die.

  * **May Yahweh return his blood on his own head** - The word "his" refers to Joab. "Blood" refers to guilt. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **more righteous and better** - These words mean basically the same thing and emphasize that Abner and Amasa were much better men than Joab. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **on the head of Joab and on the head of his descendants** - This is using "head" to describe the whole person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **and to his house, and to his throne** - Here "house" and "throne" represent David's "descendants" and David's "rule." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
