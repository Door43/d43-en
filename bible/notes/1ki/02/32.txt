\v 32 May Yahweh return his blood on his own head, because he attacked two men more righteous and better than himself and killed them with the sword, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the army of Judah, without my father David knowing it. 
\v 33 So may their blood return on the head of Joab and on the head of his descendants forever. But to David and his descendants, and to his house, and to his throne, may there be peace forever from Yahweh."
