\v 26 Then to Abiathar the priest the king said, "Go to Anathoth, to your own fields. You are worthy of death,
but I will not at this time put you to death, because you carried the ark of Yahweh God before David my father and suffered in every way my father suffered."
\v 27 So Solomon dismissed Abiathar from being priest to Yahweh, that he might fulfill the word of Yahweh, which he had spoken concerning the house of Eli at Shiloh.
