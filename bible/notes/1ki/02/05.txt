\v 5 There is something else \add that I want you to do\add*. You know what Joab did to me. He killed my two army commanders, Abner and Amasa. He murdered them violently \f + \ft metonymy \f* during a time of peace, pretending that it was a time of war. Those two men were innocent\f + \ft Or: had not done what was wrong \f*. But he caused their blood to stain his belt and his sandals.
\v 6 Because you are wise, do to him what you think is best \add for you to do\add*, but do not allow him to become old \f + \ft metonymy \f* and then die [IDI] peacefully.

\v 5 You know also what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two commanders of the armies of Israel, to Abner son of Ner, and to Amasa son of Jether, whom he killed. He shed the blood of war in peace and put the blood of war on the belt around his waist and on the shoes on his feet.
\v 6 Deal with Joab by the wisdom you have learned, but do not let his gray head go down to the grave in peace.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - King David continues to tell Solomon how to lead Israel.

  * **what Joab ... did to me, and what he did** - David is referring to the same thing twice. AT: "what Joab ... did to me—that is, what he did" 
  * **shed the blood of war in peace** - Possible meanings are 1) "killed those men during a time of peace as if he were killing them in war" or 2) "took revenge on those men during a time of peace because they had killed people in war" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **put the blood of war on the belt around his waist and on the shoes on his feet** - Possible meanings are 1) Joab was close enough to these men when he killed them that their blood spattered on his belt and on his sandals or 2) the word "blood" is a metonym for guilt of murder, and the belt and the shoes are metonyms for Joab's authority as commander, so David is saying that because Joab is guilty of murder, he should not be commander of the army. Either way, it is best to translate this literally. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **do not let his gray head go down to the grave in peace** - Here being old is represented by having gray hair, that is, a "gray head." AT: "make sure Joab dies a violent death before he grows old." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
