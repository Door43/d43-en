\v 9 But now you must surely punish him. You are a wise man, so you will know what you should do to him. He is an old man, but be sure that he sheds a lot of blood when he dies ."

\v 8 Look, there is with you Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite of Bahurim, who cursed me with a violent curse on the day I went to Mahanaim. Shimei came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to him by Yahweh, saying, 'I will not put you to death with the sword.'
\v 9 Now therefore do not let him go free from punishment. You are a wise man, and you will know what you ought to do to him. You will bring his gray head down to the grave with blood."
