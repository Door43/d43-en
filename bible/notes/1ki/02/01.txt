\c 2
\p
\v 1 As the day of David's death approached, he commanded Solomon his son, saying,
\v 2 "I am going the way of all the earth. Be strong, therefore, and show yourself a man.
\v 3 Keep the commands of Yahweh your God to walk in his ways, to obey his statutes, his commandments, his decisions, and his covenant decrees, being careful to do what is written in the law of Moses, so you may prosper in all you do, wherever you go,
\v 4 so that Yahweh may fulfill his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, 'If your sons carefully watch their conduct, to walk before me faithfully with all their heart and with all their soul, you will never cease to have a man on the throne of Israel.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I am going the way of all the earth** - This is a polite way of saying "I am going to die." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **show yourself a man** - The ellipsis can be filled in. AT: "show everyone that you are a man" or "live so that everyone can see you are a good man" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]]) 
  * **walk in his ways** - Walking on a path is a metonym for the way a person lives. AT: "live the way he commands" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **prosper** - "succeed" or "do well"
  * **may fulfill his word** - "do everything he promised he would do"
  * **If your sons ... you will never cease** - Yahweh is talking to David, so the words "you" and "your" refer to David.
  * **to walk before me faithfully** - Yahweh is talking to David, so the word "me" refers to Yahweh.
  * **with all their heart and with all their soul** - The idiom "with all ... heart" means "completely" and "with all ... soul" means "with all ... being." These two phrases have similar meanings. AT: "with all their being" or "with all their energy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **you will never cease to have a man on the throne of Israel** - The word "throne" is a metonym for the king who sits on the throne. The litotes "will never cease to have" can be stated positively. AT: "your descendants will never cease to be kings of Israel" or "one of your descendants will always be the king of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
