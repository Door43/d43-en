\p
\v 1 As the day of David's death drew near, he commanded Solomon his son, saying,
\v 2 "I am going the way of all the earth. Be strong, therefore, and show yourself a man.
\v 3 Keep the commands of Yahweh your God to walk in his ways, to obey his statutes, his commandments, his decisions, and his covenant decrees, being careful to do what is written in the law of Moses, so you may prosper in all you do, wherever you go,
\v 4 so that Yahweh may fulfill his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, 'If your sons carefully watch their conduct, to walk before me faithfully with all their heart and with all their soul, you will never cease to have a man on the throne of Israel.'
