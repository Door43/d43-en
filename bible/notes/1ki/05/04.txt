===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Solomon continues to talk with King Hiram about building the Temple.

  * **has given me rest on every side** - Before Solomon became king, King David and the people of Israel had been at war, but now King Solomon and the people were at rest and in a time of peace.
  * **There is neither adversary nor disaster** - neither humans who cause harm nor natural events that cause harm. This can be stated positively. AT: "we are safe from our enemies and from natural disasters" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **adversary** - enemy
  * **disaster** - event that causes harm to people and their property
  * **So** - This is to emphasize the words that follow. "Listen! This is what I am going to do:" or "Because of what Yahweh has done for me, this is what I am going to do:"
  * **for the name of Yahweh ... for my name** - The word "name" is a metonym for the person. You may need to make explicit what people will do in the temple. AT: "where people can worship Yahweh ... where people can worship me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **set on your throne in your place** - Here "throne" refers to ruling as king. AT: "make to be the king after you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
