\v 21 Then a spirit came forward, stood before Yahweh, and said, 'I will entice him.' Yahweh said to him, â€˜How?' 
\v 22 The spirit replied, 'I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.' Yahweh replied, 'You will entice him, and you will also be successful. Go now and do so.'
