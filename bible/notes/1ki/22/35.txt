\v 35 The battle grew worse that day, and the king was held up in his chariot facing the Arameans. He died in the evening. The blood ran out of his wound into the bottom of the chariot.
\v 36 Then about the time the sun was going down, a cry went up throughout the army, saying, "Every man should go back to his city, and every man should go back to his region!"
