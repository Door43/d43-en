  * **are they not written in The Book of the Events of the Kings of Judah?** - This can be expressed in active form and assumes that the answer is positive. The question is rhetorical and is used for emphasis. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:1ki:14:29|14:29]]. AT: "they are written in The Book of the Events of the Kings of Judah." or "you can read them in The Book of the Events of the Kings of Judah."
