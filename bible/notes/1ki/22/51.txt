\v 51 Before King Jehoshaphat died, when he had been ruling in Judah for seventeen years, Ahab's son Ahaziah began to rule in Israel. Ahaziah ruled in Samaria for two years.
\v 52 He did many things that Yahweh said were evil, doing the \add evil\add* things that his father and mother had done and the evil things that Jeroboam had done—the king who had induced all the Israelite people to sin \add by worshiping idols\add*.
\v 53 Ahaziah bowed in front of Baal's idol and worshiped it. That caused Yahweh, the God who was the true God of the Israelite people, to become very angry, just as Ahaziah's father had caused Yahweh to become angry.
