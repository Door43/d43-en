\v 18 So the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but only disaster?"
\v 19 Then Micaiah said, "Therefore hear the word of Yahweh: I saw Yahweh sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven were standing by him on his right hand and on his left.
\v 20 Yahweh said, 'Who will entice Ahab, so that he may go up and fall at Ramoth Gilead?' And one individual answered in this way, and another answered in that way.
