===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Now look** - AT: "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you"
  * **the words of the prophets declare good things with one mouth** - The phrase "with one mouth" means that they all say the same thing. AT: "the prophets all declare the same good things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom|Idiom]])
  * **let your word be like one of them** - Here the word "them" refers to "the words of the prophets." AT: "let what you say agree with what they have said"
  * **should we go**- The word "we" refers to Ahab, Jehoshaphat, and their armies but not to Micaiah. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **will place it into the hand of the king** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:1ki:22:05|v. 6]].
