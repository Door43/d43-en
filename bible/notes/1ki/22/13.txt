\v 13 And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets
declare good to the king with one mouth: let your word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak you
good.
\v 14 And Micaiah said, As Jehovah liveth, what Jehovah says to me, that will I speak.

forbear? And he answered him, Go up and prosper; and Jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king.
