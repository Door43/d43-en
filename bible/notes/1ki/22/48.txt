\v 48 Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber.
\v 49 Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab to Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with your servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.
\v 50 And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; And Jehoram his
son reigned in his stead.
