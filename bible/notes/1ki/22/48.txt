\v 48 Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold, but they did not go because the ships were wrecked at Ezion-geber.
\v 49 Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said  to Jehoshaphat, "Let my servants sail with your servants in the ships." But Jehoshaphat would not allow it.
\v 50 So Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his ancestor. And Jehoram his son reigned in his place.
