\v 48 Jehoshaphat built oceangoing ships; they were to go to Ophir for gold, but they did not go because the ships were wrecked at Ezion Geber.
\v 49 Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, "Let my servants sail with your servants in the ships." But Jehoshaphat would not allow it.
\v 50 Jehoshaphat slept with his ancestors and was buried with them in the city of David, his ancestor; Jehoram, his son, became king in his place.
