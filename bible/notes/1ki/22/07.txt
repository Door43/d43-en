\v 7 But Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there no prophet of Yahweh here whom we can ask?"
\p
\v 8 The king of Israel replied, "There is one man we can talk to, to ask him if he can ask to find out what Yahweh wants. His name is Micaiah; he is the son of Imlah. But I hate him, because when he prophesies\f + \ft Or: tells what God says to him \f* he never says that anything good \add will happen to me\add*. He always predicts that bad things will happen to me."
\p Jehoshaphat replied, "King Ahab, you should not say that!"
\p
\v 9 So the king of Israel told one of his officers to summon Micaiah immediately.

\v 7 But Jehoshaphat said, "Is there not here yet another prophet of Yahweh from whom we might seek advice?"
\v 8 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "There is still one man by whom we may seek advice from Yahweh to help, Micaiah son of Imlah, but I hate him because he does not prophesy anything good about me, but only hardships." But Jehoshaphat said, "May the king not say that."
\v 9 Then the king of Israel called an officer and commanded, "Bring Micaiah son of Imlah, right away."
