\v 33 But King Jeroboam still did not turn away from continuing to do the evil things that he was doing. Instead, he appointed more priests from men \add who were not descended from Levi\add*. Anyone who wanted to be a priest, he appointed to be a priest, in order that he could offer sacrifices on the hills.
\v 34 Because he committed that sin, \add a few years later\add* God got rid of most of Jeroboam's descendants and did not allow them to become kings of Israel.

\v 33 After this Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way, but still made priests of the high places from among all the people. Whoever would serve he consecrated him, that there might be priests of the high places.
\v 34 And this thing became sin to the family of Jeroboam and caused it to be cut off and destroy it from off the face of the earth.
