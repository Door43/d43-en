\v 33 But King Jeroboam still did not turn away from continuing to do the evil things that he was doing. Instead, he appointed more priests from men \add who were not descended from Levi\add*. Anyone who wanted to be a priest, he appointed to be a priest, in order that he could offer sacrifices on the hills.
\v 34 Because he committed that sin, \add a few years later\add* God got rid of most of Jeroboam's descendants and did not allow them to become kings of Israel.

\v 33 After this Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way, but continued to appoint common priests for the high places from among all sorts of people. Any who would serve he consecrated as a priest.
\v 34 This matter became sin to the family of Jeroboam and caused his family to be destroyed and to be exterminated from the face of the earth.
