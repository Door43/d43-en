\v 23 After he had eaten food and after he had drunk, the prophet saddled the man of God's donkey, the man who had come back with him.
\v 24 When the man of God was gone, a lion met him on the road and killed him, and his body was left on the road. Then the donkey stood by it, and the lion also stood by the body.
\v 25 When men passed by and saw the body left on the road, and the lion standing by the body, they came and told it in the city where the old prophet lived.
