\v 11 At that time there was an old man living in Bethel who was a prophet. His sons came and told him what the prophet \add from Judah\add* had done there on that day, and they also told him what the prophet had said to the king.
\v 12 Their father said, "On which road did he go?" So his sons showed him the road on which the prophet from Judah had gone \add when he left Bethel\add*.
\v 13 Then he said to his sons, "Put a saddle on my donkey." So they did that, and he got on the donkey.

\v 11 Now there was an old prophet living in Bethel, and one of his sons came and told him all the things that the man of God had done that day in Bethel. His sons also told him the words that the man of God had spoken to the king.
\v 12 Their father said to them, "Which way did he go?" Now his sons had seen the way the man of God from Judah had gone.
\v 13 So he said to his sons, "Saddle the donkey for me." So they saddled the donkey and he rode off on it.
