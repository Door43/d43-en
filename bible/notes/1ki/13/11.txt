\v 11 Now there lived an old prophet in Beth-el; and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had
done that day in Beth-el: the words which he had spoken to the king, them also they told to their father.
\v 12 And their father said to them, What way went he? Now his sons had seen what way the man of God went, that came from
Judah.
\v 13 And he said to his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass; and he rode thereon.
