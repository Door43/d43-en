\c 13
\p
\v 1 A man of God came out of Judah by the word of Yahweh to Bethel. Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense.
\v 2 The man of God cried against the altar by the word of Yahweh and said, "Altar, altar, Yahweh says, 'See, a son will be born to the family of David, Josiah by name, and on you  he will sacrifice the priests of the shrines who burn incense on you; on you they will burn men's bones.' "
\v 3 Then the man of God gave a sign the same day, saying, "This is the sign that Yahweh has spoken: 'Look, the altar will be split apart, and the ashes on it will be poured out.'"
