\p
\v 1 And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of Jehovah to Beth-el: and Jeroboam was standing by the
altar to burn incense.
\v 2 And he cried against the altar by the word of Jehovah, and said, O altar, altar, thus says Jehovah: Behold, a son shall
be born to the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon you shall he sacrifice the priests of the high places that burn
incense upon thee, and men’s bones shall they burn upon thee.
\v 3 And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which Jehovah has spoken: Behold, the altar shall be rent, and
the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.
