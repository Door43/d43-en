\v 31 Then after he had buried him, the old prophet spoke to his sons, saying, "When I am dead, bury me in the tomb in which the man of God is buried. Lay my bones beside his bones.
\v 32 For what he said when he cried out by the word of Yahweh against the altar in Bethel, and against all the shrines of the high
places which are in the cities of Samaria, will surely come to pass."
