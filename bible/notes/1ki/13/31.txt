\v 31 After they had buried him, the old man said to his sons, "When I die, bury my corpse in the grave where we buried the prophet from Judah. Lay my corpse next to his corpse.
\v 32 And do not forget that what he said, things that Yahweh told him to say about the altar in Bethel, and that what Yahweh told him to say about the shrines on the hills in the towns in Samaria, will surely happen."

\v 31 Then after he had buried him, the old prophet spoke to his sons, saying, "When I am dead, bury me in the tomb in which the man of God is buried. Lay my bones beside his bones.
\v 32 For the message he declared by the word of Yahweh, against the altar in Bethel and against all the houses on the high places in the cities of Samaria, will certainly happen.
