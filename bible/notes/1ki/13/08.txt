\v 8 The man of God said to the king, "Even if you give me half your possessions, I will not go  with you, nor will I eat food or drink water in this place,
\v 9 because Yahweh commanded me by his word saying, 'You will eat no bread nor drink water, nor return by the way that you came.'"
\v 10 So the man of God left another way and did not return to his home by the way that he had come to Bethel.
