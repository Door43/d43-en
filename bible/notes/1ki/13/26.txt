\v 26 When the old man who had brought the prophet from Judah to his home heard about it, he said, "That is the prophet who disobeyed what Yahweh told him to do! That is why Yahweh allowed the lion to attack him and kill him. That is what Yahweh said would happen!"
\p
\v 27 Then he said to his sons, "Put a saddle on my donkey." So they did that.
\v 28 Then he rode on the donkey and found the prophet's corpse on the road, and his donkey and the lion were still standing there alongside the corpse. But the lion had not eaten any of the flesh of the prophet and had not attacked the donkey.

\v 26 When the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard it, he said, "It is the man of God who disobeyed the word of Yahweh. Therefore Yahweh gave him to the lion, which torn him to pieces and killed him, just as the word of Yahweh warned him."
\v 27 So the old prophet spoke to his sons, saying, "Saddle my donkey," and they saddled it.
\v 28 He went and found the body left in the road, and the donkey and the lion standing by the body. The lion had not eaten the body, nor attacked the donkey.
