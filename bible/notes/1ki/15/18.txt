\v 19 "I want there to be a peace treaty between me and you, like there was between my father and your father. For that purpose, I am giving you this silver and gold.

\v 18 Then Asa took all the silver and gold left in the storerooms in the house of Yahweh, and the storerooms of the kingâ€™s palace. He put it into the hands of his servants and sent it to Benhadad, the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Aram, who lived in Damascus. He said,
\v 19 "Let there be a treaty between me and you, as there was between my father and your father. Look, I have sent to you a gift of silver and gold. Break your treaty with Baasha, king of Israel, so that he may leave me alone."
