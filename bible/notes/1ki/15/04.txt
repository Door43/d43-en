\v 4 Nevertheless for David's sake, Yahweh his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem by raising up his son after him in order to strengthen Jerusalem.
\v 5 God did this because David had done what was right in his eyes; for all the days of his life, he had not turned away from anything that he commanded him , except only in the matter of Uriah, the Hittite.
\v 6 Now there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of Abijah's life.
