\v 23 As for the other matters of Asa, all his might, all that he did, and the cities he built, are they not written in The Book of the Events of the Kings of Judah? But during his old age he was diseased in his feet.
\v 24 Then Asa slept with his ancestors and was buried with them in the city of David his father. Jehoshaphat, his son, became king in his place.
