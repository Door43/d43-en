===== translationNotes: =====

  * **are they not written in The Book of the Events of the Kings of Israel?** - This question is used to either inform or remind the readers that the information about Nadab is in this other book. See how you translated a similar phrase concerning Judah in [[:en:bible:notes:1ki:14:29|14:29]]. AT: "they are written in The Book of the Events of the Kings of Israel." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **are they not written in The Book of the Events of the Kings of Israel** - This can be reworded so that there is no passive "are ... written." AT: "you can read them in The Book of the Events of the Kings of Israel." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
