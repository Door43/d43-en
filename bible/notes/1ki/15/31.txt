===== translationNotes: =====

  * **are they not written in the book of the events of the kings of Israel?** - This question is used to either inform or remind the readers that the information about Nadab is in this other book. See how you translated a similar phrase concerning Judah in [[:en:bible:notes:1ki:14:29|14:29]]. This rhetorical question can be written as a statement. AT: "they are written in the book of the events of the kings of Israel." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **are they not written in the book of the events of the kings of Israel?** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "someone has written about this in the book of the events of the kings of Israel." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **all their days** - The word "days" represents a period of time, and "all their days" refers to the whole period of time that Asa and Baasha were kings. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:1ki:15:16|15:16]] AT: "the whole time that they reigned over Judah and Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
