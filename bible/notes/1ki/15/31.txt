===== translationNotes: =====

  * **are they not written in The Book of the Events of the Kings of Israel?** - This can be expressed in active form and assumes that the answer is positive. The question is rhetorical and is used for emphasis. AT: "they are written in The Book of the Events of the Kings of Israel." or "you can read them in The Book of the Events of the Kings of Israel." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
