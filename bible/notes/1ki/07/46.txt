\v 46 The king had cast them in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.
\v 47 Solomon did not weigh all the implements because there were too many to weigh, so the weight of the bronze could not be known.

===== Translation Notes: =====

The author is writing about making bronze items for the temple.

    * **cast** - Here cast means the method used to shape the metal. Melted metal is poured into a hollow container or clay mold having the shape wanted, and when the metal cools it will be the shape of the container. (See how you translated verses 23-24.)
    * **The king had cast them** - It is implicit that the king did not do the work, but that his workers did it. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]].)
    * **plain of the Jordan,** - This refers to the flat land near the Jordan River.
    * ** in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.** - Succoth and Zarethan were cities in the Jordan River Valley, north of Jerusalem. We do not know their exact location today. This is where Huram made clay molds for items to be cast of bronze. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
    * **Solomon did not weigh all the implements** - It is implicit that the King himself would not do the weighing, but also that his workers did not weigh the items. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]].)
    * **implements** - tools or the bronze items that Huram made
    * **so the weight of the bronze could not be known** - (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) AT: "so no one knows the weight of the bronze objects."
