===== Translation Notes: =====

The author continues to describe the bronze carts that Huram made.

    * **There were four handles at the four corners of each stand** - AT: Each stand/cart had four handles. There was one handle at each top corner.
    * **stand** - stand - Some translations note that the stands were movable and had wheels, so you can also refer to the stands as carts. (See how you translated stand in 1Ki 7:27 and 7:32)
    * **forged** - metal is heated and then hammered into the shape wanted
    * **cubit** - (See: [[:en:obe:other:biblicaldistance]])
    * **on the top of the stand its supports and panels were attached** - "its" is a possessive pronoun and refers to the supports and panels of the stand/cart.  AT: "the supports and panels of each stand/cart were attached to the top of each stand/cart."
