===== Translation Notes: =====
The author continues to describe the bronze stands that Huram made.
 
    * **axle** - a shaft, pole or spindle that holds the wheels of a vehicle
    * **their housings** - "their" is a possessive pronoun that refers to housings of the axles
    * **housings** - coverings that protect the axles and moving parts 
    * **stand** - Some translations note that the stands were movable and had wheels, so you can also refer to the stands as carts. (See how you translated stand in 1Ki 7:27)   
    * **cubit** - (See: [[:en:obe:other:biblicaldistance]])
    * **the wheels were forged** - Huram (and his helpers) made the wheels (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
    * **forged** - metal is heated and then hammered into the shape wanted
    * **The wheels were forged like chariot wheels.** - The wheels of the stand resembled the wheels of a chariot. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]]) 
   * **their housings, rims, spokes, and hubs** - Here "their" is a possessive pronoun that refers to the housings, rims, spokes and hubs of the wheels.
   * **cast** - Cast means the method used to shape the metal. Melted metal is poured into a hollow container or clay mold having the shape wanted, and when the metal cools it will be the shape of the container.
