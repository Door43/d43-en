===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **four bronze wheels and axles** - There was one axle for each pair of wheels. AT: "four bronze wheels and two axles" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]]) 
  * **its four corners** - "the four corners of each stand"
  * **The supports were cast with wreaths** - Each support was cast as one piece with the wreaths. AT: "Huram cast the supports with spiral-shaped pieces" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **a crown that rose up** - Here the word "crown" refers to the circular piece at the top of the stand's opening that held the basin.
  * **their panels were square** - "the panels of the stands." This phrase returns to the description of the panels that began in [[en:bible:notes:1ki:07:27|7:28-29]].
