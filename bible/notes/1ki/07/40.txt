===== Translation Notes: =====

This begins a summary of bronze items that Huram made for the temple.

    * **Huram made the basins and the shovels and the sprinkling bowls.** - In the previous verses, we read that Huram already finished the basins for the stands, so in this verse, basins would be better translated as "pots" (see verse 45). In addition to the basins, he also made pots. (See AT below.)
    * **shovels** - Priests used the shovels to remove and carry ashes of the burned sacrifices. 
    * **sprinkling bowls** - These bowls held the blood of sacrificed animals. The blood from the bowls was then sprinkled on the altar or elsewhere as part of a ceremony.
    * **Huram made the basins and the shovels and the sprinkling bowls.** - AT: "Huram also made pots, shovels for carrying ashes, and sprinkling bowls."
    * **he finished all the work that he did** - He refers to Huram.
    * **:** - Here the colon indicates that a list or a brief description of all the work Huram did, will follow. 
    * **the two pillars, and the bowl like capitals that were on top of the two pillars, and the two sets of decorative latticework to cover the two bowl like capitals that were on top of the pillars.** (See how you translated verses 15-22). Since the list will continue in the next verses, you can leave out the word and, and separate the items with commas. You can also simplify the list and not include as many details, since the details were discussed in previous verses. AT: "the two pillars, the bowl like capitals, two sets of decorative latticework for the capitals,"
    * **the bowl like capitals** - The capitals are compared to the shape of a bowl. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
    * **capital** - the decoration on top of the column or pillar (verse 19)
