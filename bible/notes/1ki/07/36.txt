===== Translation Notes: =====

The author continues to describe the bronze carts that Huram made.

    * **On the surfaces of the supports and on the panels Huram engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, that covered the space available** - AT: Huram decorated the panels and the tops of the supports with engravings of cherubim, lions, and palm trees wherever there was available space. He surrounded the engravings with decorations of bronze wreaths.
    * **He made the ten stands in this manner.** - The pronoun He refers to Huram. Huram finished making the stands, and the previous descriptions tell how he made them. 
    * **stand** - Some translations note that the stands were movable and had wheels, so you can also refer to the stands as carts. (See how you translated stand in 1Ki 7:27, 32 and 34)
    * **All of them were cast in the same molds, and they had one size, and the same shape.**  - AT: All ten stands were the same.
