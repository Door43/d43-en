===== Important Terms: =====

===== Translation Notes: =====

The writer is describing the "sea", a large tank that Huram made.

  * **stood on**  - "was on top of"
  * **twelve oxen**  - The oxen were not real animals. Huram made the oxen of bronze. The previous verses describe things Huram made of bronze, and the descriptions continue here. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Explicit and Implicit]]) AT: "twelve bronze statues of oxen" (UDB)
  * **The sea was set on top of them**  - The word "them" refers to the bronze oxen.
  * **The sea was set on top of them**  - The fact that the sea was set or put on top of something tells us that someone put it there. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Explicit and Implicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]]) AT: Huram's "helpers put the bronze tank on the backs of the statues of the oxen." (UDB)
  * **as thick as**  - (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
  * **brim**  - top edge of a vessel or container
  * **forge/forged**  - This means that metal is heated in a fire or a furnace and while it is still hot and soft, someone hammers or beats it into the desired shape.
  * **its brim was forged like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom**  - The brim of the sea is compared to the brim of a cup or to the shape of a lily blossom. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
  * **like a lily blossom**  - AT: "It curved outward like the petals of a lily." (UDB)
  * **bath**  - (See: [[:en:obe:other:biblicalvolume|biblical volume]])
