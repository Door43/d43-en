===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **brought him from Tyre** - Huram accepted Solomon's invitation to come to Jerusalem. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the son of a widow...his father was a man of Tyre** - A widow is a woman whose husband has died, so we know that the father is dead. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) 
  * **Huram was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill** - The words "wisdom and understanding" mean basically the same thing and speak of Huram's knowledge of how to do his trade."God filled Huram with wisdom, understanding, and skill" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
