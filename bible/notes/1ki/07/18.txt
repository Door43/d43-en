===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **two rows of pomegranates** - A "pomegranate" is a fruit with a hard, red rind and many juicy seeds inside. Huram did not use real pomegranates to decorate the pillars. He made them out of bronze.
  * **The capitals...were decorated with lilies, four cubits high** - Lilies are funnel-shaped flowers. AT: "Huram decorated the capitals with bronze lilies, four cubits high..." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the tops of the portico** - See how you translated "portico" in [[en:bible:notes:1ki:07:06|7:6]].
