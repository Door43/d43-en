===== Translation Notes: =====

The author continues to write about bronze items that Huram made for the temple.

    * **pomegranate** - a fruit with a hard rind and many juicy seeds inside. The children of Israel missed eating this fruit when they were in the wilderness after leaving Egypt, (Numbers 20:5) and looked forward to eating it again in the place where they were going (Deut 8:8). It was likely a symbol of prosperity. In this verse, it is a bronze decoration that looks like a pomegranate.
    * **capital** - In this verse, capital refers to a decoration on top of the column or pillar.
    * **lily/lilies** - a trumpet-shaped flower.  In this verse lilies are bronze decorations that looks like this flower.
    * **portico** - a covered structure or porch, supported by pillars and attached to the front entrance of a building [also used in 1 Kings 7:6 and 7:12]
