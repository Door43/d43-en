===== Translation Notes: =====

The author writes about the 2 pillars, named Jakin and Boaz.

  * **capital**  - In this verse, capital refers to a decoration on top of the column or pillar.
  * **two hundred**  - or 200. Decide how you want to translate numbers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers|Translate Numbers]])
  * **pomegranate**  - see 7:18
  * **He raised up the pillars**  - "He" refers to Huram and his workers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive|Inclusive]])
  * **He raised up the pillars at the temple portico.**  - The workers lifted the pillars and stood them up. It is implicit that the pillars were cast or made on the ground and then Huram and his workers lifted the pillars and stood them up in front of the temple portico. (See [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Explicit and Implicit]])
  * **portico**  - see 6:3
  * **The pillar on the right hand was named Jakin, and the pillar on the left hand was named Boaz.**  - There is a lot of discussion about the names of the pillars. It is suggested that priests were annointed at the Jakin pillar and kings were annointed at the Boaz pillar (2Kings 11:14). Since the temple entrance faced east, Jakin, the pillar on the right hand, was on the south side, and Boaz, the pillar on the left hand, was on the north side.
  * **Jakin**  - The name Jakin, also spelled Jachin, means God establishes.
  * **Boaz**  - Boaz was the great-great-grandfather of Solomon.
  * **On the top of the pillars were decorations like lilies.**  - AT: "These tops were placed on a bowl shaped section" (UDB).
  * **lily/lilies**  - a trumpet-shaped flower. In this verse lilies are bronze decorations that look like this flower. They were likely bowl or globe shaped, one on top of each pillar, as the Hebrew terms gullot (plural) and gullah (singular) indicate [1 Kings 7:41 and Zech 4:2].
