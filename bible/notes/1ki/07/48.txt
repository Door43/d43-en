===== Translation Notes: =====

The author begins to list items for the temple that were made of gold.

    * **Solomon made** - Solomon directed the work, but because he was a King, we can assume that others did the actual work. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) Also see how you handled this in 1Ki 7:01.
    * **Solomon made** - The author finished talking about the items made of bronze and begins listing the furnishings made of gold.  Adding the word "also" can help the reader make the transition from talking about bronze items to talking about gold items. AT: "Solomon's workers also made" (UDB)
    * **out of gold:** - Here the colon (:) indicates that a list of things made of gold will begin.
    * **furnishings** - furniture, equipment, decorations and items used in the temple
    * **on which the bread of the presence was to be placed.** AT: "on which the priests were to put the bread of the presence." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
    * **bread of the presence** - this was specially made bread that priests put on the golden table in front of the place where they worshiped God.  This was not food for God, but is a metaphor for God's presence and provision. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **was to be placed. The** - Instead of placing a period (.) here to end the sentence, a semicolon (;) could be used to continue the list. AT: "was to be placed; the"
    * **verse 49** - AT: "the pure gold lampstands, five on the right side and five on the left, in front of the most holy place; the gold floral work, lamps and tongs;"  Since the list will continue in the next verses, a semicolon is used at the end of this verse.
    * **the flowers** - This refers to the parts and decorations of the lamps and lampstands that looked like flowers.
    * **tongs** - a tool, like pincers, used to pick up and hold things.  In the temple, tongs were used to pick up and hold hot coals.
