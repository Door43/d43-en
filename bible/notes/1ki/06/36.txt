===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He built the inner court** - It might be best to translate so that the reader understands that other people helped Solomon do this. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **cedar beams** - A beam is a long heavy piece of wood used to support a building. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:1ki:06:05|6:6]].
