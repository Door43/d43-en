\v 5 Against the two sides and the back of the temple walls, they built a structure that had rooms in it. This structure had three levels; each level was about 2.3 meters high.
\v 6 Each room in the lowest level was about 2.3 meters high. Each room in the middle level  was about 2.8 meters wide. The rooms in the top level  were about 3.2 meters wide. The wall of the temple at the top level was thinner than the wall at the middle level, and the wall of the middle level was thinner than the wall at the bottom level. In this way, the rooms could rest on the wall underneath them; the rooms did not need wooden beams underneath to support them.

\v 5 Against the walls of the main chamber he built rooms around it, around both the outer room and the inner sanctuary. He built rooms all around the sides.
\v 6 The lowest story was five cubits wide, the middle was six cubits wide, and the third was seven cubits wide. For on the outside he made offsets in the wall of the house all around so that the beams would not be inserted in the walls of the house.
