\v 5 But Jezebel his wife came to him and said to him, "Why is your spirit so sad, that you eat no food?"
\v 6 He replied to her, "Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said to him, 'Give me your vineyard for money, or if it pleases you, I will give you another vineyard for yours.' Then he answered me, 'I will not give you my vineyard.' "
\v 7 So Jezebel his wife replied to him, "Do you still rule the kingdom of Israel? Get up and eat and let your heart be happy. I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite."
