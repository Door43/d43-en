\v 21 So this is what Yahweh says to you: 'I will soon get rid of you. I will kill you, and I will also kill every male in your household, including those who are slaves and those who are not slaves.
\v 22 Your family will all be killed, just like the family of King Jeroboam and like the family of King Baasha were killed. I will get rid of you because you have caused me to become very angry, and you have also induced the Israelite people to sin.'

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Look** - AT: "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you"
  * **completely consume and cut off from you** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize the complete destruction of Ahab's family. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **I will make your family like the family of Jeroboam...and like the family of Baasha** - Yahweh will destroy Ahab's family like he destroyed the families of Jeroboam and Baasha.
