\v 11 So the men of his city, the elders and the wealthy who live in his city, did as Jezebel had described to them, as was written in the letters that she had sent to them.
\v 12 They proclaimed a fast and seated Naboth above the people.
\v 13 The two dishonest men came in and sat before Naboth; they testified against Naboth in the presence of the people, saying, "Naboth cursed God and the king." Then they carried him out of the city and stoned him to death.
\v 14 Then the elders sent word to Jezebel, saying, "Naboth has been stoned and is dead."
