== Battle ==
God had chosen to defeat Ben Hadad, king of Aram. So when he attacked Sameria with a huge army, the tiny army of Israel defeated him. The people of Aram said that Yahweh was the god of the hills but they could defeat Israel on the planes. So they came again but Israel defeated them again. Then Ben Hadad offered a peace plan and Ahab accepted. But God had wanted him to kill Ben Hadad and was angry at Ahab for making peace with him.
