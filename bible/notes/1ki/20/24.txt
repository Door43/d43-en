\v 24 So you must do this: Remove all the kings from their positions of authority and replace them with military commanders.
\v 25 Raise up an army like the army you lost—horse for horse and chariot for chariot—so we can fight them in the plain. Then surely we will be stronger than they are." So Ben Hadad listened to their advice and did what they advised.
