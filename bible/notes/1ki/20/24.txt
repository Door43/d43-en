\v 24 And do this too. Take the kings away, every one out of his command, and put army captains in their place.
\v 25 Muster an army like the army you have lost, horse for horse and chariot for chariot, and we will fight against them in the plain. Then surely we will be stronger than they. So Benhadad listened to their voice, and did as they recommended.
