\v 24 So, this is what you should do: You must remove the 32 kings \add who are leading your troops\add* and replace them with army commanders.

\v 24 And do this, too: take the kings away, every one out of his command, and put army captains in their place.
\v 25 Muster an army like the army you lost, horse for horse and chariot for chariot, and we will fight against them in the plain. Then surely we will be stronger than they are." So Benhadad listened to their advice and did as they recommended.
