\v 11 The king of Israel answered and said, "Tell Ben Hadad, 'No one who is just putting on his armor, should boast as if he were taking it off.'"
\v 12 Ben Hadad heard this message as he was drinking, he and the kings under him who were in their tents. Ben Hadad commanded his men, "Line yourselves up in position for battle." So they prepared themselves in position of battle to attack the city.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Tell Ben Hadad, 'No one who is just putting on his armor ... as if he were taking it off.'** - This is an expression to give advice. "Putting on armor" is metonymy for getting prepared for battle. "Tell Ben Hadad, 'Do not boast as if you have already won a battle that you have not yet fought.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_proverbs]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
