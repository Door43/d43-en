\v 29 And they encamped one over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined;
and the children of Israel killed of the Syrians a hundred thousand footmen in one day.
\v 30 But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and the wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand men that were left. And
Ben-hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.
