\v 39 As the king passed by, he cried to the king and said, "Your servant went out into the heat of the battle, and a soldier stopped and brought an enemy to me and said, 'Watch this man. If by any means he comes up missing, then your life will be given for his life, or else you will pay a talent of silver.'
\v 40 But because your servant was busy going here and there, the enemy soldier escaped." Then the king of Israel said to him, "So your judgment will be what you yourself have decided."
