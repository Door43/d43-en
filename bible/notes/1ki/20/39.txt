\v 39 As the king passed by, the prophet cried out to the king and said, "Your servant went out into the heat of the battle, and a soldier stopped and brought an enemy to me and said, 'Watch this man. If by any means he goes missing, then your life will be given for his life, or else you will pay a talent of silver.'
