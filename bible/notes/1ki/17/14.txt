<usfm>
\v 14 \add I know that you will be able to do that\add*, because Yahweh, the God whom we Israelites \add worship\add*, says this: 'There will always be plenty of flour and \add olive\add* oil left in your containers, until the time when I send rain again \add and the crops grow again\add*!'~"
\p
\v 15 So the woman did exactly what Elijah told her to do. And she and her son and Elijah had enough food every day,
\v 16 because the flour in the jar was never finished, and the jug of oil was never empty. That happened just like Yahweh had told Elijah that it would happen.

\v 14 For Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, 'The jar of meal will not empty, neither will the jug of oil stop flowing, until the day that Yahweh sends rain on the earth."
\v 15 So she did as Elijah had told her, and she, Elijah, and her boy ate many days.
\v 16 The jar of meal did not empty, neither did the jug of oil stop flowing, just as the word of Yahweh had said, as he had spoken by Elijah.
