===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Yahweh listened to the voice of Elijah** - AT: "Yahweh answered Elijah's prayer" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the life of the child returned to him again, and he revived** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **See, your son is alive** - The word "See" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.
  * **the word of Yahweh in your mouth is true** - AT: "the message that you spoke from Yahweh is true" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
