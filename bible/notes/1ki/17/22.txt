===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Yahweh listened to the voice of Elijah** - Here "voice" represents what Elijah prayed. AT: "Yahweh answered Elijah's prayer" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the life of the child returned to him, and he revived** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. AT: "the child came back to life" or "the child lived again" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **his room** - Here "his" refers to Elijah.
  * **See, your son is alive** - The word "See" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.
  * **the word of Yahweh in your mouth is true** - Here "word" represents a message. Also, "mouth" represents what Elijah said. AT: "the message that you spoke from Yahweh is true" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
