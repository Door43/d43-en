\v 9 but you have done evil above all who were before you and you have made other gods, and you have cast metal images to provoke me to anger, and have thrust me behind your back.
\v 10 Therefore, look, I will bring disaster upon the family of Jeroboam and will cut off from Jeroboam every male child in Israel, whether slave or free, and will completely remove the family of Jeroboam as a man burns up dung until it is all gone.
