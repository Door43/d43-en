===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For they also built** - The word "they" here refers to the people of Judah.
  * **built for themselves** - The words "for themselves" are a metonym for what they will do with the high places. AT: "built for their own use" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_rpronouns]])
  * **on every high hill and under every green tree** - This is likely to be an exaggeration that indicates there were many places like these for false worship all over the country. AT: "on the high hills and under the green trees" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **cultic prostitutes** - "religious prostitutes" or "male prostitutes." This probably refers to male prostitutes who were associated with idol worship.
  * **the same despicable practices as the nations that** - Here the word "nations" represents the people in those nations. AT: "the same disgusting things that the people did, whom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
