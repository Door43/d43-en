\v 4 And Jeroboam’s wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see; for
his eyes were set by reason of his age.
\v 5 And Jehovah said to Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam comes to inquire of you concerning her son; for he is sick:
thus and thus shall you say to her; for it will be, when she comes in, that she will feign herself to be another woman.
