\v 4 Jeroboam’s wife did so, and left and went to Shiloh and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see, for his eyes did not work properly because of his age.
\v 5 Yahweh said to Ahijah, "Look, the wife of Jeroboam is coming to inquire from  you regarding her son, for he is sick. Say this and that to her because when she comes she will act like she is some other woman."
