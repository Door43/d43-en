<usfm>
\v 11 Anyone who belongs to your family who dies in the city will be eaten by dogs, and anyone who dies in the field will be eaten by the birds of the heavens, for I, Yahweh, have said it.'
\v 12 So arise, wife of Jeroboam, and go back to your home; when your feet enter the city, the child Abijah will die.
\v 13 All Israel will mourn for him and bury him. He is the only one from Jeroboam's family who will go into a grave, because only in him, out of Jeroboam's house, was anything good found in the sight of Yahweh the God of Israel.
