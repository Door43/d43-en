=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

The queen was angry that Elijah had killed her prophets of Baal. She promised to kill Elijah. Elijah fled south into the desert south of Judah. He traveled on to Mount Horeb also known as Mount Sinai, the mountain of God. God asked him why he was there. He said because Israel had deserted God, killed his prophets and wanted to kill him. God sent him home to make Hazael the king of Aram, Jehu the king of Israel and Elisha as the prophet in his place. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:obe:kt:promise]])
