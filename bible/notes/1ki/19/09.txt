\v 9 And he came there to a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of Jehovah came to him, and he said to him,
What do you here, Elijah?
\v 10 And he said, I have been very jealous for Jehovah, the God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets with the sword: and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.
