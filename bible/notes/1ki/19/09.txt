\v 9 He went into a cave there and slept there that night.

\p \add The next morning\add*, Yahweh said to him "Elijah, why are you here?"
\v 10 Elijah replied, "I have zealously served you, Yahweh, God Almighty. But the Israelite people have rejected the agreement that they made with you.

\v 9 He went to a cave there and stayed in it. Then the word of Yahweh came to him and said to him, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"
\v 10 Elijah replied, "I have been very zealous for Yahweh, God of hosts, for the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant, destroyed your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. Now I, only I, am left and they are also trying to take my life."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **to a cave there** - Here the word "there" refers to Mount Horeb. A cave is an opening in a mountainside that leads to a natural room or rooms underground.
  * **the word of Yahweh came to him and said to him** - This idiom means Yahweh spoke and "word" is a synecdoche representing the message. "Yahweh spoke his word and said to him." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:1ki:06:11|6:11]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **What are you doing here, Elijah?** - Yahweh asks this question to rebuke Elijah and to remind him of his duty. AT: "This is not where you should be, Elijah." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **I, only I, am left** - Here the word "I" is repeated for emphasis.
