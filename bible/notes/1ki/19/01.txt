\v 1 Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.
\v 2 Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, "So may the gods do to me, and more also, if I do not make your life like the life of one of those dead prophets by tomorrow about this time."
\v 3 When Elijah heard that, he arose and fled for his life and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his
