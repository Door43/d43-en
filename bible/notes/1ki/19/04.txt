\v 4 But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a broom tree. He requested for himself that he might die, and said, "It is enough, now, Yahweh; take away my life, for I am no better than my dead  ancestors."
\v 5 So he lay down and slept under a broom tree; unexpectedly an angel touched him and said to him, "Get up and eat."
\v 6 Elijah looked, and near his head was bread that had been baked on coals and a jug of water. So he ate and drank and then lay down again.
