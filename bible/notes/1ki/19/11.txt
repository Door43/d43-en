\v 11 Yahweh replied, "Go out and stand on the mountain before me." Then Yahweh passed by, and a very strong wind struck the mountains and broke rocks into pieces before Yahweh,  but Yahweh was not in the wind. Then after the wind, an earthquake came, but Yahweh was not in the earthquake.
\v 12 Then after the earthquake a fire came, but Yahweh was not in the fire. Then after the fire, a still small voice came.
