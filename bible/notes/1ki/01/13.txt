\v 13 Go right away to King David. Say to him, 'Your Majesty, you solemnly promised me that my son Solomon would become the king after you die and that he would sit on your throne and rule. So why are people saying that Adonijah is now king?'
\v 14 Then, Bathsheba, while you are still talking to the king, I will come in and tell him that what you are saying to him about Adonijah is true."

\v 13 Go to King David; say to him, 'My master the king, did you not swear to your servant, saying, "Surely Solomon your son will reign after me, and he will sit on my throne?" Why then is Adonijah reigning?'
\v 14 While you are there speaking with the king, I will come in after you and confirm your words."

===== Translation Notes: =====

The prophet Nathan continues to speak to Bathsheba.

  * **did you not swear to your servant** - The purpose of this question was to remind David of what he had promised Bathsheba. AT: "you swore to your servant" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
