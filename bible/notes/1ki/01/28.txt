\v 28 Then king David answered and said, Call to me Bath-sheba. And she came into the king’s presence, and stood before the
king.
\v 29 And the king sware, and said, As Jehovah liveth, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,
\v 30 verily as I sware to you by Jehovah, the God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he
shall sit upon my throne in my stead; verily so will I do this day.
\v 31 Then Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did obeisance to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live
for ever.
