King David makes a promise to Bathsheba.

  * **came into the king's presence**  - AT: "came before the king" or "came back to the king"
  * **made an oath**  - "made a solemn promise"
  * **May my master King David live forever!**  - Bathsheba knew David would not live forever; this is a way of saying that he is a good king. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]].)
