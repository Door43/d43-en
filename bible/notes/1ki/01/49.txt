===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Adonijah becomes terrified of King Solomon.

  * **They stood up** - Another possible meaning is "They began to act quickly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Adonijah ... rose up and** - Another possible meaning is "Adonijah ... quickly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Adonijah ... took hold of the horns of the altar** - The "horns of the altar" symbolized the strength and protection of Yahweh, but because Adonijah literally went into the area of the physical tent to take literal hold of the physical horns, you should translate this literally.
  * **is afraid of King Solomon** - The servants speak to King Solomon as if they were speaking of someone else to show that they respected King Solomon. AT: "is afraid of you, King Solomon" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]])
  * **he will not kill his servant** - Adonijah speaks of himself as if he were speaking of another person so people will think that he respects King Solomon. AT: "he will not kill me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]])
