\v 46 \add It is true that\add* everyone sins \f + \ft litotes \f*. So, if your people sin against you, and you become angry with them, you may allow their enemies to defeat them and capture them and take them away to their enemies' country, even to countries that are far away.
\v 47 If that happens, while they are in those countries to which they were forced to go, if they sincerely repent and plead with you there saying 'We have sinned and have done things that are very wicked \f + \ft doublet \f*,'

<usfm>
\v 46 It is true that everyone sins. So, suppose that your people sin against you and that you become angry with them. You might allow their enemies to defeat them, capture them, and take them away to their own countries, even to countries that are far away.
\v 47 And suppose that, while your people are in those countries to which they had to go, they sincerely repent and plead with you there saying, 'We have sinned and have done things that are very wicked.'

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 46 Suppose that they sin against you, since there is no one who does not sin, and suppose that you are angry with them and deliver them to the enemy, so that the enemy takes them away captive to their land, whether distant or near.
\v 47 Then suppose that they realize they are in the land where they have been exiled, and suppose that they repent and seek favor from you from the land of their captors. Suppose that they say, 'We have acted perversely and sinned. We have behaved wickedly.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Suppose that they sin ... suppose that you are ... suppose that they realize ... suppose that they repent ... Suppose that they say** - When Solomon was speaking, these hypothetical situations had not happened, but Solomon knew that they might happen in the future. Use the form in your language for talking about events that have not happened but might happen in the future. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **where they have been exiled** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "where their enemies have taken them as exiles" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **captors** - people who keep others as prisoners
  * **We have acted perversely and sinned. We have behaved wickedly** - These two sentences mean the same thing. Together they emphasize how bad the people's actions were. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **acted perversely and sinned** - The words mean basically the same thing and emphasize how badly the people sinned. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
