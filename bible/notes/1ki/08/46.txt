\v 47 If that happens, while they are in those countries to which they were forced to go, if they sincerely repent and plead with you there saying 'We have sinned and have done things that are very wicked \f + \ft doublet \f*,'

\v 46 Suppose that they sin against you—since  there is no one who does not sin, and suppose that you are angry with them and deliver them to the enemy, so that the enemy carries them away captive to their land, whether distant or near.
\v 47 Then suppose that they realize they are in the land where they have been exiled, and suppose that they turn back and make a request of you from the land of their captivity. Suppose that they say, 'We have acted perversely and sinned. We have behaved wickedly.'
