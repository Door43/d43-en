===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 35 Or suppose that you do not allow any rain to fall because your people have sinned against you. Suppose that they turn their faces toward this place and admit that you have justly punished them. Suppose also that they turn away from their sinful behavior and humbly pray to you.
\v 36 In that case, listen to them in heaven and forgive your Israelite people for the sins that they have committed. Teach them the right way to conduct their lives, and then send rain on this land that you have given to your people to belong to them permanently.
\pi

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 35 When the skies are shut up and there is no rain because the people have sinned against you—if they pray toward this place, confess your name, and turn from their sin when you have afflicted them—
\v 36 then listen in heaven and forgive the sin of your servants and of your people Israel, when you teach them the good way in which they should walk. Send rain on your land, which you have given to your people as an inheritance.
