\v 51 They are your people whom you have chosen, whom you rescued out of Egypt as if from the middle of a furnace where iron is forged.
\v 52 I pray that your eyes may be open to the request of your servant and to the requests of your people Israel, to listen to them whenever they cry to you.
\v 53 For you separated them from among all the peoples of the earth to belong to you and receive your promises, just as you explained by Moses your servant, when you brought our fathers out of Egypt, Lord Yahweh."
