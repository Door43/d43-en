\v 54 So it was that when Solomon had finished praying all this prayer and request to Yahweh, he arose from before the altar of Yahweh, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread out toward the heavens.
\v 55 He stood and blessed all the assembly of Israel in a loud voice, saying,
\v 56 "May Yahweh be praised, who has given rest to his people Israel, keeping all his promises. Not one word has failed, out of all Yahweh's good promises, that he made with Moses his servant.
