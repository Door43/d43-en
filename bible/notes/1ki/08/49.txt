  * **their prayer, their requests** - The two words “prayer” and “requests” mean basically the same thing and are used together for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **and all their sins with which they have transgressed against your commands** - This part of the sentence says basically the same thing as the first part in order to emphasize it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
