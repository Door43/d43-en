  * **their prayer and their request** - The two words "prayer" and "request" mean basically the same thing. Together they emphasize that the people were sincere as they made their request to Yahweh. See how you translated similar words in [[:en:bible:notes:1ki:08:27|8:28]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Forgive your people who have sinned against you, and all their transgressions that they have committed against you** - Solomon twice requests Yahweh to forgive the people. This emphasizes the earnestness of his request. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
