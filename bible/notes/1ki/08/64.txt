\v 64 The same day the king hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of Yahweh; for there he offered the burnt-offering, and the grain offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar that was before Yahweh was too little to receive the burnt-offering, and the grain offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings.
