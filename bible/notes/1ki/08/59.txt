<usfm>
\v 59 I pray that Yahweh our God will never forget these words that I have prayed, pleading for his help; I pray that he will think about them by day and by night. I pray that he will always act mercifully toward us Israelite people and toward our king, giving us the things that we need day by day.
\v 60 If you do that, all the people-groups in the world will know that you, Yahweh, are the only one who is God, and that there is no other one who is God.
\v 61 I pray that you, \add his people\add*, will always be fully committed\f + \ft Or: dedicated \f* to Yahweh, and that you will obey all his statutes and commands, like you are doing now."

\v 59 And let these words I have spoken, by which I have made request before Yahweh, be near  Yahweh our God day and night, so that he may help the cause of his servant and the cause of his people Israel, as every day will require;
\v 60 that all the peoples of the earth may know that Yahweh, he is God, and there is no other God!
\v 61 Therefore let your heart be true to Yahweh our God, to walk in his statutes and keep his commandments, as on this day."
