<usfm>
\v 27 But God, will you really live on the earth among people?\f + \ft Or: you cannot really live on the earth. \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* There is surely not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* enough space for you in the sky, or even in the heaven. So there is surely not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* enough space for you to live in this temple that my workers have built.
\v 28 But Yahweh, my God, please listen to me while I am praying to you this day,

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 27 But God, will you really live on the earth among people? There is not enough space in heaven for you to have enough space to live there. So this temple that I have commanded my workers to build is certainly too small for you to live in.
\v 28 But Yahweh, my God, please listen to me while I am praying to you this day.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 27 But will God actually live on the earth? Look, the entire universe and heaven itself cannot contain you—how much less can this temple that I have built!
\v 28 Yet please respect this prayer of your servant and his request, Yahweh my God; listen to the cry and prayer that your servant prays before you today.
</usfm>

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But will God actually live on the earth?** - AT: "But surely, it cannot be that God will actually live on the earth!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **this prayer of your servant and his request** - The words "prayer" and "request" mean basically the same thing and emphasize the earnestness of his prayer. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]]) 
  * **respect this prayer of your servant ... listen to the cry and prayer that your servant prays** - The first and last parts of this sentence say the same thing. Both parts intensify Solomon's request. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
