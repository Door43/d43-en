\v 27 But God, will you really live on the earth among people? There is not enough space in heaven for you to have enough space to live there. So this temple that I have commanded my workers to build is certainly too small for you to live in.
\v 28 But Yahweh, my God, please listen to me while I am praying to you this day,

\v 27 But will God actually dwell on the earth? Look, the entire universe and heaven itself cannot contain you, how much less can this temple that I have built!
\v 28 Yet please respect this prayer of your servant, and his request, Yahweh my God, to listen to the cry and to the prayer which your servant prays before you this day,
</usfm>
