\v 41-42 There will be some foreigners who do not belong to your Israelite people who will have come here from countries far away because they have heard that you are very great, and because they have heard about the great things that you have done for your people. Suppose that people like that come here to this temple to worship you  and pray.
\v 43 In that case, in your home in heaven listen to their prayer, and do for them what they request you to do. Do that in order that all the people groups in the world will know about you and revere you, as we your Israelite people do. Then they will know that this temple that I have caused to be built to honor you belongs to you and is where you should be worshiped.

\v 41 In addition, concerning the foreigner who does not belong to your people Israel: when he comes from a distant country because of your name—
\v 42 for they will hear of your great name, your mighty hand, and your raised arm—when he comes and prays toward this temple,
\v 43 then please listen from heaven, the place where you live, and do whatever the foreigner asks of you. Do this so that all the people groups on earth may know your name and fear you, as do your own people Israel.  Do this so they might know that this house I have built is called by your name.
