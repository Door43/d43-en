\v 41 In addition, concerning the foreigner who does not belong to your people Israel: when he comes from a distant country because of your name—
\v 42 for they will hear of your great name, your mighty hand, and your raised arm—when he comes and prays toward this temple,
\v 43 then please listen from heaven, the place where you live, and do whatever the foreigner asks of you. Do this so that all the people groups on earth may know your name and fear you, as do your own people Israel.  Do this so they might know that this house I have built is called by your name.
