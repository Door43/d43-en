\p
\v 41 In addition, concerning the foreigner who does not belong to your people Israel: when he comes from a distant country because of your name—
\v 42 for they will hear of your great name, your mighty hand, and your outstretched arm—when he comes and prays toward this temple,
\v 43 then please listen from heaven, your dwelling place, and act according to all for which the foreigner calls on you. Do this so that all the peoples on earth might know your name, so that they might fear you, as do your people Israel.  Do this so they might know that this house that Ihave built is called by your name.
