\v 6 The priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to its place, into the inner room of the temple, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.
\v 7 For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the poles by which it was carried.
\v 8 The poles were so long that their ends were seen from the holy place in front of the most holy place, but they could not be seen from outside. They are there to this day.
