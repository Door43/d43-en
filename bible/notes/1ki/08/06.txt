\v 6 The priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to its place, into the inner room of the house, to the most holy place, under the wings of the cherubim.
\v 7 For the cherubim spread out their wings to the place of the ark, and they covered the ark and the poles by which it was carried.
\v 8 The poles were so long that their ends were seen from the holy place in front of the most holy place, but they could not be seen from outside. They are there to this day.
