===== translationNotes: =====

  * **all Israel with him** - This generalization may refer either 1) to the people whom Solomon called to Jerusalem and who are listed in [[:en:bible:notes:1ki:08:01|8:1]], or 2) to those who traveled to Jerusalem for the feast, not necessarily to every person who lived in Israel. See how you translated similar words in [[:en:bible:notes:1ki:08:62|8:62]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **seven days ... seven days ... fourteen days** - "7 days ... 7 days ... 14 days" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **eighth day** - The word "eighth" is the ordinal form of "8." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **joyful and glad** - The two words mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
