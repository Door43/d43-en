\v 18 When Zimri realized that the city was \add about to be\add* captured, he went into his palace and set it on fire. So the palace burned down, and he died \add in the fire\add*.
\v 19 He died because he had sinned by doing the things that Yahweh said were evil. Jeroboam had induced the Israelite people to sin, and Zimri sinned just like Jeroboam had sinned.
\p
\v 20 All the other things that Zimri did, and the record of how he rebelled \add against King Elah\add*, are written in the book named 'The History of the Kings of Israel.'

\v 18 So when Zimri saw that the city had been taken, he went into the fortress attached to the king's palace and set fire to the building over him; in this way he died in the flames.
\v 19 This was for the sins that he had committed in doing what was evil in the sight of Yahweh, by walking in the way of Jeroboam and in the sin that he had committed, so as to lead Israel to sin.
\v 20 As for the other matters concerning Zimri, and the treason that he carried out, are they not written in The Book of the Events of the Kings of Israel?
