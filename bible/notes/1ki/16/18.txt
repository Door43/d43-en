\v 18 When Zimri realized that the city was \add about to be\add* captured, he went into his palace and set it on fire. So the palace burned down, and he died \add in the fire\add*.
\v 19 He died because he had sinned by doing the things that Yahweh said were evil. Jeroboam had induced the Israelite people to sin, and Zimri sinned just like Jeroboam had sinned.
\p
\v 20 All the other things that Zimri did, and the record of how he rebelled \add against King Elah\add*, are written in the book named 'The History of the Kings of Israel.'

\v 18 So when Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the fortification of the king’s palace and burned the king’s palace over him, and Zimri died in the flame, 
\v 19 for his sins which he committed in doing what was evil in the sight of Yahweh, by living  in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin which he committed, to lead Israel to sin.
\v 20 Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he carried out, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of
the kings of Israel?
