\v 7 Yahweh gave that message about Baasha and his family to the prophet Jehu. Baasha had done many deeds that Yahweh said were evil, which caused Yahweh to become angry. Baasha did the same kind of deeds that King Jeroboam and his family had done previously. Yahweh was also angry with Baasha because he had killed all of Jeroboam's family.

\v 7 So by the prophet Jehu son of Hanani the word of Yahweh came against Baasha and his family, both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of Yahweh, so as to provoke him to anger with the work of his hands, like the family of Jeroboam, and also because he had killed all of Jeroboam's family.

AT: "Yahweh spoke this message" or "Yahweh spoke these words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **all the evil that he did in the sight of Yahweh** - The sight of Yahweh represents Yahweh's judgment. AT: "all the things that Baasha that are evil in Yahweh's judgment" or "all the things that Baaha did that Yahweh considers to be evil" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **so as to provoke him to anger** - The abstract noun "anger" can be expressed with the adjective "angry." AT: "so as to make Yahweh very angry" or "that made God very angry" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
