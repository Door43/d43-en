\v 31 It was to Ahab a trivial thing to walk in the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, so he took as his wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Sidonians; he went and worshiped Baal and bowed down to him.
\v 32 He built an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.
\v 33 Ahab made an Asherah pole. Ahab did even more to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel who had been before him.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **It was to Ahab a trivial thing to walk in the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat** - AT: "As if committing the same sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had committed was not bad enough for Ahab" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **a trivial thing** - "an insignificant thing"
  * **worshiped Baal and bowed down to him** - These two phrases mean the same thing. The phrase "bowed down to him" describes the posture that people used in worship. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
