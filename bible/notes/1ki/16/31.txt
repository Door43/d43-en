\v 31 So as if it was not important for him to live in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, Ahab took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and he went and served Baal, and worshipped him.
\v 32 He built an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.
\v 33 And Ahab made an Asherah idol. Ahab did even more to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of
Israel who were before him.
