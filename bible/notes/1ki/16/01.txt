===== translationNotes: =====
 
  * **The word of Yahweh came** -  This idiom means God spoke. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:1ki:06:11|6:11]]. AT: "Yahweh spoke his message"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **I exalted you out of the dust** - "I raised you out of the dust."  Being in the dust on the ground represents not be important. Exalting someone represents making him important. AT: "I raised you from a very unimportant position" or "when you had no power or influence over people, I made you important" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **have walked in the way of Jeroboam** - Walking represents behaving. Jeroboam and Baasha sinned. AT: "have done the same things that Jeroboam did" or "you have sinned as Jeroboam sinned" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
