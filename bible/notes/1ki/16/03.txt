===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues telling Hanani what he will do to King Baasha.
  
  * **See, I will completely sweep away Baasha and his family** - Yahweh is speaking to Baasha, and the phrase "his family" refers to Baasha's family. This can be translated using the words "you" and "your." AT: "Listen, Baasha. I will completely sweep away you and your family" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **I will completely sweep away** - Sweeping away represents destroying. AT: "I will completely destroy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
