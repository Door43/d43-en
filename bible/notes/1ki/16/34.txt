<usfm>
\v 34 In his days Hiel the Bethelite rebuilt Jericho. He laid the foundation of the city with the loss of Abiram his firstborn, and constructed the gates of the city with the loss of his youngest son Segub, and they did this because they obeyed the word of Yahweh, which he had spoken by Joshua the son of Nun.
