\v 11 And so when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, he killed all the family of Baasha. He left alive not a single male child, neither of his kinsfolk nor of his friends.
\v 12 So Zimri destroyed all the family of Baasha, according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,
\v 13 for all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son which they committed, and by which they led Israel to sin and provoked Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger with their idols.
