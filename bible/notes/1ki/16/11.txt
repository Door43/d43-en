\v 11 When Zimri began to reign, as soon as he had sat on his throne, he killed all the family of Baasha. He left alive not a single male child, neither of his relatives nor of his friends.
\v 12 So Zimri destroyed all the family of Baasha, as was told them by the word of Yahweh, which he had spoken against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,
\v 13 for all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son that they committed, and by which they had led Israel to sin, so as to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger with their idols.
