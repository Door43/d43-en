====== 1 Kings 16 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Incorrect worship ==
The prophet Jehu warned Baasha, king of Israel, that God would destroy his family for worshipping the idols. But Baasha did not change his ways; so Zimri murdered Baasha's son and all his relatives. Then Omri killed Zimri. Omri's son Ahab brought in the rain god, Baal and his wife, the fertility goddess, Ashtoreth as the official religion of Israel. This was very evil. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]], [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod]] and [[:en:obe:kt:evil]]).
