\v 15 In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned only for seven days in Tirzah. Now the army was camped by Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.
\v 16 The army camped there heard it said, "Zimri has plotted and has killed the king." So that day in the camp, all Israel
declared Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel.
\v 17 Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.
