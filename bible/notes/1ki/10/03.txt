\v 3 Solomon answered all her questions. There was nothing she asked that the king did not answer.
\v 4 When the queen of Sheba saw all Solomon's wisdom, the palace that he had built,
\v 5 the food on his table and the seating of his servants and the work of his servants and their clothing, also his cupbearers and the manner in which he offered burnt offerings in the house of Yahweh, there was no more spirit in her.
