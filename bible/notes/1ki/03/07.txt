\v 7 And now, O Yahweh my God, you have made your servant king instead of David my father, though I am but a little child. I do not know how to go out or come in.
\v 8 Your servant is in the midst of your people whom you have chosen, a great people, too numerous to be numbered or counted.
\v 9 Give your servant therefore an understanding heart to judge your people, that I may discern between good and evil. For who is able to judge this your great people?"
