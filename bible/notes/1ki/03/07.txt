\v 7 Now, Yahweh my God, you have enabled me to be the king like my father was. But I am \add very young, like\add* a little child \f + \ft metaphor \f*. I do not know how to lead\f + \ft Or: rule \f* my people at all [IDI].
\v 8 I live among the people whom you have chosen. They are a very large group of people; there are very, very many of them, with the result that no one can count them \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\v 9 So please enable me to think clearly, in order that I may rule your people \add well\add*. Enable me to know what is good and what is evil. \add If you do not do that\add*, I will never \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* be able to rule this great group of people who belong to you."

\v 7 And now, Yahweh my God, you have made your servant king in the place of David my father, though I am only a little child. I do not know how to go out or come in.
\v 8 Your servant is in the midst of the people whom you have chosen, a great people, too numerous to be numbered or counted.
\v 9 So give your servant an understanding heart to judge your people, so that I may discern between good and evil. For who is able to judge this great people of yours?"

===== Translation Notes: =====

Solomon asks for wisdom.

  * **I am only a little child** - Solomon is saying that he is like a child who does know as much as a father. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]].)
  * **I do not know how to go out or come in** - AT: "I do not know the right way to do things" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]) or "I do not know how to be the king" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **For who is able to judge this great people of yours?**  - Solomon is asking a question where the answer is obvious. The answer is "no one." AT: "No one is able to judge this great people of yours"; (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]].)
