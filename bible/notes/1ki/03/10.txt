\v 10 Yahweh was very pleased that Solomon had requested that.
\v 11 God said to him, "You did not request that you live for many years or that you become very rich or that you be able to kill all your enemies. Instead, you have requested that I enable you to be wise, in order that you will be able to know \add and to do\add* what is right \add while you govern these people\add*.
\v 12 So, I will certainly do what you requested. I will enable you to be very wise \f + \ft doublet \f*. The result will be that no one who has lived before you or who will live after you will be as \add wise as\add* you are.

\v 10 This request of Solomon pleased the Lord.
\v 11 So God said to him, "Because you have asked this thing and have not asked for yourself long life or riches or the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice,
\v 12 I have done all you commanded me to do when you gave me your word. I have given you a wise and an understanding heart, so that there has been no one like you before you, nor after you will any arise like to you.
