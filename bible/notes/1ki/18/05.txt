\v 5 And Ahab said to Obadiah, "Go through the land to all the fountains of water and to all the brooks. Perhaps we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, so that we will not lose all the animals."
\v 6 So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it looking for water. Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.
