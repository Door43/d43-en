\v 5 Ahab said to Obadiah, "Go through the land to all the water springs and brooks. Perhaps we will find grass and save the horses and mules alive, so that we will not lose all the animals."
\v 6 So they divided the land between them to pass through it and look for water. Ahab went one way by himself and Obadiah went another way.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **save the horses and mules alive ... not lose all the animals** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. AT: "prevent the horses and mules from dying" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Ahab went one way by himself and Obadiah went another way** - The phrase "by himself" emphasizes that Ahab and Obadiah went in separate directions, not necessarily that no one was with Ahab. AT: "Ahab lead a team in one direction and Obadiah lead a team in the other direction" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
