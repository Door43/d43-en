\v 27 About noontime, Elijah started to make fun of them. He said, "\add Surely\add* Baal is a god, so it seems that you must shout louder! Perhaps he is thinking about something, or perhaps he has gone to the toilet. Or perhaps he is traveling to somewhere, or perhaps he is asleep and you need to wake him up!"
\v 28 So they shouted louder. Then, doing one of the things that they frequently did \add when they worshiped Baal\add*, they slashed\f + \ft Or: cut \f* themselves with knives and swords until a lot of blood flowed.
\v 29 They continued calling out to Baal all afternoon. But there was no voice that gave a reply, no answer, no god who paid attention.

\v 27 At noon Elijah mocked them and said, "Cry out loud! He is a god! Perhaps he is thinking, or is relieving himself, or he is traveling on a journey, or perhaps he is sleeping and must be awakened."
\v 28 So they cried more loudly, and they cut themselves, as they usually do, with swords and spears, until their blood flowed out over themselves.
\v 29 Midday passed, and they were still raving until the time of offering of the evening sacrifice, but there was no voice or anyone to answer; there was no one who paid any attention to their pleadings.
