===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the word of Yahweh came** - "Word" is metonymy for what a person says. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:1ki:06:11|6:11]]. AT: "Yahweh spoke his word" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **send rain on the land** - "cause rain to fall on the land"
  * **now the famine was severe** - The word "now" is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Here the writer tells background information about how the famine had affected Samaria. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
