\v 12 But as soon as I leave you, the Spirit of Yahweh will carry you away, and I will not know where he will take you. So when \add I tell\add* Ahab \add that you are here and he\add* comes to me and he does not find you here, he will kill me! But I \add do not deserve to die because\add* I have revered Yahweh since I was a boy.
\v 13 My master, have you not heard about what I did when Jezebel wanted to kill all of Yahweh's prophets? I hid a hundred of them in two caves and took food and water to them.

\v 12 As soon as I am gone from you, the Spirit of Yahweh will carry you some place I do not know. Then when I go and tell Ahab, and when he cannot find you, he will kill me. Yet I, your servant, have worshiped Yahweh from my youth.
\v 13 Has it not been told to you, my master, what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of Yahweh, how I hid one hundred of Yahweh's prophets by fifties in a cave and fed them with bread and water?
