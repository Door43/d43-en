\v 25 So Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, "Choose one bull for yourselves and prepare it first, for you are many people. Then call on the name of your god, but put no fire under the bull."
\v 26 They took the bull that was given to them and prepared it, and they called on the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying, "Baal, hear us." But there was no voice, nor anyone who answered. They danced around the altar they had made.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **prepare it** - "make it ready to be sacrificed"
  * **you are many people** - Here the word "you" is plural. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_youdual]])
  * **They took the bull** - "The prophets of Baal took the bull"
  * **the bull that was given to them** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the bull that someone gave them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **But there was no voice, nor anyone who answered** - These two phrases share similar meanings and emphasize that there was no one to respond to the prayers of the false prophets. The word "voice" represents someone speaking. AT: "But Baal did not say or do anything" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
