\v 18 Elijah answered, "I have not troubled Israel, but you and your father’s family are the troublemakers by abandoning the commandments of Yahweh and by following the Baal idols.
\v 19 Now then, send word and gather to me all Israel at Mount Carmel, along with the 450 prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah who eat at Jezebel’s table."
