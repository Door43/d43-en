\v 22 Then Elijah said to them, "I am the only true prophet of Yahweh who is left, but Baal has 450 prophets.
\v 23 Bring two bulls. The prophets of Baal may choose the one that they want. They must \add kill it and\add* cut it into pieces and lay the pieces on the wood that is on the altar that they made. But they must not light a fire \add under the wood\add*. \add I will kill the other bull and cut it in pieces and lay the pieces on the altar that I make\add*.
\v 24 Then they must call to their god \f + \ft metonymy \f*, and I will call to Yahweh. The god who answers by lighting a fire \add to the wood that is on that altar\add* is \add the true\add* God!"
\p Then all the people thought that Elijah's suggestion was good.

\v 22 Then Elijah said to the people, "I, I alone, am left as a prophet of Yahweh, but Baal's prophets are 450 men.
\v 23 So let them give us two bulls. Let them choose one bull for themselves and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, but put no fire under it. Then I will prepare the other bull and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under it.
\v 24 Then you will call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of Yahweh, and the God who answers by fire, then let him be God." So all the people answered and said, "This is good."

  * **450 men** - "four hundred fifty men" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **call on the name of your god ... call on the name of Yahweh** - "Name" is metonymy for the reputation and honor of someone and "calling on" him represents an appeal. AT: "call to your god ... call to Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
