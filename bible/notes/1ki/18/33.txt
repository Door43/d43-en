\v 33 He piled wood on top of the stones. He killed the bull and cut it in pieces. Then he laid the pieces on top of the wood. Then he said, "Fill four large jars with water, and pour the water on top of the pieces of meat and the wood." So they did that.
\p
\v 34 Then he said, "Do the same thing again!" So they did it again. Then he said "Do it a third time!" So they did it again.
\p
\v 35 As a result, the water flowed down below the altar and filled the ditches.
