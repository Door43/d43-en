\v 9 Obadiah replied, "How have I sinned, that you would give your servant into the hand of Ahab, for him to kill me?
\v 10 As Yahweh your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my master has not sent men to find you. Whenever a nation or kingdom says, 'Elijah is not here,' Ahab makes them take an oath swearing that they could not find you.
\v 11 Yet now you say, 'Go, tell your master  that Elijah is here.'
