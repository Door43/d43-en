\q
\v 6 I have cut off nations; their battlements are desolate. 
\q I have made their streets ruins, so that no one passes over them.
\q Their cities are destroyed so that there is no man inhabiting them.
\q
\v 7 I said, 'Surely you will fear me! Accept correction 
\q and do not be cut off from your dwellings according to all that I have appointed concerning you!' 
\q But they were eager to corrupt all their deeds.
