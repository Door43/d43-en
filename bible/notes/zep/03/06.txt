\v 6 Yahweh says this:
\q1 "I have destroyed many nations;
\q2 I have destroyed their strong city walls and towers.
\q1 Now I have caused the streets in those cities to be completely deserted.
\q2 Those cities are ruined and there isn't anyone still alive there.
\q2 They are all dead.
\q1
\v 7 So I said to myself,
\q2 'Because of what I have done to those other nations,
\q2 surely the people of Jerusalem will honor me now
\q2 and allow me to correct them.
\q1 If they do that, I will not destroy them;
\q2 I will not punish them like I said that I would do.'
\q1 But in spite of knowing how I punished those other nations,
\q2 they were still eager to get up early each morning
\q2 and continue to perform evil deeds."

\v 6 "I have destroyed nations; their fortresses are ruined. 
\q I have made their streets ruins, so that no one passes over them.
\q Their cities are destroyed so that there is no man inhabiting them.
\q
\v 7 I said, 'Surely you will fear me! Accept correction 
\q and do not be cut off from your homes by all that I have planned to do to you!' 
\q But they were eager to begin each morning by corrupting all their deeds.
