\v 7 So I said \add to myself\add*,
\q2 '\add Because of what I have done to those other nations\add*,
\q2 surely the people \add of Jerusalem\add* will revere me now,
\q2 and they will accept my correcting them\f + \ft Or: my telling them to quit doing what is wrong \f*.
\q1 If they do that, I will not destroy their houses;
\q2 I will not punish them like I said that I would do.'
\q1 But \add in spite of knowing how I punished those other nations\add*,
\q2 they were still eager to get up early each morning
\q2 and continue to perform evil deeds.

\v 6 Yahweh says this:
\q1 "I have destroyed many nations;
\q2 I have destroyed their strong city walls and towers.
\q1 Now I have caused the streets in those cities to be completely deserted.
\q2 Those cities are ruined and there is no one still alive there.
\q2 They are all dead.
\q1
\v 7 So I said to myself,
\q2 'Because of what I have done to those other nations,
\q2 surely the people of Jerusalem will honor me now
\q2 and allow me to correct them.
\q1 If they do that, I will not destroy them;
\q2 I will not punish them like I said that I would do.'
\q1 But in spite of knowing how I punished those other nations,
\q2 they were still eager to get up early each morning
\q2 and continue to perform evil deeds."

\q
\v 6 "I have destroyed nations; their fortresses are ruined. 
\q I have made their streets ruins, so that no one passes over them.
\q Their cities are destroyed so that there is no man inhabiting them.
\q
\v 7 I said, 'Surely you will fear me. Accept correction 
\q and do not be cut off from your homes by all that I have planned to do to you.' 
\q But they were eager to begin each morning by corrupting all their deeds.

===== translationNotes: =====

 
  * **I have made their streets ruins, so that no one passes over them. Their cities are destroyed so that there is no man inhabiting them** - Yahweh expresses the same idea in two different ways in order to emphasize the complete destruction of the cities. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
