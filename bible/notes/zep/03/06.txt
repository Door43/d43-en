\v 6 Yahweh says this:
\q1 "I have destroyed many nations;
\q2 I have destroyed their strong city walls and towers.
\q1 Now I have caused the streets in those cities to be completely deserted.
\q2 Those cities are ruined and there is no one still alive there.
\q2 They are all dead.
\q1
\v 7 So I said to myself,
\q2 'Because of what I have done to those other nations,
\q2 surely the people of Jerusalem will honor me now
\q2 and allow me to correct them.
\q1 If they do that, I will not destroy them;
\q2 I will not punish them like I said that I would do.'
\q1 But in spite of knowing how I punished those other nations,
\q2 they were still eager to get up early each morning
\q2 and continue to perform evil deeds."

\q
\v 6 "I have destroyed nations; their fortresses are ruined.
\q I have made their streets ruins, so that no one passes over them.
\q Their cities are destroyed so that there is no man inhabiting them.
\q
\v 7 I said, 'Surely you will fear me. Accept correction
\q and do not be cut off from your homes by all that I have planned to do to you.'
\q But they were eager to begin each morning by corrupting all their deeds.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In verses 3:6-7, Yahweh rebukes the people of Jerusalem because they did not learn from how he judged other sinful cities. It may be helpful to add "Yahweh says this:" to the beginning of verse 6 to make this explicit. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

  * **I have made their streets ruins, so that no one passes over them. Their cities are destroyed so that there is no man inhabiting them** - These two sentences express the same idea in two different ways in order to emphasize the complete destruction of the cities. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **no one passes over them** - "no one walks on them"
  * **there is no man inhabiting them** - "no one lives there." This can be stated in positive form. AT: "all the people are dead"
  * **I said, 'Surely you will fear me ... I have planned to do to you.'** - This can be stated as an indirect quotation. AT: "I thought they would surely fear me and accept correction so that they would not be cut off from their homes by all that I have planned to do to them." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **and do not be cut off from your homes** - Here "cut off" is an idiom that means to be removed. This can be stated in active form. AT: "so that I will not remove you from your homes" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **by corrupting all their deeds** - "by doing deeds that were corrupt"
