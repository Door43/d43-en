\v 9 But then I will give pure lips to the people, 
\q to call all of them in the name of Yahweh to serve me standing shoulder to shoulder.

\q
\v 10 From beyond the river of Ethiopia my worshipers—my scattered people—will bring offerings due me.
\q
\v 11 In that day you will not be put to shame for all your deeds that you committed against me, 
\q since at that time I will remove from among you those who celebrated your pride,  
\q and because you will no longer act arrogantly on my holy mountain.

  * **serve me standing shoulder to shoulder** - The people will be united in their desire to serve God, as people are united physically when they stand together with their shoulders touching each other.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
