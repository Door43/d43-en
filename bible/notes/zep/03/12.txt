===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The remnant of Israel will no longer commit injustice or speak lies, and no deceitful tongue will be found in their mouth** - The statement that people will no longer speak lies or have a deceitful tongue is a doublet. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]]
  * **graze and lie down** - AT: "They will move their animals freely and sleep peacefully with no one attacking them or their animals."  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
