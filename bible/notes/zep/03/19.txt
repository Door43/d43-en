===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In verses 3:19-20, Yahweh speaks directly to the remnant of Israel who survived the judgment and tells them that they should rejoice. 

  * **Behold** - This tells the reader to pay special attention to what follows. AT: "Look" or "Pay attention"
  * **I am about to deal with all your oppressors** - It is understood that "deal with" means to punish the oppressors. This can be stated explicitly. AT: "I will severely punish all those who oppressed you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **I will rescue the lame and gather up the outcast** - Here the Israelites who suffered in exile are spoken of as if they were lame and outcast sheep. This can be stated as a simile. AT: "I will rescue and bring together the remnant of Israel who are like lame and outcast sheep" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **the lame** - This refers to people or animals that cannot walk. 
  * **I will make them as praise** - The full thought here is, "I will make them to be objects of praise," that is, "I will make them to be praised by others." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **I will change their shame into renown** - The abstract nouns "shame" and "renown" can be stated as actions. AT: "I will cause them to no longer be ashamed, but for people to respect them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **At that time I will lead you; at that time I will gather you together** - These two lines mean basically the same thing and imply that Yahweh will bring the exiled people back to their homeland. AT: "At that time I will gather you together and lead you home" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
