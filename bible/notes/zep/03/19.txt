===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the lame** - This refers to people who cannot walk. 
  * **At that time I will bring you together, and at that time I will  assemble you together** - The idea is repeated to emphasize that it will certainly happen.  This is a doublet.  
  * **when I restore your fortunes**- AT: "When I cause you to be strong and successful again" 
  * **before your eyes** - "you will see" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
