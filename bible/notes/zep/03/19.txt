  * **the lame** - This refers to people who cannot walk. 
  * **At that time I will lead you and at that time I will gather you together** - These two lines mean basically the same thing and emphasize that Yahweh will bring the exiled people back to their homeland. AT: "At that time I will gather you together and lead you home." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
