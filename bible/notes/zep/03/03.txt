===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In verses 3:1-5, Zephaniah speaks Yahweh's message of judgment to the sinful people of Jerusalem. The city represents the people who live within it. To make this clear, it may be helpful to replace the singular "she" and "her" with the plural "they" and "their." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])

  * **Her princes are roaring lions in her midst** - Lions roar to chase other animals away from the prey they have caught. The princes of Jerusalem are spoken of as if they were roaring lions who were keeping the prey for themselves. AT: "Jerusalem's royalty are as greedy as roaring lions" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **Her judges are evening wolves who leave nothing to be gnawed upon in the morning** - Wolves are especially hungry before they hunt at night. The judges are spoken of as if they were hungry wolves. AT: "Her judges are as greedy as hungry wolves that leave nothing for anyone else" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **Her prophets are insolent and treasonous men** - "Her prophets do not listen to anyone and cannot be trusted"
  * **have profaned what is holy** - "have treated holy things with disrespect"
  * **have done violence to the law** - "have broken the law"
