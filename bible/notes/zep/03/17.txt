  * **General Information:** - In verses 3:14-20, Zephaniah tells the remnant of Israel who survived the judgment that they should rejoice. 
 
  * **a mighty one to save you** - "he is mighty and will save you." Yahweh is spoken of as a mighty warrior. AT: "he is a mighty warrior and will give you victory" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **He will celebrate over you with joy ... he will be glad over you with a shout for joy** - These two phrases mean the same thing and are repeated to emphasize Yahweh's joy that the remnant is restored to him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **he will be silent over you in his love** - Possible meanings are 1) "he will quiet you by his love for you" or 2) "he will renew you because he loves you."
  * **no longer bear any shame for it** - Here shame is spoken of as if it was a heavy thing that a person had to carry. AT: "no longer be ashamed because of it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
