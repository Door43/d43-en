===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Rally yourselves together and gather** - These two phrases mean the same thing. Together they intensify the command for the people to gather together in order to repent of their sins. AT: "gather yourselves together." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **unashamed nation** - The nation is not sorry for their sins. 
  * **that day passes like the chaff** - The chaff is the insignificant part of the plant being thrown away and so this day will pass quickly. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]]).
  * **before the fierce anger of Yahweh's wrath comes upon you, before the day of the wrath of Yahweh comes upon you** - The prophet repeats the same phrase almost exactly in order to emphasize how terrible Yahweh's judgment will be and the urgency with which the people must repent. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]). 
  * **Yahweh's wrath** - This stands for God's intent to punish. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
