===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In 2:1-3, Yahweh continues to speak to Judah, and tells them to repent.

  * **Rally yourselves together and gather** - These two phrases mean the same thing. Together they intensify the command for the people to gather together in order to repent of their sins. AT: "Gather yourselves together" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **unashamed nation** - The nation is not sorry for their sins. 
  * **before the decree takes effect** - This phrase refers to the punishment that will happen as a result of Yahweh's decree. AT: "before Yahweh punishes you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **that day ... the day of the wrath of Yahweh ... the day of Yahweh's wrath** - These phrases all refer to the "day of Yahweh." Translate these phrases as you did similar phrases in [[:en:bible:notes:zep:01:07|1:7-9]].
  * **that day passes like the chaff** - The chaff is the insignificant part of the plant that the wind blows away. In a similar way, the day of judgment will pass quickly. AT: "that day passes as quickly as chaff blown by the wind" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **before the fierce anger of Yahweh's wrath comes upon you, before the day of the wrath of Yahweh comes upon you** - The prophet repeats the same phrase almost exactly in order to emphasize how terrible Yahweh's judgment will be and the urgency with which the people must repent. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) 
  * **Yahweh's wrath** - This stands for God's intent to punish. AT: "Yahweh's punishment" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Seek Yahweh** - Seeking Yahweh represents either 1) asking God for help or 2) thinking about God and obeying him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Seek righteousness. Seek humility** - The abstract nouns "righteousness" and "humility" can be stated as actions. AT: "Try to do what is right and to be humble" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **you will be protected in the day of Yahweh's wrath** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh will protect you in the day of his wrath" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
