===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Rally yourselves together and gather** - AT:"meet together". (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]]). 
  * **unashamed nation** - The nation is not sorry for their sins.  
  * **before the day passes like the chaff** - The chaff is the insignificant part of the plant being thrown away and so this day will pass quickly. (See:[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]]).
  * **before the fierce anger of Yahweh's wrath comes upon you! Before the day of Yahweh's wrath comes upon you** - Notice that the same phrase is repeated almost exactly the same. This shows intensity. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]). 
  * **Yahweh's wrath** - This stands for God's intent to punish. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
