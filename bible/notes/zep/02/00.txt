====== Zephaniah 02 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 2:1-4, 8-9, 12-15, which are extended quotation. 2:5-7 are indented again to further set them apart from the rest of the quote. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Prophecy ==
In this chapter, because the prophesied destruction is so complete, it is unclear whether these prophecies concern the time near the fall of Jerusalem or the day of the Lord. It is possible that the prophecies reference more than one period of time. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]], [[:en:obe:kt:christ]] and [[:en:obe:kt:dayofthelord]])
