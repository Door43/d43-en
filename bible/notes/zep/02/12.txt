\q
\v 12 You Cushites also will be pierced by my sword,
\q
\v 13 and God's hand will attack the north and destroy Assyria, 
\q so that Nineveh will become an abandoned devastation, as dry as the desert.
\q
\v 14 Then herds will lie down in the middle of Assyria, every beast of the nations, 
\q and birds and owls will nest in the tops of her pillars. 
\q There will be a chirping sound in the windows and ravens will call on their doorsteps, for he has exposed the cedar beams.
