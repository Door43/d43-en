\v 12 You Ethiopians also, you shall be slain by my sword.
\v 13 And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria, and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like
the wilderness.
\v 14 And herds shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the pelican and the porcupine shall
lodge in the capitals thereof; their voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds: for he
has laid bare the cedar-work.
