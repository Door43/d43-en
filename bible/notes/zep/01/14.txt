\v 14 The great day of Yahweh is near, near and hurrying quickly!
\q The sound of the day of Yahweh will be that of a warrior crying bitterly!
\q
\v 15 That day will be a day of fury, a day of distress and anguish, 
\q a day of storm and devastation, a day of darkness and gloom, 
\q a day of clouds and billowing darkness!

\q
\v 16 It will be a day of trumpets and alarms  
\q against the fortified cities and the high battlements!
