\v 14 The great day of Yahweh is near, near and hurrying quickly!
\q The sound of the day of Yahweh will be that of a warrior crying bitterly!
\q
\v 15 That day will be a day of fury, a day of distress and anguish, 
\q a day of storm and devastation, a day of darkness and gloom, 
\q a day of clouds and thick darkness.
\q
\v 16 It will be a day of trumpets and alarms

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **near, near and hurrying quickly** - The repetition of the word "near," along with the phrase "hurrying quickly" emphasize that the day when Yahweh judges the people will soon happen. AT: "close and will be here soon." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **That day will be a day of fury ... battlements** - This statement is to emphasize that how terrible God's judgment will be. The multiple figures of speech are accumulative and show the destructive nature of this final judgment by God. It creates emphasis. 
  * **a day of distress and anguish** - The words "distress" and "anguish" mean about the same thing and emphasize the intensity of the people's distress. AT: "a day when people feel terrible distress." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **a day of storm and devastation** - Here the word "storm" refers to divine judgment. The word "devastation" describes the effects of that judgment. AT: "a day of devastating storms" or "a day of devastating judgment." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **a day of darkness and gloom** - The words "darkness" and "gloom" share similar meanings and emphasize the intensity of darkness. Both words refer to a time of disaster or divine judgment. AT: "a day that is full of darkness" or "a day of terrible judgment." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **a day of clouds and billowing darkness** - This phrase means the same thing as, and intensifies the idea of the previous phrase. Like that phrase, both "clouds" and "billowing darkness" refer to divine judgment. AT: "a day full of dark storm clouds." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **a day of trumpets and alarms** - The words "trumpets" and "alarms" mean basically the same thing here. Both are means to call soldiers to prepare for battle. AT: "a day when people sound the alarm for battle." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **fortified cities and the high battlements** - These two phrases both refer to military strongholds. AT: "well fortified cities." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
