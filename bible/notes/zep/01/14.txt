\v 14 The great day of Yahweh is near, near and hurrying quickly!
\q The sound of the day of Yahweh will be that of a warrior crying bitterly!
\q
\v 15 That day will be a day of fury, a day of distress and anguish,
\q a day of storm and devastation, a day of darkness and gloom,
\q a day of clouds and thick darkness.
\q
\v 16 It will be a day of trumpets and alarms
\q against the fortified cities and the high battlements.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Verses 1:2-18 refer to Yahweh's judgment. Verses 1:4-16 describe Yahweh's judgment on the people of Judah.

  * **near, near and hurrying quickly** - The repetition of the word "near," along with the phrase "hurrying quickly," emphasize that the day when Yahweh judges the people will soon happen. AT: "close and will be here soon" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **the day of Yahweh** - See how you translated this phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:zep:01:07|1:7]].
  * **a warrior crying bitterly** - Possible meanings are 1) a soldier crying in despair or 2) a soldier's battle cry.
  * **That day ... a day** - These phrases refer back to the "day of Yahweh" in verse 14.
  * **That day will be a day of fury ... battlements** - Verses 15-16 have multiple figures of speech that together emphasize the destructive nature of this final judgment by God.
  * **a day of distress and anguish** - The words "distress" and "anguish" mean about the same thing and emphasize the intensity of the people's distress. AT: "a day when people feel terrible distress" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **a day of storm and devastation** - Here the word "storm" refers to divine judgment. The word "devastation" describes the effects of that judgment. AT: "a day of devastating storms" or "a day of devastating judgment" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **a day of darkness and gloom** - The words "darkness" and "gloom" share similar meanings and emphasize the intensity of darkness. Both words refer to a time of disaster or divine judgment. AT: "a day that is full of darkness" or "a day of terrible judgment" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **a day of clouds and thick darkness** - This phrase means the same thing as, and intensifies, the idea of the previous phrase. Like that phrase, both "clouds" and "thick darkness" refer to divine judgment. AT: "a day full of dark storm clouds" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **a day of trumpets and alarms** - The words "trumpets" and "alarms" mean basically the same thing here. Both are means to call soldiers to prepare for battle. AT: "a day when people sound the alarm for battle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **fortified cities and the high battlements** - These two phrases both refer to military strongholds. AT: "well fortified cities" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
