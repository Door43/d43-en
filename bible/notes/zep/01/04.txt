\q
\v 4 I will reach out with my hand over Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\q I will cut off every remnant of Baal from this place and the names of the idolatrous people among the priests,
\q
\v 5 the people who on the housetops worship the heavenly bodies,
\q and the people who worship and swear to Yahweh but who also swear by their king.
\f + \ft The Hebrew text has \fqa by their king \fqa* , but some modern versions read \fqa by Milcom \fqa* , the name of a pagan god that many people worshiped. \f*
\q
\v 6 I will also cut off those who have turned away from following Yahweh, those who neither seek Yahweh nor ask for his guidance."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Verses 1:2-18 refer to Yahweh's judgment. Verses 1:4-16 describe Yahweh's judgment on the people of Judah.

  * **I will reach out with my hand over Judah** - This is an idiom that means God will punish. AT: "I will punish Judah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **I will cut off every remnant ... the names of the idolatrous people among the priests ... the people who on the housetops ... the people who worship and swear** - The verb "cut off" applies to each of these phrases, but has been used only once to avoid repetition. AT: "I will cut off every remnant ... I will cut off the names of the idolatrous people among the priests ... I will cut off the people who on the housetops ... I will cut off the people who worship and swear" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **cut off** - Destroying is spoken of as if it were cutting something off from what it was a part of. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:zep:01:01|1:3]]. AT: "destroy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **cut off ... the names of the idolatrous people among the priests** - Here "cut off ... the names" is an idiom that means to cause people to forget them. AT: "cause everyone ... to forget the priests who are idolatrous" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **by their king** - See the footnote about the possible rendering of this as "by Milcom." 
  * **neither seek Yahweh nor ask for his guidance** - Seeking Yahweh represents either 1) asking God for help or 2) thinking about God and obeying him. AT: "do not think about Yahweh or ask him to guide them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
