\v 12 It will be as though I will light lanterns to search in dark places in Jerusalem
\q2 for those who have become very satisfied with their behavior and complacent about their sins.
\q1 They think that I, Yahweh, will do neither good nor bad things, as if I do not  even exist!
\q1
\v 13 So I have decided that armies will come and carry off their valuable possessions,
\q2 after destroying their houses.
\q1 The people will build new homes,
\q2 but they will not live in them;
\q1 they will plant vineyards again,
\q2 but they will never drink any wine made from grapes that grow."

\v 12 It will come about at that time that 
\q I will search Jerusalem with lamps and punish the men 
\q who have settled into their wine and say in their heart, 
\q 'Yahweh will not do anything, either good or evil!'
\q
\v 13 Their wealth will become plunder, and their houses will be an abandoned devastation! 
\q They will build houses but not live in them, and plant vineyards but not drink their wine!
