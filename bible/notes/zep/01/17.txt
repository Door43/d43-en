<usfm>
\q
\v 17 For I will bring distress upon mankind, so that they will walk about like blind men
\q since they have sinned against Yahweh.
\q Their blood will be poured out like dust, and their inner parts like dung.
\q
\v 18 Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them
\q on the day of Yahweh's fury. In the fire of his jealousy the whole earth will be consumed,
\q for he will bring a complete, a terrible end of all the inhabitants of the earth."

  * **they will walk about like blind men** - The result of Yahweh's judgment is that people will be so confused and dazed when they walk about that people will think they are blind. AT: "they will walk around as confused and dazed as blind men"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]]) 
  * **Their blood will be poured out like dust** - Their blood that is shed will be as worthless as dust. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Their enemies will pour out their blood and consider it to be worthless" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
