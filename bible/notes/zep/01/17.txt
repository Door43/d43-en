<usfm>
\v 17 And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against Jehovah; and
their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as dung.
\v 18 Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of Jehovah’s wrath; but the whole land shall
be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he will make an end, yea, a terrible end, of all them that dwell in the land.
