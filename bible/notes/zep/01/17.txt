\v 17 Because you sinned against Yahweh,
\q2 he will cause you to experience great distress;
\q2 you will walk around groping as blind people do.
\q1 Your blood will flow from your bodies like falling soil,
\q2 and your corpses will lie on the ground and rot.
\q1
\v 18 At the time that Yahweh shows that he is very angry with you,
\q2 you will not be able to save yourselves
\q2 by giving silver or gold to your enemies.
\q1 Because Yahweh is very jealous,
\q2 he will send a fire to burn up the entire world,
\q1 and he will completely get rid, in a most terrifying way, of all the wicked people who live on the earth.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q2
\v 17 For I will bring distress upon mankind, so that they will walk about like blind men 
\q2 since they have sinned against Yahweh. 
\q2 Their blood will be poured out like dust, and their inner parts like dung.
\q2
\v 18 Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them 
\q2 on the day of Yahweh's fury. In the fire of his jealousy the whole earth will be consumed, 
\q2 for he will bring a complete, a terrible end of all the inhabitants of the earth."
