\q2
\v 17 For I will bring distress upon mankind, so that they will walk about like blind men 
\q2 since they have sinned against Yahweh! 
\q2 Their blood will be poured out like dust, and their inner parts like dung!
\q2
\v 18 Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them 
\q2 on the day of Yahweh's fury! The fire of Yahweh's wrath will consume the whole land, 
\q2 for the annihilation that he will bring against all the inhabitants of the land will be terrifying!"
