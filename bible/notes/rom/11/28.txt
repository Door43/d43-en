\v 28 because the Jews rejected the good news about Christ, God treats them as enemies, and that has helped you non-Jews. But because they are the people whom God chose, God still loves them because of what he promised to do for their ancestors.
\v 29 He still loves them, because he never changed his mind about what he has promised to give them, and about how he has called them to be his own people.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **On the one hand...on the other hand** - This is a pair of phrases used to compare two different facts about a subject.  Paul uses these phrases to explain that God has rejected the Jews, but he also still loves them.
    * **they are hated because of you** - God's love for the Gentiles was so great that his love for the Jews seemed like hatred in comparison. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
    * **they are hated** - AT: "God hates the Jews" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) 
    * **For the gifts and the call of God are unchangeable** - AT: "Because the gifts and the call of God cannot change"
