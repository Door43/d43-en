\v 23 And if the Jews believe in Christ, God will also put them back into the tree again, because God is able to do that.
\v 24 You non-Jews who were previously apart from God have benefited from the ways in which God blessed the Jews. That is like taking branches that someone has cut from a wild olive tree—a tree that just grew without anyone planting it— and, contrary to what people usually do, grafting them into a cultivated olive tree. So God will much more readily receive back the Jews because they belonged to him before! That will be like putting the original branches that someone cut off, back into the olive tree to which they originally belonged!

\v 23 And also, if they do not continue in their unbelief, they will be grafted back in. For God is able to graft them in again.
\v 24 For if you were cut out of what is by nature a wild olive tree, and contrary to nature were grafted into a good olive tree, how much more will these Jews, who are the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree?

===== Translation Notes: =====

Paul is speaking to the Gentile believers as though they are one person. 

  * **if they do not continue in their unbelief** - AT: "If the Jews start believing in Christ"
  * **they will be grafted back in** - AT: "God will graft them back" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **graft** - This is a common process where the end of a live branch of one tree is inserted into another tree so that it will continue to grow in that new tree. 
  * **For if you were cut out of what is by nature a wild olive tree, and contrary to nature were grafted into a good olive tree, how much more will these Jews, who are the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree?** - AT: "For if God had cut you out of what is by nature a wild olive tree, and contrary to nature had grafted you into a good olive tree, how much more will he graft these Jews, who are the natural branches, into their own olive tree?" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **branches** - Paul is comparing members of the people of God to branches on a tree. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
