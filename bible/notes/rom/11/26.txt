===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul says that a deliverer will come out of Israel to the glory of God.

  * **Thus all Israel will be saved** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Thus God will save all Israel" (See:  [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Thus all Israel will be saved** - Possible meanings are: 1) The phrase "all Israel" is a metonym and generalization for a large number of the people in the nation of Israel. AT: "Thus many of the people Israel will be saved" or 2) the phrase "all Israel" is a metonym for Jewish and Gentile Christians together. AT: "Thus all the people of God will be saved" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

  * **the Deliverer** - "the one who sets his people free" 
  * **He will remove ungodliness** - Paul speaks of ungodliness as if it were an object that someone could remove, perhaps like someone removes a garment. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
