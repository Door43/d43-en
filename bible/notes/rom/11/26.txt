===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul says that a deliverer will come out of Israel to the glory of God.

  * **Thus all Israel will be saved** - Here Paul speaks very generally. He does not mean that every person in Israel will be saved. You can translate this in an active form. AT: "Thus God will save many in Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **just as it is written** - You can translate this in an active form. AT: "just as the scriptures record" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Out of Zion** - Here "Zion" is used as a metonym for the place where God dwells. AT: "From where God is among the Jews" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **the Deliverer** - "the one who sets his people free" 
  * **He will remove ungodliness** - Paul speaks of ungodliness as if it were an object that someone could remove, perhaps like someone removes a garment. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **from Jacob** - Here "Jacob" is used as a metonym for Israel. AT: "from the Israelite people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **I will take away their sins** - Here Paul speaks of sins as if they were objects that someone could take away. AT: "I will remove the burden of their sins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
