\v 9 The Jews remind me of what King David said, when he asked God to cause his enemies' senses to be dull:
"Make them stupid, like animals that fall into nets or traps! May they feel as safe as if they were at their banquets, but let those feasts be times when you will catch them, and they will sin, with the result that you will destroy them.
\q
\v 10 May they not see the danger when it comes to them. May you always make them suffer because of their troubles."

\v 9 And David says,
\q "Let their table be made a net, a trap,
\q a stumbling block, and retaliation to them.
\q
\v 10 Let their eyes be darkened so that they may not see;
\q always keep their backs bent."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Let their table be made a net, a trap** - "Table" represents feasting, and "net" and "trap" represent punishment. AT: "Please, God, catch and trap them at their feasts" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]], [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **a stumbling block** - AT: "something that makes them sin" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **and retaliation to them** - AT: "something that allows you to take revenge on them"
  * **always keep their backs bent** - David asks God to turn his enemies into slaves who always carry heavy loads on their backs. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
