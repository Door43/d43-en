\v 9 The Jews remind me of what King David said, when he asked God to cause his enemies' senses to be dull:
"Make them stupid, like animals that fall into nets or traps! May they feel as safe as if they were at their banquets, but let those feasts be times when you will catch them, and they will sin, with the result that you will destroy them.
\q
\v 10 May they not see the danger when it comes to them. May you always make them suffer because of their troubles."

\v 9 Then David says,
\q "Let their table become a net and a trap,
\q a stumbling block and a retribution for them.
\q
\v 10 Let their eyes be darkened so that they may not see,
\q and bend their backs continually."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Let their table become a net and a trap** - "Table" is a metonym that represents feasting, and "net" and "trap" are metaphors that represent punishment. You can translate this in an active form. AT: "Please, God, make their feasts like a trap that catches them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **a stumbling block** - A "stumbling block" is anything that causes a person to trip so that he falls down. Here it represents something that tempts a person to  sin. AT: "something that tempts them to sin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a retribution for them** - "something that allows you to take revenge on them"
  * **bend their backs continually** - Here "bend their back" is a metonym for forcing slaves to carry heavy loads on their backs. This is a metaphor for making them suffer. AT: "make them suffer like people carrying heavy loads" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
