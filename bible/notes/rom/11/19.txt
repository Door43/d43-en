\v 19 If one of you then says, "\add God rejected the Jews\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add like\add* branches \f + \ft metaphor \f* that are broken \f + \ft Or:that people broke \f* off \add a tree and rejected\add*, in order that \add he might accept us non-Jews, as\add* branches \f + \ft metaphor \f* of a tree are grafted in \f + \ft Or:\add as people\add* graft in branches of a tree \f*,"
\v 20 \add I would reply that\add* this is true. However, it is because the Jews did not believe \add in Christ\add* that they were rejected \f + \ft metaphor \f* \f + \ft Or:that \add God\add* rejected \f + \ft metaphor \f* them \f*. As for you, it is \add only\add* because you believe \add in Christ\add* that \add God has accepted\add* you! \add So\add* do not \add any of you\add* become proud, but instead beware \add of what could happen to you\add*!
\v 21 Since God did not spare \add the unbelieving Jews\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add who were like a tree's\add* natural branches, he will not spare any of you \add if you do\add* not\add keep trusting in him!\add*

\v 19 Maybe you will say to me, "God rejected the Jews like people break bad branches off a tree and throw them away, and he has done this in order that he might accept us non-Jews, just like people put branches of a wild olive tree into the trunk of a good tree."
\v 20 I would reply that this is true. However, it is because the Jews did not believe in Christ that God rejected them. As for you, it is only because you believe in Christ that God has accepted you! So do not become proud, but instead be careful: the same thing could happen to you!
\v 21 Since God did not spare those Jews who were like a tree's natural branches, he will not spare any of you if you do not keep trusting in him!

\v 19 You will say then, "Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in."
\v 20 True! Because of their unbelief they were broken off, but you stand by your faith. Do not think too highly of yourself, but fear.
\v 21 For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.
