\v 15 God has rejected most of my fellow Jews because they refused to believe, with the result that he made peace between himself and other people in the world. If that is what happened after most of the Jews rejected Christ, think about the excellent things that will happen after they trust in him. It will be like they have risen from the realm of the dead!
\v 16 Just like the whole lump of dough will belong to God if people offer to God the bread baked from the first part of it, so the Jews will belong to God because their ancestors belonged to God. And just like the branches of a tree will belong to God if the root belongs to God, so the descendants of our great Jewish ancestors who belonged to God will also some day belong to God.

\v 15 For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead ones?
\v 16 If the firstfruits are reserved, so is the lump of dough. If the root is reserved, so are the branches.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world** - "For if because God rejected them, he will reconcile the rest of the world to himself"
  * **their rejection** - The pronoun "their" refers to Jewish unbelievers.
  * **the world** - Here "the world" is a metonym for the people who live in the world. AT: "the people in the world" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **what will their acceptance be but life from the dead ones?** - Paul asks this question to emphasize that when God accepts the Jews, it will be a wonderful thing. You can translate it in an active form. AT: "how will it be when God accepts them? It will be like they have come back to life from the dead ones!" or "then when God accepts them, it will be like they have died and become alive again!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **If the firstfruits are reserved, so is the lump of dough** - Paul is speaking of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the Israelites' ancestors, as if they were the first grain or "firstfruits" to be harvested. He is also speaking of the Israelites who are descendants of those men as if they were a "lump of dough" that they made from the grain. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **If the root is reserved, so are the branches** - Paul is speaking of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the Israelites' ancestors, as if they were the root of a tree, and the Israelites who are descendants of those men, as if they were the tree's "branches." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **reserved** - The people always dedicated to God the first crops that they harvested. Here "firstfruits" stands for the first people to believe in Christ. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
