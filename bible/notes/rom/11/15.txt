\v 15 God has rejected most of my fellow Jews because they refused to believe, with the result that he made peace between himself and many other people in the world. If that is what happened after most of the Jews rejected Christ, think about the excellent things that will happen after they trust in him. It will be like they have risen from the dead!
\v 16 Just like the whole lump of dough will belong to God if people offer to God the bread baked from the first part of it, so the Jews will belong to God because their ancestors belonged to God. And just like the branches of a tree will be good if the root is good, so the descendants of our great Jewish ancestors who belonged to God will also some day belong to God.

\v 15 For if the rejection of those is the reconciliation of the world, what will their reception be but life from the dead?
\v 16 If the firstfruit is holy, so is the lump of dough. If the root is holy, so are the branches.
