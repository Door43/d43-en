  * **For who has known the mind of the Lord?** - Paul uses this question to emphasize his point. You can translate this as a statement. AT: "No one has ever known what the Lord thinks" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **or who has become his advisor?** - Paul uses this question to emphasize his point. You can translate this as a statement. AT: "He does not need anyone to give him advice" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
