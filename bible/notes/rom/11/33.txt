===== translationNotes: =====


  * **Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God!** - Here "wisdom" and "knowledge" mean basically the same thing. AT: "How amazing are the many benefits of both God's wisdom and knowledge!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways beyond discovering** - "We are completely unable to understand the things that he has decided and find out the ways in which he acts toward us"
  * **For who has known the mind of the Lord or who has become his advisor?** - Paul uses this question to emphasize that no one is as wise as the Lord. You can translate this as a statement. AT: "No one has ever known the mind of the Lord, and no one has become his advisor." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the mind of the Lord** - Here "mind" is a metonym for knowing things or thinking about things. AT: "all that the Lord knows" or "what the Lord thinks about" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
