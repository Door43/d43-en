<usfm>
\v 30 For just as you were formerly disobedient to God, but now have received mercy because of their disobedience,
\v 31 so now these Jews have been disobedient, in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may now receive mercy.
\v 32 For God has shut up all into disobedience, in order that he might show mercy upon all.
