\v 6 But those whom God puts right with himself because they trust in Christâ€”to them Moses says, "No one should try to go to heaven," that is, in order to bring Christ down to us.
\v 7 Moses also says this to them: "No one should try to go down to where the dead are," that is, in order to bring Christ back from the dead for us.

\v 6 But the righteousness that comes from faith says this, "Do not say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?' (that is, to bring Christ down),
\v 7 or, 'Who will descend into the abyss?' (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.)"

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **But the righteousness that comes from faith says this**  - Here "righteousness" is described as a person that can speak. AT:  "But Moses writes this about how faith makes a person right before God" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification|Personification]])
  * **Do not say in your heart**  - Moses was addressing the people as though they were one person. AT: "Do not say to yourself" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you|Forms of 'You']])
  * **Who will ascend into heaven?**  - Moses uses a question to teach his audience. His previous instruction of, "Do not say" requires a negative answer to this question. AT: "No one should try to go up to heaven" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **that is, to bring Christ down**  - AT: "in order that they might have Christ come down to earth"
  * **Who will descend into the abyss**  - Moses uses a question to teach his audience. His previous instruction of, "Do not say" requires a negative answer to this question. AT: "No one should try to go down and enter the place where the spirits of dead persons are" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **that is, to bring Christ up from the dead**  - AT: "in order that they might bring Christ up from the dead"
  * **dead** - Here it means when the physical body of a person stops living.
