<usfm>
\v 11 It is written in the scriptures about the Christ, "Whoever believes in him will not be disappointed or ashamed."
\v 12 In this way, God treats the Jews and the non-Jews the same. Because he is the same Lord for all people who believe in him, he greatly helps all who ask him to help them.
\v 13 This is just like what the scriptures say: "The Lord God will save all those who ask him."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 For scripture says, "Everyone who believes on him will not be put to shame."
\v 12 For there is no difference between Jew and Greek. For the same Lord is Lord of all, and he is rich to all who call upon him.
\v 13 For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.

  * **For there is no difference between Jew and Greek** - Paul implies that God will treat all people the same. You can make this explicit in your translation. AT: "In this way, God treats the Jews and the non-Jews the same" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **he is rich to all who call upon him** - Here "he is rich" means that God blesses richly. You can make this explicit in your translation. AT: "he richly blesses all who trust in him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
