\v 11  It is written in the scriptures about the Christ, "Whoever believes in him will not be disappointed or ashamed."
\v 12 In this way, God treats the Jews and the non-Jews the same. Because he is the same Lord for all people who believe in him, he greatly helps all who ask him to help them.
\v 13 This is just like what the scriptures say: "The Lord God will save all those who ask him."
