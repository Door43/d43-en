\v 16  \add I would reply in this way to people who say such things: God has indeed sent people to preach the message about Christ\add*. But not all  \add the people of Israel\add* have paid attention to the good message! \add It is like what\add* Isaiah said  \add when he felt very discouraged\add*, "Lord, it seems as if hardly anyone believed what they heard us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* preach!\f + \ft Or: has anyone believed what they heard us\add ( exclusive )\add* preach? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*"
\v 17 So then, \add I tell you that people\add* are believing  \add in Christ\add* as a result of hearing  \add the message about him\add*, and people are hearing  \add the message\add* as a result of  \add people\add* preaching  \add about\add* Christ!

\v 16  I would reply in this way to people who say such things: God has indeed sent people to preach the message about Christ. But not all the people of Israel have paid attention to the Good News! It is like what Isaiah said when he felt very discouraged, "Lord, it seems as if hardly anyone believed what they heard us preach!"
\v 17 So then, I tell you that people are believing in Christ as a result of hearing the message about him, and people are hearing the message as a result of people preaching about Christ!

\v 16 But they did not all listen to the gospel. For Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed our message?"
\v 17 So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.
