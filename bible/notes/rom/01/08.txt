\v 8 First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ concerning all of you, because your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world.
\v 9 For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of his Son, of how continually I make mention of you,
\v 10 always in my prayers requesting that by any means at last I may be successful now by the will of God in coming to you.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the whole world**  - This is an exaggeration referring to the world they knew, which in their case would mean the Roman Empire. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole|Hyperbole]])
  * **For God is my witness**  - Paul emphasizes that he earnestly prays for them and that God has seen him praying. The word "for" is often left untranslated.
  * **in my spirit** - Here this means that a person's spirit is the part of him that can know God and believe in him.
  * **I make mention of you** - "I talk to God about you"
  * **always in my prayers requesting that...I may be successful...in coming to you** - AT: "every time I pray, I ask God that...I may succeed...in coming to visit you"
