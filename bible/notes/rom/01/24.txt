\v 24 So God allowed the non-Jews to do immoral sexual things that they strongly desired, things that they thought they had to do, because they wanted so much to do them. As a result, they began to dishonor each other's bodies by their sexual actions.
\v 25 Also, they chose to worship false gods instead of admitting what is true about God. They worshiped things that God created instead of worshiping him, the one who created everything, the one whom we should all praise forever! Amen.

\v 24 Therefore God gave them over to the lusts of their hearts for uncleanness, for their bodies to be dishonored among themselves—
\v 25 they who exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creation instead of the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.
