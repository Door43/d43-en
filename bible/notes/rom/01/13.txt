\v 13 My fellow believers, many times I planned to visit you. I certainly want you to know that. But I have not been able to come to you because something has always stopped me. I have wanted to come in order that more people among you might trust in Jesus, just as in other places among the non-Jews.
\v 14 I feel obliged to proclaim the good news to all non-Jewish people, to those who speak Greek and to those who do not, to people who are educated and to those who are uneducated.
\v 15 As a result, what I have eagerly desired is that I might proclaim this good news to you who are living in Rome also.

\v 13 Now I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that often I intended to come to you—and was hindered until now—that I might have some fruit among you just as there was among the rest of the Gentiles.
\v 14 I am debtor both to Greeks and to foreigners, both to the wise and to the foolish.
\v 15 So, as for me, I am ready to proclaim the gospel also to you who are in Rome.
