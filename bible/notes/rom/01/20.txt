====== Romans 01:20-21 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 \add People\add* cannot see what God is like. But ever since he created the world, by means of what he created he has clearly revealed what he is like. He has made clear to everyone that he has always been able to do very powerful deeds. \add Therefore, we should recognize that\add* he is God, \add completely different from all that he created\add*. So no one has a basis for saying\add , "We never knew about God\add*."
\v 21 Although \add the non-Jews\add* knew what God \add is like\add*, they did not honor him as God, nor did they thank \add him for what he had done\add*. But instead, they began to think foolish \add things about him\add*, and they became unable to understand \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add what he wanted them to know\add*.

\v 20 People cannot actually see with their eyes what God is like. But ever since he created the world, the things in it make us understand things about him—for example, he has always been able to do powerful things. Another example is that everyone knows that he is completely different from all that he has created. So no one is able to say truthfully, "We never knew about God."
\v 21 Although non-Jews knew what God is like, they did not honor him as God, nor did they thank him for what he had done. But instead, they began to think foolish things about him, and they were no longer able to understand what he wanted them to know about himself.

<usfm>
\v 20 For the unseen things about him have been clearly visible since the creation of the world, being understood by the created things—that is, his everlasting power and divine nature, so that they are without excuse.
\v 21 Because, although knowing about God, they did not glorify him as God, nor give thanks, but became foolish in their thoughts, and their senseless heart was darkened.
