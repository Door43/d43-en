\v 26 So God allowed the non-Jews to do shameful sexual things that they strongly desired. As a result, many women began having sexual relations with other women—something that goes against nature.
\v 27 Similarly, many men stopped having natural sexual relations with women. Instead, they had sexual relations with other men—something that is shameful to do. They committed homosexual acts with other men, acts that were shameful. As a result, God has punished them by sicknesses in their bodies, which is what they deserve because they thought that God would not punish them for doing that.

\v 26 Because of this, God gave them over to dishonorable passions, for their women exchanged their natural functions for that which is against nature.
\v 27 Likewise, the males also left their natural function with woman and burned in their lust for one another, males doing with males what is inappropriate, and receiving in themselves the penalty that was due their perversion.
