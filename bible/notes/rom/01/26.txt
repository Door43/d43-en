\v 26 Because of this, God gave them over to dishonorable passions, for their women exchanged their natural functions for that which is against nature.
\v 27 Likewise, the males also left their natural function with women and burned in their lust for one another, males doing with males what is inappropriate, and receiving in themselves the penalty that was due their perversion.
