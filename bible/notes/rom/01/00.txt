=== Structure and formatting ===

The first verse is a type of introduction and was typical of a letter in the ancient Mediterranean region. Sometimes this is called a "salutation." 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== The gospel ==
This chapter refers to the contents of the book of Romans as, "the gospel" ([[:en:bible:notes:rom:01:01|1:2]]). Romans is not a gospel like Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. Instead, chapters 1-8 are a presentation of the biblical gospel: Jesus died for the sins of mankind and was raised again as proof of eternal life for those who believe in him. 

== Fruit ==
The imagery of fruit is used in this chapter. The image of fruit usually refers to person's faith producing acts of righteousness in their life. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:fruit]], [[:en:obe:kt:faith]] and [[:en:obe:kt:righteous]])

== Universal Condemnation and the Wrath of God==
This chapter explains that the whole world is without excuse and has enough knowledge to seek after and believe in the true God, Yahweh. Because of man's sin and depravity, all of mankind is deserving of a punishment of death to appease the wrath of God. This wrath was satisfied by the death of Jesus. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:believe]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== "God gave them over" ==
Many scholars view the phrases "God gave them over" and "God gave them up" as theologically significant. For this reason, it is can be important to translate these phrases with God playing a passive role in the action. God simply allows man to pursue their own desires, he does not force them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Difficult phrases and concepts ==

There are many abstract concepts in this chapter and Paul's personal style makes many of the phrases in this chapter difficult to translate. The translator may need to use the UDB to understand the meaning of the phrases and it may be necessary to use more freedom in translating these phrases. The difficult phrases include: "obedience of faith," "whom I serve in my spirit," "from faith to faith" and "exchanged the glory of the imperishable God for the likenesses of an image of perishable man."
