===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Paul**  - “From Paul.” Your language may have a particular way of introducing the author of a letter. This could be translated as “I, Paul, wrote this letter.” You may also need to tell who the letter is to ([[:en:bible:notes:rom:01:01|1:7]], see UDB).
  * **called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God**  - This could be translated as a new sentence and with active verbs. AT: "God called me to be an apostle and chose me to tell people about the gospel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **called** - Here this means that God has appointed or chosen people to be his children, to be his servants and proclaimers of his message of salvation through Jesus
  * **he promised before by his prophets in the holy scriptures**  - God promised his people that he would set up his kingdom. He told the prophets to write these promises in the scriptures.
  * **concerning his Son**  - This refers to "the gospel of God," the good news that God was to send his Son into the world.
  * **who was born out of the descendants of David according to the flesh**  - Here the word "flesh" refers to the physical body. AT: "who is a descendant of David according to the physical nature" or "who was born into the family of David"
