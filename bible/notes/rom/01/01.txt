===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Paul**  - “From Paul.” Your language may have a particular way of introducing the author of a letter. This could be translated as “I, Paul, wrote this letter.” You may also need to tell who the letter is to ([[:en:bible:notes:rom:01:01|1:7]], see UDB).
  * **called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God**  - This could be translated as a new sentence and with active verbs: "God called me to be an apostle and chose me to tell people about the gospel. " (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **called** - This word has several meanings as a Key Term. This is the one most appropriate for this verse: "The term “called” is used in the Bible to mean that God has appointed or chosen people to be his children, to be his servants and proclaimers of his message of salvation through Jesus."
  * **he promised before by his prophets in the holy scriptures**  - God promised his people that he would set up his kingdom. He told the prophets to write these promises in the scriptures.
