===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Paul** - Your language may have a particular way of introducing the author of a letter. You may also need to tell in this same verse who the people are to whom Paul wrote the letter ([[:en:bible:notes:rom:01:07|1:7]]). AT: "I, Paul, wrote this letter" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicitinfo]])
  * **called to be an apostle, and set apart for the gospel of God** - You can translate this in an active form. AT: "God called me to be an apostle and chose me to tell people about the gospel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **called** - This means that God has appointed or chosen people to be his children, to be his servants and proclaimers of his message of salvation through Jesus.
  * **This is the gospel that he promised beforehand by his prophets in the holy scriptures** - God promised his people that he would set up his kingdom. He told the prophets to write these promises in the Scriptures.
  * **It is about his Son** - This refers to "the gospel of God," the good news that God promised to send his Son into the world. 
  * **Son** - This is an important title for Jesus, the Son of God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **who was born from the descendants of David according to the flesh** - Here the word "flesh" refers to the physical body. AT: "who is a descendant of David according to the physical nature" or "who was born into the family of David" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicitinfo]])
