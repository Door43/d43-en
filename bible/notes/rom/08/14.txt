\v 14 We who obey the Spirit of God are God's children.
\v 15 This is because you have received from God a Spirit who does not make you fear God again. You are not like slaves who fear their masters. On the contrary, this Spirit has made us God's children. The Spirit now enables us to cry out to God, "You are my Father!"
