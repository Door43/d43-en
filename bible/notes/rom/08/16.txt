\v 16 The Spirit himself confirms what our spirits say, that we are God's children.
\v 17 Because we are God's children, we also will one day receive what God has promised us. And we will also receive what God has promised us and Christ together. But we must suffer for doing good as Christ did, in order that God may honor us.

<usfm>
\v 16 The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God.
\v 17 If children, then also heirs, heirs of God on the one hand, and joint heirs on the other hand with Christ, if indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him.
