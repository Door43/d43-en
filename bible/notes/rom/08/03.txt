\v 3 What \add we\add* could not do \add by trying to obey\add* the laws \add of God\add* \f + \ft personification \f*, because our self-directed nature was too weak \add to obey them\add*, God did. He sent his own Son \add into the world in order that his Son might atone\add* for our sin. His Son came having a body \f + \ft Or: human nature \f* that was like \add the body\add* \f + \ft Or: the \add human nature\add* \f* of us people who sin. \add By sending his Son in this way\add*, he condemned and punished \add his Son, who never sinned, instead of punishing us, who\add* sinned \f + \ft metonymy \f*. He did that \add by making his Son's\add* body \add a sacrifice\add* \f + \ft Or: \add by causing his Son's\add* body \add to suffer\f + \ft Or: die \f*\add* \f* for \add all our\add* sin.
\v 4 So we can \add now\add* fulfill all that God required in his laws. We do this, not by our acting the way our sinful human nature \add desires\add*, but instead by living as \add God's\add* Spirit \add desires us to live\add*.
\v 5 People who live according to what their self-directed nature \add desires\add* think about and are concerned about what their self-directed nature \add desires\add*. But people who \add live\add* according to what \add God's\add* Spirit \add desires think about and are concerned about\add* what \add God's\add* Spirit \add desires\add*.

\v 3 What we could not do by trying to obey the laws of God  for all our sin.
\v 4 So we can now fulfill all that God required in his laws. We do this, not by our acting the way our sinful human nature desires, but instead by living as God's Spirit desires us to live.
\v 5 People who live according to what their self-directed nature desires think about and are concerned about what their self-directed nature desires. But people who live according to what God's Spirit desires think about and are concerned about what God's Spirit desires.

\v 3 For what the law was unable to do in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh.
\v 4 In order that the requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.
\v 5 For they whoare according to the flesh are mindful of the things of the flesh, but they who are according the Spirit the things of the Spirit.
