\v 35 Absolutely no one and nothing can cause Christ to stop loving us! Even if someone afflicts us, or even someone harms us, or even if we have nothing to eat, or even if we do not have enough clothes, or even if we live in a dangerous situation, or even if someone will kill us.
\v 36 Such things may happen to us, just as it is written that David said to God, "Because we are your people, others repeatedly attempt to kill us. They consider that we are only people to be killed, like a butcher considers that sheep are only animals to be slaughtered."

\q We were considered as sheep for the slaughter."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Who will separate us from the love of Christ?** - This question seems to ask about a person, but the following question presents events, not persons. So Paul is perhaps speaking of events as if they were people. AT: "No one will ever be able to separate us from the love of Christ!" or "Nothing will ever be able to separate us from the love of Christ!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]]).
  * **Tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or hunger, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?** -  The words "shall separate us from the love of Christ" are understood from the previous question. Paul uses this question to emphasize that even these things cannot separate us from the love of Christ. AT: "Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or hunger, or nakedness, or danger, or sword separate us from the love of Christ?" or "Even tribulation, distress, persecution, hunger, nakedness, danger, and sword cannot separate us from the love of Christ." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or hunger, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?** - The abstract nouns can be expressed with verb phrases. Here "sword" is a metonym that represents being killed violently. AT: "Even if people cause us trouble, hurt us, take away our clothes and food, or kill us, they cannot separate us from the love of Christ." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Tribulation, or distress** - These words both mean the same thing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **For your benefit** - Here "your" is singular and refers to God. AT: "For you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **we are killed all day long** - Here "we" refers to the one who wrote this part of Scripture, but not his audience, who was God. The phrase "all day long" is an exaggeration to emphasize how much danger they are in. Paul uses this part of Scripture to show that all who belong to God should expect difficult times. This can be translated in an active form. AT: "our enemies continually seek to kill us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **We were considered as sheep for the slaughter** - Here Paul compares to livestock those whom people kill because they are loyal to God. You can translate this in an active form. AT: "Our lives have no more value to them than the sheep they kill" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
