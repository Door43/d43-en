\v 23 Not only \add do those things groan\add*, but we ourselves also groan inwardly.

We groan while we wait eagerly for the time when we will receive our \add full\add* rights as God's adopted children. That \add will include\add* his freeing our bodies \add from the things that hinder us on earth. He will do this by giving us new bodies\add*.
\v 24 Ever since we were saved \f + \ft Or:since \add God\add* saved us \f*, we have continued to confidently expect \add that future glory\add*. If we had what we waited for, we would not \add need to\add* wait for it any longer, because those who have something, certainly do not continue to wait for it!\f + \ft Or: will they continue to wait for it? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 25 But because we keep waiting expectantly to receive what we do not yet have, we wait for it eagerly and patiently\f + \ft Or: perseveringly \f*.

\v 23 Not only do those things groan, but we ourselves also groan inwardly. We who have God's Spirit, who is like a partial gift we have received as we wait for everything that God will give us, we groan inwardly. We groan while we wait eagerly for the time when we will receive our full rights as God's adopted children. That will include his freeing our bodies from the things that hinder us on earth. He will do this by giving us new bodies.
\v 24 For God saved us because we had confidence in him. If we had now the things for which we have been waiting, we would not need to wait for them any longer. After all, if you possess something that you have been expecting to get, you certainly do not need to wait for it any longer.
\v 25 But because we keep waiting expectantly to receive what we do not yet have, we wait for it eagerly and patiently.

<usfm>
\v 23 Not only that, but even we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spiritâ€”even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for our adoption, the redemption of our body.
\v 24 For in this certain hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he can see? 
\v 25 But if we have certain hope about what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **who have the firstfruits of the Spirit** - Paul compares believers' receiving the Holy Spirit to the firstfruits and vegetables of the season to grow. This emphasizes that the Holy Spirit is only the beginning of what God will give to believers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **waiting for our adoption, the redemption of our body** - Here "our adoption" means when we become full members of God's family, as adopted children. The word "redemption" means when God saves us. AT: "waiting for when we are fully members of God's family and he saves our bodies from decay and death" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For in this certain hope we were saved** - You can translate this in an active form. AT: "For God saved us because we hoped in him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **But what we are confident will happen has not yet been seen, for who confidently waits for what he already sees?** - Paul uses a question to help his audience understand what "confidence" is. AT: "But if we are confidently waiting, that means we do not yet have what we want. No one can confidently wait if he already has what he wants" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
