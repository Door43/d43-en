===== TFT: =====

<usfm> \v 17 So, it is not that I do \add evil things because I wish to do them\add*. Instead, \add I do sinful things because the desire to\add* sin \add causes me to do them\add*. The \add desire to\add* sin in within\f + \ft Or: permeates \f* me \f + \ft personification \f*. \v 18 I know that my self-directed nature will not \add let me\add* \f + \ft personification \f* \add do\add* anything that is good. I know this because I want \add to do what is good\add*, but I do not do what is good. </usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 17 So, it is not because I wish to sin that I sin. Instead, I sin because the desire to sin causes me to sin. \v 18 I know that by myself, I can do nothing good. I know this because I want to do what is good, but I do not do what is good. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 17 But now it is no longer I who do it, but the sin that lives in me. \v 18 For I know that in me, that is in my flesh, lives no good thing. For the desire for good is present with me, but I cannot do it. </usfm>

  * **in my flesh**  - Paul is speaking of his sinful human nature that desires to sin.
