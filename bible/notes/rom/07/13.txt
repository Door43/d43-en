\p
\v 13 Then did what is good become death to me? May it never be. But sin in order that it might be shown to be sin through what is good, brought about death in me, This was in order that through the commandment sin might become sinful beyond measure.
\v 14 For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am of the flesh. I have been sold under slavery to sin.
