===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 In my new nature, I am very happy about the Law of God.
\v 23 Nevertheless, I sense that there is a different power that is in my body. It is opposed to what with my mind I desire to do, and it makes me do what my old sinful nature wants me to do.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 For I rejoice in the Law of God with the inner man.
\v 23 But I see a different principle in my body parts, warring against that new principle in my mind, and taking me captive by the principle of sin which is in my body parts.
