====== Romans 07 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

== "Or do you not know" ==
This phrase is used to mark the narrative and shifts the topic of the discussion. It connects this discussion with the previous teaching. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "We have been released from the law" ==
Paul explains that the Law of Moses is no longer in effect. While this is true, the principles behind the Law are a reflection of the character of God and are timeless. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|Law of Moses]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Marriage ==
Marriage is a common metaphor used in Scripture. Here it is used to describe the church's relationship to the Law of Moses. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Flesh ==
This is a complex issue and it is possible that "flesh" is a metaphor for a person's sinful nature. It is not the physical part of man that is sinful and it appears Paul is teaching that while man remains alive ("in the flesh"), he will remain sinful regardless of his effort, but his new nature will be fighting against his old nature. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:flesh|Flesh]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sinful]])
