====== Romans 07:11-12 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 \add My desire to\add* sin found a way \f + \ft personification \f* to deceive me \add by making me think wrongly that\add* I could keep \add on sinning and at the same time obey\add* those laws \add enough so that I would live eternally\add*, and \add thus it\add* caused me to be separated from God \f + \ft personification \f*.
\v 12 So \add we conclude that\add* the laws \add that God gave to Moses\add* are holy. What God commanded \add about not coveting, along with all the other things that he commanded\add*, is also holy, and it is just and good.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 When I wanted to sin, I thought that I would live forever if I obeyed the Law enough. But I was mistaken: I thought I could keep sinning at the same time. In fact, God was going to separate me from him forever because I did not truly obey the Law.
\v 12 So we know that the Law that God gave to Moses is perfectly good. Everything that God commands us to do is also holy, just, and good.

\v 11 For sin, taking the opportunity through the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment it killed me.
\v 12 Therefore the Law is holy, and the commandment holy, righteous, and good.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **sin...deceived me, and...killed me.**  - As in [[:en:bible:notes:rom:07:07|7:7-8]], Paul is viewing sin as though it were a person who could act. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:personification]])
  * **taking the opportunity through the commandment**  - When God commands us not to do something, it is because we have been told not to do it that we want to do it more. Translate this the same way you translated it in [[:en:bible:notes:rom:07:07|7:8]].​
  * **through the commandment it killed me**  - "because I disobeyed God's commandments, I died spiritually"
