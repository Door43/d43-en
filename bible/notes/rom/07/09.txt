\v 10 and \add I realized that\add* I was separated from God. The laws that \add I thought would enable me to\add* live \add eternally as a result of my obeying them\add* caused me \add to realize that\add* I was separated from God!

\v 9 Formerly, when I did not know what God's Law required, I used to sin without worrying about what I was doing. But when I became aware that God had given us his Law, I suddenly realized that I was sinning,
\v 10 and I realized that I was apart from God. The Law that was supposed to allow me to live forever, if I obeyed it, was leading me to die instead.
