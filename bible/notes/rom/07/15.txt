\v 15 The things that I do, I often do not understand. That is, sometimes it is the good things that I want to do that I do not do. And sometimes it is the evil things that I detest that I do.
\v 16 Since I do the evil things that I do not want to do, I agree that the law of God directs me in the right way.

\v 15 For what I do, I do not really understand. For what I want to do, I do not do, and what I hate, I do.
\v 16 But if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law that the law is good.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul talks about the struggle inside his inner man between his flesh and the law of God—between sin and good.

  * **For what I do, I do not really understand** - "I am not sure why I do some of the things that I do"
  * **For** - "because"
  * **what I want to do, I do not do** - The words "I do not do" are an exaggeration to emphasize that Paul does not do what he wants to do as often as he would like too or that he does what he does not want to do too often. AT: "I do not always do what I want to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]]) 
  * **what I hate, I do** - The words "I do," which implies that he always does what he hates to do, are an exaggeration to emphasize that Paul does what he does not want to do too often. AT: "the things that I know are not good are the things that I sometimes do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **But** - "However"
  * **I agree with the law** - "I know God's law is good"
