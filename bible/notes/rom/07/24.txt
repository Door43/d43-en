\v 25 I thank God that it is by Jesus Christ our Lord that he sets us free from the control of what our bodies desire. So with our minds, I on the one hand want to obey God's law. But also, I often let our sinful desires control me because of my old sinful attitude.

\v 24 I am a miserable man! Who will deliver me from this body of death?
\v 25 But thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind. However, with the flesh I serve the principle of sin.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Who will deliver me from this body of death?** - Paul uses this question to express great emotion. If your language has a way of showing great emotion through an exclamation or a question, use it here. AT: "I want someone to set me free from the control of what my body desires!"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **this body of death** - This is a metaphor that means a body that will experience physical death. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **But thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord** - This is the answer to the question in 7:24.
  * **So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind. However, with the flesh I serve the principle of sin** - The mind and flesh are used here to show how they compare to serve either God's law or the principle of sin. With the mind or intellect one can choose to please and obey God and with the flesh or physical nature to serve sin. AT: "My mind chooses to please God, but my flesh chooses to obey sin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
