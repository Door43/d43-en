\v 8 That means that it is not all the natural-born descendants \add of Abraham\add* whom God\add considers as\add* his children. Instead it is those who were born as a result of \add believing what God\add* promised whom \add he\add* considers to be his children.
\v 9 \add You know that what God\add* promised \add to Abraham\add* was this: "About this time \add next year\add* Sarah \add your wife\add* will bear a son \add as a result of my enabling\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add her\add*." \add So Abraham knew that it was not through Ishmael, the son that he already had, that God would fulfill what he had promised him\add* \f + \ft Or: \add that his true descendants would come\add* \f*.

\v 8 What I mean is, not all of Abraham's descendants are the people that God as his own children. Instead, only the people that God had in mind when he promised to give Abraham descendantsâ€”it is these people whom he considers to be Abraham's true descendants and his own children.
\v 9 This is what God promised Abraham: "About this time next year I will come back to you, and Sarah your wife will bear a son." God promised this, and he made it happen.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 That is, the children of the flesh are not the children of God. But the children of the promise are counted as descendants.
\v 9 For this is the word of promise: "At this time I will come, and a son will be given to Sarah."
