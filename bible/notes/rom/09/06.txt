\v 6 \add God promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that their descendants would all inherit his blessings\add*. But \add although most of my fellow Israelites have rejected Christ\add*, that does not \add prove\add* that God has failed \add to do\add* the things that he promised, because it is not all who are descended from Jacob and who \add call themselves the people of\add* Israel whom \add God considers\add* to be truly his people.
\v 7 And it is also not all of Abraham's natural descendants that \add God considers\add* to be his people. Instead, \add God considers only some of them to be Abraham's children\add*. \add This agrees with what God told Abraham\add*: "It is Isaac, \add not any of your\f + \ft singular \f* other sons\add*, whom \add I\add* will consider \add to be the true father of\add* your descendants."

\v 6 But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For they are not all Israel, who are of Israel.
\v 7 Neither, because they are Abraham’s seed, are they all children. But In Isaac will your descendants be called.
