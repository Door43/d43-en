\v 6 \add God promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that their descendants would all inherit his blessings\add*. But \add although most of my fellow Israelites have rejected Christ\add*, that does not \add prove\add* that God has failed \add to do\add* the things that he promised, because it is not all who are descended from Jacob and who \add call themselves the people of\add* Israel whom \add God considers\add* to be truly his people.
\v 7 And it is also not all of Abraham's natural descendants that \add God considers\add* to be his people. Instead, \add God considers only some of them to be Abraham's children\add*. \add This agrees with what God told Abraham\add*: "It is Isaac, \add not any of your\f + \ft singular \f* other sons\add*, whom \add I\add* will consider \add to be the true father of\add* your descendants."

\v 6 God promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that their descendants would all inherit his blessings. But although most of my fellow Israelites have rejected Christ, that does not prove that God has failed to do the things that he promised. For it is not all people who are descended from Jacob and who call themselves the people of Israel whom God considers to be truly his people.
\v 7 And it is also not all of Abraham's natural descendants that God considers to be Abraham's true descendants. Instead, God considers only some of them to be Abraham's true descendants. This agrees with what he told Abraham: "It is Isaac, not any of your other sons, whom I will consider to be the true father of your descendants."

\v 6 But it is not as though the promises of God had failed. For it is not everyone in Israel who truly belongs to Israel.
\v 7 Neither are all Abraham's descendants truly his children. But, "It is through Isaac that your descendants will be designated."
