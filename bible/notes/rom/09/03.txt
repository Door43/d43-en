\v 3 I personally would be willing to let God curse me and, as a result, be separated from Christ if that would help my fellow Israelites, my natural kinsmen, to believe in Christ.
\v 4 We Jews are Israelites, God's chosen descendants of Jacob. God has always considered us as his children . It was to our ancestors that he used to appear gloriously while they were in the desert. It was with them that God made covenants several times. It was to them that God gave the laws at Mount Sinai. They were the ones to whom God showed how they should worship him. They were the ones to whom God promised many things, especially that the Messiah would come from their race.
\v 5 It was our ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, whom God chose to found our nation. And, most importantly, it was from us Israelites that the Messiah received his human nature. Nevertheless, most of my fellow Israelites have rejected Christ, who is the one who controls all things! He is God, the one who is worthy that we praise him forever! This is true!

\v 3 For I could wish that I myself accursed from Christ in behalf of my brethers, my relatives according to the flesh,
\v 4 who are Israelites. Whose is the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises.
\v 5 Whose are the fathers, and from whom is Christ with respect to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.
