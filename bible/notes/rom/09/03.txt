\v 4 We \add Jews\add* are \add Israelites, God's chosen\add* descendants of \add Jacob\add*. \add God has always considered\add* us as his children \f + \ft metaphor \f*. It was to our ancestors \add that he used to appear\add* gloriously \add while they were in the desert\add*. It was with them that \add God made\add* covenants \add several times\add*. It was to them \add that God\add* gave the laws \add at Mount Sinai\add*. They were the ones \add to whom God showed how they should\add* worship him.

\v 3 I personally would be willing to let God curse me and, keep me apart from Christ forever if that would help my fellow Israelites, my natural kinsmen, to believe in Christ.
\v 4 They, like me, are Israelites. They are among those whom God chose to be Jacob's descendants. God has always considered them to be his children. It was to their ancestors that he showed how powerful he is. It was with them that he made covenants several times. It was to them that he gave the Law on Mount Sinai. They were the ones whom God allowed to worship him. They were the ones to whom God promised many things, especially that the Christ would come from their race.
\v 5 It was our ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, whom God chose to begin our nation. And, most importantly, it was from us Israelites that the Christ was born as a human being. He is God, the one who is worthy that we praise him forever! This is true!
