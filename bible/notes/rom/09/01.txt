===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **my conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit,**  - This phrase can be made into a separate sentence: "The Holy Spirit controls my conscience and confirms what I say"
  * **that for me there is great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart.**  - This can be a separate sentence. AT: "I tell you that I grieve very greatly and deeply." If the person for whom Paul grieves needs to be stated, follow UDB.
  * **great sorrow and unceasing pain** - These two expressions mean basically the same thing. Paul uses them together to emphasize how great his emotions are. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
