\v 27 Isaiah also exclaimed concerning the Israelites:
\q Even though the Israelites are \add so many that no one can count them, like\add* sand \add particles beside\add* the ocean, \add only\add* the small part of them will be saved \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* will save \add only\add* the small part of them \f*,
\v 28 because the Lord will punish completely and speedily the \add people who live in that\add* land, as he said that he would do.
\p
\v 29 \add Also, we can understand from what the prophet\add* Isaiah said\add that God would not save\add* anyone if he did not show mercy,
\q If the Lord, who controls everything in heaven, had not mercifully allowed some of our descendants to survive, we would have become like the people of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, who were \f + \ft simile, doublet \f* completely destroyed.

\v 27 Isaiah cries out concerning Israel, 
\q "Though the number of the children of Israel were as the sand of the sea, 
\q it will be a remnant that will be saved,
\q
\v 28 for the Lord will carry out his sentence on the earth, 
\q completely and without delay."
\q 	 
\v 29 As Isaiah had said previously,
\q "If the Lord of hosts had not left us descendants,
\q we would be like Sodom,
\q and we would have become like Gomorrah."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **cries out** - "calls out"
  * **as the sand of the sea** - Here Paul compares the number of the people of Israel to the number of grains of sand in the sea. AT: "too many to count" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **will be saved** - Paul uses the word "saved" in a spiritual sense. If God saves a person, it means that through believing in Jesus' death on the cross, God has forgiven him and rescued him from being punished for his sin. You can translate this in an active form. AT: "God will save" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) 
  * **the Lord will carry out his sentence on the earth** - Here "sentence" refers to how he has decided to punish people. AT: "the Lord will punish people on the earth according to how he has said" 
  * **us ... we** - Here the words "us" and "we" refer to Isaiah and include the Israelites. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
  * **we would be like Sodom, and we would have become like Gomorrah"** - You can make more explicit how the Israelites would have been like Sodom and Gomorrah. You can also translate this in an active form. AT: "God would have destroyed all of us, like he destroyed the cities of Sodom and Gommorah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
