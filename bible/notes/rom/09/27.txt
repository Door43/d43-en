\v 27 Isaiah also exclaimed concerning the Israelites:
\q Even though the Israelites are \add so many that no one can count them, like\add* sand \add particles beside\add* the ocean, \add only\add* the small part of them will be saved \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* will save \add only\add* the small part of them \f*,
\v 28 because the Lord will punish completely and speedily the \add people who live in that\add* land, as he said that he would do.
\p
\v 29 \add Also, we can understand from what the prophet\add* Isaiah said\add that God would not save\add* anyone if he did not show mercy,
\q If the Lord, who controls everything in heaven, had not mercifully allowed some of our descendants to survive, we would have become like the people of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, who were \f + \ft simile, doublet \f* completely destroyed.

\v 27 Isaiah cries out concerning Israel, "If the number of the children of Israel were as the sand of the sea, it is a remnant that will be saved.
\v 28 For the Lord will carry out his word on the earth, soon and completely.
\v 29 And it is as Isaiah said before,
\q "If the Lord of Hosts had not left behind for us descendants,
\q we would have become like Sodom, 
\q and have been made like Gomorrah.
