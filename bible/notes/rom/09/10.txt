\v 10 And not only then did God show \add that he did not determine who would be his true children according to who their ancestors were. He showed it again\add* when Rebecca conceived \add twins\add* by our ancestor Isaac.
\v 11-12 Before \add the twins, Jacob and Esau\add*, were born, when neither one had yet done anything good or bad, \add God\add* said to Rebecca \add about the twins she was to bear\add*, "The older one shall later serve the younger one, \add contrary to normal custom\add*." \add God said this\add* in order that \add we\add* might \add clearly\add* understand that what he purposed \add for people\add* was according to what he himself determined. That is, people's \add eternal destiny\add* does not depend on what they do. Instead, their destiny depends on \add God\add*, the one who chooses them.
\v 13 And \add this teaching is\add* \add supported\f + \ft Or: shown to be true\add* \f* \add by\add* what is written \add in the Scriptures\add* \f + \ft Or:what \add a prophet\add* recorded \f* \add that God said\add*: "I favored Jacob, \add the younger son\add*. I did not favor \f + \ft hyperbole \f* Esau, \add the older son\add*."

\v 10 It was similar with Rebecca, the wife of Isaac, Abraham's son, when Rebecca conceived twins.
\v 11 Before the twins, Jacob and Esau, were born,
\v 12 when neither one had yet done anything good or bad, God said to Rebecca, "The older one will serve the younger one, contrary to normal custom." God said this in order that we might know this: that when he plans to do something, he chooses the people because he wants to choose them, not because they have done anything for him.
\v 13 It is just what God said in the scriptures: “I chose Jacob, the younger son. I rejected Esau, the older son."

<usfm>
\v 10 But not only this, but after Rebecca also had conceived by one man, our father Isaac—
\v 11 for the children were not yet born, neither having yet done anything good or bad, so that the purpose of God according to choice might stand, not because of actions, but because of him who calls—
\v 12 it was said to her, "The older will serve the younger."
\v 13 It is just as had been written: "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated."
