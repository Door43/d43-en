\v 10 And not only then did God show \add that he did not determine who would be his true children according to who their ancestors were. He showed it again\add* when Rebecca conceived \add twins\add* by our ancestor Isaac.
\v 11-12 Before \add the twins, Jacob and Esau\add*, were born, when neither one had yet done anything good or bad, \add God\add* said to Rebecca \add about the twins she was to bear\add*, "The older one shall later serve the younger one, \add contrary to normal custom\add*." \add God said this\add* in order that \add we\add* might \add clearly\add* understand that what he purposed \add for people\add* was according to what he himself determined. That is, people's \add eternal destiny\add* does not depend on what they do. Instead, their destiny depends on \add God\add*, the one who chooses them.
\v 13 And \add this teaching is\add* \add supported\f + \ft Or: shown to be true\add* \f* \add by\add* what is written \add in the Scriptures\add* \f + \ft Or:what \add a prophet\add* recorded \f* \add that God said\add*: "I favored Jacob, \add the younger son\add*. I did not favor \f + \ft hyperbole \f* Esau, \add the older son\add*."

\v 10 It was similar with Rebecca, the wife of Isaac, Abraham's son, when Rebecca conceived twins.
\v 11 Before the twins, Jacob and Esau, were born,
\v 12 the children had not yet done anything good or bad, God said to Rebecca, "The older one will serve the younger one, contrary to normal custom." God said this in order that we might know this: that when he plans to do something, he chooses the people because he wants to choose them, not because they have done anything for him.
\v 13 It is just what God said in the scriptures: "I chose Jacob, the younger son. I rejected Esau, the older son."

\v 10 Not only this, but after Rebecca also had conceived by one man, our father Isaac—
\v 11 for the children were not yet born and had not yet done anything good or bad, so that the purpose of God according to choice might stand, not because of actions, but because of him who calls—
\v 12 it was said to her, "The older will serve the younger."
\v 13 It is just as had been written: "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated."

  * **our father Isaac ... It is just** - In your culture you may need to place 9:11 after 9:12 to make them easier to understand. AT: "our father Isaac, it was said to her, 'The older will serve the younger.' Now the children were not yet born ... because of him who calls. It is just"
  * **our father** - Paul refers to Isaac as "our father" because Isaac was the ancestor of Paul and of the Jewish believers in Rome. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
  * **conceived** - "became pregnant"
  * **for the children were not yet born and had not yet done anything good or bad** - "before the children were born and before they had done anything, whether good or bad"
  * **so that the purpose of God according to choice might stand** - "so that what God wants to happen according to His choice will happen"
  * **for the children were not yet born** - "before the children were born"
  * **had not yet done anything good or bad** - "not because of anything they had done"
  * **because of him** - because of God
  * **it was said to her, "The older will serve the younger."** - "God said to Rebecca, 'The older son will serve the younger son'"
  * **Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated** - God did not literally hate Esau, but he loved Jacob much more than he loved Esau. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
