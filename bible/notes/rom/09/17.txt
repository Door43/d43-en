\v 17 Moses recorded that God had told Pharaoh, â€œThis is why I made you king of Egypt: It was so I might fight against you and show everyone in the world how powerful I am."
\v 18 So we know that God kindly helps the ones he wants to act kindly towards. And we also know that he makes stubborn anyone who he wants to be stubborn, such as Pharaoh.

<usfm>
\v 17 For the scripture says to Pharaoh, "For this very purpose I raised you up, that I might demonstrate in you my power, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth."
\v 18 So then, he has mercy on whom he wishes, and whom he wishes, he makes stubborn.
