====== Romans 09:17-18 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 \add Moses\add* recorded \f + \ft personification \f* \add that God had told\add* Pharaoh, "This is why I gave you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* authority \f + \ft metonymy \f*: It was in order that I might show \add by how I oppose\add* you \add how exceedingly\add* powerful I am, and in order that people everywhere \f + \ft hyperbole \f* would hear about me \f + \ft metonymy \f*."
\v 18 So \add we conclude that God\add* kindly helps the ones he wants to act kindly towards. But he makes stubborn the ones \add such as Pharaoh\add* that he wants \add to make stubborn\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 Moses recorded that God had told Pharaoh, "This is why I made you king of Egypt: It was so I might fight against you and everyone in the world will help others respect my reputation."
\v 18 So we know that God kindly helps the ones he wants to act kindly toward. And we also know that he makes stubborn anyone who he wants to be stubborn, such as Pharaoh.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 For the scripture says to Pharaoh, "For this very purpose I raised you up, so that I might demonstrate my power in you, and so that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth."
\v 18 So then, God has mercy on whom he wishes, and whom he wishes, he makes stubborn.
