\v 19 Maybe one of you will say to me, "Because God determines ahead of time everything that people do, that also implies that he wants some of us to sin. No one has resisted what God has wished! Therefore, it is not right for God to punish those who sin."
\v 20 I would reply, "You are only a human being, so you have no right to criticize God! He is like a man who makes clay pots. A pot has no right to ask its maker, "Why did you make me like this?"
\v 21 Instead, the potter certainly has the right to take a lump of clay and use part of it to make a beautiful pot that people will value highlyâ€”and then use the rest of the clay for a pot that someone will use every day. Certainly God has the same right.

\v 19 You will say then to me, "Why does he still find fault? For who has ever withstood his will?"
\v 20 On the contrary, man, who are you who answers against God? Will what has been molded say to the one who molds it, "Why did you make me this way?"
\v 21 Does the potter not have the right over the clay to make from the same lump a container for special use, and another container for daily use?

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **You** - Paul is talking to the critics of his teaching as though his is talking to one person. You may need to use the plural here. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_youdual]])
    * **he...his** - These refer to God.
    * **Will what has been molded say...daily use?**  - Paul uses the potter's right to make any kind of container he wants from the clay as a metaphor for the creator's right to do whatever he wants with his creation. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
