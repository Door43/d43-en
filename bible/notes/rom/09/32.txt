====== Romans 09:32-33 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 32 The reason \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add that they did not succeed\add* is that they did not trust that \add God would provide a way to save them\add*. Instead, they were trying to do certain things \add in order that God would accept them. Because they did not expect the Messiah to die, the Israelites\add* felt disgusted concerning \add Jesus' death, which is like\add* the stone \f + \ft metaphor \f* on which people stumble.
\v 33 This is what \add a prophet\add* predicted when he wrote these words that\add God said about the Messiah\add*:
\q Listen! I am placing in Israel \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add one who is like\add* a stone \f + \ft metaphor \f* on which people will stumble. What he does will offend people \f + \ft doublet \f*. Nevertheless, those who believe in him will not be disappointed.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 32 They were not able to, because they tried to do things to please God. They refused to trust him to forgive them. They refused to believe in Christ, so they remained apart from God.
\v 33 This is what a prophet said would happen:
"Listen! I am placing in Israel one who is like a stone on which people will stumble. What he does will make people angry. Nevertheless, those who believe in him will not be ashamed."
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 32 Why not? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but by works. They stumbled over the stone of stumbling,
\v 33 as it has been written,
\q "Look, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense.
\q He who believes in it  will not be ashamed."
</usfm>
