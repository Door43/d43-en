\v 14 Someone might ask me, "Is God unjust by choosing only certain people?" I would reply, "He is certainly not unjust!"
\v 15 God told Moses, "I will pity and help anyone whom I choose!"
\v 16 So God chooses people, not because they want God to choose them or because they try hard to please him. Instead, he chooses people because he himself has mercy on undeserving ones.

\v 14 What then will we say? Is there unrighteousness with God? May it never be.
\v 15 For he says to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion."
\v 16 So then, it is not because of him who wills, nor because of him who runs, but because of God, who shows mercy.
