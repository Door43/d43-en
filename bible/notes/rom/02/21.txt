===== Translation Notes: =====

Paul continues his imaginary argument with a Jewish person, whom he scolds with rhetorical questions.

  * **if you therefore teach another, do you not teach yourself?**  - Paul is using a question to scold his listener. This could be translated as a new sentence: "But, you do not teach yourself while you are teaching others!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **You who preach not to steal, do you steal?**  - Paul is using a question to scold his listener. This could be translated as a new sentence: "You tell people not to steal, but you steal!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **You who say not to commit adultery, do you commit adultery?**  - Paul is using a question to scold his listener. This could be translated as a new sentence: "You tell people not to commit adultery, but you commit adultery!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **You who detest idols, do you rob temples?**  - Paul is using a question to scold his listener. This could be translated as a new sentence: "You say you hate idols, but you rob temples!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **rob temples**  - Possible meanings are: 1) "steal items from local pagan temples to sell and make a profit" or 2) "do not send to the Jerusalem temple all the money that is due to God" or 3) "joke about local gods."
