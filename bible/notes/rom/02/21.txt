\v 22 You who command people not to have sexual relations with someone to whom they are not married, it is disgusting that you commit adultery yourself! You who command others not to worship idols, it is disgusting that you do not avoid disgusting things.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Paul continues his imaginary argument with a Jewish person, whom he scolds with rhetorical questions.

  * **if you therefore teach another, do you not teach yourself?**  - Paul is using a question to scold his listener. This could be translated as a new sentence. AT: "But, you do not teach yourself while you are teaching others!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **You who preach not to steal, do you steal?**  - Paul is using a question to scold his listener. This could be translated as a new sentence. AT: "You tell people not to steal, but you steal!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **You who say not to commit adultery, do you commit adultery?**  - Paul is using a question to scold his listener. This could be translated as a new sentence. AT: "You tell people not to commit adultery, but you commit adultery!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **You who detest idols, do you rob temples?**  - Paul is using a question to scold his listener. This could be translated as a new sentence. AT: "You say you hate idols, but you rob temples!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **rob temples**  - Possible meanings are: 1) "steal items from local pagan temples to sell and make a profit" or 2) "do not send to the Jerusalem temple all the money that is due to God" or 3) "joke about local gods."
