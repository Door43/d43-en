\v 17 Now I have something to say to anyone of you Jews to whom I am writing: You trust that God will save you because you know the laws that he gave to Moses. You boast that you belong to God.
\v 18 You know what God desires. Because you have been taught God's laws, you are able to know which things are right and to choose to do them.
\v 19 You are certain that you are able to show God's truth to non-Jews, and that you can instruct those who know nothing about God.
\v 20 You are certain that you can instruct those who believe foolish things about God and those who are like children because they know nothing about him at all. You are certain about all this because you have the law that teaches you truly about God.

\p
\v 17 But if you call yourself a Jew and rest upon the law and boast in God,
\v 18 and know his will and approve of what is excellent because you have been instructed from the law;
\v 19 and if you are convinced that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,
\v 20 a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of little children, and that you have in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth, then how does this affect the way you live your life?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Here begins Paul's discussion that the law the Jews possess actually condemns them because they do not obey it.

  * **if you call yourself a Jew** - "since you call yourself a Jew"
  * **rest upon the law** - The phrase "rest upon the law" represents believing that they can become righteous by obeying the law. AT: "rely on the law of Moses" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **know his will** - "and know God's will"
  * **because you have been instructed from the law** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "because people have taught you what is right from the law" or "because you have learned from the law" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness** - Here "the blind" and "those who walk in darkness" represent people who do not understand the law. AT: "that because you teach the law, you yourself are like a guide to blind people, and you are like a light to people who are lost in the dark" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a corrector of the foolish** - "you correct those who do wrong"
  * **a teacher of little children** - Here Paul compares those who do not know anything about the law to very small children. AT: "and you teach those who do not know the law" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and that you have in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth** - The knowledge of the truth that is in the law comes from God. AT: "because you are sure you understand the truth that God has given in the law" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
