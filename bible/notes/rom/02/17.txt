\v 17  Now I have something to say to anyone of you Jews to whom I am writing: You trust that God will save you because you know the laws that he gave to Moses. You boast that you belong to God.
\v 18 You know what God desires. Because you have been taught God's laws, you are able to know which things are right and to choose to do them.
\v 19 You are certain that you are able to show  God's truth to non-Jews, and that you can instruct those who know nothing about God.
\v 20 You are certain that you can instruct those who believe foolish things about God and those who are like children because they know nothing about him at all. You are certain about all this because you have in the Law what teaches you truly about God.

\p
\v 17 If you call yourself a Jew, rest upon the law, rejoice proudly in God,
\v 18 know his will, and test the things that differ from it, having been instructed by the law—
\v 19 if you are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,
\v 20 a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babies, and that you have in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth—

===== Translation Notes: =====

Paul continues his imaginary argument with a Jewish person.

  * **If you call yourself a Jew** - This begins a new section of the letter. Here the word "if" does not mean Paul doubts or is unsure. He is emphasizing that these statement are true. AT: "Now you think of yourself as member of the Jewish people"
  * **rest upon the Law, rejoice proudly in God**  - AT: "and you rely on the Law of Moses and rejoice proudly because of God"
  * **know his will**  - This could be translated as a new sentence. AT: "And you know God's will"
  * **having been instructed by the Law**  - This could be translated with an active verb. AT: "because you understand what the Law of Moses teaches"
  * **if you are confident…and of the truth**  - If your language has a way to mark that 2:19-20 interrupts Paul's main argument of [[:en:bible:notes:rom:02:17|17, 18]], and [[:en:bible:notes:rom:02:21|21]], use it here. You might have to place 2:19-20 before 2:17.
  * **if you are confident**  - AT: "You are sure"
  * **that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness** - Both of these phrases mean basically the same thing. Paul compares a Jewish person teaching someone about the Law to helping a person that cannot see. AT: "that you yourself are like a guide to someone who is blind, and you are like a light to someone lost in the dark" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **a corrector of the foolish**  - This could be translated as a new sentence. AT: "You correct those who do wrong" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **a teacher of babies**  - Here Paul compares those who do not know anything about the Law to babies. AT: "and you teach those who do not know the Law" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **and that you have in the Law the form of knowledge and of the truth**  - AT: "because you are sure you understand the truth written in the Law"
