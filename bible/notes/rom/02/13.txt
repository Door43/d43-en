\v 13 It is right for God to punish them because it is not those who merely know God's laws whom he considers to be righteous. On the contrary, it is only those who continually have obeyed all of God's law whom God will consider righteous.
\v 14 Whenever the non-Jews, who do not have the law of God, freely obey those laws, they prove that they have a law within their own minds, even though they do not actually have the laws that God gave to Moses.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but it is the doers of the law who will be justified.
\v 14 For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature the things of the law, they, not having the law, are a law to themselves.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul continues to let the reader know that perfect obedience to God's law is required even for those who never had God's law.

  * **For** - If your language has a way to mark that verses 14 and 15 interrupt Paul's main argument to give the reader extra information, use it here. You may need to place 2:14-15 either before 2:13 or after 2:16. AT: "Because"
  * **it is not the hearers of the law** - AT: "it is not those who only hear the law of Moses"
  * **who are righteous before God** - AT: "that are pleasing to God"
  * **but it is the doers of the law** - AT: "but it is those who obey the law of Moses"
  * **who will be justified** - AT: "that God will accept" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **are a law to themselves** - AT: "have God's laws already inside them"
