\v 25 Any one of you who  \add is\add* circumcised  \add to show that he belong to God\add* can benefit from that if he obeys the laws  \add God gave to Moses\add*. But if you\add \f + \ft singular \f*, a circumcised person\add*, disobey  \add God's\add* laws, \add God will consider that\add* you who are circumcised are no better  \add in God's sight\add* than\add someone who is\add* not circumcised.
\v 26 This means that God will certainly consider that even  \add non-Jews who are\add* not circumcised can become his people if they obey the things that he commanded in his laws.\f + \ft Or: So will not God consider that even  \add non-Jews who are\add* not circumcised can ◄become his people, Or: become acceptable to him \f* if they obey the things that he commanded in his laws?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 27  \add If any one of\add* you disobeys God's laws, even though  \add you\f + \ft singular \f* have\add* the Scriptures and even though someone has circumcised you \f + \ft Or:you are circumcised \f* \add God will punish you\add*. And those people who are not circumcised, but who obey God's laws, \add will declare that God is right\add* when he says that he will punish you.

\v 25 Any one of you who is circumcised to show that he belong to God can benefit from that if he obeys the Law that he gave to Moses. But if you, a circumcised person, disobey the Law, God will consider you to be no better in God's sight than someone who is not circumcised.
\v 26 This means that God will certainly consider that even non-Jews who are not circumcised can become his people if they obey the things that he commanded in his laws.
\v 27 The people who are not circumcised but who obey God's laws, will declare that God is right when he punishes you, for you are circumcized but still break the Law.

<usfm>
\v 25 For circumcision indeed benefits you if you obey the Law, but if you are a violator of the Law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision.
\v 26 If, therefore, the uncircumcised person keeps the requirements of the Law, will not his uncircumcision be considered as circumcision?
\v 27 Will not the one who is by nature uncircumcised, if he fulfills the Law, judge you, who by the written Scriptures and circumcision are a violator of the Law?
