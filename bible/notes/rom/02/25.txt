But if you\add \f + \ft singular \f*, a circumcised person\add*, disobey  \add God's\add* laws, \add God will consider that\add* you who are circumcised are no better  \add in God's sight\add* than\add someone who is\add* not circumcised.
\v 26 This means that God will certainly consider that even  \add non-Jews who are\add* not circumcised can become his people if they obey the things that he commanded in his laws.\f + \ft Or: So will not God consider that even  \add non-Jews who are\add* not circumcised can ◄become his people, Or: become acceptable to him \f* if they obey the things that he commanded in his laws?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 27  \add If any one of\add* you disobeys God's laws, even though  \add you\f + \ft singular \f* have\add* the Scriptures and even though someone has circumcised you \f + \ft Or:you are circumcised \f* \add God will punish you\add*.

\v 25 Any one of you who is circumcised to show that he belongs to God can benefit from that if he obeys the law that he gave to Moses. But if you, a circumcised person, disobey the law, God will consider you to be no better in God's sight than someone who is not circumcised.
\v 26 This means that God will certainly consider that even non-Jews who are not circumcised can become his people if they obey the things that he commanded in his laws.
\v 27 These people, who are not circumcised but who still obey God's laws, will declare that God is right when he punishes you, for you are circumcized but still break the law.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 25 For circumcision indeed benefits you if you obey the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision.
\v 26 If, then, the uncircumcised person keeps the requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be considered as circumcision?
\v 27 And will not the one who is naturally uncircumcised condemn you if he keeps the law? This is because you have the written law and circumcision, yet you break the law!

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul continues to show that God, by his law, condemns even the Jews who have God's law.

  * **For circumcision indeed benefits you** - "I say all of this because being circumcised does benefit you"
  * **if you break the law** - "if you do not obey the commandments found in the law"
  * **your circumcision becomes uncircumcision** - "it is as though you were no longer circumcised"
  * **the uncircumcised person** - "the person who is not circumcised"
  * **keeps the requirements of the law** - "obeys what God commands in the law"
  * **will not his uncircumcision be considered as circumcision? And will not the one who is naturally uncircumcised condemn you ... the law?** - Paul asks two questions here to emphasize that circumcision is not what makes one right before God. You can translate these questions as statements in an active form. AT: "God will consider him as circumcised. The one who is not physically circumcised will condemn you ... the law." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
