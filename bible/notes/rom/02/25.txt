\v 25 Any one of you who is circumcised to show that he belong to God can benefit from that if he obeys the Law that he gave to Moses. But if you, a circumcised person, disobey the Law, God will consider you to be no better in God's sight than someone who is not circumcised.
\v 26 This means that God will certainly consider that even non-Jews who are not circumcised can become his people if they obey the things that he commanded in his laws.
\v 27 The people who are not circumcised but who obey God's laws, will declare that God is right when he punishes you, for you are circumcized but still break the Law.

<usfm>
\v 25 For circumcision indeed benefits you if you obey the law, but if you are a violator of the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision.
\v 26 If, therefore, the uncircumcised person keeps the requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be considered as circumcision?
\v 27 Will not the one who is by nature uncircumcised, if he fulfills the law, judge you, who by the written scriptures and circumcision are a violator of the law?

===== Translation Notes: =====
 Paul continues his imaginary argument with a Jewish person, whom he scolds with rhetorical questions.
  * **For circumcision indeed benefits you** - AT: "I say all of this because being circumcised does benefit you"
  * **if you are a violator of the Law **- AT: "if you do not obey the commandments found in the Law"
  * **your circumcision becomes uncircumcision** - This compares a Jewish person who does not obey the Law to a man who was physically circumcised but reverses the operation: he may be Jewish, but he looks like a Gentile. AT: "it is like you are no longer circumcised" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the uncircumcised person** - AT: "the person who is not circumcised"
  * **keeps the requirements of the Law** - AT: "obeys what is commanded in the Law"
  * **will not his uncircumcision be considered as circumcision? Will not the one who is by nature uncircumcised...judge you** - Paul is asking a question to emphasize that circumcision is not what makes one right before God. This can be translated with an active verb: "God will consider him as circumcised. The one who is not physically circumcised...will judge you" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]], [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **who by the written scriptures and circumcision are a violator of the Law** - AT: "who have the written scriptures and are circumcised but do not obey the Law"
