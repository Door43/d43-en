===== Translation Notes: =====

Paul continues his imaginary argument with a Jewish person, whom he scolds with rhetorical questions.

  * **You who rejoice proudly in the Law, do you through your transgression of the Law dishonor God?**  - Paul uses a question to scold his listener. "It is wicked that you claim to be proud of the Law, while at the same time you disobey it and bring shame to God." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **the name of God is dishonored among the Gentiles**  - This can be translated with an active verb: "Your wicked actions bring shame to God in the minds of the Gentiles" [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **name of God** - The word "name" refers to the entirety of God, not just his name. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]]
