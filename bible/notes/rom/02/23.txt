===== Translation Notes: =====

Paul continues his imaginary argument with a Jewish person, whom he scolds with rhetorical questions.

  * **You who rejoice proudly in the Law, do you through your transgression of the Law dishonor God?**  - Paul uses a question to scold his listener. AT: "It is wicked that you claim to be proud of the Law, while at the same time you disobey it and bring shame to God" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **the name of God is dishonored among the Gentiles**  - This can be translated with an active verb. AT: "Your wicked actions bring shame to God in the minds of the Gentiles" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **name of God** - The word "name" refers to the entirety of God, not just his name. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
