\v 3 So you who say that God should punish others for doing evil deeds, although you do evil deeds yourself, you should certainly not think that you yourself will be able to escape from God when he begins to punish you!
\v 4 And you should not say, "God is acting very tolerantly and patiently toward me, so I do not need to turn away from my sin." You should understand that God is patiently waiting for you to repent from your sins.

\v 3 But consider this, you person, you who judge those who practice such things although you do the same things. Will you escape from the judgment of God?
\v 4 Or do you think so little of the riches of his goodness, his delayed punishment, and his patience, not knowing that his goodness is meant to lead you to repentance?

===== Translation Notes: =====

Paul continues his imaginary argument with a Jewish person, whom he scolds with rhetorical questions.

  * **But**  - AT: "So" (UDB)
  * **consider this**  - AT: "think about what I am going to tell you"
  * **person**  - Use the general word for a human being. AT: "whoever you are"
  * **you who judge those who practice such things although you do the same things** - AT: "you who say someone deserves God's punishment while you do the same wicked deeds"
  * **Will you escape from the judgment of God?**  - AT: "You will certainly not escape God's judgment!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **Or do you think so little of the riches of his goodness, his delayed punishment, and his patience...?**  - AT: "You act like it does not matter that God is good and he patiently waits a long time before he punishes people" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **think so little of the riches...patience** - AT: "consider the riches...patience unimportant" or "consider...not good" 
  * **not knowing that his goodness is meant to lead you to repentance**  - This can be translated as a new sentence. AT: "You must know that God shows you he is good so that you might repent"
