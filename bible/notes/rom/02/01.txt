You\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* say that  \add God should\add* punish  \add non-Jews for doing evil deeds\add*. But when any one of you says that, it is yourself whom you are saying that God should punish, because you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* do  \add some of\add* the same  \add evil\add* deeds  \add that the non-Jews do\add*.
