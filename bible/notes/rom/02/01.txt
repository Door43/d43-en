\v 1  \add God will severely punish non-Jewish people who habitually do evil deeds, because he has clearly revealed that he is angry with them\add*. So, \add when God judges people\add*, he will not excuse any one of you Jews  \add to whom I am writing\add*. You\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* say that  \add God should\add* punish  \add non-Jews for doing evil deeds\add*. But when any one of you says that, it is yourself whom you are saying that God should punish, because you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* do  \add some of\add* the same  \add evil\add* deeds  \add that the non-Jews do\add*.
\v 2 We know very well that God will judge and punish fairly  \add non-Jewish\add* people who do such  \add evil\add* deeds.

\v 1  God will severely punish people who habitually do evil deeds, because he has clearly revealed that he is angry with them. So when God judges people, he will not excuse any one of you, my Jewish friends. You say that God should punish non-Jews for doing evil deeds. But when any one of you says that, you are really saying that God should punish yourself, because you do some of the same evil deeds that the non-Jews do.
\v 2 We know very well that God will judge and punish fairly non-Jewish people who do such evil deeds.

\c 2
\p
\v 1 Therefore you are without excuse, you person, you who judge, for what you judge in another you condemn in yourself. For you who judge practice the same things.
\v 2 But we know that God's judgment is according to truth when it falls on those who practice such things.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Paul begins an argument with an imaginary Jewish person.

  * **Therefore you are without excuse**  - The word "therefore" marks a new section of the letter. It also makes a concluding statement based on what was said in [[:en:bible:notes:rom:01:32|1:1-32]]. AT: "Since God will punish those who continually sin, he will certainly not excuse your sins"
  * **you are**  - Paul is not talking to a real person. He is acting like a Jewish person who is arguing with him. Paul is doing this to teach his audience that God will punish everyone who continually sins, whether Jew or Gentile. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe|Apostrophe]])
  * **you** - Here the word "you" is singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_yousingular]])
  * **you person, you who judge**  - Here the word "person" is used to scold or mock someone who thinks he can act like God and judge others. This could be translated as a new sentence. AT: "You are just a human being, yet you judge others and say they deserve God's punishment"
  * **for what you judge in another you condemn in yourself**  - This could be translated as a new sentence. AT: "But you are only judging yourself because you do the same wicked deeds as they do"
  * **But we know**  - This may include Christian believers and also Jews who are not Christians. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive|Inclusive]])
  * **God's judgment is according to truth when it falls on those**  - AT: "God will judge those people truly and fairly" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification|Personification]])
  * **those who practice such things**  - AT: "the people who do those wicked deeds"
