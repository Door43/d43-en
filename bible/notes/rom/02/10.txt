<usfm>
\v 10 But God will praise, honor, and give a peaceful spirit to every person who habitually does good deeds. He will certainly do this for the Jews because he chose them as his special people, but he will also do it for the non-Jews.
\v 11 God will do this fairly, because he pays no attention to how important anyone is.


\p
\v 12 Although non-Jews do not have the laws that God gave to Moses, all non-Jews who sin will be apart from God forever. He will not consider whether or not they knew the laws that he gave to Moses. And he will also punish all the Jews who have disobeyed his Law, because he will judge them according to it.

<usfm>
\v 10 But praise, honor, and peace will come to everyone who practices good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
\v 11 For there is no partiality with God,
\v 12 for as many as have sinned without the Law will also perish without the Law, and as many as have sinned in respect to the Law will be judged by the Law.

===== Translation Notes: =====
 Paul continues his imaginary argument with a Jewish person. 
  * **But praise, honor, and peace will come** - AT: "But God will give praise, honor, and peace"
  * **practices good**  - AT: "continually does what is good"
  * **to the Jew first, and also to the Greek** - This could be a new sentence. AT: "God will reward the Jewish people first, and then those who are not Jewish people"
  * **first** - You should translate this the same way you did in [[en:bible:notes:rom:02:08|2:9]].
  * **For there is no partiality with God** - AT: "For God does not favor one group of people over another" or "For God treats all people the same" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **for as many as have sinned** - This could be translated as a new sentence. AT: "For those who have sinned"
  * **without the Law will also perish without the Law** - Paul repeats "without the Law" to emphasize it does not matter if they do not know the Law of Moses. If they sin, God will judge them. AT: "without knowing the Law of Moses will certainly still die spiritually"
  * **and as many as have sinned** - This could be translated as a new sentence. AT: "And all those who have sinned"
  * **in respect to the Law will be judged by the Law** - AT: "and know the Law of Moses, God will judge them according to the Law of Moses"
