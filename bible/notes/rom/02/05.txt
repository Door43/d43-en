\v 5 But instead, because you are stubborn and refuse to stop sinning, God will punish you even more severely. He will do that at the time when he shows that he is angry and judges all people fairly.


\p
\v 6 God will pay back everyone according to what they deserve for what they have done.
\v 7  Specifically, some people keep doing good deeds, because they want God to honor them, and they want to live forever with him. God will reward them  in this way.

\v 5 But it is to the extent of your hardness and unrepentant heart that you are storing up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath, the day of the revelation of God's righteous judgment.
\v 6 He will pay back to every person the same measure of his actions:
\v 7 to those who according to consistent, good actions have sought praise, honor, and incorruptibility—eternal life.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Paul continues his imaginary argument with a Jewish person.

  * **But it is to the extent of your hardness and unrepentant heart**  - Paul compares a person who refuses to listen and obey God to something hard, like a stone. The heart represents the whole person. AT: "It is because you refuse to listen and repent" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **hardness and unrepentant heart** - The phrase "unrepentant heart" explains the word "hardness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **you are storing up for yourself wrath**  - The phrase "storing up" usually refers to a person gathering his treasures and putting it in a safe place. Paul says instead of treasures the person is gathering God's punishment. The longer they go without repenting, the more severe the punishment. AT: "you are making your punishment worse" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in the day of wrath, the day of the revelation of God's righteous judgment**  - These refer to the same day. AT: "when God shows everyone that he is angry and that he judges all people fairly" (see UDB).
  * **pay back**  - AT: "give a fair reward or punishment"
  * **to every person the same measure of his actions**  - AT: "according to what each person has done"
  * **to those who according to consistent, good actions have sought praise, honor, and incorruptibility—eternal life** - AT: "He will give eternal life to those who have shown by consistently doing good things that they were seeking praise, honor, and incorruptibility"
  * **have sought**  - This means that they act in a way that will lead to a positive decision from God on judgment day.
  * **praise, honor, and incorruptibility** - They want God to praise and honor them, and they want to never die.
  * **incorruptibility** - This refers to physical, not moral, decay.
