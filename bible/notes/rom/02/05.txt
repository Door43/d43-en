===== Translation Notes: =====

Paul continues his imaginary argument with a Jewish person.

  * **But it is to the extent of your hardness and unrepentant heart**  - Paul compares a person who refuses to listen and obey God to something hard, like a stone. The heart represents the whole person. AT: "It is because you refuse to listen and repent" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **hardness and unrepentant heart** - The phrase "unrepentant heart" explains the word "hardness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **you are storing up for yourself wrath**  - The phrase "storing up" usually refers to a person gathering his treasures and putting it in a safe place. Paul says instead of treasures the person is gathering God's punishment. The longer they go without repenting, the more severe the punishment. AT: "you are making your punishment worse" (See:[[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in the day of wrath, the day of the revelation of God's righteous judgment**  - These refer to the same day. AT: "when God shows everyone that he is angry and that he judges all people fairly" (see UDB).
  * **pay back**  - "give a fair reward or punishment"
  * **to every person the same measure of his actions**  - "according to what each person has done"
  * **to those who according to consistent, good actions have sought praise, honor, and incorruptibility—eternal life** - "He will give eternal life to those who have shown by consistently doing good things that they were seeking praise, honor, and incorruptibility"
  * **have sought**  - This means that they act in a way that will lead to a positive decision from God on judgment day.
  * **praise, honor, and incorruptibility** - They want God to praise and honor them, and they want to never die.
  * **incorruptibility** - This refers to physical, not moral, decay.
