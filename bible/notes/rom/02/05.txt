\v 5 But instead, because you are stubborn and refuse to stop sinning, God will punish you even more severely. He will do that at the time when he shows that he is angry and judges all people fairly.


\p
\v 6 God will pay back everyone according to what they deserve for what they have done.
\v 7 Specifically, some people keep doing good deeds, because they want God to honor them, and they want to live forever with him. God will reward them in this way.

\v 5 But it is to the extent of your hardness and unrepentant heart that you are storing up for yourself wrath on the day of wrath, that is, the day of the revelation of God's righteous judgment. 
\v 6 He will pay back to every person the same measure of his actions: 
\v 7 to those who according to consistent, good actions have sought praise, honor, and incorruptibility, he will give eternal life.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul continues to remind the people that all people are wicked.

  * **But it is to the extent of your hardness and unrepentant heart** - Paul uses a metaphor to compare a person who refuses to obey God to something hard, like a stone. He also uses the metonym "heart" to represent the whole person. AT: "It is because you refuse to listen and repent" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **hardness and unrepentant heart** - This is a doublet that you can combine as "unrepentant heart." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **you are storing up for yourself wrath** - The phrase "storing up" implies a metaphor that usually refers to a person gathering his treasures and putting them in a safe place. Paul says, instead of treasures, that the person is gathering God's punishment. The longer they go without repenting, the more severe the punishment. AT: "you are making your punishment worse" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **on the day of wrath ... the day of the revelation of God's righteous judgment** - Both of these phrases refer to the same day. AT: "when God shows everyone that he is angry and that he judges all people fairly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **pay back** - "give a fair reward or punishment"
  * **to every person the same measure of his actions** - "according to what each person has done"
  * **have sought** - This means that they act in a way that will lead to a positive decision from God on judgment day.
  * **praise, honor, and incorruptibility** - They want God to praise and honor them, and they want to never die.
  * **incorruptibility** - This refers to physical, not moral, decay.
