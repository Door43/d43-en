\v 8 But some people act in a selfish way and refuse to believe that what God says is true, and they do the things that God says are wrong. God will be very angry and will punish them severely.
\v 9 He will cause everyone who habitually does evil deeds to suffer greatly and to have many troubles. This certainly will happen to the Jews who refuse to accept God's message, because God gave them the privilege to be his special people, but it will also happen to the non-Jews.

\v 8 But to those who are self-seeking, who disobey the truth but obey unrighteousness, wrath and fierce anger will come,
\v 9 and tribulation and distress, on every human soul that has practiced evil, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Paul continues his imaginary argument with a Jewish person.

  * **self-seeking**  - AT: "selfish" or "only concerned with what makes themselves happy"
  * **disobey the truth but obey unrighteousness** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second intensifies the first. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **wrath and fierce anger will come** - The words "wrath" and "fierce anger" mean basically the same thing and emphasize God's anger. AT: "God will show his terrible anger" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **tribulation and distress, on** - The words "tribulation" and "distress" mean basically the same thing here and emphasize how bad God's punishment will be. AT: "awful punishments will happen to" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **on every human soul**  - Here, Paul uses the word "soul" to refer to the whole person. AT: "upon every person" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche|Synecdoche]])
  * **has practiced evil**  - AT: "has continually done evil things"
  * **to the Jew first, and also to the Greek**  - This can be a new sentence. AT: "God will judge the Jewish people first, and then those who are not Jewish people"
  * **first**  - Possible meanings are 1) "first in order of time" or 2) "most certainly" (see UDB) or "most importantly."
