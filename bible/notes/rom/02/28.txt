<usfm>
\v 28 It is not those who perform rituals for God who are true Jews, and it is not being circumcised in their bodies that causes God to accept them.
\v 29 On the contrary, we whom God has changed inwardly are the true Jews. God has accepted us because we have allowed God's Spirit to change our hearts, not because we perform rituals. Even if  other people will not praise us, God will praise us.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 For he is not a Jew who is merely one outwardly; neither is circumcision that which is merely outward in the flesh.
\v 29 But he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter. The praise of such a person comes not from people but from God.
