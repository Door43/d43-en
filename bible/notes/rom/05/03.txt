<usfm>
\v 3 When we suffer because we are joined to Christ, we also rejoice because we know that when we are suffering, we are learning to endure things patiently.
\v 4 And we know that when we endure suffering patiently, God approves of us. And when we know that God approves of us, we confidently expect that he will do great things for us.
\v 5 And we are very confident that we will receive the things that we wait for, because God loves us very much. His Holy Spirit, whom he gave to us, causes us to understand how much God loves us.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Not only this, but we also rejoice in our sufferings. We know that suffering produces endurance.
\v 4 Endurance produces character, and character produces certain hope,
\v 5 and that hope does not disappoint because the love of God has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.
