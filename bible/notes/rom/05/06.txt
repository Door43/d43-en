\v 6 When we were unable to save ourselves, it was Christ who, at the time that God chose, died for us people, although we were not honoring God at all.
\v 7 Rarely will anyone die for another person, even if that person were righteous, although for a good person perhaps someone might be courageous enough to die.

\v 6 For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.
\v 7 For one will hardly die for a righteous man. That is, perhaps someone would dare to die for a good person.
