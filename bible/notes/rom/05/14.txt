\v 14 But \add we know\add* that from \add the time when\add* Adam \add lived\add* until \add the time when\add* Moses \add lived\add*, all people sinned, and they died \add as a consequence\add* \f + \ft personification, metaphor \f*. Even people who sinned differently from the way Adam \add sinned, died\add*. \add Adam's sin\add* affected \add all people\add*, just like what \add Christ did\add*, the one who came later, can affect all people.
\v 15 But \add the results of God's erasing the record of our sins as\add* a gift to us are not like \add the results of Adam's\add* sinning. The result of one man, \add Adam\add*, sinning was that many\f + \ft Or: all \f* people have died. But \add it is certain\add*, \add however\add*, that many people have abundantly experienced God's acting kindly toward them in a way they did not deserve. \add It is also certain\add* that they have experienced God's erasing the record of their sins as the result of one man, Jesus Christ, acting kindly toward them\f + \ft Or: towards \f* them in a way they did not deserve.

\v 14 But we know that from the time when Adam lived until the time when Moses lived, all people sinned, and that they died as a consequence. Everyone died, even those who did not break a direct command from God as Adam did. Adam's sin affected all people, just like what Christ did, the one who came later, also affects all people.
\v 15 But the gift that God gives is not like Adam's sin. Because Adam sinned, everybody dies. But because another single man, Jesus Christ, died for us all, God kindly offers us this gift of everlasting life, although we do not deserve it.

\v 14 Nevertheless, death ruled from Adam until Moses, even over those who did not sin like Adam's disobedience, who is a pattern of him who was to come.
\p
\v 15 But the gift is not like the trespass. For if by the trespass of one the many died, how much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound for the many!

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Nevertheless** - "Yet" or "There was no written law from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, but." The word "Nevertheless" links this section with the verses that came immediately before it. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:rom:05:12|5:13]])
  * **death ruled from Adam until Moses** - Paul is speaking of death as if it were a king who ruled. AT: "people continued to die from the time of Adam until the time of Moses as a consequence of their sin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **even over those who did not sin like Adam's disobedience** - "even people whose sins were different from Adam's continue to die"
  * **who is a pattern of him who was to come** - Adam was a pattern of Christ, who appeared much later. He had much in common with him.
  * **For if by the trespass of one the many died** - Here "one" refers to Adam. AT: "For if by one man's sin, many died" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) 
  * **how much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound for the many** - Here "grace" refers to God's free gift that he made available to everyone through Jesus Christ. AT: "even more through the man Jesus Christ, who died for us all, did God kindly offer us this gift of everlasting life, although we do not deserve it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
