===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 Even when we were acting as enemies towards God, he made us to be friends with him because his Son died for us. So it is even more certain that Christ will save us, because he is alive again.
\v 11 And that's not all! Now we also rejoice because we have become friends with God, because of what our Lord Jesus Christ has done for us.

<usfm>
\v 10 For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, after having been reconciled, will we be saved by his life.
\v 11 Not only this, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we now have received this reconciliation.
