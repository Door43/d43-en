  * **Lord** - Here this means that Jesus is God.
  * **Through him we also have our access by faith into this grace in which we stand **  - Paul compares believers receiving grace to a person being able to stand before a king. AT: "Because it is in Jesus that we believe, God gives us grace to stand before God"

Other versions try to make this passage more specific.
