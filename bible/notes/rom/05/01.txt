===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul begins to tell many different things that happen when God makes believers right with him.

  * **Since** - "Because"
  * **we ... our** - All occurrences of "we" and "our" refer to all believers and should be inclusive. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
  * **through our Lord Jesus Christ** - "because of our Lord Jesus Christ"
  * **Lord** - Here "Lord" means that Jesus is God.
  * **Through him we also have our access by faith into this grace in which we stand** - Here "by faith" refers to our trust in Jesus, which allows us to stand before God. AT: "Because we trust in Jesus, God allows us to come into his presence"
