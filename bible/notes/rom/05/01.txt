===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Since**  - AT: "Because"
  * **we…our**  - All occurrences of "we" and "our" refer to all believers and should be inclusive. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive|Inclusive]])
  * **through our Lord Jesus Christ**  - AT: "because of our Lord Jesus Christ"
  * **Lord** - Here this means that Jesus is God.
  * **Through him we also have our access by faith into this grace in which we stand **  - Paul compares believers receiving grace to a person being able to stand before a king. AT: "Because it is in Jesus that we believe, God gives us grace to stand before God"
  * **We rejoice because of what we confidently expect regarding God's glory** - Some versions imitate the Greek text more closely: "We rejoice in the hope of God's glory." Other versions try to make this passage more specific. AT: "We are happy because we are confident that we will experience God’s glory" or "We are happy because we are confident that we will see God's glory" or "We are happy because we are confident that we will share in God’s glory"
