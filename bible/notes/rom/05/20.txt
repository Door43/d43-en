\v 20 God gave his Law to Moses in order that people might realize how greatly they had sinned; but as people sinned more, God continued to act even more kindly toward them, in a way that they did not deserve.
\v 21 He did that in order that, unlike people die because they sin, his kind gift might put them right with himself. Then they can live forever because of what Jesus Christ our Lord has done for them.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 But the Law came in alongside, in order that the trespass might abound. But where sin abounded, grace abounded even more.
\v 21 This happened so that, as sin ruled in death, even so grace might rule through righteousness for everlasting life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
