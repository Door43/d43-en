\v 12 \add What you can learn from what I have written so far is as follows\add*: All people are sinful \f + \ft personification \f*, and that is the result of \add Adam, the first\add* man whom \add God created, sinning long ago\add*. Adam died \f + \ft personification \f* because he sinned. So, all people \add who have lived since then\add* die, because \add it is as though\add* all people sinned \add when Adam sinned\add*.
\v 13 \add People in\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* the world sinned before \add God gave his\add* laws \add to Moses\add*. But people are not considered \add by God\add* \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* does not consider people \f* to be guilty for their sins if there is no law \add stating that what they did was sinful\add*.

\v 12 What you can learn from what I have written so far is as follows: All people are sinful because Adam, the first man whom God created, sinned long ago. Because he sinned, he eventually died. So all people who have lived since then became sinners, and they all die.
\v 13 Now People in the world sinned before God gave his Law to Moses. But people are not considered by God to be guilty for their sins if there is no law stating that what they did was sinful.

\v 12 Therefore, as through one man sin entered into the world, in this way death entered through sin. And death spread to all people, to all who sinned.

\v 13 For until the Law, sin was in the world, but sin is not recorded when there is no law.
