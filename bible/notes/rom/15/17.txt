\v 17 It follows that, because of my relationship with Christ Jesus, I am happy about my work for God.
\v 18 I will speak boldly only about the work that Christ has accomplished through me that non-Jews might pay attention to the message about Christ. These accomplishments came because of words and deeds
\v 19 by showing signs and other things that convince people. I have done those things God's Spirit has enabled me. In this way I have traveled all the way around from Jerusalem to the province of Illyricum, and I have completed my work of proclaiming the message about Christ in those places.

\v 17 So my delight is in Christ Jesus and in the things of God.
\v 18 For I will not dare to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me for the obedience of the Gentiles. These are things done by word and action,
\v 19 by the power of signs and wonders, and by the power of the Holy Spirit. This was so that from Jerusalem, and round about as far as Illyricum, I might fully carry out the gospel of Christ.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **So my delight is in Christ Jesus and in the things of God** - Here "the things of God" could refer to the task that God has chosen Paul to do. AT: "Therefore I have reason to rejoice in Christ Jesus and in the work God has given me to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) 
  * **For I will not dare to speak of anything ... These are things done by word and action, by the power of signs and wonders, and by the power of the Holy Spirit** - You can translate this double negative in a positive form. Here "these are things" refers to what Christ has accomplished through Paul. AT: "For the sake of the obedience of the Gentiles, I will only speak of what Christ has accomplished through me in my words and actions and by the power of signs and wonders through the power of the Holy Spirit" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **signs and wonders** - These two words mean basically the same thing and refer to various kinds of miracles. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **so that from Jerusalem, and round about as far as Illyricum** - This is from the city of Jerusalem as far as the province of Illyricum, a region close to Italy.
