\v 17 It follows that, because of my relationship with  Christ Jesus, I am happy about my work for God.
\v 18 I will speak boldly only about the work that Christ has given me to do. I do that work in order that non-Jews might pay attention to the message about Christâ€”
\v 19 specifically, by my performing many powerful deeds and other things that amaze people. I have done those things God's Spirit has enabled me. In this way I have traveled all the way around from Jerusalem to the province of Illyricum, and I have completed my work of proclaiming the message about Christ in those places.

\v 17 I have then my boast in Christ Jesus in the things pertaining to God.
\v 18 For I will not dare to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and action,
\v 19 by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Holy Spirit; so that from Jerusalem, and round about as far as Illyricum, I might fully carry out the gospel of Christ.
