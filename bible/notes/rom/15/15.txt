\v 15 However, I have written to you quite openly in this letter about some things in order to remind you about them. I have written this because God has made me an apostle, although I did not deserve this.
\v 16 He did this in order that I should work for Jesus Christ among the non-Jews. God has appointed me to act like a priest as I proclaim his good news, in order that he may accept the non-Jews who believe in Christ. They will be like an offering that the Holy Spirit has set completely apart for God only.

\v 15 But I am writing more boldly to you about some things in order to remind you again, because of the gift that was given me by God:
\v 16 that I should be a servant of Christ Jesus sent to the Gentiles, to offer as a priest the gospel of God, that the offering of the Gentiles might become acceptable, an object of sanctification by the Holy Spirit.
