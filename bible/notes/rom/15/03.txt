\v 3 We should please our fellow believers, since Christ has set us an example. He did not do things to please himself. On the contrary, he tried to please God even when others insulted him. That was as the scriptures say: "When people insulted you, it was as though they were also insulting me."
\v 4 Remember that all the things written in the scriptures are there to teach us, so that we may become patient in hardship. In this way the scriptures will encourage us to expect that God will do for us everything that he has promised.

\v 3 For even Christ did not please himself. Instead, it was just as it is written, "The insults of those who insulted you fell on me."
\v 4 For whatever was previously written was written for our instruction, in order that through patience and through encouragement of the scriptures we would have certain hope.
