Paul is greeting many of the believers in Rome by name. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|How to Translate Names]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])

    * **Mary** - This is a woman's name.
    * **Junias** - This could be either 1) Junia, a woman's name (see UDB) or much less likely, 2) Junias, a man's name.
    * **Andronicus...Ampliatus** - These are men's names.
    * **my beloved in the Lord** - AT: "my dear friend and fellow believer"
