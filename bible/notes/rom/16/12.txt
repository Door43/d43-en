    * **Tryphaena...Tryphosa...Persis**  - These are women's names.
    * **Rufus...Asyncritus...Phlegon...Hermes...Patrobas...Hermas**  - These are men's names.
    * **chosen in the Lord** - This can be translated with an active verb. AT: "whom the Lord has chosen" because of special qualities (see UDB). (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
