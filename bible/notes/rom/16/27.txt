Paul continues his closing statement. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:rom:16:25|16:25]])

  * **To the only wise God ... be the glory forever. Amen** - Here "through Jesus Christ" refers to what Jesus did. To give "glory" means to praise God. AT: "Because of what Jesus Christ has done for us, we will praise forever the one who alone is God and who alone is wise. Amen" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
