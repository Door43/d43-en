  * **who are causing the divisions and stumbling**  - "who are causing believers to argue with one another and to stop having faith in God"
  * **going beyond the teaching that you have learned**  - This can be translated as a new sentence: "They teach things that do not agree with the truth you have already learned."
  * **Turn away from them**  - "Stay away from them"
