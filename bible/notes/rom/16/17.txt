\v 17 Now I urge you, brothers, to think about those who are causing the divisions and stumbling, going beyond the teaching that you have learned. Turn away from them.
\v 18 For people such as these do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own belly. By their smooth and flattering speech they deceive the hearts of the innocent.
