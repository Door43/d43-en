Keep away from such people!
\v 18 They do not serve our Lord Christ! On the contrary, they only want to satisfy their own desires \f + \ft metonymy \f*! Also, by all the eloquent things that they say \f + \ft doublet \f* they deceive the minds of those people who do not realize \add that their teaching is false\add*.

<usfm>
\v 17 My fellow believers, I tell you that you must be careful about the people who are causing divisions among you and who cause people to turn away from God. Keep away from such people!
\v 18 They do not serve our Lord Christ! On the contrary, they only want to satisfy their own desires. They deceive the people using smooth talk and praise so the people do not realize that these troublemakers are teaching false things.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 17 Now I urge you, brothers, to think about those who are causing the divisions and stumbling. They are going beyond the teaching that you have learned. Turn away from them.
\v 18 For people such as these do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own belly. By their smooth and flattering speech they deceive the hearts of the innocent.

  * **to think about** - "to watch out for"
  * **who are causing the divisions and stumbling** - This refers to those who argue and cause others to stop trusting in Jesus. AT: "who are causing believers to argue with one another and to stop having faith in God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
