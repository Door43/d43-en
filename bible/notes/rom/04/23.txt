\v 23 The words in the scriptures, "God considered him to be right with himself because he trusted in him," are not only about Abraham.
\v 24 They were also written about us, whom God would consider to be right with himself because we trust in him, the one who caused our Lord Jesus to become alive again after he died.
\v 25 God allowed men to execute Jesus because of our evil deeds. And God caused Jesus to live again because God wanted to put us right with him.

\v 23 Now it was not written only for his benefit, that it was counted for him.
\v 24 It was written also for us, for whom it will be counted, we who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead ones.
\v 25 This is the one who was delivered up for our trespasses and was raised for our justification.
