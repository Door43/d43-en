\v 23 The words in the scriptures, "God considered him to be right with himself because he trusted in him," are not only about Abraham.
\v 24 They were also written about us, whom God would consider to be right with himself because we trust in him, the one who caused our Lord Jesus to become alive again after he died.
\v 25 Jesus allowed men to execute him so that God would forgive our evil deeds. And God caused Jesus to live again because God wanted to put us right with him.

\v 23 Now it was not written for his benefit only, that it was counted to him,
\v 24 but also for us, to whom it will be counted, we who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead—
\v 25 Jesus, who was delivered up for our trespasses, and was raised for our justification.
