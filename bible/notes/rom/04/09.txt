\v 9 Being fortunate like this is not something that only we Jews can experience. No, it is also something that non-Jews can experience. We know this, because it is written in the scriptures that Abraham trusted in God, so God considered him to be right with himself.
\v 10 Think about when God did this for Abraham. He did it before Abraham was circumcised, not after.

\v 9 Is this blessing then pronounced only upon those of the circumcision, or also upon those of the uncircumcision? For we say, "Faith was counted to Abraham for righteousness."
\v 10 So how was it counted? When Abraham was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? It was not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
