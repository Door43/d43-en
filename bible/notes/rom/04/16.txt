\v 16 So it is because \add we\add* trust \add in God that we will receive the things that he has promised\add*. \add It is not because we perfectly obey God's laws. He wants\add* to \add erase the record of our sins\f + \ft Or: to declare us no longer guilty\add* \f* without our earning it. As a result, what God now promises, he guarantees to give to all people who are \add Abraham's spiritual\add* descendants. \add He promises to do that not only for us Jewish believers\add*, who \add have\add* God's laws \add and trust in him as Abraham did\add*, but also for those \add non-Jews who do not have God's laws but\add* who trust \add in him\add* as Abraham did. Abraham is the \add spiritual\add* ancestor of all of us \add believers\add*.
\v 17 What is written \f + \ft Or:What \add Moses\add* wrote \f* \add in the Scriptures about what God promised Abraham shows that this is true\add*. \add God said to him\add*, "It is in order that you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* may be the ancestor of many ethnic groups that I have appointed you."


\p God \add guaranteed that he would give Abraham many descendants\add*. Abraham confidently believed that God \add would do that\add*,

\v 16 So it is because we trust in God that we will receive the things that he has promised. And he promises these things to us as a gift, because he is very kind. He acts in this way in order to give these things to everyone whom he regards as a true descendant of Abraham—us Jewish believers, who have God's Law and trust him, and also those non-Jews who do not have God's laws but who trust in him as Abraham did. For God regards Abraham as the true  ancestor of all of us believers.
\v 17 (This is what God said to Abraham in the scriptures: "I will make you the ancestor of many ethnic groups.")


\p 
God guaranteed that he would give Abraham many descendants. Abraham confidently believed that God would do that, and lived in his presence, trusting that he was able to give life to dead people and to make things that did not yet exist come into being.

\v 16 For this reason it is by faith, so that it might be according to grace, in order that the promise might be sure for all the descendants. And these descendants will include not only those who know the law, but also those who are from Abraham's faith, (who is the father of us all,
\v 17 as it is written, "I have made you the father of many nations"). Abraham was in the presence of him whom he trusted, that is, God, who gives life to the dead and calls the things that do not exist into existence.
