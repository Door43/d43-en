\v 11 \add Many years later, God commanded that\add* Abraham \add be\add* circumcised. Abraham's accepting that ritual simply showed \add that he knew that God had accepted him\add*. \add He knew that God\add* had \add erased the record of his sins\add* because he trusted \add in God\add* while he was still, \add in effect, a non-Jew because\add* he had not been circumcised. \add So we can understand that\add* Abraham became a spiritual ancestor\f + \ft Or: like an ancestor \f* to \add all\add* of us whose record of sins has been erased \f + \ft Or:whose sins \add God\add* has erased the record of \f* because we believe \add in God's promise, even though some of us\add* are not circumcised.
\v 12 Likewise, Abraham is the \add spiritual\add* ancestor of all us Jews who are not merely circumcised but who, more importantly, \add believe in God's promise\add* as our ancestor Abraham did, even before he was circumcised.

\v 11 Many years later, God commanded that Abraham be circumcised. Abraham obeyed; he knew that this ceremony would simply show that God had already accepted him, like we put a mark on something that we own. So we can learn here that God considered Abraham as the ancestor of everyone who trusts in him, even those who are not circumcised. In this way, God considers all these people to be right with himself.
\v 12 Likewise, God considers Abraham to be the ancestor of all us who are true Jews, that is, all Jews who not only have the mark of circumcision on their bodies, but—much more importantly—who live like our ancestor Abraham did before he was circumcised, when he was simply trusting in God

\v 11 Abraham received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had already when he was in uncircumcision, in order that he might be the father of all those who believe, even if they are in uncircumcision—so that righteousness might be counted to them—
\v 12 and so that he might be the father of circumcision to those who come not only from the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham—the faith that he had in uncircumcision.
