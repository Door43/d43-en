\v 11 He received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had when he was in uncircumcision. That he might be the father of all those who believe, though they be in uncircumcision, for righteousness to be counted to them,
\v 12 and the father of circumcision to those who are not only from the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which he had in uncircumcision.
