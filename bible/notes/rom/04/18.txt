\v 18 He trusted in this promise of God, even though there was no physical reason for him to expect that he would have descendants, because he and his wife were too old to bear children. God had said to Abraham, "You will have so many descendants that they will be as impossible to count as the stars." Abraham believed that, and he believed that he would become the ancestor of many ethnic groups.
\v 19 He did not doubt that God would do what he promised, even though he knew that his body was already as incapable of begetting children as if he were dead (he was, after all, about one hundred years old), and even though he knew that Sarah had never been able to become pregnant.
