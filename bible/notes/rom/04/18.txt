\v 18 even though there was no physical reason for him to hope \add that he would have descendants, because he and his wife were too old to bear children\add*. But God is the one who causes dead people to live again, and who talks about things that do not yet exist as already existing. \add God said to Abraham\add*, "You will have so many descendants that they will be \add as impossible to count as the stars\add*." And Abraham believed that, and he believed that he would become the ancestor of many ethnic groups.
\v 19 He did not doubt \add that God would do what he promised\add*, even though he knew that his body was already \add as incapable of begetting children as if he were\add* dead \f + \ft metaphor \f* because he was about a hundred years old. And \add even though he realized that\add* Sarah had never been able to become pregnant \f + \ft idiom \f*,

\v 18 He trusted firmly in this promise of God, even though there was no physical reason for him to expect that he would have descendants because he and his wife were too old to bear children. God had promised Abraham that he would become the ancestor of many ethnic groups by saying, "Your descendents will be like the stars in the sky."
\v 19 He did not doubt that God would do what he promised, even though he knew that his body was not able to father a child (he was, after all, about one hundred years old), and he knew that Sarah had never had children, especially now, because she was so old.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 In hope he believed against hope, that he would become the father of many nations, according to what he had been told, "So will your descendants be."
\v 19 Without becoming weak in faith, he considered his own body as dead (because he was about a hundred years old)â€”and he considered the deadness of Sarah's womb.
