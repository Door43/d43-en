\v 18 even though there was no physical reason for him to hope \add that he would have descendants, because he and his wife were too old to bear children\add*. But God is the one who causes dead people to live again, and who talks about things that do not yet exist as already existing. \add God said to Abraham\add*, "You will have so many descendants that they will be \add as impossible to count as the stars\add*." And Abraham believed that, and he believed that he would become the ancestor of many ethnic groups.
\v 19 He did not doubt \add that God would do what he promised\add*, even though he knew that his body was already \add as incapable of begetting children as if he were\add* dead \f + \ft metaphor \f* because he was about a hundred years old. And \add even though he realized that\add* Sarah had never been able to become pregnant \f + \ft idiom \f*,

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 He trusted in this promise of God, even though there was no physical reason for him to expect that he would have descendants, because he and his wife were too old to bear children. God had said to Abraham, "You will have so many descendants that they will be as impossible to count as the stars." Abraham believed that, and he believed that he would become the ancestor of many ethnic groups.
\v 19 He did not doubt that God would do what he promised, even though he knew that his body was already as incapable of begetting children as if he were dead (he was, after all, about one hundred years old), and even though he knew that Sarah had never been able to become pregnant.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 Despite all outward circumstances, Abraham confidently trusted God for the future. So he became the father of many nations, according to what had been spoken, "Thus will be your descendants."
\v 19 He was not weak in faith. Abraham acknowledged that his own body was already dead—he was about a hundred years old. He also acknowledged the deadness of Sarah's womb.

He also acknowledged the deadness of Sarah's womb** - Here Paul speaks about Abraham's old age and Sarah's inability to have children as if they were dead bodies.

(See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
