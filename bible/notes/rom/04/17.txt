\v 17 (This is like it was God said to Abraham in the Scriptures: "I will make you the ancestor of many ethnic groups.")


\p 
God guaranteed that he would give Abraham many descendants. Abraham confidently believed that God would do that, and lived in his presence, trusting that he was able to give life to dead people and to make things that did not yet exist come into being.
\v 18 He lived this way, even though there was no physical reason for him to expect that he would have descendants, because he and his wife were too old to bear children. God had said to Abraham, "You will have so many descendants that they will be as impossible to count as the stars." And Abraham believed that, and he believed that he would become the ancestor of many ethnic groups.
\v 19 He did not doubt that God would do what he promised, even though he knew that his body was already as incapable of begetting children as if he were dead (he was, after all, about one hundred years old), and even though he knew that Sarah had never been able to become pregnant.

\v 17b  Abraham was in the presence of him whom he trusted, that is, God, who gives life to the dead and calls the things that do not exist into existence. 
\v 18 Who in the manner of confidence believed confidently, in order to become the father of many nations, according to what had been spoken, "...Thus will be your descendants."
\v 19 Not being weak in faith, Abraham considered his own body already to be dead—he was about a hundred years old—and the deadness of Sarah’s womb.
