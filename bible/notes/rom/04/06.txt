\v 6 Similarly, it is as David wrote \add in the Psalms\add* about people being happy whose record of sins God has erased even though they have not done things \add to earn it. David wrote\add*:
\q
\v 7 \add God\add* is pleased with people whose sins have been \f + \ft Or:whose sins \add he\add* has \f* forgiven, and whose sins he \add has decided\add* to forget \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\q
\v 8 \add God\add* causes to be happy the people whose sins he no longer keeps a record of.

\v 6 Similarly, it is as David wrote in the Psalms about anyone whom God considers to be right with himself without earning it:
\q
\v 7 "How fortunate are the people whose sins God has forgiven, whose sins he no longer looks at. 
v 8 How fortunate are the people whose sins he no longer keeps a record of.

\v 6 David also pronounces blessing upon the man to whom God counts righteousness without works,
\v 7 saying,
\q "Blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven,
\q and whose sins are covered.
\q
\v 8 Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not count sin."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **David also pronounces blessing upon the man to whom God counts righteousness without works** - AT: "Similarly, David wrote about how God blesses the man whom God makes righteous without works"
  * **whose iniquities are forgiven...whose sins are covered...to whom the Lord will not count sin** - The same concept is stated in three different ways. AT: "whose iniquities the Lord has forgiven...whose sins the Lord has covered...whose sins the Lord will not count" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
