\v 1 Abraham is the revered ancestor of us Jews. So think about what we can learn from what happened to Abraham.
\v 2 If it was because of Abraham's doing good things that God put him right with himself, Abraham would then have had reason to boast about that to people, (but, even so, he would not have had any reason to boast to God about it).
\v 3 Remember that in the scriptures it is written that Abraham believed what God promised to do for him, and that for this reason, God considered Abraham to be right with himself.

\v 1 What then will we say that Abraham, our forefather, found according to the flesh?
\v 2 For if Abraham had been justified by works he would have had a reason to boast, but not before God.
\v 3 For what do the scriptures say? "Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness."

===== Translation Notes: =====

Paul continues to answer rhetorical questions to emphasize that each point he is making is certainly true. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

  * **What then will we say that Abraham, our forefather, found according to the flesh?**  - "This is what Abraham our physical ancestor found." Paul uses the question to catch the attention of the reader and to start talking about something new. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **For what do the scriptures say**  - "For we can read in the scriptures" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification|Personification]])
  * **and it was counted to him as righteousness **  - "and God considered Abraham as a righteous person" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
