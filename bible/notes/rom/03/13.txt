Here "open grave" is a metaphor that refers to the stench of the evil words of the people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Their tongues have deceived** - The word "tongues" is a metonym for the false words that people speak. AT: "People speak lies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
