\v 21 When God forgives our sins, it does not depend on our obeying the laws that he gave Moses. It has now been revealed to us that he forgives our sins by a different way. It was written about by Moses in the laws God gave him, and it was also written about by the prophets.
\v 22 God erases the record of our sins because we trust in what Jesus Christ has done for us. God does this for every person who trusts in Christ, because he considers that there is no difference between Jews and non-Jews.
