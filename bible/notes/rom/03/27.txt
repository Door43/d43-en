\v 27 It is not at all because of our obeying the laws of Moses that God erases the record of our sins. So there is no way that we can boast that God does that because of our obeying those laws.  Instead, it is because of our believing in Christ that God erases the record of our sins.
\v 28 We cannot boast about that, because we conclude that the record of our sins is erased because of our trusting in Christ. God does not erase the record of our sins because of our obeying the laws that he gave to Moses, because it is impossible for us to completely obey them.

\v 27 Where then is boasting? It is excluded. On what grounds? Of works? No, but on the grounds of faith.
\v 28 We conclude therefore that a person is justified by faith without the works of the Law.
