\v 27 It is not at all because we obey the laws of Moses that God erases the record of our sins. So there is no way that we can boast that God favors us because we obeyed those laws. Instead, it is because we believe in Christ that God erases the record of our sins.
\v 28 So it is clear that God makes someone right with himself if that person trusts in Christ—not if that person obeys the Law.

\v 27 Where then is boasting? It is excluded. On what grounds? Of works? No, but on the grounds of faith.
\v 28 We conclude therefore that a person is justified by faith without the works of the law.
