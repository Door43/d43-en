\v 5 So if we \add Jews'\add* being wicked \f + \ft personification \f* shows that it is right that God \add does not bless us\add*, what shall we say\f + \ft Or: conclude \f*? Shall we conclude that it is not right for God to be angry \add and punish us Jews\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*? I \add should not be saying these things\add*, \add but\add* I am speaking as ordinary humans \add speak\add*.
\v 6 We should certainly not \add conclude that God should not judge us\add*, because if God \add did not judge us Jews\add*, it would not possibly be right for him to judge \add anyone in\add* the world \f + \ft metonymy \f*!\f + \ft Or: how could he judge \add anyone in\add* the world? \f* \f + \ft metonymy, rhetorical question \f*

\v 5 So if God did not bless us Jews because we were wicked, can we say that he acted unfairly? That he was wrong to be angry with us? (I should not be asking these questions at all about God, but I am speaking as ordinary humans speak.)
\v 6 We should certainly not conclude that God should not judge us, because if God did not judge us Jews, it could not possibly be right for him to judge anyone in the world!

<usfm>
\v 5 But if our unrighteousness shows the righteousness of God, what can we say? God is not unrighteous, he who inflicts with wrath, is he?—I speak according to human logic.
\v 6 May it never be. For then how would God judge the world?
