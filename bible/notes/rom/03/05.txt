\v 5 So if we \add Jews'\add* being wicked \f + \ft personification \f* shows that it is right that God \add does not bless us\add*, what shall we say\f + \ft Or: conclude \f*? Shall we conclude that it is not right for God to be angry \add and punish us Jews\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*? I \add should not be saying these things\add*, \add but\add* I am speaking as ordinary humans \add speak\add*.
\v 6 We should certainly not \add conclude that God should not judge us\add*, because if God \add did not judge us Jews\add*, it would not possibly be right for him to judge \add anyone in\add* the world \f + \ft metonymy \f*!\f + \ft Or: how could he judge \add anyone in\add* the world? \f* \f + \ft metonymy, rhetorical question \f*

\v 5 So if God did not bless because we were wicked, can we say that he acted unfairly? That he was wrong to punish us out of anger? (I am speaking as ordinary humans speak.)
\v 6 We should certainly not conclude that God should not judge, because if God did not judge, it could not possibly be right for him to judge the world!

<usfm>
\v 5 But if our unrighteousness shows the righteousness of God, what can we say? Can we say that God is unrighteous to bring his wrath upon us? (I am using a human argument.)
\v 6 May it never be! For then how would God judge the world?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But if our unrighteousness shows the righteousness of God, what can we say? Can we say that God is unrighteous to bring his wrath upon us?** - Paul uses these questions to present what some people were arguing and to get his readers to think about whether or not this argument is true. AT: "Some people say that since our unrighteousness shows God's righteousness, then God is unrighteous when he punishes us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **to bring his wrath upon us** - Here "wrath" is a metonym for punishment. AT: "to bring his punishment upon us" or "to punish us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I am using a human argument** - "I am saying here what some people say" or "This is what some people say"
  * **May it never be** - "We must never say that God is unrighteous"
  * **For then how would God judge the world?** - Paul uses this question to show that the arguments against the gospel are not valid, since the Jews believe that God will judge all people. AT: "We all know that God will in fact judge the world!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the world** - The "world" is a metonym for the people who live in the world. AT: "anyone in the world" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
