\v 9 Shall we conclude that God will treat us more favorably and will treat the non-Jews less favorably? We can certainly not conclude that! The Jews and also the non-Jews have sinned and so they deserve for God to punish them.
\v 10 The following words that are written in the scriptures support this,


\p No person is righteous. There is not even one righteous person!
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

\v 9 What then? Are we excusing ourselves? Not at all. For we have already accused both Jews and Greeks, all of them, of being under sin.
\v 10 This is as it is written:
\q "There is no one righteous, not one.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul sums up that all are guilty of sin, none are righteous, and no one seeks God.

  * **What then? Are we excusing ourselves?** - Paul asks these questions to emphasize his point. AT: "We Jews should not try to imagine we are going to escape God's judgment, just because we are Jewish!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Not at all** - These words are stronger than a simple "no," but not as strong as "absolutely not!"
  * **This is as it is written** - You can translate this in an active form. AT: "This is as the prophets have written in the Scriptures" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
