\v 9 If someone should ask, "Shall we conclude that God will treat us Jews more favorably and will treat the non-Jews less favorably?” I would reply that we can certainly not conclude that! I have already shown you that all people, the Jews and also the non-Jews, have sinned and so they deserve for God to punish them.
\v 10 The following words that are written in the scriptures support this,


\p No person is righteous. There is not even one righteous person!

\v 9 What then? Do we excuse ourselves? Not at all. For we already accused both Jews and Greeks, all of them, of being under sin,
\v 10 as it is written,
\q "There is none righteous, not one.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul begins God's verdict that everyone is guilty of sin, none are righteous, and  none seek God.

  * **What then? Do we excuse ourselves?** - Possible meanings are: 1) "We Jews should not try to imagine we are going to escape God's judgment, just because we are Jewish!" (UDB) or 2) "We Christians are not trying to hide the wicked things that we are supposedly doing!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Not at all** - These words are stronger than a simple "no," but not as strong as "absolutely not!"
