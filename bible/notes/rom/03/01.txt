\v 1 Someone may object to this, saying, "If being circumcised does not cause God to accept us Jews, there is no advantage in being a Jew over being a non-Jew. Being circumcised does not benefit us Jews at all!"
\v 2 I would reply that being Jews benefits us in many ways. First of all, it benefits us because it was to our ancestors that God spoke his words, words that show us who he is.
