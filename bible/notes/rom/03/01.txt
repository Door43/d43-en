\v 1 If being circumcised does not cause God to accept Jews there is no advantage in being a Jew over being a non-Jew. Being circumcised does not benefit us Jews at all!
\v 2 Being Jews has many benefits. First of all because it was to their ancestors that God spoke his words, words that show us who he is.

\v 1 Then what advantage does the Jew have? And what is the benefit of circumcision?
\v 2 It is great in every way. First of all, the Jews were entrusted with revelation from God.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul proclaims ​the advantage that Jews have because God gave them his law.

  * **Then what advantage does the Jew have? And what is the benefit of circumcision?** - Paul uses these questions to capture the attention of his readers. You can translate this as a strong statement. AT: "Then Jewish people have no benefit from God's covenant, even though God promised that they would!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **It is great in every way** - Here "It" refers to being a member of the Jewish people. AT: "There is a great advantage!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information]])
  * **First of all** - Possible meanings are 1) "First in order of time" or 2) "Most certainly" or 3) "Most importantly."
  * **the Jews were entrusted with revelation from God** - Here "revelation" refers to God's words and promises. You can translate this in an active form. AT: "God gave his words that contain his promises to the Jews" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
