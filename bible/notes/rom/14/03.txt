\v 3 Anyone who thinks that it is all right to eat all kinds of food must not despise those who do not think that. Anyone who thinks it is not all right to eat all kinds of food must not condemn those who think differently, because God himself has accepted those people.
\v 4 God is the master of us all, so he is the one who will decide whether those people have done wrong! No one should judge another in this regard, because he is able to keep them faithful to him.

\v 3 Let the one who eats anything not despise the one who does not eat everything; and let not the one who does not eat everything judge the other who eats everything. For God has received him.
\v 4 Who are you, you who judge a servant belonging to another? Before his own master he stands or falls.  But he will be made to stand; for the Lord is able to make him stand.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Paul continues instructing the believers on right living. 

    * **Who are you, you who judge a servant belonging to another?**  - Paul is using a question to scold those who are judging others. AT: "You are not God, and you are not allowed to judge one of his servants"  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **you, you** - singular (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
    * **Before his own master he stands or falls**  - AT: "Only the master can decide if he will accept the servant or not"
    * **But he will be made to stand; for the Lord is able to make him stand** - This can be translated with an active verb. AT: "But the Lord will accept him because he is able to make the servant acceptable" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
