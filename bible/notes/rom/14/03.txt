\v 3 Anyone who thinks that it is all right to eat all kinds of food must not despise those who do not think that. Anyone who thinks it is not all right to eat all kinds of food must not condemn those who think differently, because God himself has accepted those people.
\v 4 You are wrong when you evaluate somebody else's servant. We are all God's servants so God is the master of us all. He is the one who will decide whether those people have done wrong! No one should judge another in this regard, because he is able to keep them faithful to him.

\v 3 May the one who eats everything not despise the one who does not eat everything. And may the one who does not eat everything not judge the other who eats everything. For God has received him.
\v 4 Who are you, you who judge a servant belonging to someone else? It is before his own master that he stands or falls. But he will be made to stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Who are you, you who judge a servant belonging to someone else?** - Paul is using a question to scold those who are judging others. You can translate this as a statement. AT: "You are not God, and you are not allowed to judge one of his servants!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **you, you** - The form of "you" here is singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **It is before his own master that he stands or falls** - Paul speaks of God as if he were a master who owned servants. AT: "Only the master can decide if he will accept the servant or not" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **But he will be made to stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand** - Paul speaks of the servant who is acceptable to God as if he were being "made to stand" instead of falling. You can translate this in an active form. AT: "But the Lord will accept him because he is able to make the servant acceptable" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
