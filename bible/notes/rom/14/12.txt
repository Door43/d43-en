\v 12 So we know that it is God who will decide whether or not he approves of what each of us has done.

\v 13 Since it is God who will judge everyone, we must stop saying that God should punish some of our fellow believers! Instead, you must be determined to never cause another brother or sister to sin or to stop trusting Christ.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **will give an account of himself to God** - "will have to explain our actions to God"
    * **but instead decide this, that no one will place a stumbling block or a snare** - Here "stumbling block" and "snare" mean basically the same thing. Alternate translation: "but instead make it your goal to not do or say anything that may result in a fellow believer starting to sin." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
