\v 8 While we live, it is the Lord whom we belong to \add and should be trying to please, and not just ourselves\add*. And when we die, it is the Lord whom we should \add be trying to please\add*. So, while we live and also when we die, we should be trying to please the Lord to whom we belong\add , not just ourselves\add*,
\v 9 because the very purpose for which Christ died and became alive again is that he might be Lord whom all people should try to please, both of those who have already died and of those who are still living.

\v 7 None of us should live merely to please ourselves, and none of us should think that when we die, it affects only us.
\v 8 While we live, it is the Lord whom we belong to and should be trying to please, and not just ourselves. And when we die, it is the Lord whom we should be trying to please. So, while we live and also when we die, we should try to please the Lord, for we belong to him.
\v 9 For Christ died and became alive again in order that he might be Lord whom all people should obey, both those alive and those who are dead.

\v 7 For none of us lives for himself, and none dies for himself.
\v 8 For if we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord. Then whether we live or die, we are the Lord’s.
\v 9 For to this purpose Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.
