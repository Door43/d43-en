===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 10 It is disgraceful that you who obey certain rules say that God will punish your fellow believers who do not obey them. For God will judge each one of us. \v 11 We know this because it is written in the scriptures: \q "Everyone will bow down before me! \q And everyone will praise me."
