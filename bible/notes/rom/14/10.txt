===== Translation Notes: =====

Paul continues instructing the believers on right living. 

  * **But you, why do you judge...? And you, why do you despise...?** - Paul is demonstrating how he might have to scold individuals among his readers. (See: [[en:ta:translate:formsofyou]]) Alternate translations: "it is wrong for you to judge...it is wrong for you to despise" (see UDB) or "stop judging...stop despising." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion]])
  * **For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God**  - The "judgment seat" refers to God's authority to judge. Alternate translation: "For God will judge us all." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
  * **As I live** - This phrase is used to start an oath or solemn promise. Alternate translation: "You can be certain that this is true."
  * **to me every knee will bend, and every tongue will give praise to God**  - Paul uses the words "knee" and "tongue" to refer to the whole person. Also, the Lord uses the word "God" to refer to himself. Alternate translation: "Every person will bow and give praise to me." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:translate:123person]])
