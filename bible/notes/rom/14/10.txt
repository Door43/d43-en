\v 10 It is disgraceful that you who obey certain rules say that God will punish your fellow believers who do not obey them. For God will judge each one of us.

\q And everyone will praise me."

===== Translation Notes: =====

Paul continues instructing the believers on right living. 

  * **But you, why do you judge...? And you, why do you despise...?** - Paul is demonstrating how he might have to scold individuals among his readers. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]]) AT: "it is wrong for you to judge...it is wrong for you to despise" (see UDB) or "stop judging...stop despising" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God**  - The "judgment seat" refers to God's authority to judge. AT: "For God will judge us all" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **As I live** - This phrase is used to start an oath or solemn promise. AT: "You can be certain that this is true"
  * **to me every knee will bend, and every tongue will give praise to God**  - Paul uses the words "knee" and "tongue" to refer to the whole person. Also, the Lord uses the word "God" to refer to himself. AT:  "Every person will bow and give praise to me" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
