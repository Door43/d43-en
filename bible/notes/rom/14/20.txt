<usfm>
\v 20 Do not destroy what God has done \add in the life of any believer\add* just because of \add your eating certain kinds of\add* food \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add which that person considers wrong to eat! God\add* permits us to eat every \add kind of food\add*. But if, by your eating \add certain kinds of food\add*, you encourage another person to sin \add by doing what he believes is wrong\add*, you are doing wrong.
\v 21 It is good neither to eat meat nor to drink wine, nor \add to do anything else at any time if it\add* will cause one of your fellow believers to stop trusting in God.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 Do not destroy how God has helped any believer, just because you want to eat a certain kind of food. It is true that God allows us to eat every kind of food. But if you eat something that another believer thinks is wrong, then you are encouraging to do what he thinks is wrong.
\v 21 It is good neither to eat meat nor to drink wine, nor to do anything else at any time if it will cause one of your fellow believers to stop trusting in God.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 Do not destroy the work of God because of food. All things indeed are clean, but it is evil for that person who eats and causes stumbling.
\v 21 It is good not to eat meat, nor to drink wine, nor anything by which your brother takes offense.
