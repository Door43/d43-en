\v 14 Because I am joined to the Lord Jesus, I am absolutely certain that there is nothing that by itself is wrong to eat. But if people think it is wrong to eat something, then for them it is wrong to eat it. So you should not encourage them to eat it.
\v 15 If you eat food that a fellow believer thinks is wrong to eat, you might cause him to stop obeying God. You would no longer be loving him. Do not cause any fellow believer to stop trusting in Christ. After all, Christ died for him, too!

\v 14 I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean by itself, except that for him who considers anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.
\v 15 If because of food your brother is hurt, you no longer walk in love. Do not destroy with your food one for whom Christ died.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus** - Here the word "know" and "am persuaded" mean basically the same thing. Paul uses them to emphasize his certainty. AT: "I am certain because of my relationship with the Lord Jesus" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **except that for him who considers anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean** - This could be translated as a new sentence: "But if a person thinks something is unclean, then for that person it is unclean and he should stay away from it."
  * **If because of food your brother is hurt** - "If you hurt your fellow believer's faith over the matter of food." Here the word "your" refers to the strong in faith and "brother" refers to the weak in faith.
  * **you no longer walk in love**  - "then you are no longer showing love"
