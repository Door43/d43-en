    * **Do not let your good be insulted** - This can be translated with an active verb: "Do not act in a way that causes people to insult what you know is good." Here "your" refers to the strong in faith.
    * **For the kingdom of God is not about food and drink, but about righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.** - "For God did not set up his kingdom so that he could rule over what we eat and drink. He set up his kingdom so we could have a right relationship with him and the Holy Spirit could give us peace and joy."
