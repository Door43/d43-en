<usfm>
\v 16 Similarly, do not do something that fellow believers would call bad, even if you think it is good.
\v 17 When God rules how we live, he does not think about what we eat and drink. Instead, he thinks about whether we obey him, have peace with each other, and rejoice because of the Holy Spirit.
