\v 23 But some believers are not certain \add that God will approve of their eating a certain kind of food\add*. So if they eat it, \add they think that God will punish\add* them. And they \add truly\add* will be punished \f + \ft Or:\add God truly\add* will punish them \f*, because \add they have done things that they\add* believe \add are not right\add*. Those who do anything without being certain \add that God considers it to be right\add* are sinning.

\v 22 Let God tell you what things are right for you to do, but do not try to force others to accept what you believe. God is pleased with those who do what they believe is right and do not feel guilty about it.
\v 23 But some believers are not certain that God will be pleased if they eat a certain kind of food. So if they eat it, they think that God will punish them. And he will truly punish them, because they have done things that they believe are not right. If we do anything without being certain that God considers it to be right, we are sinning.

\v 22 The faith that you have, you have according to yourself before God. Blessed is the one who does not judge himself in respect to what he approves.
\v 23 He who doubts is condemned if he eats, because it is not from faith; and whatever is not from faith is sin.
