===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 Let God tell you \add what things are right for you to do, but do not try to force others to accept what you believe. God is\add* pleased with those who do what they know is right and as a result do not feel guilty \add concerning what they have done\add*, \add because they have done only\add* those things that they believe are right.
\v 23 But some believers are not certain \add that God will approve of their eating a certain kind of food\add*. So if they eat it, \add they think that God will punish\add* them. And they \add truly\add* will be punished \f + \ft Or:\add God truly\add* will punish them \f*, because \add they have done things that they\add* believe \add are not right\add*. Those who do anything without being certain \add that God considers it to be right\add* are sinning.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 Let God tell you what things are right for you to do, but do not try to force others to accept what you believe. And you will please God if you have no doubts about your convictions about what is right and wrong to do.
\v 23 But some believers fear that God will not be pleased if they eat certain kinds of food. And indeed, he will say that they have done wrong, if they do not do what they believe to be right. If we do anything without being certain that God approves of it, we are sinning.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 These particular beliefs that you have, keep them between yourself and God. Blessed is the one who does not condemn himself in respect to what he approves of.
\v 23 He who doubts is condemned if he eats, because it is not from faith; and whatever is not from faith is sin.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **These particular beliefs that you have** - This refers back to the beliefs about food and drink from the previous verse.
    * **you...you...yourself** - singular. Because Paul is addressing the believers, you may have to translate this using plural. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
    * **Blessed is the one who does not condemn himself in respect to what he approves of**  - AT: "Blessed are those who do not feel guilty for what they decide to do"
    * **He who doubts is condemned if he eats** - This can be translated with an active verb. AT: "God will say that the person does wrong if he is not sure if it is right to eat a certain food, but he eats it anyway" (see UDB) or "The person who is not sure if it is right to eat a certain food, but then eats it anyway will have a troubled conscience" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
    * **because it is not from faith** - This can be translated as a new sentence. AT: "God will say that he is wrong because he is eating something he believes God does not want him to eat" 
    * **and whatever is not from faith is sin** - AT: "You are sinning if you do something that you do not believe God wants you to do"
