\v 11 Similarly, you must consider that \add it is as though\add* you have become \add unable to do what your\add* sinful \add desires\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* want, as a corpse \add is not able to do what anyone wants it to do\add*. You must also consider that because of your relationship to Christ Jesus you are living \add in a new way\add* in order to \add serve\f + \ft Or: honor \f*\add* God.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 When he died, he went free from our sinful world, and he will never die again; but because he lives again, he lives in order to serve God.
\v 11 In the same way, you must view yourselves as God views you: you are dead people, unable to sin any longer, but you are also living people, living to worship God and joined to Christ Jesus.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

\v 10 For the death that he died to sin, he died once for all, but the life that he lives, he lives for God.
\v 11 Thus also you: consider yourselves to be dead to sin on the one hand, but on the other hand, alive to God in Christ Jesus.
