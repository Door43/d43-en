===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 When he died, he died once for \add people\add* who had sinned, and he will never die again; but in regard to his living \add again now\add*, he lives in order to \add serve\f + \ft Or: honor \f*\add* God.
\v 11 Similarly, you must consider that \add it is as though\add* you have become \add unable to do what your\add* sinful \add desires\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* want, as a corpse \add is not able to do what anyone wants it to do\add*. You must also consider that because of your relationship to Christ Jesus you are living \add in a new way\add* in order to \add serve\f + \ft Or: honor \f*\add* God.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 When he died, he went free from our sinful world, and he will never die again; but because he lives again, he lives in order to serve God.
\v 11 In the same way, you must view yourselves as God views you: You are dead people, unable to sin any longer; but you are also living people, living to serve God and joined to Christ Jesus.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 For in regard to the death that he died to sin, he died once for all. However, the life that he lives, he lives it for God.
\v 11 In the same way, you also must consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For in regard to the death that he died to sin, he died once for all** - The phrase "once for all" means to finish something completely. You can make this full meaning explicit in your translation. AT: "For when he died he broke the power of sin completely" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **In the same way, you also must consider** - "For this reason consider"
  * **consider yourselves** - "think of yourselves as" or "see yourselves as"
  * **dead to sin** - Just as one cannot force a corpse to do anything, sin has no power to force believers to dishonor God. AT: "as if you were dead to the power of sin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **dead to sin, but alive to God** - "dead to the power of sin, but living to honor God"
  * **alive to God in Christ Jesus** - "living to honor God through the power Christ Jesus gives you"
