\v 22 But you have been freed \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* has freed you \f* from \add letting the desire to\add* sin control you. You have become \add as though you were\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* the slaves of God. So now the result is that God has caused you to completely belong to him and, as a result, you will live eternally.
\v 23 \add What people receive for\add* sinning \add is that they are\add* eternally separated from God. That is \add like\add* wages that \add people receive\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. But what God gives us is a gift. What he gives us is that we live eternally because of \add our relationship with\add* \f + \ft Or: because \add we are united to\add* \f* Christ Jesus our Lord.

\v 22 But now you do not have to sin any longer. You are no longer slaves like that. Instead, you have become slaves of God. In return, he has set you apart as his own people, and he will allow you to live forever, with him.
\v 23 All who do what their evil minds tells them to do receive payment, too, but that payment is death: they will be apart from God forever. But as for God, he pays no wages to his slaves at all. Instead, he gives us a free gift: he allows us to live forever with him, joined to Christ Jesus our Lord.
