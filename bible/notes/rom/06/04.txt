<usfm>
\v 4 So, when we were baptized \f + \ft Or:someone baptized us \f*, \add it was as though\add* we were buried with Christ. \add We were baptized\add* in order to indicate that \add we would not let our sinful desires make us do what they want us to do, just like people cannot make\add* a corpse \add do what they want it to\add* do \f + \ft metaphor \f*. We \add were baptized\add* to \add signify that we would\add* continually conduct our lives in a new way, just like Christ was caused to live again in a new way by the great \add power\add* of \add God his\add* Father.
\v 5 Because of our close relationship with Christ, we have \add separated ourselves from the former way in which we conducted our lives\add*, just like he \add was separated from his physical life when he\add* died \f + \ft metaphor \f*. But God will also certainly \add enable us to live in a new way, just like he\add* enabled Christ to live again.

<usfm>
\v 4 So, when we were baptized, God viewed us also as being with Christ in his tomb. God the Father used his power to raise Christ from the dead; in the same way, he made us also to live again.
\v 5 Since God views us as joining with Christ when he died, he will also make us rise with him from the dead.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we might walk in newness of life.

\v 5 For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we will also be united with his resurrection.
