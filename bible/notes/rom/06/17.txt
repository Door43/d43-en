\v 17 In the past you sinned in whatever way you wanted to sin—you were slaves of sin. But then  you began to sincerely obey what Christ taught you. I thank God for that.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **But thanks be to God!** - "But I thank God!
  *  **For you were servants of sin** - Here "sin" is described as a master that slave would serve. Also, "sin" refers to the power that lives in us that makes us choose to do what is sinful. Alternate translation: "For you were slaves to the power of sin." (See: [[en:ta:translate:personification]] and [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
  *  but you obeyed from the heart the form of teaching that you were given.   **- Paul is giving thanks to God for how the teaching they were given changed their hearts from sin to obedience. This can be translated as: "In the past you sinned in whatever way you wanted to sin—you were slaves of sin. But then you began to sincerely obey what Christ taught you. I thank God for that." (UDB) (See: Metaphor)
  * **enslaved to righteousness**  - The phrase “enslaved to” or “in bondage to” could be translated as “made to be a slave of” or “made to serve” or “under the control of.”
