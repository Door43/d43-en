\v 19 I speak like a man because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members as servants to uncleanness and to evil, even so now present your members as servants to righteousness to sanctification.
\v 20 For when you were servants of sin, you were free from righteousness.
\v 21 What fruit then did you have at that time in the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.
