Since God has done so much for you\f + \ft Or: us \f*\add*, this is the \add only\add* appropriate way to serve him.
\v 2 Do not let anything non-Christian determine how you should act. Instead, let God change your \add way of life\add* by making your way of thinking new, in order that you may know what he wants you to do. That is, you will know what is good, and you will know what pleases\add God\add*, and you will know how to be all that he wants you to be.
