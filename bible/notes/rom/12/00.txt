====== Romans 12 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 12:20, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

Many scholars believe Paul uses the word "therefore" in [[:en:bible:notes:rom:12:01|12:1]] to refer to all of Romans 1-11. Having given such a great explanation of the Christian doctrine, Paul is now going on to say "therefore, in light of these doctrinal truths, go and live this way." The remainder of Romans focuses on living out one's Christian [[:en:obe:kt:faith|faith]]. Paul uses many different commands to give these practical instructions in this chapter.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Christian living ==
Under the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|law of Moses]], people were required to offer sacrifices of animals or grain in the temple, now Christians are required to live their lives as a type of sacrifice to God, since physical sacrifices are no longer required.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Body of Christ ==
The body of Christ is an important [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] or image used in Scripture to refer to the church. Its significance lies in the fact that each member of the church plays a unique and important function. Christians need each other.
