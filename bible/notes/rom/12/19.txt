\v 19 My fellow believers whom I love, do not do evil in return when people do evil to you! Instead, allow God to punish them. The Scriptures say, ""I will pay back those who do evil. It is my right to pay them back,' says the Lord."
\v 20 Instead of doing evil to those who have done evil to you, do as the Scriptures teach: “If your enemies are hungry, feed them! If they are thirsty, give them something to drink. By doing that, you will cause them to feel ashamed and perhaps they will change their attitude toward you.”
\v 21 Do not let evil deeds that others have done to you overcome you Instead, do for them better than  what they have done to you.!

\v 19 Do not avenge yourselves, beloved, but give way to the wrath of God. For it is written, " 'Vengeance belongs to me; I will repay,' says the Lord."
\v 20 But if your enemy is hungry, feed him. If he is thirsty, give him a drink. For if you do this you will heap coals of fire on his head.
\v 21 Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
