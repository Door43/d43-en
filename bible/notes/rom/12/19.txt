\v 19 My fellow believers whom I love, do not do evil in return when people do evil to you! Instead, allow God to punish them. The scriptures say, "'I will pay back those who do evil. It is my right to pay them back,' says the Lord."
\v 20 Instead of doing evil to those who have done evil to you, do as the scriptures teach: "If your enemies are hungry, feed them! If they are thirsty, give them something to drink. By doing that, you will cause them to feel the pain of shame and perhaps they will change their attitude toward you."
\v 21 Do not let evil deeds that others have done to you overcome you. Instead, do for them better than what they have done to you!

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **give way to the wrath of God** - Here "wrath" is a metonym for God's punishment. AT: "allow God to punish them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **For it is written** - You can translate this in an active form. AT: "For someone has written" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) 
  * **Vengeance belongs to me; I will repay** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that God will avenge his people. AT: "I will certainly avenge you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **your enemy ... feed him ... give him a drink ... if you do this, you will heap ... Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil** - All forms of "you" and "your" are addressed as to one person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **But if your enemy is hungry ... his head** - In 12:20 Paul quotes another part of Scripture. AT: "But the Scripture also says, 'If your enemy is hungry ... his head'"
  * **feed him** - "give him some food"
  * **heap coals of fire on his head** - Paul speaks of the blessings that the enemies will receive as if someone were pouring hot coals on their heads. Possible meanings are 1) "make the person who harmed you feel badly about how he has mistreated you" or 2) "give God a reason to judge your enemy more harshly." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good** - Paul describes "evil" as though it were a person. You can translate this in an active form. AT: "Do not let those who are evil defeat you, but defeat those who are evil by doing what is good" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
