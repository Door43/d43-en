=== What is the Book of Romans about? ===

Rome was the most important city in the Mediterranean area at that time. Paul wrote this letter to the Christians in Rome in order to get them ready to receive him as a visitor. He stated his purpose was to "bring about the obedience of faith" (16:26). 

In his letter to the Christians in Rome, Paul writes the fullest description of his understanding of the gospel of Jesus Christ. He explains that God offers everyone his love and acceptance through Jesus Christ. This is true, even though there were at that time deep divisions between Jews and non-Jews.
 
=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "Romans." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as "Paul's Letter to the Church in Rome," or "A Letter to the Christians in Rome." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])

=== Who wrote the Book of Romans? ===

Paul from the city of Tarsus was the author. He had been known as Saul in his early life, when as a Pharisee he was a determined persecutor of Christians. After he began to trust in Jesus Christ, he made a number of missionary journeys in order to preach the gospel among both Jews and non-Jews living outside the land of Israel.

He probably wrote this letter while he was staying in the city of Corinth in Greece, on his third missionary journey. 

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== What are the titles used to refer to Jesus? ===

In Romans, Paul describes Jesus Christ by many titles and descriptions: Jesus Christ (1:1), the Seed of David (1:3), the Son of God (1:4), the Lord Jesus Christ (1:7), Christ Jesus (3:24), Propitiation (3:25), Jesus (3:26), Jesus our Lord (4:24), Lord of Hosts (9:29), a Stumbling Stone and Rock of Offence (9:33), the End of the Law (10:4), the Deliverer (11:26), Lord of the Dead and the Living (14:9), and the Root of Jesse (15:12).

=== How should theological terms in Romans be translated? ===

Romans contains many theological terms that do not occur very much in the four gospels. As early Christians thought more about the meaning of Jesus Christ and his message, they realized that they needed words and expressions for new ideas, such as "justification" (5:1), "works of the law" (3:20) and "gospel" (2:16). Other such terms are "righteousness" (1:17), "grace" (1:7), "reconcile" (5:10), "salvation" (1:16), "propitiation" (3:25), "sanctification" (6:19), "glorify" (8:17) and "the old man" (6:6).

The "key terms" dictionary can help translators understand many of these terms. Also, many of the terms are abstract concepts. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])

Terms such as those given above are complicated to explain. It is often hard or impossible for translators to find equivalent terms in their own languages. It can help to know that word equivalents of these terms are not necessary. Instead, translators are free to develop any short expressions they can in order to communicate these ideas. For example, the term "gospel" can be translated as "the good news about Jesus Christ." "Grace" can be translated as "God's kind gifts" or "God's acceptance of people," etc. 

Translators should also remember that some of these terms have more than one meaning, depending on the context in which it is used. For example, "righteousness" sometimes signals the idea that a person can perfectly obey God's law. At other times, "righteousness" signals the idea that Jesus Christ has obeyed God's law for us, and that God allows us to share in Christ's obedience.


=== What does Paul mean by "a remnant" of Israel (11:5)? ===

The idea of a "remnant" (a few people who have survived a disaster) is important both in the Old Testament and for Paul. Most of the Israelites were either killed or scattered among other people when the Assyrians and then the Babylonians conquered their land. Only a relatively few Jews survived. They were known as "the remnant."

In 11:1-9, Paul speaks of another remnant. These are the Jews who trusted in Jesus Christ. Because of that, God saved them.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== What does Paul mean by being "in Christ"? ===

This kind of expression occurs in 3:24; 6:11, 23; 8:1,2,39; 9:1; 12:5,17; 15:17; and 16:3,7,9,10. Paul uses a metaphor ("in Christ") to express the reality of the Christian believer's relationship to Jesus Christ. In this relationship, the believer is saved, is made into a friend with God, and is promised eternity with him. However, this idea can be difficult to represent in many languages, so translators must become very creative.

While expressing the believer's relationship to Christ, Paul at the same time often uses phrases such as "in Christ," "in Jesus Christ," and "in the Lord" with more specific meanings that depend on context. For example, in 3:24 ("the redemption that is in Christ Jesus"), Paul refers to the redemption that we have "because" of Jesus Christ. In 8:9 ("you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit"), Paul speaks of the believers' submission "to" the Holy Spirit. In 9:1 ("I tell the truth in Christ"), Paul means that he is telling the truth that "is in agreement with" Jesus Christ. 

Nevertheless, the basic idea of our union with Jesus Christ (and with the Holy Spirit) is evident in these passages as well. This application of a double sense frequently occurs when words of multiple senses appear. Note that even the basic idea of union with Christ Jesus depends on a metaphorical understanding of the preposition "in," which in its concrete sense expresses the idea of physical location.

Therefore, the translator has a choice in many passages that use "in." He will often decide to represent only the more immediate sense of "in": "by means of," "in the manner of," "in regard to," etc. But if the project language allows the background sense of "in union with" to appear at the same time, the translator may well decide to translate in such a way as to allow that secondary meaning to show. 

=== How are the ideas of "holy," "saints" or "holy ones," and "sanctify" represented in Romans ULB? ===

The scriptures use such words to indicate any one of various ideas. For this reason, it is often difficult for translators to represent them well in their versions. In translating into English, Romans ULB uses the following principles:
  * Sometimes the context mainly implies moral holiness. Especially important for understanding the gospel is the fact that God views Christians as sinless because they are united to Jesus Christ. Another related fact is that that God is perfect and faultless. A third fact is that Christians are to conduct themselves in a blameless and faultless manner in life. In these cases, the ULB uses "holy," "holy God," "holy ones" or "holy people." (See: 1:7)
  * Sometimes the context mainly indicates a simple reference to Christians without implying any particular role filled by them. In cases where some other English versions have "saints" or "holy ones," the ULB uses "believers." (See: 8:27; 12:13; 15:25, 26, 31; 16:2, 15)
  * Sometimes the context mainly implies the idea of someone or something set apart for God alone. In these cases, the ULB uses "set apart," "dedicated to" or "reserved for." (See: 15:16)

As translators think about how to represent these ideas in their own versions, they will often be helped by the choices made in the ULB.

=== What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Romans? ===

The following are the most significant textual issues in the Book of Romans:

  * "he [God] works all things together for good" (8:28). Some older versions read, "All things work together for good."
  * "But if it is by grace, it is no longer by works. Otherwise grace would no longer be grace." (11:6) The best ancient copies have this reading. However, some versions read: "But if it is by works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work."
  * "May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen." (16:24) The best ancient copies do not have this verse.

Translators are advised not to translate this last passage. However, if older Bible versions exist in their region that have it, it is not wrong to translate it. If it is translated, it should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that it is probably not original to the Book of Romans. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_textvariants]])
