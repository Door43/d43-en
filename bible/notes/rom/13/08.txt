\v 9 \add There are many things that God\add* commanded \add in his laws, such as\add* do not commit adultery, do not murder \add anyone\add*, do not steal, and do not desire anything that belongs to someone else. But the command by which they are all summed up \f + \ft Or:that includes them all \f* is this: Each of you must love the people with whom you come in contact, just like you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* love yourself.
\v 10 If you love people with whom you come in contact \f + \ft personification \f*, you will not do any evil to them \f + \ft litotes \f*. So, whoever loves \add others\add* fulfills all that \add God's\add* laws \add require\add*.

\v 8 Pay all of your debts when you are supposed to pay them. The only thing that is like a debt that you should never stop paying is to love one another. Whoever loves others has fulfilled all that God requires in his law.
\v 9 There are many things that God has commanded in his law, such as do not commit adultery, do not murder anyone, do not steal, and do not desire anything that belongs to someone else. But we can sum up the meaning of all the law in this sentence: "Love your neighbor as you love yourself."
\v 10 If you love everyone around you, you will harm no one. So whoever loves others fulfills all that God's law requires.

\v 8 Owe no one anything, except to love one another. For he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.
\v 9 For, "You will not commit adultery, you will not kill, you will not steal, you will not covet," and if there is any other commandment also, it is summed up in this sentence: "You will love your neighbor as yourself."
\v 10 Love does not harm one's neighbor. Therefore, love is the fulfilment of the law.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul tells believers how to act toward neighbors.
  * **Owe no one anything except to love one another** - This is a double negative. You can translate it in a positive form. AT: "Pay all you owe to everyone and love one another" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])

  * **love** - This refers to the kind of love that comes from God and focuses on the good of others, even when it does not benefit oneself. 
  * **You will** - All occurrences of "you" in 13:9 are singular, but the speaker was addressing a group of people as if they were one person. If this is not natural in your language, you may need to use plural forms here. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **covet** - to desire to have or possess something that another person possesses.
