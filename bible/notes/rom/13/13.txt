\v 13 We must behave properly, as though the time when Christ will return were already here. We must not get drunk and do evil things with others. We must not commit any kind of sexual immorality. We must not quarrel. We must not be jealous of other people.
\v 14 On the contrary, we should be like the Lord Jesus Christ so that others will see what he is like. You should stop wanting to do the things that your old evil heart wants to do.

\v 14 But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, for its lusts.
