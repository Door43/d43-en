\v 13 We must behave properly, as though the time when Christ will return were already here. We must not get drunk and do evil things with others. We must not commit any kind of sexual immorality or wild sensual behavior. We must not quarrel. We must not be jealous of other people.
\v 14 On the contrary, we should be like the Lord Jesus Christ so that others will see what he is like. You should stop wanting to do the things that your old evil nature wants to do.

\v 13 Let us walk appropriately, as in the day, not in wild celebrations or drunkenness. And let us not walk in sexual immorality or in uncontrolled lust, and not in strife or jealousy.
\v 14 But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, for its lusts.

  * **Let us** - Paul includes his readers and other believers with himself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
  * **Let us walk appropriately as in the day,** - Paul speaks of living as true believers as if one were walking while it is day. AT: "Let us walk in a visible way knowing that everyone can see us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in sexual immorality or in uncontrolled lust** - These concepts mean basically the same thing. You can combine them in your translation. AT: "sexually immoral acts" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]]) 
  * **strife** - This refers to plotting against and arguing with other people.
  * **jealousy** - This refers to negative feelings against another person's success or advantage over others.
  * **put on the Lord Jesus Christ** - Paul speaks of accepting the moral nature of Christ as if he were our outer clothing that people can see. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **put on** - If your language has a plural form for commands, use it here.
  * **make no provision for the flesh** - Here the "flesh" refers to the self-directed nature of people who oppose God. This is the sinful nature of human beings. AT: "do not allow your old evil heart any opportunity at all for doing wicked things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
