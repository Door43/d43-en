====== Romans 13 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

In Judaism, there was a close and intended connection between the government and the religion of the people in Israel. Christianity does not usually have this same connection and Paul felt that it was important to now instruct Christians how to live under an [[:en:obe:kt:ungodly|ungodly]] ruler. This is the focus of the first part of this chapter. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Ungodly rulers ==
Some of the concepts about ungodly rulers in this chapter may be difficult to understand, especially in cultures where the church is persecuted by the government. Christians must obey both God and their rulers. Some times rulers can be disobeyed but there are times when a believer must submit to these ruler and suffer at their hands. This is because the Christian understands that this world is temporary and they will ultimately spend eternity with God.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Flesh ==

This is a complex issue and it is possible that "flesh" is a [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|metaphor]] for a person's sinful nature.
