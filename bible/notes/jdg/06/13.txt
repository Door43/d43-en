\v 13 Gideon said to him, “Oh, my master, if Yahweh is with us, why then has all this happened to us? Where are all his wonderful deeds that our fathers told us about, when they said, ‘Did not Yahweh bring us up from Egypt?’ But now Yahweh has abandoned us and given us over to the power of Midian.”

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **my master**  - Gideon uses the word “master” as a polite way to greet a stranger. He does not realize this Yahweh in the form of an angel.
  * **given us over to the power of Midian**  - AT: "allowed us to be defeated in battle and ruled by the people from Gideon"
