\v 22 Gideon understood that this was the angel of Yahweh. Gideon said, “Ah, Lord Yahweh! For I have seen the angel of Yahweh face to face!”
\v 23 Yahweh said to him, “Peace to you! Do not be afraid, you will not die.”
\v 24 So Gideon built an altar there to Yahweh. He called it, Yahweh is Peace. To this day it still stands at Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
