\v 39 Then Gideon said to God, “May your anger not be kindled against me, and I will speak only one time more; let me make another test, I beg you, just once more with the fleece. Now let it be dry only on the fleece, and let there be dew on all the surrounding ground.”
\v 40 God did so that night; for it was dry only on the fleece, and there was dew on all the surrounding ground.
