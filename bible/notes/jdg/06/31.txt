\v 31 But Joash replied, "Are you trying to defend Baal? Are you trying to argue his case? Anyone who tries to defend Baal should be executed by tomorrow morning! If Baal is truly a god, he ought to be able to defend himself, and to get rid of the person who tore down his altar!"
\v 32 From that time, people called Gideon Jerub-Baal, which means 'Baal should defend himself,' because he tore down Baal's altar.

\v 31 But Joash replied to those who came against him, "Are you trying to defend Baal? Are you trying to argue his case? Anyone who tries to defend Baal should be executed by tomorrow morning! If Baal is truly a god, he ought to be able to defend himself, when someone tears down his altar!"
\v 32 From that time, people called Gideon Jerub Baal, which means "Baal should defend himself," because he had torn down Baal's altar.

\v 31 Joash said to all who opposed him, "Will you plead the case for Baal? Will you save him? Whoever pleads the case for him, let him be put to death while it is still morning. If Baal is a god, let him defend himself when someone pulls his altar apart."
\v 32 Therefore on that day they called Gideon "Jerub Baal," because he said, "Let Baal defend himself against him," because Gideon broke down Baal's altar.
