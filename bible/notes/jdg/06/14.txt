\v 14 Yahweh looked at him and said, “Go in this strength you have. Deliver Israel from the power of the Midianites. Have I not sent you?”
\v 15 Gideon said to him, “Please, Lord, how can I deliver Israel? See, my family is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least important in my father’s house.”

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Yahweh looked at him** - "Yahweh looked at Gideon"
  * **Have I not sent you?** - Yahweh is emphasizing the he is the one sending Gideon.  AT: "I have sent you." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **Please, Lord** - "Please listen to my concerns, Lord"  Gideon now realizes that he is talking to Yahweh, not another human being as in the previous verse.
