===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Yahweh looked at him** - "Yahweh looked at Gideon"
  * **from the hand** - Here "hand" represents power or control. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **of Midian** - Here "Midian" represents the people of Midian. AT: "of the Midianites" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Have I not sent you?** - Yahweh uses a question to ensure Gideon that he is sending him. Here "sent" means Yahweh has appointed Gideon with a specific task. AT: "I, Yahweh, am sending you!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Please, Lord** - Gideon now calls the person "Lord" instead of "my master" as in [[:en:bible:notes:jdg:06:13|6:13]]. Here it seems Gideon either knows or suspects that he is speaking with Yahweh.
  * **how can I deliver Israel?** - Gideon uses a question to emphasize that he does not think he can rescue the Israelites. AT: "I cannot possibly rescue the Israelites!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **See** - "Please understand" or "Listen"
  * **in Manasseh** - "in the tribe of Manasseh"
  * **in my father's house** - Here "house" represents a family. AT: "in my father's family" or "in my family" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
