\v 11 Now the angel of Yahweh came and sat under the oak in Ophrah, which belonged to Joash (the Abiezrite), while Gideon, Joash's son, was separating out the wheat by beating it on the floor, in the winepress—to hide it from the Midianites.
\v 12 The angel of Yahweh appeared to him and said to him, “Yahweh is with you, you strong warrior!”
