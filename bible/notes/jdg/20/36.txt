\v 36 So the people of Benjamin saw that they were defeated; the men of Israel had given ground to Benjamin, because they were counting on the men whom they had placed in ambush against Gibeah.
\v 37 Then the men in ambush hurried and rushed into Gibeah; they hurried in and struck down all the city’s inhabitants with the edge of the sword.
\v 38 Now the arranged signal between the men of Israel and the men in ambush had been that they should make a large column of smoke rise up out of the city.
