\v 5 The men of Gibeah attacked me, and surrounded the house around me by night. They were intending to kill me and rape my concubine, and now she is dead.
\v 6 I took my concubine and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel; for those people have committed this obscene act, this wickedness, in Israel.
\v 7 See, you people of Israel, all of you, give us here your advice and plans.”
