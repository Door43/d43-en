\v 5 During the night the relatives of Gibeah attacked me, surrounding the house and intending to kill me. They seized and slept with my concubine, and she died.
\v 6 I took my concubine and cut her body into pieces, and sent them into each region of Israel's inheritance, because they have committed such wickedness and outrage in Israel.
\v 7 Now, all you Israelites, speak up and give your advice and attention to this!"

  * **Now** - This word is used to introduce the conclusion of the speech of the Levite.
  * **advice and attention** - "advice and counsel." These two words refer to the same thing and are repeated to emphasize that it will be the Israelites who will decide what to do. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
