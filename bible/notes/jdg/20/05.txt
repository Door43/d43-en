\v 5 During the night, the leaders of Gibeah attacked me, surrounding the house and intending to kill me. They seized and raped my concubine, and she died.
\v 6 I took my concubine and cut her body into pieces, and sent them into each region of Israel's inheritance, because they have committed such wickedness and outrage in Israel.
\v 7 Now, all you Israelites, speak up and give your advice and attention to this!"
