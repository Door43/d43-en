===== translationNotes: =====

  * **None of us will to go to his tent and none of us will return to his house** - AT: "We will all stay here." These two lines talk about the same thing and are used together to emphasize how committed they were. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **But now** - These words introduce the main portion of what the people say after the initial exclamation.
  * **as the lot directs** - Here this involved tossing or rolling small marked stones or pieces of broken pottery. The person who rolled the specially marked piece would be chosen.
