===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **None of us will to go to his tent and none of us will return to his house** - AT: "We will all stay here." These two lines talk about the same thing and are used together to emphasize how committed they were. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **But now** - These words introduce the main portion of what the people say after the initial exclamation.
