\v 12 The tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, “What is this wickedness that was done among you?
\v 13 Therefore, give us those wicked men of Gibeah, so we may put them to death, and so we will completely remove this evil from Israel.” But the Benjaminites would not listen to the voice of their brothers, the people of Israel.
