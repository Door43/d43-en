\v 27-28 At that time, the sacred chest that contained the stone tablets on which were written the Ten Commandments was there at Bethel. A priest named Phinehas, the son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron, often stood in front of that chest \add and talked with Yahweh\add*. While he stood there on that day, he asked Yahweh, "Shall we go again to fight against our fellow Israelites from the tribe of Benjamin, or shall we stop fighting against them?"
\p Yahweh answered, "Go again tomorrow, because tomorrow I will enable you to defeat them."
