\v 1 Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of courage, and he was the son of a prostitute; and Gilead was the father of Jephthah.
\v 2 Gilead’s wife bore him sons; when his wife’s sons grew up, they drove Jephthah out and said to him, “You will
not inherit in our father’s house, for you are the son of another woman.”
\v 3 Then Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob; worthless men gathered to Jephthah, and
they went out following him.
