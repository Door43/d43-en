\v 9 Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “If you bring me home again to fight with the people of Ammon, and if Yahweh delivers them before me, will I be your head?”
\v 10 The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “May Yahweh be witness between us! We will certainly act according to everything you say.”
