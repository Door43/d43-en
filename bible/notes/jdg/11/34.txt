\v 34 Jephthah came to his home at Mizpah, and there his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dancing. She was his only child, and beside her he had neither son nor daughter.
\v 35 As soon as he saw her, he tore his clothes and said, “Oh! My daughter! You have crushed me with sorrow, and you have become one who causes me pain! For I  have made an oath to Yahweh, and I cannot turn back on my promise.”
