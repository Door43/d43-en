\v 34 Jephthah came to his home at Mizpah, and there his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dancing. She was his only child, and beside her he had neither son nor daughter.
\v 35 As soon as he saw her, he tore his clothes and said, “Oh! My daughter! You have crushed me with sorrow, and you have become one who causes me pain! For I  have made an oath to Yahweh, and I cannot turn back on my promise.”

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **tambourines** - Musical instruments you hold in one hand and shake to make a sound, often used to celebrate.
  * **he tore his clothes** - This is an act that shows mourning or great sadness.
  * **You have crushed me with sorrow, and you have become one who causes me pain!** - These two statements show how much Jephthah felt sad about his oath. They are both expressing the same thing in two different ways. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **crushed me with sorrow** - "made me collapse on my knees" or "destroyed me with sadness" AT: "made me extremely sad"
