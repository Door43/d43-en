\v 26 While Israel lived in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along by the side
of the Arnon, three hundred youars; wherefore did you not recover them within that time?
\v 27 I therefore have not sinned against thee, but you do me wrong to war against me: Jehovah, the Judge, be judge this
day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.
\v 28 Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon listened not to the words of Jephthah which he sent him.
