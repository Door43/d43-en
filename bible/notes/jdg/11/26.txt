<usfm>
\v 26 While Israel lived for three hundred years in Heshbon and its villages, and in Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities that are along the banks of the Arnon—why then did you not take them back during that time?
\v 27 I have not done you wrong, but you are doing me wrong by attacking me. Yahweh, the judge, will decide today between the people of Israel and the people of Ammon.'”
\v 28 But the king of the people of Ammon rejected the warning Jephthah sent him.

Jephthah's messengers continues to speak.

  * **three hundred years** - "300 years" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **Heshbon** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:jdg:11:19|11:19]].
  * **Aroer** - This is the name of a city. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Arnon** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:jdg:11:12|11:13]].
  * **why then did you not take them back during that time?** - This question is used to show that now it is too late to take back the land. AT: "you should have taken them back during that time" or "now it is too late; you should have taken them back long ago" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **I have not done you wrong, but you are doing me wrong by attacking me** - Jephthah is telling the king of Ammon that he has not done anything bad to the Ammonites and they are bad to attack the Israelites. This is a warning to the king of Ammon.
