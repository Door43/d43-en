===== translationNotes: =====

  * **So Jephthah passed through ... Yahweh gave him victory ... He attacked** - Since Jephthah was the leader of his army, he and his army is often spoken of as himself. AT: "So Jephthah and his army passed through ... Yahweh gave them victory ... they attacked" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Aroer** - Translate the name of this city the same way you did in [[:en:bible:notes:jdg:11:26|11:26]].
  * **Minnith ... Abel Keramim** - These are the names of cities. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **twenty cities** - "including 20 cities" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
