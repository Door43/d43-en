\v 17 They sent messengers to the king of the Edom people-group, to say to him, "Please allow us Israelites to walk across your land." But the king of the Edom people-group refused. Later we sent the same message to the king of the Moab people-group, but he refused to allow the Israelites to go through his land. So the Israelites stayed at Kadesh \add for a long time\add*.
\v 18 Then the Israelites went into the desert and walked outside the borders of the Edom and Moab regions. They walked east of the Moab region, east of the Arnon \add River, which is the eastern border of the Moab region\add*. They did not cross that river to enter the Moab \add region\add*.

\v 17 Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, “Let me, I beg you, pass through your land,” but the king of
Edom did not listen. In the same manner, he sent messengers to the king of Moab; but he refused. So Israel stayed at Kadesh.
\v 18 Then they went through the wilderness and went around the land of Edom and the land of Moab, and came by the east side
of the land of Moab. They camped on the other side of the Arnon, but they did not come inside the borders of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab.
