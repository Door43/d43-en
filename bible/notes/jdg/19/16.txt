\v 16 Finally, in the evening, an old man came by. He had been working in the fields. He was from the hilly area of the tribe of Ephraim, but at that time he was living in Gibeah.
\v 17 He realized that the man from the tribe of Levi was only traveling and did not have a home in that city. So he asked the man, "Where have you come from? And where are you going?"

\v 16 And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even: now the man was of the hill-country of
Ephraim, and he sojourned in Gibeah; but the men of the place were Benjamites.
\v 17 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city; and the old man said, Whither go thou?
and whence come thou?
