\v 7 When the Levite got up to leave, the father of the young woman urged him to stay, so he changed his plan and spent the night there again.
\v 8 On the fifth day he woke up early to leave, but the girl's father said, "Strengthen yourself, and wait until the afternoon." So the two of them had a meal.
