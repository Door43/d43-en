\v 3 Her husband rose and went after her to speak kindly to her, in order to bring her back. He had his servant with him and
a couple of donkeys. She brought him into her father’s house; when the father of the girl saw him, he was glad that he had come.
\v 4 His father-in-law, the girl’s father, kept him from leaving, so that he stayed there for three days. They ate and drank, and they slept there.
