\v 48 And Abimelech got him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his
hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it up, and laid it on his shoulder: and he said to the people that were
with him, What you have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.
\v 49 And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the stronghold, and set
the stronghold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.
