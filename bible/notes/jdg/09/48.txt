\v 48 Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people who were with him; Abimelech took an axe in his
hand and cut down a bough from the trees, took it up, and laid it on his shoulder. He said to the people who were
with him, “What you have seen me do, hurry and do as I have done.”
\v 49 In the same way, all the people cut down every man his bough and followed Abimelech. They placed them against the stronghold, and set
the stronghold on fire with them. In this way, all the men in the tower of Shechem also died, about one thousand men and women.
