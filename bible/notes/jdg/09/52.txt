\v 52 Abimelech came to the tower and fought against it, and went up to the door of the tower to burn it.
\v 53 But a certain woman threw down an upper millstone on Abimelech’s head and broke his skull.
\v 54 Then he called in a hurry to the young man who was his armor bearer; he said to him, “Draw your sword and kill me, so that men may no say of me, ‘A woman killed him.’”  So his young man thrust him through, and he died.
