\v 22 Abimelech ruled over Israel for three years.
\v 23 God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the leaders of Shechem.  The leaders of Shechem betrayed the trust they had with Abimelech.
\v 24 God did this so the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerub Baal might be avenged, and Abimelech their brother would be held responsible for murdering them; and the men of Shechem would be held responsible because they helped him murder his brothers.
