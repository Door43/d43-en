\v 18 But now you have rebelled against my father's family, and you have killed 69 of his sons on one huge rock. And you have appointed Abimelech—who is the son of my father's slave girl, \add not the son of his wife\add*—to be the king who will rule you people of Shechem. You have done that only because he is one of your relatives!
