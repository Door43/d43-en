\v 17 \add Do not forget that\add* my father fought a battle for you, and he was willing to die for you \add if that were necessary\add*, to save you from the power of the Midian people-group.
\v 18 But now you have rebelled against my father's family, and you have killed 69 of his sons on one huge rock. And you have appointed Abimelech—who is the son of my father's slave girl, \add not the son of his wife\add*—to be the king who will rule you people of Shechem. You have done that only because he is one of your relatives!

\v 17 —and to think that my father fought for you, risked his life, and rescued you out of the hand of Midian—
\v 18 but today you have risen up against my father's house and have killed his sons, seventy persons, upon one stone. And you have made Abimelech, the son of his female servant, king over the leaders of Shechem, because he is your relative.
