===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Gaal, Zebul**  - These are the names of men. See how you translated these in [[en:bible:notes:jdg:09:26|Judges 9:26]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]).
  * **You are seeing the shadows on the hills like they are men. **- Zebul is trying to confuse Gaal by saying this means that the shade on the hills looked similar to men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **one unit**  - "1 group" or "1 troop"  (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
