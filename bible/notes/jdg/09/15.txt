\v 16 After Jotham finished telling them this parable, he said, "So now I ask you, were you being completely honest and sincere when you appointed Abimelech to be your king?

Jotham continues telling his fable where trees represent various people groups and makes the application.

  * **thornbush **- (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **If you truly want...** - This is only a possibility. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **safety** - "to be safe" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **fire come out of the thornbush and let it burn up the cedars of Lebanon**  - This means to let the thornbush burn so that it will burn the cedars.
  * **if you have done well concerning Jerub Baal**  - Jotham offer the possibility that they have treated Jerub Baal as he deserves. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
