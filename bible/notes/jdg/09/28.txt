<usfm>
\v 28 Gaal, the son of Ebed, said, “Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of
Jerubbaal? And is not Zebul his officer? You are serving the men of Hamor, Shechem’s father, but why should we serve him?
\v 29 I wish that this people were under my hand! Then would I remove Abimelech. I would tell Abimelech, ‘Bring your army out to fight.’”
