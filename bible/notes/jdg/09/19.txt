\v 19 If you acted with honesty and integrity with Jerub Baal and his house, then you should rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you.
\v 20 But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech and burn up the men of Shechem and Beth Millo. Let fire come out from the men of Shechem and Beth Millo, to burn up Abimelech."
\v 21 Jotham fled and ran away, and he went to Beer. He lived there because it was far away from Abimelech, his brother.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **If you acted with honesty and integrity with Jerub Baal and his house** - Jotham offered the possibility that what they did was good, but Jotham does not actually believe what they did was good. AT: "If you treated Jerub Baal and his family as they deserved to be treated" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **Jerub Baal** - This is another name for Gideon. It means "let Baal defend himself." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jdg:06:31| 6:32]].
  * **his house** - Here "house" refers to family. AT: "his family" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **But if not** - Jotham offered the opposite possibility that what they did was evil and applied a curse. Jotham does believe what they did was evil. AT: "But if you treated Jerub Baal and his family as they did not deserve to be treated" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **let fire come out from Abimelech and burn up the men of Shechem** - Jotham is speaking a curse. He speaks of Abimelech destroying the people of Shechem as if he would burn them with fire. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Let fire come out from the men of Shechem and Beth Millo, to burn up Abimelech** - Jotham is speaking a curse. He speaks of the people of Shechem and Beth Millo destroying Abimelech as if they would burn him with fire. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
