\v 19 If then you acted with honesty and integrity with Jerub Baal and his house, then you should rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you.
\v 20 But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech and burn up the men of Shechem and the house of Millo. Let fire come out from the men of Shechem and  Beth Millo, to burn up Abimelech.‚Äù
\v 21 Jotham fled and ran away, and he went to Beer. He lived there because it was far away from Abimelech, his brother.
