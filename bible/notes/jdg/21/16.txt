  * **Benjaminites** - This refers to the descendants of Benjamin. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jdg:03:15|3:15]].
  * **the women of Benjamin have been killed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "we killed all the Benjaminite women" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **There must be an inheritance ... is not destroyed from Israel** - The Israelites are exxagerating. They had already given wives to four hundred of the Benjaminites, so the tribe would not be completely destroyed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
