\v 22 If their fathers or brothers come to us and complain \add about what you have done\add*, we will say to them, 'Act kindly toward the men of the tribe of Benjamin. When we fought them, we did not \add leave any women alive to become their\add* wives, and you did not give those young women to the men from the tribe of Benjamin. \add They stole them\add*. So you will not be guilty, \add even though you said that you would not allow any of your daughters to marry one of them\add*.'~"

\v 22 When their fathers or their brothers come to protest to us, we will say to them, 'Show us favor! Let them remain because we did not get wives for each man during the war. And you are innocent regarding the promise, because you did not give your daughters to them.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Show us favor!** - The abstract noun "favor" can be stated as an action. AT: "Act kindly toward us and toward the men of Benjamin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **because we did not get wives for each man during the war** - The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. AT: "because we did not get wives for each of them during the war with Jabesh Gilead" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **you are innocent ... not give your daughters to them** - This refers to the men of Shiloh. They did not voluntarily give their daughters to the Benjaminites, and therefore did not break their promise not to do that.
