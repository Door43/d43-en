When we fought them, we did not \add leave any women alive to become their\add* wives, and you did not give those young women to the men from the tribe of Benjamin. \add They stole them\add*. So you will not be guilty, \add even though you said that you would not allow any of your daughters to marry one of them\add*.'~"

\v 22 When their fathers or their brothers come to protest to us, we will say to them, ‘Show us favor! Let them remain because we did not get wives during the war.  And you are innocent regarding the promise, because you did not give your daughters to them.'”
