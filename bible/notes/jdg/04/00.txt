====== Judges 04 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===
Chapters 4 and 5 form one section about Barak and Deborah.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Barak's leadership ==

At this time, it was very unusual for a woman to be a leader, especially a military leader. Barak lacked the strength to go into battle without Deborah. This indicates that Barak was a poor leader. If a woman won the battle for him, it would have brought Barak shame. It also indicates that Deborah was very well respected. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
