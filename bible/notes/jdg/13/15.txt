\v 15  Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh, “I beg you, let us delay your going a little, so that we may prepare a young goat for you.”
\v 16 The angel of Yahweh said to Manoah, “Even if you keep me here, I will not eat your food; and if you wish to make
a burnt offering, you must offer it to Yahweh.” For Manoah did not know that he was the angel of Yahweh.
