Until then, you must not drink any wine or any alcoholic\f + \ft Or: fermented \f* drink, and you must not eat any food that would make you unacceptable to God.

\v 6 The woman ran and told her husband, "A man whom God sent came to me. I was very afraid of him, because he was like an angel from God. I did not ask where he came from, and he did not tell me his name.
\v 7 But he told me, 'You have become pregnant, and you will give birth to a son. Until then, you must not drink any wine or any alcoholic drink, and you must not eat any food that the law says you are not to eat; it would be unacceptable to God for you to eat it. Your son will be dedicated to God even before he is born, and until the day he dies.'"

\v 6 Then the woman came and told her husband, â€œA man of God came to me, and his appearance was like that of an angel of God, and he caused me to be very afraid. I did not ask him where he came from, and he did not tell me his name.
\v 7 He said to me, 'Look! You will become pregnant, and you will give birth to a son. So then drink no wine or strong drink, and do not eat any food that the law declares to be unclean, because the child will be a Nazirite to God from the time he is in your womb until the day of his death.'"
