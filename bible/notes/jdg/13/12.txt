\v 12 So Manoah said, "Now may your words come true. What will be the rules for the child, and what will be his work?"
\v 13 The angel of Yahweh said to Manoah, "She must carefully do everything that I said to her.
\v 14 She may not eat anything that comes from the vines, and do not let her drink wine or strong drink; do not let her eat any food that the law declares to be unclean. She should obey everything I commanded her to do."
