\v 3 And the angel of Jehovah appeared to the woman, and said to her, Behold now, you are barren, and bear not; but
you shall conceive, and bear a son.
\v 4 Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:
\v 5 for, lo, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come upon his head; for the child shall be a Nazirite
to God from the womb: and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.
