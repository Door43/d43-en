===== translationNotes: =====

  * **with the grain offering** - This law requires a grain offering to be offered when a burnt offering is made. AT: "with the grain offering required with it" or "with the grain offering to accompany it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **on the rock** - "on the altar." The altar Manoah sacrificed the offering on was a rock. 
  * **He did something** - "the angel did something"
  * **the angel of Yahweh went up in the flame of the altar** - "the angel of Yahweh went back up into heaven through the flames on the altar"
  * **lay facedown on the ground** - "lay with their faces to the ground." This is a sign of respect and honor, but it also shows their fear of Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
