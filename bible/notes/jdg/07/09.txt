\v 11 Go down and listen to what some of the Midian soldiers are saying. Then you will be very encouraged, and you will be ready to attack their camp." So Gideon took Purah with him, and they went down to the edge of the enemy camp.

\v 9 It came about the same night that Yahweh said to him, “Arise, go down into the camp; for I have delivered it into your hand.
\v 10 But if you are afraid to go down, go first with Purah, your servant, down to the camp.
\v 11 You will hear what they say, and afterward your hands will be strengthened to go down into the camp.” Then Gideon went down with Purah, his servant, to the outermost part of the armed men who were in the camp.
