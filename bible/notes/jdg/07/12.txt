<usfm>
\v 12 The Midianites, the Amalekites, and all the people of the east settled along in the valley, as thick as a cloud of locusts. Their camels were more than could be counted; they were more in number than the grains of the sand on the seashore.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **as thick as a cloud of locusts**  - The army camp is compared to a swarm of locusts because there are many people camped in a small area. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
  * **they were more in number than the grains of the sand on the seashore **  - AT: "There were a great number of camels." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole|Hyperbole]])
