\v 6 So when they drank, only 300 men drank from their hands. All the others drank with their mouths down in the water.

\v 5 So Gideon brought down the people to the water; and Yahweh said to him, “Everyone who laps from the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, him you put apart from the others; likewise, everyone who kneels down to drink.”
\v 6 The number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men; all the rest of the people knelt to drink water.
