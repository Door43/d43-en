\v 13 When Gideon had come, see, there was a man telling a dream to his companion; the man said, “See, I had a dream; see, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, came to the tent, and struck down it so that it fell; it turned it upside down so that the tent lay flat.”
\v 14 His companion answered and said, “This is nothing else but the sword of Gideon, the son of Joash, a man of Israel; into his hand God has delivered Midian and all the army.”
