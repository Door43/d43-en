\v 2 Yahweh said to Gideon, “There are too many soldiers for me to give you victory over the Midianites. So that Israel may boast against me, saying, ‘Our own power has saved us.’
\v 3 Now therefore, proclaim in the ears of the people and say, ‘Whoever is afraid, whoever trembles, let him return and depart from Mount Gilead.’” So 22,000 people went away, and 10,000 remained.
