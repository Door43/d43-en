\v 2 Yahweh said to Gideon, “The people who are with you are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand; otherwise, Israel may be proud of themselves against me, saying, ‘My own hand has saved me.’
\v 3 Now therefore, proclaim in the ears of the people and say, ‘Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return and depart from Mount Gilead.’” So twenty two thousand people returned; there remained ten thousand.
