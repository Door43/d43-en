\v 17 But the Israelites still would not obey their leaders. Instead, they gave themselves to the idols, acting like prostitutes who gave themselves to men who were not their husbands, and they worshiped those idols. They were not like their ancestors. Their ancestors obeyed what Yahweh commanded, but these new people quickly stopped behaving as their ancestors had behaved.

\v 16 Then Yahweh raised up judges, who saved them from the power of those who were stealing their possessions. 
\v 17 Yet they would not listen to their judges. They were unfaithful to Yahweh and gave themselves like prostitutes to other gods and worshiped them. They soon turned aside from the way their fathers had lived—who had obeyed the commandments of Yahweh. But they did not do so.
