\v 16 Yahweh raised up judges who saved them out of the hand of those who impoverished them.
\v 17 But they did not listen not to their judges, for they acted like prostitutes, going after other gods; they bowed down to them; they quickly turned aside out of the way in which their fathers had walked in obeying the commandments of Yahweh; this new generation did not behave like them.
