\v 18 Whenever Yahweh brought a leader to them, he helped that leader and enabled his to rescue the people from their enemies. He did that as long as that leader was alive. Yahweh pitied them as they groaned because they were being oppressed and caused to suffer.
\v 19 But after that leader died, the people went back to behaving in more evil ways than their ancestors had behaved. They worshiped other gods and bowed down to them and did all \f + \ft litotes \f* the things that they thought those gods wanted them to do.

\v 18 When Yahweh raised up judges for them, then Yahweh would be with the judges and save them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge’s life; for Yahweh was sorry for them as they groaned because of those who oppressed them and troubled them.
\v 19 But it would it come about, when the judge was dead, that they would turn back and act even more corruptly than their fathers, in that they would follow other gods to worship them and to bow down to them. They did not stop doing this, nor cease from their stubborn ways.
