===== Translation Notes: =====
The angel of Yahweh continues to speak to the people of Israel.

    * **become thorns in your sides** - The angel of Yahweh compares the Canaanites to thorns to express that like a thorn in a person's side is painful so also the Canaanites will cause problems for Israel. AT: "become problems for you" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])  
    * **thorns** - sharp pieces of wood up to 7 centimeters long that stick out from some plants
    * **their gods will become a trap for you** - AT: "their gods are like a trap that will lead you into sin" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
    * **cried out and wept** - AT: "they cried many tears"
    * **Bochim** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:jdg:02:01|2:1]].
