===== Translation Notes: =====
The angel of Yahweh continues to speak to the people of Israel.

  * **become thorns in your sides** - The angel of Yahweh compares the Canaanites to thorns to express that like a thorn in a person's side is painful so also the Canaanites will cause problems for Israel. AT: "become problems for you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])  
  * **thorns** - sharp pieces of wood up to 7 centimeters long that stick out from some plants
