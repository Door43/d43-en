===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The angel of Yahweh continues to speak to the people of Israel.

  * **become thorns in your sides** - The angel of Yahweh compares the Canaanites to thorns to express that like a thorn in a person's side is painful so also the Canaanites will cause problems for Israel. AT: "become problems for you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **thorns** - sharp pieces of wood up to 7 centimeters long that stick out from some plants
  * **their gods will become a trap for you** - The angel of Yahweh compared the Canaanites' gods to a trap. Like a trap unexpectedly prevents an animal from being free to go where it wants so also worshiping the Canaanites' gods will unexpectedly cause them to sin. AT: "their gods are like a trap that will lead you into sin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **angel of Yahweh** - Possible meaning: 1. "angel who represents Yahweh" Or 2. "messenger who serves Yahweh." Or 3. it may refer to Yahweh himself, who looked like an angel as he talked to a person. Either one of these meanings would explain the angel's use of "I" as if Yahweh himself were talking.
  * **shouted and wept** - "cried many tears"
  * **Bochim** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jdg:02:01|2:1]].
