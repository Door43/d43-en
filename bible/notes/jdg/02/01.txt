\v 1 The angel of Yahweh went up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, "I brought you up from Egypt, and have brought you to the land I swore to give to your fathers. I said, 'I will never break my covenant with you.
\v 2 You must make no treaty with those who live in this land. You must tear down their altars.' But you have not listened to my voice. What is this that you have done?

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **angel of Yahweh** - Here this has more than one possible meaning: 1. It may mean "angel who represents Yahweh" or "messenger who serves Yahweh." 2. It may refer to Yahweh himself, who looked like an angel as he talked to a person. Either one of these meanings would explain the angel's use of "I" as if Yahweh himself was talking.
  * **Bochim** - This place was named to remember this event. "Bochim" means "crying." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **brought you up from Egypt** - "led you up from Egypt"
  * **swore** - Here this means God also made oaths in which he made promises to his people.
  * **your fathers** - Here this means the ancestors of a certain person or people group.
  * **break my covenant with you** - "fail to do what I said I would do for you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you have not listened to my voice** - "you have not obeyed my commands"
  * **What is this that you have done?** - This question is asked to cause the people of Israel to realize they have disobeyed Yahweh and will suffer because of it. AT: "You have done a terrible thing." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
