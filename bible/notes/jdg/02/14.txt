\v 14 The anger of Yahweh burned against Israel, and he gave them over to the raiders who stole their possessions from them. He sold them as slaves who were held by the strength of their enemies around them, so they could no longer defend themselves against their enemies.
\v 15 Wherever Israel went out to fight, Yahweh's hand was against them to defeat them, just as he had sworn to them. And they were in terrible distress.
