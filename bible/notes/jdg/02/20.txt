\v 20 So Yahweh was very angry with the Israelite people. He said, "These people have disobeyed the agreement I made with their ancestors They have not heeded what I told them.
\v 21 So I will no longer expel the people-groups that Joshua left in this land when he died.
\v 22 I will use them to test the Israelite people to see whether they will do what I want them to do, as their ancestors did."
\v 23 Yahweh had allowed these people-groups to stay in that land. He did not expel them by allowing Joshua \add and his men\add* to defeat them.

\v 20 The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel; he said, “Because this nation has transgressed my covenant that I had set in place for their father—because they have not listened to my voice,
\v 21 I will not, from now on, drive out from before them any of the nations that Joshua left when he died.
\v 22 I will act in this way so that I may test Israel, whether they will keep the way of Yahweh to walk in, as their fathers kept it, or not.”
\v 23 So Yahweh left those nations, without driving them out quickly; nor did he deliver them into Joshua’s hand.
