====== Judges 02:20-23 ======

<usfm>
\v 20 So Yahweh was very angry with the Israelite people. He said, "These people have disobeyed the agreement I made with their ancestors They have not heeded what I told them.
\v 21 So I will no longer expel the people-groups that Joshua left in this land when he died.
\v 22 I will use them to test the Israelite people to see whether they will do what I want them to do, as their ancestors did."
\v 23 Yahweh had allowed these people-groups to stay in that land. He did not expel them by allowing Joshua \add and his men\add* to defeat them.

\v 20 So Yahweh was very angry with the Israelite people. He said, "These people have disobeyed the covenant that I made with their ancestors. They have not done what I told them to do.
\v 21 So I will no longer expel the people groups that Joshua left in this land when he died.
\v 22 I will use them to test the Israelite people to see whether they will do what I want them to do, as their ancestors did."
\v 23 Yahweh allowed these people groups to stay in that land for a long time after the people of Israel had come. He did not expel them by allowing Joshua and his men to defeat them.

\v 20 The anger of Yahweh burned against Israel; he said, “Because this nation has broken the terms of my covenant that I had set in place for their fathers—because they have not listened to my voice,
\v 21 I will not, from now on, drive out from before them any of the nations that Joshua left when he died.
\v 22 I will do this so that I may test Israel, whether or not they will keep the way of Yahweh and walk in it, as their fathers kept it.”
\v 23 That is why Yahweh left those nations and did not drive them out quickly, and why he did not allow Joshua to conquer them.
