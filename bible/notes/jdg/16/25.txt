  * **Call for Samson ... They called for Samson** - Since Samson was a prisoner, he would not be called directly, but rather the people were request for the men in charge of him to bring him out. AT: "Call for them to bring out Samson ... They brought Samson" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the boy** - "the young man." This was not a young child but rather a youth.
  * **Permit me to touch the pillars on which the building rests** - "Allow me to touch the pillars which hold up the building"
