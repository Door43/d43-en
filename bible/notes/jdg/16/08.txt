\v 8 So \add after Delilah told that to the Philistine leaders\add*, they brought seven new bowstrings to Delilah.
\v 9 Then she hid them in one of the rooms in her house. Then \add while Samson was sleeping on her lap\add*, she tied him up with the bowstrings. Then she called out, "Samson! The Philistines have come here to capture you!" But Samson snapped the bowstrings as easily as though they were strings that had been singed in a fire. So the Philistines did not find out what made Samson so strong.

\v 8 Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to Delilah seven green ropes that had not been dried, and she tied him up with them.
\v 9 Now she had men lying in wait, staying in her inner room. She said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson.” But he broke the ropes, as a candle wick is broken when it touches the fire. So the source of his strength remained unknown.
