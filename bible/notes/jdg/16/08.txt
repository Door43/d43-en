\v 8 Then the rulers of the Philistines brought up to Delilah seven green bowstrings that had never been dried, and she tied him up with them.
\v 9 Now she had men hiding in secret, staying in her inner room. She said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” But he broke the bowstrings like a thread of yarn when it touches the fire. And they did not learn the secret of his strength.
