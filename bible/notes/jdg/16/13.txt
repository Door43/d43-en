\v 13 Then Delilah said, "You have deceived me and lied to me \add again\add*! Please tell me how someone can tie you up securely!" Samson replied, "If you weave the seven braids of my hair into the threads you are weaving on the loom, and then fasten those threads with the pin \add that makes the threads tight\add*, then I will be as weak as other men."
\p So again, while Samson was sleeping on her lap, Delilah held the seven braids of his hair, and wove them into the threads on the loom,
\v 14 and she tightened them with the pin. Then she called out, "Samson! The Philistines have come to capture you!" But Samson woke up and pulled out the pin, and pulled his hair from the threads on the loom.

Samson replied, "If you weave the seven braids of my hair into the threads you are weaving on the loom, and then fasten those threads with a nail that makes the threads tight, then I will become as weak as other men."
\p So again, Delilah held the seven braids of his hair, and wove them into the threads on the loom,
\v 14 and she secured them with a nail. Then she called out, "Samson! The Philistines have come to capture you!" But Samson woke up and pulled out the nail, and pulled his hair from the threads on the loom.

\v 13 Delilah said to Samson, “Until now you have deceived me and you have told me lies. Tell me how you may be overpowered.” Samson said to her, “If you weave seven locks of my hair into a fabric on a loom, and then nail that to the loom, I will be as any other man.”
\v 14 While he slept, Delilah wove seven locks of his hair into the fabric on the loom and nailed it to the loom, and she said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” He woke from his sleep and he pulled out the nail, the loom, and the fabric.
