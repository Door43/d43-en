\v 1 Samson went to the city of Gaza. He saw a prostitute there, and he spent the night with her.
\v 2 The Gazites were told, "Samson has come here."  They surrounded the place where Samson was, and they waited in secret all night long. They were beside the city gate, so they would be sure he could not escape. They said, "Let us wait until the light, and then we will kill him."
