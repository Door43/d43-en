\v 10 Then Delilah said to Samson, “This is how you have deceived me and told me lies. Please, tell me how can you be overpowered.”
\v 11 He said to her, “If they tie me up with new ropes with which have never been used for work, I will become weak and like any other man.”
\v 12 So Delilah took new ropes and tied him up with them, and said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” The men lying in wait were in the inner room. But Samson tore off the ropes from his arms like they were a piece of thread.
