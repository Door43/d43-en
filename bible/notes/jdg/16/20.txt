\v 20 And she said, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other
times, and shake myself free. But he knew not that Jehovah was departed from him.
\v 21 And the Philistines laid hold on him, and put out his eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters
of brass; and he did grind in the prison-house.
\v 22 Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.
