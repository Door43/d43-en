\v 20 She said, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson.” He woke up out of his sleep and said, “I will escape like the other times and shake myself free.” But he did not know that Yahweh had departed from him.
\v 21 The Philistines laid hold of him and put out his eyes; they brought him down to Gaza and tied him with fetters
of bronze; he ground a mill in the prison house.
\v 22 However, the hair on his head began to grow again after he was shaved.
