\v 18 Delilah realized that this time he had told her the truth. So she summoned the Philistine leaders again, saying, "Come back one more time, because Samson has really told me everything \add about why he is so strong\add*". So the Philistine leaders returned and brought to Delilah the money \add that they promised to give her\add*.
\v 19 Again she lulled Samson to sleep, with his head in her lap. Then she called one of the Philistine men to come and shave off Samson's hair. As he did that, Samson began to get weaker. And finally his strength was all gone.
