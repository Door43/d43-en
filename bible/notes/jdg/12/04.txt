\7v 3 When I saw that you did not save me, I took my life into my own hands and went against the people of Ammon, and Yahweh delivered them into my hand. Is that why you have come up to me today to fight against me?”
\v 4 Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead and fought with Ephraim; the men of Gilead struck Ephraim down, because the men of Ephraim had said to them, “You are fugitives in Ephraim, you Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim and in the midst of Manasseh.”
