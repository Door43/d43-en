\v 5 The men of Gilead captured that ford\f + \ft Or: place where people can walk across \f* at the Jordan \add River\add* to go to the land where the tribe of Ephraim live. If someone from the tribe of Ephraim came to the ford to try to escape, he would say, "Allow me to cross the river." Then the men of Gilead would ask him, "Are you from the tribe of Ephraim?" If he said "No,"
\v 6 they would say to him, "Say the word 'Shibboleth'." The men of Ephraim could not pronounce that word correctly. So if the person from the tribe of Ephraim said 'Sibboleth', \add they would know that he was lying and that he was really from the tribe of Ephraim\add*, and they would kill him there at the ford.
\p So the men of Gilead killed 42,000 people from the tribe of Ephraim at that time.

\v 5 The Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites. It happened that when
any of the fugitives of Ephraim said, “Let me go over the river,” the men of Gilead would say to him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” If he said, “No,”
\v 6 then they would say to him, “Say ‘Shibboleth;’ the man would say ‘Sibboleth,’ for he could not pronounce the word right. Then the Gileadites would seize him and kill him at the fords of the Jordan. And forty-two Ephraimites fell at that time.
