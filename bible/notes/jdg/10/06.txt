\v 6 The Israelites did even more evil that Yahweh saw them do. They worshiped the Baal idols and female fertility idols called the Asthoreths. They worshiped the gods of the people groups of Aram, Sidon, Moab, and Ammon people groups, and the gods of the Philistines. They forgot about Yahweh and stopped worshiping him.
\v 7 So Yahweh was very angry with them, and he allowed the Philistines and Ammonites to conquer Israel.

\v 6 The people of Israel added to the evil they had done in the sight of Yahweh and worshiped the Baals, the Ashtoreths, the gods of Aram, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the people of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines. They abandoned Yahweh and no longer worshiped him.
\v 7 Yahweh burned with anger toward Israel, and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the Ammonites.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **added to the evil they had done in the sight of Yahweh** - This speaks of evil as if it were an object that a person could add to and make bigger. AT: "continued doing what Yahweh said was evil" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in the sight of Yahweh** - Here "in the sight of Yahweh" represents what Yahweh considers or thinks about something. AT: "according to Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Ashtoreths** - This is the plural of Ashtoroth, who was worshiped as a goddess in many different forms. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jdg:02:11|2:13]].
  * **They abandoned Yahweh and no longer worshiped him** - The author basically said the same thing twice for emphasis. These can be combined.  AT: "They completely stopped worshiping Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **They abandoned Yahweh** - No longer obeying and worshiping Yahweh is spoken of as if the people left Yahweh and went somewhere else. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Yahweh burned with anger toward Israel** - Yahweh becoming angry is spoken of as if anger were a burning fire. AT: "Yahweh was very angry at Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he sold them into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the Ammonites** - Yahweh allowing the Philistines and the Ammonites to defeat the Israelites is spoken of as if he sold the Israelites to them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **into the hand** - Here "hand" represents power or control. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
