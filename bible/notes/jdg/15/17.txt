===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Ramath Lehi** - This is the name of a place. It's name means "Jawbone Hill" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **was very thirsty** - "needed water to drink"
  * **But now will I die of thirst and fall into ... uncircumcised?** - Possible meanings are 1) Samson is so thirsty he could literally die. AT: "But now I will die of thirst and my body will fall into ... uncircumcised." or 2) Samson exaggerates how thirsty he is by asking if he will die of thirst. AT: "But now will you allow me to become so weak from my thirst that I fall into ... uncircumcised?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **die of thirst** - This means to die because you have not drank enough and therefore, you do not have enough water in your body. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **fall into the hands of those who are uncircumcised** - The phrase "fall into the hands" means to be captured. "Those who are uncircumcised" refers to the Philistines and with the word "uncircumcised" emphasizing that they do not worship Yahweh.
