\v 12 They said to Samson, “We have come down to tie you up and deliver you into the hand of the Philistines.” 
Samson said to them, “Swear to me that you will not kill me yourselves.”
\v 13 They said to him, “No; we will only tie you up well and deliver you into their hand. But we will certainly not
kill you.” Then they tied him up with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock.
