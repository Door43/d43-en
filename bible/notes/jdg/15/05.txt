\v 5 When he had set the torches on fire, he let the foxes go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and they set fire to both the stacked grain and the grain standing in the field, along with the vineyards and the olive orchards.
\v 6 The Philistines asked, “Who did this?” They were told, “Samson, the Timnite's son-in-law, did this, because the Timnite took Samson’s wife and gave her to his friend.” Then the Philistines went and burned up her and her father.
