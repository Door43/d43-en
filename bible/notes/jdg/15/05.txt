\v 5 When he had set the torches on fire, he let the foxes go into the Philistines’ standing grain. The foxes burned up both the sheaves of grain and the standing grain, and also the olive orchards.
\v 6 Then the Philistines said, “Who has done this?” Others said, “Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because the Timnite took Samson’s wife and gave her to his companion.” Then the Philistines came up and burned her and her father with fire.
