\v 7 Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they lived in security, after the
manner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure; for there was none in the land, possessing authority, that might put
them to shame in anything, and they were far from the Sidonians, and had no dealings with any man.
\v 8 And they came to their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said to them, What
