\v 7 The next day the five men left. When they came to the city of Laish, they saw that the people there lived safely, as the people did in the city of Sidon. The people there thought that they were safe, because there was no one nearby to cause trouble for them, they were far from Sidon, and they rarely had contact with any outsiders.

\v 7 Then the five men left and came to Laish, and they saw the people who were there were living in safety—in the same way the Sidonians lived undisturbed and secure. There was no one who conquered them in the land, or who troubled them in any way. They lived far away from the Sidonians, and they had no dealings with anyone.
\v 8 They returned to their tribe in Zorah and Eshtaol. Their relatives asked them, “What is your report?”
