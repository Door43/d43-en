\p
\v 1 In those days there was no king in Israel; and in those days the tribe of the people of Dan were looking for land for their inheritance and to live in, for up to that day their inheritance had not fallen to them among the tribes of Israel.
\v 2 The people of Dan sent of their family five men from their whole number, men of courage, from Zorah and from Eshtaol,
to spy out the land and to search it. They said to them, “Go search the land.” They came to the hill country of
Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and slept there.
