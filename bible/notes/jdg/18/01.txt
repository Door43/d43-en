\p
\v 1 In those days there was no king in Israel. The tribe of the descendants of Dan were looking for a territory to live on, for up to that day they had not received any inheritance from among the tribes of Israel.
\v 2 The people of Dan sent five men from the whole number of their tribe, men who were experienced warriors from Zorah and from Eshtaol, to scout the land on foot, and to look it over. They said to them, “Go and  look over the land.” They came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah and they spent the night there.
