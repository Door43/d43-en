\v 24 He said, “You have taken away the gods that I made and my priest; you are leaving, and what else do I own? Why do you say to me, “What is bothering you?”?
\v 25 The people of Dan said to him, “Do not let your voice be heard by us, or angry fellows might attack us, and you would lose your life, and the lives of those in your household.”
\v 26 The people of Dan went on their way; when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.
