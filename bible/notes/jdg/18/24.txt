\v 24 He said, “You stole my gods I made, and you have taken the priest, and you are leaving. What else do I have left? How can you ask me, 'What is bothering you?'"
\v 25 The people of Dan said to him, “We do not want to hear your voice! For some very angry men will attack you, and you and your family will be killed.”
\v 26 Then the people of Dan went their way. When Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.
