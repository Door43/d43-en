\v 24 He said, "You stole the gods that I made, you have taken my priest, and you are leaving. What else do I have left? How can you ask me, 'What is bothering you?'"
\v 25 The people of Dan said to him, "You should not let us hear you say anything, or some very angry men will attack you, and you and your family will be killed."
\v 26 Then the people of Dan went their way. When Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.
