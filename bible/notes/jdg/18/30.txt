  * **Jonathan son of Gershom, son of Moses** - This is the name of the young Levite who used to serve as priest for Micah. This can be made explicit.

  * **until the day of the land's captivity** - This refers to a time later on when the people of Dan would be captured by their enemies.

  * **that he made** - Micah did not make his gods, rather the craftsman made them for him. AT: "that had been made for him" or "that his craftsman made for him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
