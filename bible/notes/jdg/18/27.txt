\v 27 The men of the tribe of Dan were carrying the things that had been made for Micah, and they also took his priest, and they continued traveling to Laish. They attacked the people who were peacefully living there, and killed them with their swords, and then they burned everything in the city.
\v 28 There was no group of people to rescue the people of Laish. Laish was far from Sidon \add city, so the people who lived there could not help the people of Laish\add*. And the people of Laish had no other allies. Laish was in a valley near Beth-Rehob \add town\add*.
\p The people of the tribe of Dan rebuilt the city and started to live there.
\v 29 They gave to the city a \add new\add* name, Dan, \add in honor of\add* their ancestor Dan, who was one of the sons of Jacob.

\v 27 The people of Dan took what Micah had made, as well as his priest, and they came to Laish, to a people who were undisturbed and secure and they killed them with the sword and burned the city.
\v 28 There was no one to rescue them because it was a long way from Sidon, and they had no dealings with anyone. It was in the valley that is near Beth Rehob. The Danites rebuilt the city and lived there.
\v 29 They named the city Dan, the name of Dan their ancestor, who was one of Israel's sons. But the name of the city used to be Laish.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **what Micah had made** - Micah did not make his gods, rather a craftsman made them for him. Also, this can be stated in active form. AT: "the things that had been made for Micah" or "Micah's things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Laish** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jdg:18:07| 18:7]].
  * **with the sword** - "with their swords." Here "the sword" represents the swords and other weapons that the soldiers used in battle. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **they had no dealings with anyone** - this means they lived far enough away from any other city, that they lived secluded from other people. See how you translated this phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:jdg:18:07|18:7]].
  * **Beth Rehob** - This is a name of a town. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
