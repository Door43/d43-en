\v 27 The men of the tribe of Dan were carrying the things that had been made for Micah, and they also took his priest, and they continued traveling to Laish. They attacked the people who were peacefully living there, and killed them with their swords, and then they burned everything in the city.
\v 28 There was no group of people to rescue the people of Laish. Laish was far from Sidon \add city, so the people who lived there could not help the people of Laish\add*. And the people of Laish had no other allies. Laish was in a valley near Beth-Rehob \add town\add*.

\v 28 There was no one to rescue them because it was a long way from Sidon, and they had no dealings with anyone. It was in the valley that is near Beth Rehob. The Danites rebuilt the city and lived there.
