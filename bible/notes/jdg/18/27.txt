\v 27 The men of the tribe of Dan were carrying the things that had been made for Micah, and they also took his priest, and they continued traveling to Laish. They attacked the people who were peacefully living there, and killed them with their swords, and then they burned everything in the city.
\v 28 There was no group of people to rescue the people of Laish. Laish was far from Sidon \add city, so the people who lived there could not help the people of Laish\add*. And the people of Laish had no other allies. Laish was in a valley near Beth-Rehob \add town\add*.

\v 27 The people of Dan took what Micah had made, and the priest whom he had possessed, and came to Laish, to a people who were quiet and living in peace; they struck down them with the edge of the sword and burned the city with fire.
\v 28 There was no one to save them because it was far from Sidon, and the people had no dealings with anyone. It was in the valley that lies by Bethrehob. The people of Dan rebuilt the city and lived in it.
\v 29 They called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their ancestor, who was born to Israel. But the name of the city had been Laish at first.
