\v 34 The Amorites forced the people of Dan into the hill country, for they did not allow them to come down to the
coastal region.
\v 35 Instead, the Amorites lived at Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim; still, when the hand of the house of Joseph dominated them, they would come under hard labor.
\v 36 Now the border with the Amorites was from the Ascent of Akrabbim at Seal and went north.
