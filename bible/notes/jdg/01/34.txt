\v 34 The Amorites forced the tribe of Dan to live in the hill country, not allowing them to come down to the plain.
\v 35 So the Amorites lived at Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim, but the military might of the house of Joseph conquered them, and they were forced to serve them with hard labor.
