  * **pursued him** - "chased him"
  * **Seventy kings** - "70 kings" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **who had their thumbs and their big toes cut off** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "whose thumbs and big toes I told my men to cut off" or "whose thumbs and big toes we cut off" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **gathered their food from under my table** - "ate scraps of food from under my table." Forcing these kings to eat scraps of food represents all the ways that Adoni-Bezek humiliated these kings. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
