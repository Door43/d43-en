===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the name of Debir was previously Kiriath Sepher** - The author probably wrote this because his readers knew the city as Debir. But at the time Israel attacked it, it was called Kiriath Sepher. AT: "which used to be called Kiriath Sepher" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background|Background Information]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|How to Translate Names]])
  * **previously** - "in times past" or "at an earlier time"
  * **Whoever attacks Kiriath Sepher and takes it** - Here "Kiriath Sepher" represents the people. AT: "Whoever attacks and defeats the people of Kiriath Sepher and takes their city" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Aksah** - This is the name of Caleb's daughter. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|How to Translate Names]])
  * **Othniel, son of Kenaz** - These are names of men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|How to Translate Names]])
