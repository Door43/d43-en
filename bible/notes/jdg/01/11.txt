===== Translation Notes: =====

See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]

    * **the name of Debir was previously Kiriath Sepher** - The author probably wrote this because his readers knew the city as Debir. But at the time Israel attacked it, it was called "Kiriath Sepher." AT: It used to be called Kiriath Sepher" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]]) 
    * **previously** - "in times past" or "an an earlier time"
