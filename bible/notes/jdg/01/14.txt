\v 14 And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she alighted
from off her ass; and Caleb said to her, What would thou?
\v 15 And she said to him, Give me a blessing; for that you have set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of
water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.
