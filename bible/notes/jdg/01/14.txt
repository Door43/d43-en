\v 14 Soon Achsah came to Othniel, and she urged him to ask her father to give her a field. As she was getting off her donkey, Caleb asked her, "What can I do for you?"
\v 15 She said to him, "Give me a blessing. Since you have set me in the land of the Negev, also give me springs of water." So Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **she urged him** - "Achsah urged Othniel"
  * **give her a field ... Since you have set me in the land** - This implies that Caleb did give her the field when she asked him for it in verse 14. In verse 15, she is now asking for springs of water in addition to that field. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Give me a blessing** - "Do a favor for me" or "Do this for me"
  * **Since you have set me in the land of the Negev** - "Since you sent me to the land of the Negev." Caleb gave Achsah in marriage to Othniel, so she lived with Othniel in the city that he had captured in the Negev. The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. AT: "Since you have given me in marriage to live in the Negev" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
