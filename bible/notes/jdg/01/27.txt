\v 27 The people of Manasseh did not drive out the people living in the cities of Beth Shan and its villages, or Taanach and its villages, or those who lived in Dor and its villages, or those who lived in Ibleam and its villages, or those who lived in Megiddo and its villages, because the Canaanites were determined to live in that land.
\v 28 When Israel became strong, they forced the Canaanites to serve them with hard labor, but they never drove them out completely.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - 1:27-30 tells another part of he story of the conquest by the tribes. The other tribes did not drive out the inhabitances of the land but lived with them and made them into slaves.

  * **cities ... and its villages** - These are places where people live together. "Cities" are larger and had walls around them. "Its villages" are smaller and have no walls so they are dependent on the "cities" for defense. AT: "city ... and its nearby villages" 
  * **Beth Shan ... Taanach ... Dor ... Ibleam ... Megiddo** - These are the names of cities. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **because the Canaanites were determined to live in that land** - To "determine" is to firmly decide something. AT: "because the Canaanites firmly decided not to leave that land"
