===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **They attacked it with the edge of the sword** - AT: "They attacked the people of the city with their swords" or "They attacked it with weapons"
  * **foothills** - hills that are at the base of a mountain or mountain range
  * **the name of Hebron was previously Kiriath Arba** - This is background information. People who first read this book had probably heard of Kiriath Arba but did not know that it was the same as the city that they called Hebron. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai** - These are the names of three Canaanite leaders of Hebron. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
