===== translationNotes: =====
 
  * **house of Joseph** - Here "house" represents descendants. Manasseh and Ephraim were sons of Joseph, and the "house of Joseph" can refer to the descendants of Manasseh and Ephraim. AT: "the tribes of Manasseh and Ephraim" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **to attack Bethel** - Here "Bethel" represents the people who live in Bethel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **spy** - to get information secretly
  * **the city that was formerly called Luz** - This is background information. Some people who first read this book had probably heard of Luz but did not know that it was the same as the city that they called Bethel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **spies** - people who get information secretly
