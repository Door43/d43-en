\v 26 She put her hand to the tent peg,
\q Her right hand to the workman’s hammer;
\q With the hammer she struck down Sisera, she struck down through his head;
\q Indeed, she pierced through his temples and struck him down.

\q At her feet he bowed and fell;
\q Where he bowed, there he fell down dead.
