\v 26 She put her hand to the tent peg,
\q and her right hand to the workmanâ€™s hammer;
\q with the hammer she struck Sisera, she crushed his head. 
\q She smashed his skull into pieces when she pierced him through the side of his head.
\q
\v 27 He collapsed between her feet, he fell, and he lay there;
\q between her feet he fell limp.
\q And where he collapsed, there, he was killed with violence.
