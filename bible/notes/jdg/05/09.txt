===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **My heart goes out to the commanders of Israel** - The word "heart" refers to the emotions. AT: "I appreciate the commanders of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **you who ride on white donkeys...you who walk along the road** - This probably refers to rich people and poor people. AT: "You rich people who ride on white donkeys ... you poor people who walk along the road." The two are used together to mean everyone.
  * **sitting on rugs for saddles** - These rugs were probably used as saddles on the donkey's back to make the rider more comfortable.
