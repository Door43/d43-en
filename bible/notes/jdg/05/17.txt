===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **and Dan, why did he wander about on ships?** - This question is asked to express anger because the people of the tribe of Dan would not fight for Israel.  AT: "the people of the tribe of Dan thought it was more important to explore the sea in ships."  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **harbors** - places at the seacoast with deeper water where ships were kept
  * **Naphtali, also** - AT: "Naphtali, also, would risk their lives to the point of death" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
