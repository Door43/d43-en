  * **Have they not found and divided up the plunder?** - Sisera's mother suggests that it is possible Sisera and his men have been delayed in coming back because they have many things to gather from their defeated enemies. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **A womb, two wombs for every man** - Women are referred to as the part of their body associated with pregnancy.  This means the Sisera's men have taken many enemy women to produce more children with them.   (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
