  * **Kishon** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jdg:04:06|4:6]].
  * **March on my soul, be strong** - Here "soul" refers to the whole person. The word "my" refers to Deborah. AT: "I tell myself to march on and to be strong" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Then the sound of horses' hooves—galloping, the galloping of his mighty ones** - This describes the sound of many horses running away from the battle. AT: "Then I heard the sound of horses running away. Sisera's mighty horses were running away" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
