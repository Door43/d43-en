===== translationNotes: =====

  * **forty thousand in Israel** - "40,000 in Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **neither shields nor spears were seen among forty thousand in Israel** - This statement is probably an exaggeration about how few weapons the Israelites had. AT: "few weapons for battle remained in Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
