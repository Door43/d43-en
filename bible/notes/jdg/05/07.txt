===== translationNotes: =====

  * **a mother took command in Israel** - This speaks of Deborah's leadership as if she were the mother of the Israelites. AT: "I took care of the Israelites like a mother takes care of her children" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **they chose new gods** - The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. AT: "the people of Israel worshiped new gods" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **there was fighting at the city gates** - Here "gates" represents the entire city. The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. AT: "enemies attacked the people within the Israelite cities" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) 
  * **there were no shields or spears seen among forty thousand in Israel** - This statement is probably an exaggeration about how few weapons the Israelites had. AT: "few weapons for battle remained in Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **forty thousand in Israel** - "40,000 in Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
