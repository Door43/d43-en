===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The mountains quaked** - This probably refers to earthquakes and gives the impression that the mountains quaked because they were very afraid of Yahweh. AT: "The mountains trembled in fear" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) 
  * **before the face of Yahweh** - Here "face" refers to the whole person. AT: "in the powerful presence of Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **even Mount Sinai quaked** - When Moses and Israel were at Mount Sinai, it quaked. AT: "long ago, even Mount Sinai quaked" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **In the days of** - "During the lifetime of"
  * **Shamgar ... Anath ... Jael** - These are the names of people. See how you translated Shamgar and Anath in [[:en:bible:notes:jdg:03:31|3:31]] and Jael in [[:en:bible:notes:jdg:04:17|4:18]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **son of Anath** - Shamgar's father is mentioned to help identify Shamgar and when he lived. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **the main roads were abandoned** - This can be stated in active form and you can make explicit why the roads were abandoned AT: "people stopped using the main roads; because they were afraid of Israel's enemies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the winding paths** - This refers to smaller roads that fewer people traveled on.
