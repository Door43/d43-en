===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The mountains quaked before the face of Yahweh** - This probably refers to earthquakes that Yahweh caused. The phrase "before the face of Yahweh" gives the impression that the mountains quaked because they were very afraid of Yahweh. This emphasizes how powerful Yahweh is. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]]) 
  * **the face of Yahweh** - This refers to Yahweh's great and powerful presence. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **In the days of** - "during the lifetime of"
  * **Shamgar ... Anath ... Jael** - These are the names of men. See how you translated Shamgar and Anath in [[:en:bible:notes:jdg:03:31|3:31]], and Jael in [[:en:bible:notes:jdg:04:17|4:18]] (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **son of Anath** - Shamgar's father is mentioned to help identify Shamgar and when he lived. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **the main roads were abandoned** - "people abandoned the main roads" or "people stopped using the main roads." People did this because they were afraid. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the winding paths** - This refers to smaller roads that fewer people traveled on.
