=== Structure and formatting ===

The account of Deborah and Barak continues in this chapter.

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of chapter 5, which is a song.


=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== The flood ==

God caused rain and flooding to bog down Jaban's chariots making 
them vulnerable to soldiers on foot, even though it is not said. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
