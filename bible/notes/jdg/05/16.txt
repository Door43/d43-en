===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Why did you sit between the fireplaces, listening to the shepherds playing their pipes for their flocks?** - This question is asked to criticize the people of Reuben because they did not decide to come fight in battle. AT: "Why did you sit around your fires listening to shepherds playing their pipes instead of preparing for battle?" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **pipes** - a simple musical instrument, like a flute
  * **searchings of heart**  - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:jdg:05:15|5:15]].
