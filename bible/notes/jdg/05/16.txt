===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Why did you sit between the fireplaces, listening to the shepherds playing their pipes for their flocks?** - This question is asked to criticize the people of Reuben because they did not decide to come fight in the battle. AT: "Why did you sit around your fires listening to shepherds playing their pipes for their flocks instead of preparing for the battle?" This can be translated as a statement. AT: "You should have helped us fight instead of staying at home and listening to the shepherds playing their pipes for their flocks." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the fireplaces** - Some versions of the Bible have the translation "the sheepfolds" or "the sheep pens."
  * **there were great searchings of heart** - Here "heart" represents thoughts. The people discussing with each other but being unable to decide what they should do is spoken of as if they were searching their heart. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jdg:05:15|5:15]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
