===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Deborah and Barak's song continues using poetry. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]])

  * **Listen, you kings! Pay attention, you leaders** - Deborah and Barak speak to the kings and leaders as if they were there listening to the song. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
  * **you kings ... you leaders** - This refers to kings and leaders in general, not to specific kings or leaders.
  * **when you went out from Seir, when you marched from Edom** - This refers to the time when the Israelites left Edom to start conquering the people in Canaan. Yahweh empowering his people to defeat the people of Canaan is spoken of as if he were a warrior leading the Israelite army. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Seir** - Seir is a mountain on the border of the land of Israel and Edom. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **the earth shook, and the skies also trembled; also the clouds poured down water** - Possible meanings are 1) this is poetic language that emphasizes Yahweh's power by describing it as causing earthquakes and storms or 2) the people of Canaan being terrified as the Israelites were about to attack them is spoken of as if the earth and sky were shaking. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
