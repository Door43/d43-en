===== Translation Notes: =====

Deborah and Barak's song continues using poetry. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]])

  * **Listen, you kings! Pay attention, you leaders**  - Both of these phrases mean the same thing. It is repeated for emphasis.
  * **when you went out from Seir, when you marched from Edom**  - Seir is a mountain on the border of the land of Israel and Edom. Both of these phrases refer to Yahweh bringing the people of Israel into the land he had promised to give to Israel.
