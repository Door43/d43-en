  * **lattice** - A structure made from strips of crossed wood.
  * **Why have the hoofbeats of the horses...been delayed?** - The hoofbeats refer to the sound of Sisera's horses at his arrival. AT: "Why has Sisera's arrival been delayed?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Why has it taken his chariot so long to come? Why have the hoofbeats of the horses that pull his chariots been delayed?** - Both questions are asked for the same purpose and say the same thing in different ways.
