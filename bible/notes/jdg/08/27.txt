===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Ophrah** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jdg:06:11|6:11]].
  * **all Israel prostituted themselves by worshiping it** - The worship of the ephod is compared to prostitution because like a prostitute gives pleasure to men who are not her husband to get money, the Israelites have given worship to something that is not their God to have success. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **It became a trap** - The worship of the ephod is compared to a trap because they thought it was good but it was harmful. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **they did not raise their heads up again** - To have a raised head is associated with having confidence. They did not have confidence in their ability to attack Israel and defeat them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **forty years** - "40 years" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
