===== Translation Notes: =====
Gideon replies to the men from Ephraim.

    * **Are not the gleanings of Ephraim's grapes better than the full grape harvest of Abiezer?** - Gideon used this question to emphasize that the descendants of Ephraim had greater success in battle than the descendants of Abi Ezer. AT: The grapes that were left over after you Ephraimites gathered your harvest are more than the whole harvest that we descendants of Abi Ezer gathered.  (See: [[:/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_rquestion]])
    * **Abi Ezer** - This is the name of one of Gideon's ancestors. Gideon used his name to refer to Abi Ezer's descendants and their land. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]], [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]) 
    * **the princes of Midian**  - Gideon said "princes of Midian" to refer to the the princes and their armies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
    * **Oreb and Zeeb** - See how you translated the names of these men in [[en:bible:notes:jdg:07:24|7:25]].
    * **What have I done now compared to you?**  - Gideon uses this question to honor the people of Ephraim and emphasize they have done greater things than he has.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **accomplished** - AT: "been able to do"
    * **died down**  - "became less"
