\v 20 He said to Jether, his firstborn, “Up and kill them!” But the youth did not draw his sword; for he was afraid, because he was still a youth.
\v 21 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Rise yourself and fall on us; for as the man is, so is his strength.”  Gideon rose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna; he also took the crescent ornaments that were on their camels’ necks.
