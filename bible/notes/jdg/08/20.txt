\v 20 And he said to Jether his first-born, Up, and kill them. But the youth drew not his sword; for he feared, because he
was yet a youth.
\v 21 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us; for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and
killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescents that were on their camels’ necks.
