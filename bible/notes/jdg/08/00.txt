====== Judges 08 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

The account of Gideon concludes in this chapter. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Succoth's refusal to help Gideon ==
The men of Succoth feared the Midianites more than Gideon. This is why they refused to help Gideon. By allying themselves with the Midianites, they aligned themselves against Yahweh. Because of this, Gideon treated them like he treated the Midianites. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

== Gideon refuses to be king ==

Gideon said to them, "I will not rule over you, neither will my son rule over you. Yahweh will rule over you." Although the book of Deuteronomy anticipates a king in Israel, it was sinful for Israel to desire to have a king. He did though take a share of everyone's plunder as a king would have done through taxes. This may serve as a warning to Israel about their desire to have a king. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])
