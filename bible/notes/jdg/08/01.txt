===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **What is this you have done to us?** - This question is asked to make Gideon think about what he had done. AT: "You have not treated us fairly." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **And they argued with him him with force**  - The word "force" could refer to physical force as in the UDB but probably is used to refer to how loud and angry they were as they argued. Possible meanings: 1) "and they used physical force with Gideon show how upset they were" or "And they passionately argued with him"
