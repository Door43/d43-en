===== Translation Notes: =====

Samson tells his riddle. Since it is supposed to be hard to understand, do not translate it in a way that people will immediately know what it means.

  * **Out of the eater was something to eat**  - AT: "Out of the eater came something to eat" or "Something to eat came out of something that eats"
  * **the eater**  - "the thing that eats"
  * **out of the strong was something sweet**  - AT: "out of the strong came something sweet" or "Something that is sweet came out of something that is strong"
  * **the strong**  - "the strong thing"
  * **his guests**  - This refers to the people that were invited to his feast. AT:"the men at at his feast"
