\v 7 When they arrived in Timnah, Samson talked with the young woman, and he liked her very much. \add And his father made arrangements for the wedding\add*.
\p
\v 8 Later, when Samson returned to Timnah for the wedding, he turned off the path to see the carcass of the lion. He discovered that \add after other creatures had eaten all the flesh\add*, a swarm of bees \add had made a nest in the skeleton and\add* had made some honey.
\v 9 So he scooped some of the honey into his hands and ate some of it as he was walking along. He also gave some of it to his mother and father, but he did not tell them that he had taken the honey from the skeleton of the lion, \add because anyone dedicated to God was not to touch a corpse\add*.

\v 7 He went and spoke with the woman, and when he looked at her, she pleased Samson.
\v 8 A few days later when he returned to marry her, he turned aside to look for the carcass of the lion. And, look, there was a swarm of bees and honey in what was left of the lion's body.
\v 9 He scraped up the honey in his hands and went on, eating as he went. When he came to his father and his mother, he gave some to them, and they ate. But he did not tell them he had taken the honey out of what was left of the lion's body.
