\v 7 He went and spoke with the woman, and when he looked at her, she pleased Samson.
\v 8 A few days later when he returned to marry her, he turned aside to look for the carcass of the lion. And there was a swarm of bees and honey in what was left of the lion’s body.
\v 9 He scraped up the honey in his hands and went on, eating as he went. When he came to his father and his mother, he gave some to them, and they ate. But he did not tell them he had taken the honey out of what was left of the lion’s body.
