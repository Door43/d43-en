\v 16 So Samson's wife came to him, crying, and said to him, "You do not really love me. You hate me! You have told a riddle to my friends, but you have not told me the meaning of the riddle!"
\p He replied, "I have not told the meaning of the riddle even to my mother and father, so why should I tell it to you?"
\v 17 She continued to cry every time she was with him, all during the rest of the celebration. Finally, on the seventh day, because she continued to nag him, he told her the meaning of the riddle. Then she told it to the young men.

\v 16 Samson’s wife started crying in front of him, “All you do is hate me! You do not love me. You have told a riddle to some of my people, but you have not told me the answer.” Samson said to her, “Look here, if I have not told my father or my mother, should I tell you?”
\v 17 She cried during all seven days their feast lasted, and on the seventh day he told her the answer because she pressured him very much. She told the answer to the relatives of her people.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **All you do is hate me! You do not love me** - She was accusing him of not loving her because he did not tell her the answer to the riddle.
  * **riddle** - a game in which the players must discover the answer to a difficult question
  * **Look here** - Paying attention is spoken of as looking. AT: "Listen to me" or "Pay attention to what I'm about to say" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **if I have not told my father or my mother, should I tell you?** - Samson used this question to say that either 1) he is not obligated to tell her or 2) his not telling her does not prove that he does not love her.  AT: "I have not even told my father or mother. I should not have to tell you"
  * **all seven days** - Possible translations: 1) "all seven days", or 2) "until day 7". The translation "all seven days" could mean she asked for the answer even before being threatened by the guests at the feast, or she cried all seven days over something and then continued crying to try to learn the answer to Samson's riddle after the guests asked her to find out the answer.
  * **on the seventh day** - "on day 7"
  * **she pressured him very much**  - The word "pressured" compares her complaining to putting pressure on something until it breaks. AT: "she kept urging him to tell her" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
