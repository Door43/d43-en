\v 5 Then Samson went down to Timnah with his father and his mother, and they came to the vineyards of Timnah. And there one of the young lions came up and was roaring at him. 
\v 6 Yahweh's Spirit suddenly came on him, and he tore the lion apart as easily as he would have torn apart a small goat, and he had nothing in his hand. But he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done.
