\p But Samson told his father, "Get her for me! She is the one I want!"
\v 4 His mother and father did not realize that Yahweh was arranging this. He was preparing a way for Samson to create a conflict with the Philistines, for they were  ruling over Israel at that time.

\v 3 But his father and mother said to him, "Is there not a woman among the daughters of your relatives, or among all our people?  Are you going to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?" Samson said to his father, "Get her for me, for when I look at her, she pleases me."
\v 4 But his father and his mother did not know that this matter came from Yahweh, for he desired to create a conflict with the Philistines (for at that time the Philistines were ruling Israel).
