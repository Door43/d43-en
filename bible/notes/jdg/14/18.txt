\v 18 So before sunset on the seventh day, the young men came to Samson and said to him,
\q1 "Nothing is sweeter than honey;
\q2 Nothing is as strong as a lion."
\p Samson replied, "People use their own animals to plow their fields. My bride is like a young heifer that you have used, but she does not belong to you!
\q1 If you had not forced her to ask me,
\q2 you would not have learned the answer!"

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **on the seventh day** - "on day 7"
  * **What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?** - These questions are used to answer the riddle. AT: "Honey is sweet and a lion is strong." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) If necessary it could be made clear how this relates to the riddle by adding "Honey came out of a lion" or "Honey was found in a lion's body." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **If you had not plowed with my heifer**  -  Samson compares their using his wife to get the answer to someone using another person's heifer to plow his field. AT: "If you had not used my wife" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **plowed** - To plow is to use an animal to pull a blade through soil to prepare the soil for seeds.
