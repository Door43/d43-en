<usfm>
\v 4 These nations were left as a means by which Yahweh would test Israel, to confirm whether they would obey the commands he gave their ancestors through Moses.
\v 5 So the people of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
\v 6 Their daughters they took to be their wives, and their own daughters they gave to their sons, and they served their gods.
