\v 24 After he had gone, his servants came back, but they saw that the doors of the room were locked. They said, "The king must be defecating in the inner room."
\v 25 So they waited, but when the king did not open the doors of the room, after a while they were worried. They got a key and unlocked the doors. And they saw that their king was lying on the floor, dead.

\v 24 Now after Ehud had left, the king’s servants came; they looked and, behold, the doors of the upper room were locked; they
said, “Surely he is relieving himself in the upper chamber.”
\v 25 They waited until they were embarrassed; and, behold, the king did not open the doors to  the upper room; so they took the
key and opened them; and, behold, their lord had fallen down dead on the floor.
