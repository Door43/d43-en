\v 24 After he had gone, his servants came back, but they saw that the doors of the room were locked. They said, "The king must be defecating in the inner room."
\v 25 So they waited, but when the king did not open the doors of the room, after a while they were worried. They got a key and unlocked the doors. And they saw that their king was lying on the floor, dead.

\v 24 After Ehud had gone, the king’s servants came; they saw that the doors of the upper room were locked, they throught, "Surely he is relieving himself in the coolness of the upper room.”
\v 25 They were growing more concerned until they felt they were neglecting their duty when king still did not open the doors to the upper room. So they took the key and opened them, and there lay their lord, fallen to the floor, dead.
