\v 28 He said to them, “Follow me, for Yahweh is about to defeat your enemies, the Moabites.” They followed him and they captured the fords of the Jordan across from the Moabites, and they did not allow anyone to cross the river.
\v 29 At that time they killed about ten thousand men of Moab, and all were strong and capable men. Not one escaped.
\v 30 So that day Moab was subdued by the strength of Israel. And the land had rest for eighty years.
