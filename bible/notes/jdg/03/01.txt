<usfm>
\v 1-2 At that time there were still many people-groups in Canaan. Yahweh left there to test the Israelite people. But many of the Israelites in Canaan were ones who had not fought in any of the wars in Canaan. So Yahweh also left those people-groups in Canaan so that the descendants of those who had not fought in any of the wars might learn how to fight.
\v 3 \add This is a list of\add* the people-groups that Yahweh left there: The Philistines and their five leaders, the people living in the area near Sidon \add city\add*, the descendants of Canaan, and the descendants of Hiv who were living in the mountains of Lebanon between Baal-Hermon Mountain and Lebo-Hamath.

\v 1 At that time there were still many people groups in Canaan. Yahweh left them there to test the Israelite people. But many of the Israelites in Canaan had not fought in any of the previous wars.
\v 2 So Yahweh did this to teach the new generation of Israelites how to wage war.
\v 3 This is a list of the people groups that Yahweh left there to test the Israelites: The Philistines and their five leaders, the people living in the area near the city of Sidon, the descendants of Canaan, and the Hivites who were living in the mountains of Lebanon between Mount Baal Hermon  and Lebo Hamath ("the Pass of Hamath").

\v 1 Now Yahweh left these nations to test Israel—all in Israel who had not experienced any of the wars fought in Canaan,
\v 2 (he did this to teach warfare to the new generation of the Israelites who had not known it before):
\v 3 —the five kings of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived in the Lebanon mountains, from Mount Baal Hermon to Hamath Pass.
