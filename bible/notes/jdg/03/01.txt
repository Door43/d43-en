\p
\v 1 Now these are the nations which Jehovah left, to prove Israel by them, even as many
of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;
\v 2 only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as beforetime knew
nothing thereof:
\v 3 namely, the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that
lived in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon to the entrance of Hamath.
