\v 21 Ehud reached with his left hand and took the sword from his right thigh, and he stabbed it into the kingâ€™s body.
\v 22 And the hilt of the sword also went into him after the blade, the tip of which came out of his back, and the fat closed over the blade, for Ehud did not draw the sword out of his body.
\v 23 Then Ehud went out on the porch and closed the doors of the upper room behind him and locked them.
