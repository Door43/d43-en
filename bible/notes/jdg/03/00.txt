====== Judges 03 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== The people worship false gods ==

Israel worshiped idols and false gods. Because of this, Yahweh allowed Aram and Moab to rule over them. In the period of Judges, when Israel sinned, they were often placed under the rule of a foreign power. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin]]) 


=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "Blew a trumpet" ==

When Ehud "blew a trumpet," he was calling all of the men to come help him fight. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
