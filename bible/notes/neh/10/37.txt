===== Translation Notes: =====

In these verses, the people continue describing the content of the oath they were making in [[en/bible/notes/neh/10/28 | verse 29]].

    * **We will bring...We will bring** - The pronoun "we" here includes Nehemiah and the Israelites except for the priests and the Levites, and also does not include the reader of this book (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
    * **the first of our dough** - Dough is "coarse flour" or "ground grain."
    * **the storerooms of the house of our God** - "the places where things are stored in the temple"
    * **the tithes from our soil** - Here "our soil" refers to everything that is grown in the ground. AT: "one tenth of what we grow in the ground" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
    * **the storerooms of the treasury** - "the rooms where the priests stored the treasure"
