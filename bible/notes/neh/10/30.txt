===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **We promised that we would not give our daughters to the people of the land or take their daughters for our sons** - "We made the commitment that we would not allow our daughters and sons to marry the people of the land who do not obey Yahweh"
    * **We promised...we would not give...we would not buy...we will let...we will cancel...** - The pronoun "we" here includes Nehemiah and the Jewish people, but not the reader of this book. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])

    * **we will cancel all debts of other Jews** - "we will declare that Jewish people will no longer have to pay back what they owe us"
