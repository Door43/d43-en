===== Translation Notes: =====

In these verses, the people describe the content of the oath they were making in [[:en:bible:notes:neh:10:28|verse 29]].

  * **We promised that we would not give our daughters to the people of the land or take their daughters for our sons**  - "We made the commitment that we would not allow our daughters and sons to marry the people of the land who do not obey Yahweh"
  * **We promised…we would not give…we would not buy…we will let…we will cancel…**  - The pronoun "we" here includes Nehemiah and the Jewish people, but not the reader of this book. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive|Exclusive]])
  * **we will let our fields rest**  - "we will not plough our fields" or "we will not grow anything in our fields"
  * **we will cancel all debts contracted by other Jews**  - "we will declare that Jewish people will no longer have to pay back what they owe us"
