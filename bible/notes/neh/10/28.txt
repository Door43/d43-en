\v 28 And the rest of the people—the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the temple servants, and all they that had separated themselves from the people of the neighboring lands and pledged themselves to the law of God, including their wives, their sons and their daughters, all that have knowledge and understanding—
\v 29 they joined together with their brothers, their nobles, and bound themselves with both a curse and an oath, to walk in God’s law, which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the commandments of Yahweh our Ruler and his judgments and his statutes.
