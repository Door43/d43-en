\v 28 And the rest of the people, who were priests, Levites, gatekeepers, singers,  temple servants, and all who had separated themselves from the people of the neighboring lands and pledged themselves to the law of God, including their wives, their sons and their daughters, all who have knowledge and understanding,

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **gatekeepers** - These are people who looked after the opening in the wall and controlled who went in and out. See how you translated this in [[en/bible/notes/neh/07/01|7:1]]
    * **singers** - "temple singers"
    * **all who had separated themselves from the people of the neighboring lands and pledged themselves to the law of God** - AT: "all who had separated themselves for the purpose of the Law of God"
    * **all who had separated themselves** - This refers to the separate gathering of the Jews in [[en:bible:notes:neh:09:01|09:2]].
    * **all who have knowledge and understanding** - This phrase can be made explicit. AT: "all who were old enough to understand what promising to obey God meant" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
    * **nobles** - "the group of people who are members of the highest social class"
    * **bound themselves with both a curse and an oath** - The people did not physically tie themselves up with a curse and an oath. The phrase "curse and an oath" is a metonym for "a solemn promise.  AT: "made a solemn promise" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **a curse and an oath** - These words are related. An "oath" is a solemn promise to do something and a "curse" refers to the bad things that will happen if they break the oath. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
    * **to walk in God's law** - "to obey God's law" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
