===== Translation Notes: =====

In these verses, the people continue describing the content of the oath they were making in [[en/bible/notes/neh/10/28 | verse 29]].

    * **We accepted the commands** - AT: "We promised ourselves"
    * **We accepted** - The pronoun "we" here includes all the Israelites including Nehemiah except for the priest and Levites, and does not include the reader of this book (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
    * **shekel** - (See: [[:en:obe:other:biblicalmoney]])
    * **for the service of the house of our God** - "to pay for the care of the temple"
    * **the bread of the presence** - This refers to the 12 loaves of bread baked without yeast kept in the temple and used to symbol God's presence with His people.
    * **the new moon festivals** - These were celebrations held when the moon was just a small crescent in the sky.
    * **to make atonement for Israel** - "to pay for the sins of the Israelites" 
    * **as well as for all the work of the house of our God** - "as well as for taking care of the temple"
