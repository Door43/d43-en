===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **the people cast lots** - "the people threw marked stones to decide who would be responsible"
    * **We promise to bring...we will bring** - The pronoun "we" here includes Nehemiah and the Israelites except for the priests and the Levites, and also does not include the reader of this book (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
    * **to the priests who serve** - "To the priests who serve" This should begin a new sentence.
