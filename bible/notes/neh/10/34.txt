\v 34 And the priests, the Levites, and the people cast lots for the wood offering. The lots would select which of our families would bring wood into the house of our God at the appointed times each year. The wood would be burned on the altar of Yahweh our God, as it is written in the law.
\v 35 We promised to bring to the house of Yahweh the firstfruits grown from our soil, and the firstfruits of every tree each year.
\v 36 And as it is written in the law, we promised to bring to the house of God and to the priests who serve there, the firstborn of our sons and of our herds and flocks.
