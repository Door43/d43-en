\v 21 I warned them, "It is useless \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* for you to stay here outside the walls \add on Friday night\add*! If you do this again, I will clobber [IDI] you!" So after that, they did not come on Sabbath days.
\v 22 I also commanded the descendants of Levi to \add perform the ritual to\add* purify themselves and to guard the city gates, to make sure that the Sabbath was kept holy \add by not allowing merchants to enter it on Sabbath days\add*.
\p My God, do not forget this also that I \add have done for you\add*! And because of your faithfully loving me, allow me to continue to live \add many more years\add*!

\v 21 I warned them, "It is useless for you to stay here outside the walls on Friday night! If you do this again, I will take you and remove you myself!" So after that, they did not come on sabbath days.
\v 22 I also commanded the descendants of Levi to perform the ritual to purify themselves and to take up their stations to guard the City Gates, to make sure that the sabbath was kept holy by not allowing merchants to enter it on that holy day.
\p My God, do not forget what I have done for you! And be kind to me, as kind as your love is for me.

\v 21 But I warned them, "Why do you camp outside the wall? If you do so again, I will lay hands on you! From that time on they did not come on the sabbath. 
\v 22 And I commanded the Levites to purify themselves, and come and guard the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. 
\p Call me to mind for this also, my God, and have mercy on me because of the covenant loyalty you have toward me.
