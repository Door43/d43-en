\v 10 I also found out that the temple musicians and other Levites had left Jerusalem and returned to their fields, because the people of Israel had not been bringing into the storerooms the food they needed.
\v 11 So I rebuked the officials, saying to them, "Why have you not taken care of the services to be held in the temple? So I got them together and put them back at their stations.

\v 10 I learned that the Levites' portions had not been given to them, and they had run away, each to his own field, the Levites and the singers who did the work.
\v 11 So I confronted the officials and said, "Why is the house of God neglected?" I gathered them together and stationed them at their posts.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the Levites' portions had not been given to them** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "the people had not been bringing into the storerooms their tithes and offerings of food for the temple priests" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) 
  * **they had run away, each to his own field, the Levites and the singers who did the work** - "the Levites and the singers who did the work had left the temple, each one going to his own field"
  * **Why is the house of God neglected?** - This is a rhetorical question since Nehemiah uses it to challenge or even ridicule the officials who had not done their work. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
