\v 10 I also found out that the temple musicians and other Levites had left Jerusalem and returned to their fields, because the people of Israel had not been bringing into the storerooms the food they needed.
\v 11 So I rebuked the officials, saying to them, "Why have you not taken care of the services to be held in the temple? So I got them together and put them back at their stations.

\v 10 And I learned that the portions assigned to give to the Levites had not been distributed to them, so that they hurried to leave the temple, each to his own field, as the singers who did the work also had done.
\v 11 So I confronted the officials and said, "Why is the house of God neglected?" I gathered them together and stationed them at their posts.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the portions assigned to give to the Levites had not been distributed to them** - AT: "the people of Israel had not been bringing into the storerooms their tithes and offerings of food for the temple priests" 
  * **so that they hurried to leave the temple, each to his own field, as the singers who did the work also had done** - This can be written as a new sentence. "As a result, the priests and the singers who performed the service had gone away, each to his own field." 
  * **the singers** - AT: "the musicians"
  * **Why is the house of God neglected?** - This is a rhetorical question since Nehemiah uses it to challenge or even ridicule the officials who had not done their work. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
