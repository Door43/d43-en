\p
\v 29 My God, do not forget that those people \add who have married foreign women\add* have caused it to be a shame\f + \ft Or: disgrace \f* to be a priest, and have caused people to despise the agreement that you made with the priests and with the descendants of Levi \add who help the priests\add*!
