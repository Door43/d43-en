\v 28 One of the sons of Jehoiada, the son of Eliashib the supreme priest, had married the daughter of \add our enemy\add* Sanballat, from Beth-Horon \add town\add*. So I forced Jehoiada to leave Jerusalem.
\p
\v 29 My God, do not forget that those people \add who have married foreign women\add* have caused it to be a shame\f + \ft Or: disgrace \f* to be a priest, and have caused people to despise the agreement that you made with the priests and with the descendants of Levi \add who help the priests\add*!

\v 28 One of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the leader of all the priests, married the daughter of Sanballat. So I ran Joiada's son out of Jerusalem.
