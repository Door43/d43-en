== Nehemiah returns to Jerusalem ==

Nehemiah was eager to make sure that the Jews kept their promise to obey the law. When he returned from Persia, he found many things wrong: one of the store rooms in the temple had been converted into a guest room for Tobiah, the Levites had not received their portions for working in the temple, people were working on the Sabbath, and many had married heathen wives. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:promise]], [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses]], [[:en:obe:kt:temple]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sabbath]])
