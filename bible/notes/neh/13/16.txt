\v 16 I also saw some people from Tyre \add city\add* who were living there in Jerusalem who were bringing fish and other things \add into Jerusalem\add* to sell to the people of Judea on the Sabbath day.
\v 17 So I rebuked the Jewish leaders and told them, "This is \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* a very evil thing that you are doing! You are causing the Sabbath days to be unholy.
\v 18 Your ancestors did \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* things like that, so God punished them, and as a result, this city was destroyed! And now by causing the Sabbath day to be unholy, you are going to cause God to be angry with us Israelite people \add and punish us\add* more!"

\v 18 Your ancestors did things like this, so God punished them. He allowed this city to be destroyed because of their sin! And now by breaking the laws for the sabbath day, you are going to cause God to be angry with us, and he will punish us even more!"

\v 16 Men from Tyre living in Jerusalem brought in fish and all kinds of goods, and they sold them on the sabbath to the people of Judah and in the city!
\v 17 Then I confronted the leaders of Judah, "What is this evil thing you are doing, profaning the sabbath day? 
\v 18 Did not your fathers do this? And did not our God bring all this evil on 
us and on this city? Now you are bringing more wrath on Israel by profaning the sabbath."
