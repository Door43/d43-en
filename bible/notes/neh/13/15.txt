\v 15 In those days saw I in Judah people treading winepresses on the sabbath and bringing in heaps of grain and loading them on donkeys, and also wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of heavy loads, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day. I protested that they were selling food on that day.
