<usfm>
\v 12 Then all the people of Judah again started to bring to the temple storerooms their tithes of grain, wine, and \add olive\add* oil.
\v 13 I appointed these men to be in charge of the storerooms: Shelemiah, who was a priest; Zadok, who knew the Jewish laws very well; and Pedaiah, a descendant of Levi. I appointed Hanan, who is the son of Zaccur and grandson of Mattaniah, to assist them. I knew that I could trust these men while they distributed those offerings to their fellow workers.
\p
\v 14 My God, do not forget all these good deeds that I have faithfully done for your temple and for the work that is done there!

\v 12 Then brought all Judah the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil to the treasuries.
\v 13 And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and
next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and their business was to
distribute to their brethren.
\v 14 Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for
the observances thereof.
