====== Nehemiah 13:30-31 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 30 I did all that to make sure that there were no more foreign people among them who would encourage them \add to worship idols\add*. I also established regulations for the priests and descendants of Levi, in order that they would know what work they should do.
\v 31 I also arranged for people to bring the firewood \add that was needed to burn on the altar\add*, as \add Moses had declared\add* that we should do. I also arranged for the people to bring the first part of what they harvested \add each year\add*.
\p My God, do not forget that I \add have done all these things\add*, and bless me for doing them.

\v 30 I took away everything from them that was from other nations and religions, I also established regulations for the priests and descendants of Levi, so they would know what work each of them should do.
\v 31 I made sure that there was wood to be burned on the altar at the set times and days. I also arranged for the people to bring into the storerooms the first portion of the harvest.
\p My God, do not forget that I have done all these things, and bless me for doing them.

\v 30 Thus I cleansed them from everything foreign, and established the duties of the priests and the Levites, each to his own task.
\v 31 I provided for the wood offering at the appointed times and for the firstfruits.
\p
Call me to mind, my God, for good.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Thus I cleansed them** - "In this way I purified them" 
  * **the duties** - "the responsibilities" 
  * **I provided for the wood offering** - "I arranged for a supply of wood for the wood offerings" 
  * **for the firstfruits** - "for the offering of firstfruits at harvest time"
  * **Call me to mind, my God, for good** - "My God, remember me for good." One last time, Nehemiah is giving an account of the things he did to make sure that the Law was followed. This is not directed to the people, but directed to God. He asks God to remember his deeds.
