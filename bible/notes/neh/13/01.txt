\v 1 On that day, when someone read to the people parts of the laws that \add God gave to\add* Moses, they read where it was written that no one from the Ammon people-group or the Moab people-group was ever to be allowed to be with God's people while they were gathered together \add to worship\add*.
\v 2 The reason for that was that the people of Ammon and the people of Moab did not give\f + \ft Or: sell \f* any food or water to the Israelites while \add the Israelites were going through their areas after they left Egypt\add*. Instead, the people of Ammon and Moab paid money to Balaam in order that he would curse the Israelites. But God commanded Balaam to bless the people, not to curse them.
\v 3 So when the people heard these laws \add being read to them\add*, they sent away all the people whose ancestors had come from other countries.

\v 1 On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that an Ammonite
and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God for ever,
\v 2 because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, to curse them:
howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.
\v 3 And it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.
