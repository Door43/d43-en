===== Translation Notes: =====

In these verses, the Levites continue to praise Yahweh in the presence of the people of Israel.

  * **commandments and statutes and a law** - Three words are used for emphasis to describe the same thing: God's Law or The Ten Commandments. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]]) 
  * **to go in to possess the land** - "to enter the land of Israel" or "to enter the Promised Land" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
