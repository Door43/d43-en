<usfm>
\v 16 But our ancestors were very proud and stubborn [IDI], and they did not obey what you commanded them to do.
\v 17 They refused to heed you, and they forgot about all the miracles that you had performed for them. Instead, they became stubborn [IDI], and they appointed someone to lead them back to Egypt, where they would be slaves again! But you are a God who forgives us and who acts kindly and mercifully \add toward us\add*. You do not quickly become angry. You are always faithfully loving us.

\v 16 But they and our ancestors acted disrespectfully, and they were stubborn, and did not listen to your commandments.
\v 17 They refused to listen, and they did not think about the wonders that you had done among them, but became stubborn, and in their rebellion they appointed a leader to return to their slavery. But you are a God who is full of forgiveness, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love. You did not abandon them.

===== Translation Notes: =====

In these verses, the Levites continue to praise Yahweh in the presence of the people of Israel.

  * **But they and our ancestors** - Here "they" refers to the Israelites at the time of Moses, and "our" refers to the people of Israel. 
  * **they were stubborn...became stubborn** - The literal statement is "they hardened their necks" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **the wonders that you had done among them** - "the miracles that you had done among them"
  * **they appointed a leader to return to their slavery** - "They appointed a leader to take them back to their slavery." After the Exodus from Egypt, the Israelites talked about appointing such a leader. (See: [[en:bible:notes:num:14:04|Num 14:04]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **who is full of forgiveness** - "who is ready to forgive"
