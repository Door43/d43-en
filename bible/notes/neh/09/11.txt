Their soldiers sank into the deep sea like stones!

===== Translation Notes: =====

In these verses, the Levites continue to praise Yahweh in the presence of the people of Israel.

  * **And you divided the sea** - Here "you" refers to God. The Levites are telling the story of the exodus from Egypt.
  * **divided** - "ripped open" or "split open"
  * **you...threw those who pursued them into the depths, as a stone into deep waters** - In this simile, the writer describes God throwing the Egyptians into the sea as a person would throw a stone into water.  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
