In these verses, the Levites continue to praise Yahweh in the presence of the people of Israel.

  * **You gave your good Spirit to instruct them** - Here "you" and "your" refer to Yahweh, and "them" refers to the Israelites at the time of Moses.
  * **and your manna you did not withhold from their mouths** - "and you did not withhold your manna from their mouths" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_order]])
  * **instruct** - "teach"
