===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - In these verses, the Levites continue to praise Yahweh in the presence of the people of Israel.

  * **You led them** - Yahweh led the Israelites.
  * **you came down** - When God talks with his people, he is often described as "coming down" or "coming down from heaven." This is a descriptive way of saying that God appeared to that person. AT: "you appeared" or "you came down from heaven" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **righteous decrees and true laws, good statutes and commandments** - Both of these double phrases describe the same thing, the law of Moses. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
