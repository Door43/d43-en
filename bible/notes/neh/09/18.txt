====== Nehemiah 09:18-19 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm> \v 18 So, even though \add their leaders\add* made an idol that resembled a calf and insulted you by saying \add about the idol\add*, 'This is your god, who brought you up out of Egypt,' you did not desert them. \pi \v 19 Because you always act mercifully, you did not abandon them when they were in the desert. The bright cloud which was like a huge pillar continued to lead them during the daytime, and the fiery cloud showed them where to walk at night. </usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 18 So, you did not desert them, even though they melted precious metals and cast an idol that looked like a calf. They presented this calf to the people and said, 'This is your god, who brought you up out of Egypt,' while they cursed God and did what he had forbidden. \pi \v 19 You always acted mercifully, and you would not abandon them when they were in the desert. The bright cloud which was like a huge pillar continued to lead them during the daytime, and the fiery cloud showed them where to walk at night. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 18 You did not abandon them even when they cast a calf out of molten metal and said, 'This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt,' while they committed great blasphemies. \v 19 You, in your compassion, did not abandon them in the wilderness. The pillar of cloud to lead them on the way did not leave them during day, neither did the pillar of fire by night to illuminate for them the road on which they were to walk. </usfm>
