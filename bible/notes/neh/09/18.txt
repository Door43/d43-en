<usfm>
\v 18 So, even though \add their leaders\add* made an idol that resembled a calf and insulted you by saying \add about the idol\add*, 'This is your god, who brought you up out of Egypt,' you did not desert them.
\pi
\v 19 Because you always act mercifully, you did not abandon them when they were in the desert. The bright cloud which was like a huge pillar continued to lead them during the daytime, and the fiery cloud showed them where to walk at night.

<usfm>
\v 18 So, you did not desert them, even though they melted precious metals and cast an idol that looked like a calf. They presented this calf to the people and said, 'This is your god, who brought you up out of Egypt,' while they cursed God and did what he had forbidden.
\pi
\v 19 You always acted mercifully, and you would not  abandon them when they were in the desert. The bright cloud which was like a huge pillar continued to lead them during the daytime, and the fiery cloud showed them where to walk at night.

\v 18 You did not abandon them even when they cast a calf out of molten metal and said, 'This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt,' while they  committed great blasphemies.
\v 19 You, in your compassion, did not abandon them in the wilderness. The pillar of cloud to lead them on the way did not leave them during day, neither did the pillar of fire by night to illuminate for them the road on which they were to walk.

===== Translation Notes: =====

In these verses, the Levites continue to praise Yahweh in the presence of the people of Israel.

  * **You did not abandon them even when they cast a calf out of molten metal and said, 'This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt,' while they committed great blasphemies.  You, in your compassion, did not abandon them in the wilderness** - "Even when they made a calf out of molten metal and said, 'This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt,' and committed great blasphemies, you in your great mercies did not abandon them in the wilderness."
  * **You did not abandon them** - Here "you" refers to Yahweh, and "them" refers to the Israelites at the time of Moses.
  * **cast a calf out of molten metal** - "molded a calf out of melted metal"
  * **The pillar of cloud...the pillar of fire** - See [[en:bible:notes:neh:09:12|09:12]]
  * **the road** - "the path" or "the way"
