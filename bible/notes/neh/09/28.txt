===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 But after there was a time of peace again, our ancestors again did things that displeased you. So again you allowed their enemies to conquer them. But whenever they cried out to you again \add to help them\add*, you heard them from heaven, and because you act mercifully, you rescued them many times.
\pi
\v 29 You warned them that they should again \add obey\add* your laws, but they became proud and stubborn, and they disobeyed your commands. They sinned by disobeying what you commanded them to do, the things that would enable them to live a good long life \add if they obeyed them\add*. They stubbornly refused [IDI] to listen to you and continued sinning.

\v 28 But after there was a time of peace again, our ancestors again did evil things that you hated. So you allowed their enemies to conquer them and ruled over them. But whenever they cried out to you again to help them, you heard them from heaven, and because you act mercifully you rescued them.
\pi
\v 29 You warned them that they should again obey your laws, but they became proud and stubborn, and they disobeyed your decrees. They disobeyed what you commanded them to do. They paid them no attention. And they stubbornly refused to listen to you.

\v 28 But after they had rest, they did evil again before you, and you abandoned them to the hand of their enemies, so their enemies ruled over them. Yet when they returned and cried out to you, you heard from heaven, and many times because of your compassion you rescued them. 
\v 29 You warned  them so they might turn back to your law. Yet they acted arrogantly and did not listen to your commands. They sinned against your decrees which give life to anyone who obeys them. They did not obey them, but they paid them no attention, and they refused even to listen to them.

===== Translation Notes: =====

In these verses, the Levites continue to praise Yahweh in the presence of the people of Israel. 

  * **to the hand of their enemies** - AT: "to their enemies control" (see previous verse 27: [[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:metaphor]])
  * **so their enemies ruled over them**  - AT "so their enemies subdued them"
  * **you rescued them**  - AT "you delivered them"
  * **your decrees which give life**  - the decrees do not give life but obeying the decrees causes God to bless the obedient person. "giving life" is a [[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:metaphor]]. God blessing, the life giving.
