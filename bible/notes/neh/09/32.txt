\v 32 Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps his covenant and steadfast love, do not let all this hardship seem little to you that has come on us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our ancestors, and on all your people from the days of the kings of Assyria until today.
