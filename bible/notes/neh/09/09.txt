\v 9 You saw what our ancestors were suffering in Egypt. You heard them cry to you for help when they were at the Red Sea.
\v 10 Because you knew that the leaders of Egypt were treating our ancestors very arrogantly, you performed many kinds of miracles that caused the king and his officials and all his people to suffer. As a result, you became famous then, and you are still famous!

===== Translation Notes: =====

In these verses, the Levites continue to praise Yahweh in the presence of the people of Israel.

  * **You saw the affliction** - Here "you" refers to God.
  * **You heard their cry** - The implied information is that God was moved to action because of the Israelites' cries for help. (See: [[[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]))
  * **signs and wonders against Pharaoh** - The plagues tested Pharaoh's heart, and they became a witness against his hardness of heart. AT: "signs and wonders that testified against Pharaoh" or "signs and wonders that condemned Pharaoh"
  * **all the people of his land** - "all the Egyptians"
  * **acted with arrogance against them** - "were arrogant toward the Israelites" or "mistreated God's chosen people"
  * **you made a name for yourself** - This is another way of saying "you showed the world your character" or "you demonstrated your power." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **which stands to this day** - "which people still remember" or "which endures even now"
