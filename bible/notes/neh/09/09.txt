\v 9 You saw what our ancestors were suffering in Egypt. You heard them cry to you for help when they were at the Red Sea.
\v 10 Because you knew that the leaders of Egypt were treating our ancestors very arrogantly, you performed many kinds of miracles that caused the king and his officials and all his people to suffer. As a result, you became famous then, and you are still famous!

\v 9 And you saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heard their cry by the Red Sea,
\v 10 and showedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land; for you knew
that they dealt proudly against them, and did get you a name, as it is this day.
