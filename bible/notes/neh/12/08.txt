===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah...Bakbukiah, and Unno** - These are male names (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
    * **Mattaniah...was in charge of the thanksgiving songs, along with his associates. Bakbukiah and Unno, their associates, stood opposite them during the service** - This means one person led two groups of singers in a musical form called 'call and response.'
