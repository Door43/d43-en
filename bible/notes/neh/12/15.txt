===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The list that began in [[:en:bible:notes:neh:12:12|12:12]] continues.

  * **Adna ... Helkai ... Zechariah ... Meshullam ... Zichri ... Piltai ... Shammua ... Jehonathan ... Mattenai ... Uzzi ... Kallai ... Eber ... Hashabiah ... Nethanel** - These are all names of men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Harim ... Meraioth ... Iddo ... Ginnethon ... Abijah ... Miniamin ... Moadiah ... Bilgah ... Shemaiah ... Joiarib ... Jedaiah ... Sallai ... Amok ... Hilkiah ... Jedaiah** - These are all names of families that are named after men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **was the leader of** - "was the leader of the family of" or "was the leader of the descendants of"
  * **Meshullam was the leader of Ginnethon** - Ginnethon may be another form of the name Ginnethoi. 
  * **of Miniamin** - The Hebrew text mistakenly leaves out the name of the leader of the family of Miniamin. Some modern versions leave the expression incomplete, as the ULB does. Other versions provide a short explanation to make up for the omission of the leader's name, as the UDB does.
  * **Moadiah** - Maadiah may be another form of the name Moadiah.
