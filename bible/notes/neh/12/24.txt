\v 24 These are the leaders of the clans who are descendants of Levi: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel and others who were divided into two groups. The two groups \add faced each other\add*, one group replying to the other, during the time that they praised and thanked God. They did that just as King David, the man \add who served\add* God well, had instructed.
\v 25 These singers included Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, and Obadiah.
\p The men who guarded the storerooms close to the gates \add of the temple\add* were Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub.
\v 26 They did that work during the time that Joiakim, who was the son of Jeshua and the grandson of Jehozadak, \add was the supreme priest\add*, and I was the governor, and Ezra was the priest who knew the Jewish laws very well.
