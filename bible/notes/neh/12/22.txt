\v 22 During time when Eliashib led the Levites, this is a list of them all: Elisahib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua were the leaders of all the priests.  They wrote the names of the families who were descendants of Levi. When Darius was the king of Persia, the priests were responsible for recording who were the heads of families.
\v 23 They wrote the names of the leaders of the families who were descendants of Levi in the book of the annals. They recorded the events until the time Eliashib's grandson Johanan was the leader of all the priests.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **In the days of Eliashib, the Levites, Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua, were recorded as the heads of families, and the priests were recorded during the reign of Darius the Persian** - This statement is ambiguous since it is not clear whether the Levites and priests represented one group or were two different groups.  Here is one possible translation: "The family heads of the Levites in the days of Eliashib (Joiada, Johanan and Jaddua), as well as those of the priests, were recorded in the reign of Darius the Persian." 
    * **Eliashib...Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua, were recorded as the heads of families** - These males were recorded as heads of families. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
    * **The descendants of Levi and their leaders of families** - "The descendants of Levi, leaders of families"
    * **recorded in the book of the annals** - This may refer to the Book of Chronicles.  The scribes wrote the words in the verses above in a book that recorded the events of each day.   
    * **up to the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib** - The records in the temple recorded only up until Johanan.
