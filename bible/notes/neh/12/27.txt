===== translationNotes: =====

  * **At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem** - "For the dedication of Jerusalem's wall" Nehemiah records the dedication of the entire city wall. 
  * **the people sought out the Levites wherever they lived, to bring them to Jerusalem to celebrate the dedication with joy, with thanksgivings and singing with cymbals, harps, and with lyres** - "the people looked everywhere for Levites who could best celebrate the wall's dedication with joy, thanksgiving, singing, and their musical instruments." The people in charge of the dedication sought out those who were best qualified, spiritually, musically, and in all ways. 
  * **cymbals** - two thin, round metal plates that are hit together to make a loud sound (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
