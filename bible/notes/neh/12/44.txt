They also kept there the \add other things that the people contributed\add*—the tithes and the first part of the grain and fruit that was harvested each year. Those men collected those things from the fields, Or: farms near the cities, and \add took them to Jerusalem and\add* gave them to the priests and the descendants of Levi, as \add Moses had said in his\add* laws that they should do. All the Israelite people were happy about the work that the priests and the descendants of Levi did,
\v 45 because they performed the rituals to purify things, and the other rituals that God had commanded. The musicians in the temple also did their work as King David and his son Solomon had declared that they should do.

\v 44 On that day men were appointed to be in charge of the storerooms where they kept the money that people gave for the temple. They also were in charge of the tithes and the first part of the grain and fruit that was harvested each year. They also brought into the storerooms a part of the harvest from the fields for the priests and the descendants of Levi. This was done because the people of Judah were so happy to have servants serving in the house of Yahweh.
\v 45 The priests and Levites were serving Yahweh in their rituals to purify things, and the musicians in the temple and the gatekeepers also did their work as King David and his son Solomon had declared that they should do.

\v 44 On that day men were appointed to be in charge of the storerooms for the contributions, the firstfruits, and the tithes, to gather into them the portions required by the law for the priests and for the Levites. Each was assigned to work the fields near the towns. For Judah rejoiced over the priests and the Levites who were standing before them.
\v 45 They performed the service of their God, and the service of purification, and so did the singers and the gatekeepers, in keeping with the command of David and of Solomon his son.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **men were appointed to be in charge** - This can be stated in active form. It is not clear who appointed the men. AT: "they appointed men to be in charge" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the contributions** - things the people gave to the priests
  * **For Judah rejoiced over the priests and the Levites** - It seems that the people appointed the men because the people of Judah were grateful for the priests and Levites who were serving. 
  * **who were standing before them** - The Levites and priests were not just standing, they were serving in their roles. The meaning can be made explicit. AT: "who were standing before them serving God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **gatekeepers** - These were people assigned to each gate, responsible to control access to the city or temple, as well as to open and close the gates at times and for reasons set by the administrator. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:neh:07:01|7:1]].
