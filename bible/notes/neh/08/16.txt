\v 16 So the people went out and brought the branches back and made themselves tents, each on their own roofs, in their courtyards, in the courts of the house of God, in the open place by the Water Gate, and in the square at the Gate of Ephraim.
\v 17 And all the assembly of those who had returned from captivity made tents and lived in them. For since the days of Joshua the son of Nun to that day, the people of Israel had not celebrated this festival. And the joy was very great.
