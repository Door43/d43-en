\v 1 All the people gathered together in the plaza that was close to the Water Gate. Men and women and children who were old enough to understand gathered together. They asked Ezra to bring out the scroll of the law that Moses had written down, and which Yahweh had given as the law for the people of Israel, for them to obey its rules and commands.
\v 2 Ezra, who served God through the sacrifices in the temple, brought out the law and presented it before all the people, to both men and women, and anyone else who could understand what he read. He did this on the first day of the seventh month of that year.
\v 3 So he brought it out and read it to the people. He read it from early in the morning until the middle of the day. All the people listened, men and women, anyone who was able to understand what he read. The people listened with great interest to what Ezra read from the book of the law.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **And all the people gathered themselves for one purpose** - AT: "The entire population gathered as one man" or "All the people gathered as one people."
    * **On the first day of the seventh month** - (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
    * **all who could hear and understand** - This is likely a different/additional category of people than the Jewish Assembly in the previous sentence.
