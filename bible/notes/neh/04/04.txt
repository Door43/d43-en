====== Nehemiah 04:4-6 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 Then I prayed. I said, "Our God, hear us, because they are ridiculing us! Cause the words of their insults to fall back on them! Allow their enemies to come and capture them and force them to go to a foreign land!
\v 5 They are guilty; they have caused you to be angry while the people here who are building the wall are listening; so punish them!"
\p
\v 6 But after some time, we finished building the wall around the whole city, up to half as high as the first wall had been. We were able to do that because we worked very hard.

\v 4 Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn back their reproach upon their own head, and give them up for a spoil in a
land of captivity;
\v 5 and cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee; for they have provoked
you to anger before the builders.
\v 6 So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together to half
the height thereof: for the people had a mind to work.
