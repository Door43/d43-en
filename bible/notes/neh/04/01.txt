Do they think that if they offer enough\f + \ft Or: many \f* sacrifices, \add their gods will hear them and enable\add* them to finish building the wall in one day? The stones \add that were in the wall previously have been weakened by\add* being burned in a fire. Those stones that they are pulling out of the rubbish\f + \ft Or: garbage \f* heaps—do they think that they can make them strong again?" \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 1 When Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the city wall, the fact that they were rebuilding Jerusalem burned like a fire within him, and he was furious and he spoke of the Jews with disgust.
\v 2 While his counselors and officials of the army troops who had come from Samaria were listening he said, "These Jews can hardly stand on their own legs, what do they think they are doing?  Will they rebuild the city and live in it themselves? Will they restore the temple and the all the sacrifices that the priests gave to Yahweh? Will they finish such a great work in only a day? Will they turn these burned and useless rocks into useful material to rebuilt the wall and will they bring life to the city again?
\p
\v 3 Tobiah was standing beside Sanballat. He said, "That wall they are building is so weak that even if a little fox climbed up on it, their stone wall would fall to the ground!"

\v 1 Now when Sanballat heard we were building the wall, it burned within him, and he was furiously angry, and he mocked the Jews.
\v 2 In the presence of his brothers and the army of Samaria, he said, "What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they restore the city for themselves? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they finish the work in a day? Will they bring to life the stones from the piles of rubble after they were burned?
\v 3 Tobiah the Ammonite was with him, and he said, "If only a fox went up on what they are building it would break down their stone wall!"

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Now when Sanballat** - Here Nehemiah uses the word "now" to signal a new part of the story.
  * **it burned within him, and he was furiously angry** - Here "it" refers to Sanballat's realization that the Jews are rebuilding the walls. AT: "the idea burned within him, and he became enraged"
  * **In the presence of his brothers** - "In the presence of his kinsmen" or "In the presence of his clan"
  * **What are these feeble Jews doing?  Will they restore the city...Will they offer sacrifices...Will they finish the work...Will they bring to life the stones from the piles of rubble after they were burned?** - Sanballat poses these questions not to receive an answer but to mock the Jews.  AT: "These feeble Jews can accomplish nothing.  They will never restore the city, offer sacrifices, finish the work, or bring to life the burned stones." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **feeble Jews** - "weak Jews"
