\v 22 At that time, I also said to the people, "Tell every worker and his helper that they must stay inside Jerusalem at night. By doing that, they can guard us at night, and they can work \add on the wall\add* during the daytime."
\v 23 During that time, none of us ever took off our clothes \f + \ft Or: we wore our clothes all the time \f* â€”I and my relatives and my workers and the guards who were with me. And we had our weapons with us, even \add when we went for\add* water \f + \ft Or: \add close to our\add* hands \f*.

\v 23 During that time, I did not put away my clothing, and I always carried my weapon The same was true of my brothers, my servants, and the men who followed me and served as guards. All of us did the same, even if we just went to get a drink of water.

\v 21 So we were doing the work. Half of them were holding spears from the rising of the dawn until the coming out of the stars.
\v 22 I also said to the people at that time, "Let every man and his servant spend the night in the middle of Jerusalem, so they may be for us a guard during the night and a worker in the day."
\v 23 So neither I, nor my brothers, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us changed our clothes, and each of us carried his weapon, even if he went for water.
