\v 12 The Jews who were living near our enemies came and told us many times, "You should leave the city and go to other places, in order that your enemies will not attack you!"
\p
\v 13 So I put guards at the places where the wall was not very high yet and at places where there were gaps in the wall. I put guards to protect each of their family groups. I gave the guards daggers, spears, and bows \add and arrows\add*.
\v 14 Then after I inspected everything, I summoned the leaders and other officials and many of the other people, and I said to them, "Do not be afraid of our enemies! Think about what Yahweh, who is great and glorious, \add can do\add*! And fight \add to protect\add* your friends, your families, and your homes!"

\v 12 The Jews who were living near our enemies came and told us many times, to warn us about the wicked plans our enemies were planning to carry out against us. 
\p
\v 13 So I put people from each of the families to stand guard at the wall. They were put at the lowest points of the wall, at the places where the wall would be most easily crossed over. They would protect it with their swords, their spears, and their bows and arrows.
\v 14 Then after I inspected everything, I summoned the leaders and other officials and many of the other people, and I said to them, "Do not be afraid of our enemies! Keep in mind God is great and glorious! And fight to protect your families, your sons and daughters, your wives, and your homes!"

\v 12 At that time the Jews who lived near them came from all directions and spoke to us ten times warning us about the schemes they were making against us.
\v 13 So I positioned people in the lowest parts of the wall in the exposed areas. I gave a position to each family. They had their swords, spears, and bows.
\v 14 And I looked, and stood up, and said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, "Do not be afraid of them. Call to mind the Lord, who is great and awesome. Fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives, and your homes.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the Jews...came from all different directions and spoke to us ten times** - This is a figure of speech that exaggerates to make a point. It means, "the Jews came from many different directions and spoke to us many times" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **in the exposed areas** - "in the vulnerable areas"
  * **Call to mind the Lord, who is great and awesome** - "Remember the great and awesome Lord" or "Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome."
  * **Fight for your families** - "Fight for your kinsmen"
  * **and your homes** - "and your households"
