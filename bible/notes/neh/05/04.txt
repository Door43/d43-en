\v 4 Others said, "We have \add needed to\add* borrow money to pay the taxes that the king \add commanded us to pay\add* on our fields and our vineyards.
\v 5 We are Jews just like [IDI] the other Jews. Our children are \add just as good as\f + \ft Or: equal with \f*\add* their children. But we have needed to sell some of our children to become slaves \add in order to pay what we owe\add*. We have already sold some of our daughters to become slaves.

\v 4 Others said, "We have needed to borrow money to pay the taxes we owe the king for our fields and our vineyards.
\v 5 We are Jews just like the other Jews. Our children are just as important to us as their children are to them. But we have been forced to sell our children to become slaves in order to pay what we owe. We have already sold some of our daughters to become slaves. Our fields and vineyards have been taken away from us, so now we do not have the money to pay what we owe."

\v 4 Some also said, "We have borrowed money to pay the king's tax on our fields and our vineyards.
\v 5 Yet now our flesh and blood is the same as our brothers, and our children are the same as their children. Yet we are forced to sell our sons and our daughters to become slaves. Some of our daughters have already been enslaved. But it is not in our power to help it because other men now own our fields and our vineyards.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **bold words**  - explanation
    * **our flesh and blood is the same as our brothers, and our children are the same as their children**  - These are two figures of speech in which a concept is expressed, emphasized and illustrated by using a concrete example. The concept being is "people/jews just like us." (see: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **Yet we are forced to sell our sons and our daughters to become slaves**  - This is the passive voice. If your language does not have that voice, you may need to change the passage to active voice, AT: "Yet the drought and our Jewish neighbors force us to sell our sons and daughters into slavery."
    * **bold words**  - explanation
    * **bold words**  - explanation
    * **But it is not in our power to help it because other men now own our fields and our vineyards.**  - This text assumes that information is already in the hearers' posession for the statement to make sense. That information is that their fields and vinyards must be in their possession to produce the money they need to escape this mess. (see: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]), (see: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicitinfo]]) If your readers will not understand this situation, you may need to add the implicit information AT: "But it is not in our power to help it because other men now own our fields and our vineyards, and we cannot earn money from the fields and vinyards."
