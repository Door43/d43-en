\v 4 There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king’s tribute
upon our fields and our vineyards.
\v 5 Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons
and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought into bondage
already: neither is it in our power to help it; for other men have our fields and our vineyards.
