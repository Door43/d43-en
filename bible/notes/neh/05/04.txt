\v 5 We are Jews just like the other Jews. Our children are just as important to us as their children are to them. But forced to sell our children to become slaves in order to pay what we owe.

\v 4 Some also said, "We have borrowed money to pay the king's tax on our fields and our vineyards.
\v 5 Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our children are the same as their children. Yet we are forced to sell our sons and our daughters to become slaves. Some of our daughters have already been enslaved. But it is not in our power to help it because other men now own our fields and our vineyards.
