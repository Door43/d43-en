====== Nehemiah 05:6-8 ======

<usfm>
\v 6 I was very angry when I heard these things that they were complaining about.
\v 7 So I thought about what I could do about it. I told the leaders and officials, "You are charging interest to your own relatives \add when they borrow money from you\add*!" Then I called together a large group of people,
\v 8 and I said to them, "Some of our Jewish relatives have been forced to sell themselves to become slaves of people who have come from other countries. As much as we have been able to, we have been buying them back. But now you are forcing your own relatives to sell themselves to you, their fellow Jews!" \add When I said that to\add* them, they were silent. There was nothing that they could say \add because they knew that what I said was true\add*.

\v 6 I was very angry when I heard these things about which they were so concerned.
\v 7 So I thought about what I could do about it. I told the leaders and officials, "You are charging interest to your own relatives when they borrow money from you. You know that is wrong!" Then I called together a large group of people to bring charges against them.
\v 8 I said to them, "Some of our Jewish relatives have been forced to sell themselves to become slaves of the nations. As much as we have been able, we have been buying them back. But now you are even selling your own relatives so that they might be sold back to us, their fellow Jews!" When I said that to them, they were silent. They did not answer with even a single word.

\v 6 I was very angry when I heard their outcry and these words.
\v 7 Then I thought about this, and brought charges against the nobles and officials. I said to them, "You are exacting interest, each from his own brother." I held a great assembly against them
\v 8 and said to them, "We, as much as we are able, have bought back from slavery our Jewish brothers who had been sold to the nations, but you even sell your brothers and sisters that they may be sold back to us!" They were silent and never found a word to say.
