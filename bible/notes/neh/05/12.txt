\v 12 The leaders replied, "We will do what you have said. We will return to them everything that we forced them to give to us, and we will not require that they give us anything more."
\p Then I summoned the priests, and I forced the leaders to solemnly promise in front of them that they would do what they had promised to do.
\v 13 I shook out the folds of my robe and said to them, "If you do not do what you have just now promised to do, I hope\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that God will shake you like I am shaking my robe. He will separate you from your homes and from everything that you own."
\p They all replied, "Amen\f + \ft Or: May \f* it be so!" And they praised Yahweh. Then they did what they had promised to do.

\p They all replied, "Amen, let it be so!" And they praised Yahweh. Then they did what they had promised to do.

\v 12 Then they said, "We will return what we took from them, and will require nothing from them. We will do as you say."  Then I called the priests, and made them swear to do as they had promised. 
\v 13 I shook out the fold of my robe and said, "So may God shake out of his house and possessions every man who does not keep his promise. So may he be shaken out and emptied."  
\p All the assembly said, "Amen," and they praised Yahweh. And the people did as they had promised.

  * **Then they said** - Here "they" refers to the Jewish nobles.
  * **We will return what we took from them** - The nobles are saying they will return the money which the poorer Jews paid in interest charges.

  * **Then I called** - "I" refers to Nehemiah.
  * **and made them swear** - "and made the Jewish nobles take an oath"
  * **I shook out the fold of my robe** - Many times in the Old Testament, oaths were physically demonstrated as a witness to what was promised. Nehemiah is demonstrating to the nobles what will happen if they break the promise they had made.
