\v 12 The leaders replied, "We will do what you have said. We will return to them everything that we forced them to give to us, and we will not require that they give us anything more."
\p Then I summoned the priests, and I forced the leaders to solemnly promise in front of them that they would do what they had promised to do.
\v 13 I shook out the folds of my robe and said to them, "If you do not do what you have just now promised to do, I hope\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that God will shake you like I am shaking my robe. He will separate you from your homes and from everything that you own."
\p They all replied, "Amen\f + \ft Or: May \f* it be so!" And they praised Yahweh. Then they did what they had promised to do.

\v 12 Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do, even as you sayest. Then I called
the priests, and took an oath of them, that they would do according to this promise.
\v 13 Also I shook out my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that performeth not
this promise; even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the assembly said, Amen, and praised Jehovah. And the people did
according to this promise.
