\v 18 Each day I told my servants to serve us the meat from one ox, six very good sheep, and birds. And every ten days I gave them a large new supply of wine. But I knew that the people were burdened by paying a great deal of money for taxes, so I did not accept the money that I was entitled to as governor.
\p
\v 19 My God, think of me, and reward me for all that I have done for this people.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 Now what was prepared each day was one ox, six choice sheep, and also birds, and every ten days all kinds of wine in abundance, yet for all this I did not demand the food allowance of the governor, because the demands were too heavy on the people.
\p
\v 19 Call me to mind, my God, for good, because of all that I have done for this people.
