\v 6 Listen to my prayer and open your eyes, so you may hear the prayer of your servant that I now pray before you day and night for the people of Israel your servants. I am confessing the sins of the people of Israel, which we have sinned against you. Both I and my father's house have sinned.
\v 7 We have acted very wickedly against you, and we have not kept the commandments, the statutes, and the rules you commanded your servant Moses.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **open your eyes** - Nehemiah speaks if God paying attention to him as he prays as if God were to open his eyes and look at him. AT: "look at me" or "pay attention to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **so you may hear the prayer of your servant** - "so that you may hear the prayer that I, your servant, am praying." The word "servant" refers to Nehemiah. This is how a person would address his superior in order to show humility and respect. 
  * **day and night** - By saying that he prays both during the day and during the night, Nehemiah emphasizes the frequency of his prayers. AT: "all the time" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **Both I and my father's house** - Here the word "house" represents family. AT: "Both I and my family" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
