\v 6 Listen to my prayer and open your eyes, so you may hear the prayer of your servant that I now pray before you day and night for the people of Israel your servants. I am confessing the sins of the people of Israel, which we have sinned against you. And I and and the house of my father have sinned.
\v 7 We have acted very wickedly against you, and we have not kept the commandments,  the laws, and the decrees you commanded your servant Moses.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Listen to my prayer and open your eyes** - "Let your ear be attentive and your eyes opened" 
  * **Listen to** - AT: "give your attention to" or "please consider" or "give ear to"
  * **open your eyes** - Nehemiah is speaking with God as if he has human attributes. AT: "see and respond" or "look at what is happening" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **so that you may hear the prayer of your servant** - The word "servant" refers to Nehemiah.  This is how a person would address his superior.  Referring to oneself in this way showed humility and respect. 
  * **day and night** - This phrase uses two extremes in time to convey all the time. - AT: "without stopping" or "all of the time" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **confessing the sins** - AT: "admitting guilt for the sins"
  * **And I and and the house of my father** - "Both I and my father's house"
  * **We have acted very wickedly** - AT: "We have lived very sinful lives."
