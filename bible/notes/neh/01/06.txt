\v 6 Let your ear now be attentive, and your eyes open, that you may listen to the prayer of your servant, which I pray
before you at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel your servants, while I confess the sins of the children of
Israel, which we have sinned against thee. Yea, I and my father’s house have sinned:
\v 7 we have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which
you commanded your servant Moses.
