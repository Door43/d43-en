\v 6 Listen to my prayer and open your eyes, so you may hear the prayer of your servant that I now pray before you day and night for the people of Israel your servants. I am confessing the sins of the people of Israel, which we have sinned against you. Both I and my father's house have sinned.
\v 7 We have acted very wickedly against you, and we have not kept the commandments, the laws, and the decrees you commanded your servant Moses.

  * **Listen to** - AT: "give your attention to" or "please consider" or "give ear to"
  * **open your eyes** - Nehemiah is speaking with God as if he has human attributes. AT: "see and respond" or "look at what is happening" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
