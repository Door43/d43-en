\v 10 We are your servants. We are the people whom you have delivered from slavery by your very great power; you did because you are able to do whatever you desire.
\v 11 Yahweh, please hear my prayer, I who am your servant, and hear the prayers of all your people who have great joy when they honor you for who you are and what you do.
