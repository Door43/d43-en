\v 10 We are your servants. We are the people whom you brought back here by your very great power \f + \ft metonymy, doublet \f* \add from being exiled in Babylonia\add*.
\v 11 Yahweh, please hear this prayer of mine, and the prayers of all your people who are delighted to revere you \f + \ft metonymy \f*.

\v 10 We are your servants. We are the people whom you have delivered from slavery by your very great power. You did that because you are able to do whatever you desire.
\v 11 Yahweh, please hear my prayer, I who am your servant. Please hear the prayers of all your people who have great joy when they honor you for who you are and what you do. Now I pray you would give me success when I go to the king; and protect me as I make a request of the king that could put my life in jeopardy. Give me mercy."
\p I was serving as one of the most trusted servants to the king.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Nehemiah continues his prayer to God.

  * **Now they are your servants** - The word "they" refers to the Israelites, and "your" refers to God.
  * **Now** - This word is used here to shift from words which God spoke to Moses (see [[en:bible:notes:neh:01:08|01:8-9]]) to words which Nehemiah is speaking to God.    
  * **your strong hand** - Nehemiah gives human characteristics to God. "Hand" here represents strength, power, or control. AT: "your great strength". (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **Listen now** - AT: "Let your ear be attentive"
  * **the prayer of your servant** - The word "servant" refers to Nehemiah. This is how a person would address his superior.  Referring to oneself in this way showed humility and respect.
  * **your servants who delight to...** - AT: "your servants who are happy to..." OR "your servants who are pleased to..."
  * **to honor your name** - "to revere your name" OR "to lift up your reputation"
  * **grant him**- Nehemiah is referring to himself in the third person to express his humility before God. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **in the sight of this man** - "This man" refers to Artaxerxes, the King of Persia.
