\v 10 One day I went to talk with Shemaia son of Delaiah and grandson of Mehetabel. I went to talk with him in his house. He was ordered not to leave his house. He said to me, "You and I must enter the temple, and we must go to one of the rooms in the center of the temple, and lock the doors. They are going to come to kill you. They are coming tonight to kill you."
\p
\v 11 I replied, "I am not that kind of person! I would not run and hide in the temple to save my life! No, I will not do that!"

\v 10 I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah son of Mehetabel, who was confined in his home. He said, "Let us meet together in the house of God, inside the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you. At night they are coming to kill you."
\v 11 I replied, "Would a man like me run away? Would a man like me go into the temple just so he could save his own life? I will not go in!"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Shemaiah ... Delaiah ... Mehetabel** - These are men's names. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **who was confined in his home** - The writer does not give the reason for him being confined, so it is best to say that he was staying at home using the most general words possible. AT: "whom the authorities had ordered to stay in his house" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Would a man like me run away? Would a man like me go into the temple just so he could save his own life?** - Nehemiah uses these rhetorical question to emphasize that he will not do what Shemaiah has suggested. These questions may be written as statements. AT: "A man like me would not run away. And a man like me would not go into the temple just to hide to stay alive." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
