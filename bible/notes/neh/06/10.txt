\v 10 One day I went to talk with Shemaia son of Delaiah and grandson of Mehetabel. I went to talk with him in his house. He was ordered not to leave his house. He said to me, "You and I must enter the temple, and we must go to one of the rooms in the center of the temple, and lock the doors. They are going to come to kill you. They are coming tonight to kill you."

\v 11 I replied, "I am not that kind of person! I would not run and hide in the temple to save my life! No, I will not do that!"

\v 10 I went to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was confined in his home. He said, "Let us meet together in the house of God, inside the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you. At  night they are coming to kill you."
\v 11 I replied, "Would a man like me run away?  And would a man like me go into the temple just so I might live? I will not go in."

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **Shemaiah...Delaiah...Mehetabel** - These are men's names. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
    * **Shemaiah** - one of the Jewish officials
    * **confined in his home** - "a shut-in," someone who cannot leave his house because of weakness or illness.
    * **Let us meet together in the house of God, inside the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you. At night they are coming to kill you** - It would appear to Nehemiah's followers that he was hiding in the temple, a sign of weakness.
    * **Would a man like me run away? And would a man like me go into the temple just so I might live?** - The questions do not expect an answer, but are used for emphasis.  AT: "A man like me would not run away. And a man like me would not go into the temple just to stay alive." (see: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
