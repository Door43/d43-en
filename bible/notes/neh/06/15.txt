\v 15 On October 2 we finished rebuilding the wall. We did it all in 52 days.
\v 16 When our enemies in the nearby countries heard about that, they realized that they had been humiliated, because everyone knew that it was because God helped us that we had been able to do this work \add and that they had not been able to force us to quit\add*.

\v 15 So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of the month of Elul, after fifty-two days. 
\v 16 When all our enemies heard of it, all the nations around us, they became afraid and they fell greatly in their own esteem. For they knew the work was done with the help of our God.
