\v 8 When I read that message, I sent the messenger back to Sanballat to say, "None of what you are saying is true. You have made this up in your own imagination."
\v 9 I said that because I knew that they were trying to cause us to be afraid, so that they thought, "They will become so discouraged that they will not work on the wall any more, and the work will never be finished." So I prayed, "O God, give me courage."

<usfm>
\v 8 Then I sent word to him saying, "No such things have occurred as you say, for within your heart you invented them." 
\v 9 For they all wanted to make us afraid thinking, "They will drop their hands from doing the work, and it will not be done." But now, God, please strengthen my hands.
