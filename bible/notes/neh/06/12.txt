===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 When I thought \add about what he had said\add*, I realized that God had not told Shemaiah to say that to me. I realized that Tobiah and Sanballat had bribed him \add to say that to me\add*.
\v 13 They had bribed him to cause me to be afraid. They wanted me to \add disobey God's commands\add* and sin \add by hiding in the temple\add*. If I did that, they would be able to ruin my reputation \f + \ft metonymy \f* and discredit me.
\p
\v 14 \add So I prayed\add*, "My God, do not forget what Tobiah and Sanballat have done. Punish them. And do not forget that the female prophet Noadiah and some of the other prophets have also tried to cause me to be afraid."

\v 12 I thought about what he had said, and I saw that God had not told Shemaiah what to say to me. Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
\v 13 They had hired him to frighten me. They wanted me to disobey God's commands and sin by hiding in the temple. If I did that, they would give me a bad name for what I had done, and then they would humiliate me.
\p
\v 14 So I prayed, "My God, do not forget what Tobiah and Sanballat have done. And do not forget the prophetess Noadiah and the other prophets who tried to make me be afraid."

\v 12 I realized that it was not God who sent him, but that he had prophesied against me. Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
\v 13 They hired him to make me afraid, so that I might do what he said and sin, so they could give me a bad name in order to humiliate me. 
\v 14 Call to mind Tobiah and Sanballat, my God, and all that they did. Also call to mind the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who tried to make me be afraid.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I realized that it was not God who sent him, but that he had prophesied against me**  - Here "I" refers to Nehemiah, and "him" refers to Shemaiah. AT: "I recognized that it was not God who sent Shemaiah because he had prophesied against me." (See: [[:en:bible:notes:neh:06:10|06:10]])
  * **Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him**  - Shemaiah was paid by and under the control of Tobiah and Sanballat.
  * **so that I might do what he said and sin**  - AT: "so I might sin by misusing the temple"
  * **and so they could give me a bad name in order to humiliate me**  - "so they would have an account that they could use to discredit me"
  * **Call to mind**  - This phrase is ambiguous. It is unclear if Nehemiah is asking God to help him (Nehemiah) remember Tobiah and Sanballat or if Nehemiah is asking God to remember these men. AT: "Remember" 
  * **the prophetess Noadiah**  - Here "Noadiah" is the name of a female (a prophetess), but the name can be male or female. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])
