===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **Sanballat sent his servant to me in the same way the fifth time** - Identifying this message separately means it is distinct in some way from the previous four messages and, therefore, should be noted.  AT: "Sanballat sent his servant to me the fifth time"
    * **an open letter** - The letter was an unsealed diplomatic communication. This was an insult to the recipient because the courier was free to read it and spread its contents among the people of the region.
    * **in his hand** - AT: "in his possession"
    * **It is reported among the nations that** - AT: "The rumor in the region is that" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
    * **you and the Jews are planning to rebel, for that is why you are rebuilding the wall. From what these reports say, you are about to become their king** - Nehemiah is accused of plotting treachery against his benefactor, Artaxerxes, the Persian king whom Nehemiah served as cupbearer.  (See: [[en:bible:notes:neh:02:01|02:1]])  
   * **for that is why you are rebuilding** - AT: "and that is why you are rebuilding"
