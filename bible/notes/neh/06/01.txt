\v 1 Now when Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian and the rest of our enemies heard that I rebuilt the wall and that there were no longer any sections left broken open, although I had not yet set up the doors in the gates, 
\v 2 Sanballat and Geshem sent to me saying, "Come, let us meet together somewhere in the plain of Ono." But they intended to do harm to me.
