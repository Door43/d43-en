\v 3 I sent messengers to them, saying, "I am doing a great work and I cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?"

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I sent a messenger to them**  - Here (and in verse 4) "them" refers to Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:neh:06:01|06:1]])
  * **and I cannot**  - "and I am unable to" or "and I am not able to"
  * **Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?**  - This is a statement posed as a question that does not expect (and does not get) an answer. The purpose of the question is to challenge Sanballat. AT: "I will not let the work stop while I leave it and come down to you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
