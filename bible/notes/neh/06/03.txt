\v 3 I sent messengers to them, saying, "I am doing a great work and I cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?"
\v 4 They sent me the same message four times, and I answered them the same way each time.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I am doing a great work** - Nehemiah was supervising the rebuilding of the wall. He was not building it himself. AT: "I am supervising a great work" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?** - This rhetorical question is used to challenge Sanballat's request. This can be written as a statement. AT: "I cannot let the work stop and come down to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **down to you** - The word "down" is used here because the plain of Ono where they were requesting Nehemiah to come is at a lower elevation than Jerusalem.
