===== Translation Notes: =====

Nehemiah is continuing to recount the number of people who returned from exile. The people were grouped by family according to the name of their patriarch. With Bethlehem the list goes according to the ancestors from that location. The number represents the number of males in each family. (See how you translated numbers in [[en:bible:notes:neh:07:11|07:11-14]].)

  * **Bezai...Hariph...Gibeon** - These are the names of the patriarchs of each family group. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Bethlehem and Netophah** - These are the names of two villages in Judah. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
