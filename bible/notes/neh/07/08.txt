===== Translation Notes: =====

Nehemiah is recounting the number of people who returned from exile. The people were grouped by family according to the name of their patriarch. The number represents the number of males in each family. (See [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])

  * **the number of the men** - A census had been taken when the Israelites first returned to Jerusalem after the exile. The numbers represent how many men belonged to each family group.
  * **Parosh...Shephatiah...Arah** - These are the names of the patriarch of each family group. Family groups would contain children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
