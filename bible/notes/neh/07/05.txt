  * **My God put into my heart** - Though God did not really put a thought into Nehemiah's physical heart, he caused Nehemiah to have this idea. AT: "My God made me think of an idea" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **to enroll them** - "to list, register, and organize them"
  * **The Book of the Genealogy** - an official book of parents and births that was part of Hebrew culture
  * **and found the following written in it** - This can be expressed as a new sentence. "The items that follow are what I found and selected from those records."
