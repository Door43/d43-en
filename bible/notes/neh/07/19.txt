===== Translation Notes: =====

Nehemiah is continuing to recount the number of people who returned from exile. The people were grouped by family according to the name of their patriarch. The number represents the number of males in each family. (See how you translated numbers in [[en:bible:notes:neh:07:11|07:11-14]].)

  * **Bigvai...Adin...Ater...Hashum** - These are the names of the patriarchs of each family group. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **The descendents of Ater, of Hezekiah** - AT: "the descendants of Ater, who is a descendant of Hezekiah"
