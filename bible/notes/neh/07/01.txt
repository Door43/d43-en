\v 1 After the wall had been finished and we had put the gates in their places, we assigned to the temple guards and to the members of the \add sacred\add* choir and the other descendants of Levi the work that they were to do.
\v 2 I appointed two men to \add help me to\add* govern Jerusalem, my brother Hanani and Hananiah who was the commander of the fortress \add in Jerusalem\add*. Hananiah always did his work reliably, and he had more awesome respect for God than most other people have.
