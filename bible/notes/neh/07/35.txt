===== Translation Notes: =====

Nehemiah is continuing to recount the number of people who returned from exile. The people were grouped by the town where their ancestors came from. The number represents the number of males in each family. (See how you translated numbers in [[en:bible:notes:neh:07:11|07:11-14]].)

  * **The men of** - AT: "The descendants of"
  * **Harim...Jericho...Lod, Hadid...Ono...Senaah** - These are village names. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
