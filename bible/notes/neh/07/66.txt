===== Translation Notes: =====

(See how you translated numbers in [[en:bible:notes:neh:07:11|07:11-14]].)

  * **The whole assembly together** - "The entire congregation together"   The word "congregation" would be a good choice to reflect the nature of the community.
  * **singing men and women** - "male singers and female singers" The sentence structure imitates "their male servants and their female servants" just before it.
