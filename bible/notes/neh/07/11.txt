Nehemiah is continuing to recount the number of people who returned from exile. The people were grouped by family according to the name of their patriarch. The number represents the number of males in each family. (See [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])

  * **Pahath Moab** - Pahath Moab is a place name. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **the descendants of Jeshua and Joab** - AT: "that is, the descendants of Jeshua and Joab"
  * **Jeshua...Joab...Elam...Zattu...Zaccai** - These are the names of the patriarchs of each family group. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
