<usfm>
\v 13 We left the city, going out through the Valley Gate, then past the well called the Jackal \f + \ft Or: Dragon's \f* Well, and then past the gate called the Rubbish\f + \ft Or: Garbage \f* Gate. We inspected all the walls that had been broken down and all the gates that had been burned down.
\v 14 Then we went to the Fountain Gate and to the pool called the King's Pool, but my donkey could not get through \add the narrow opening\add* \f + \ft Or: \add the rubble\add* \f*.

\v 13 I passed through the Valley Gate and went outside of the city wall. Then I went around the city and passed by the well called the Jackal's Well. Then I proceeded to the Dung Gate. I inspected all the walls around Jerusalem and found they were all broken open, and the wooden gates all around the wall were burned to ashes.
\v 14 Then I went to the Fountain Gate and to the pool called the King's Pool, but my donkey could not get through the narrow opening.

\v 13 I went out by night by the Valley Gate, toward the Jackal's Well and to the Dung Gate, and inspected the walls of Jerusalem, which had been broken open, and the wooden gates were destroyed by fire.
\v 14 Then I went on to the Fountain Gate and to the king's pool. The place was too narrow for the animal I was riding to pass through.
