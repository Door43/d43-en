\v 13 I went out by night by the Valley Gate, toward the Jackal’s Well, and to the Dung Gate, and inspected the walls of Jerusalem, which had been broken open, and the wooden gates were destroyed by fire.
\v 14 Then I went on to the Fountain Gate and to the king’s pool. The place was too narrow for the animal I was riding to pass through.
