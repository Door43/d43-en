===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **May the king live forever!** - "Long live the king!" or "May the king have a long life!" Nehemiah is showing honor to King Artaxerxes. 
  * **Why should not my face be sad?** - "I am very sad." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **the place of my father's tombs** - AT: "the place of my ancestors"
  * **lies in ruins** - "is destroyed"
