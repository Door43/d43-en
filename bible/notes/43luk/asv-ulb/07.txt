\v 1 After he had ended all his sayings in the ears of the people, he entered into Capernaum.
\p
\v 2 And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear to him, was sick and at the point of death.
\v 3 And when he heard concerning Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him that he would come and save his
servant.
\v 4 And they, when they came to Jesus, implored him earnestly, saying, He is worthy that you should do this for him;
\v 5 for he loves our nation, and himself built us our synagogue.
\v 6 And Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him,
Lord, trouble not thyself; for I am not worthy that you should come under my roof:
\v 7 wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come to thee: but say the word, and my servant shall be healed.
\v 8 For I also am a man set under authority, having under myself soldiers: and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to
another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.
\v 9 And when Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned and said to the multitude that followed him, I say
to you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.
\v 10 And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole.
\p
\v 11 And it came to pass soon afterwards, that he went to a city called Nain; and his disciples went with him, and a great
multitude.
\v 12 Now when he drew near to the gate of the city, behold, there was carried out one that was dead, the only son of his
mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.
\v 13 And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said to her, Weep not.
\v 14 And he came near and touched the bier: and the bearers stood still. And he said, Young man, I say to thee, Arise.
\v 15 And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.
\v 16 And fear took hold on all: and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet is arisen among us: and, God has visited his
people.
\v 17 And this report went forth concerning him in the whole of Judaea, and all the region round about.
\p
\v 18 And the disciples of John told him of all these things.
\v 19 And John calling to him two of his disciples sent them to the Lord, saying, Are you he that cometh, or look we for
another?
\v 20 And when the men were come to him, they said, John the Baptist has sent us to thee, saying, Are you he that cometh,
or look we for another?
\v 21 In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and on many that were blind he bestowed sight.
\v 22 And he answered and said to them, Go and tell John the things which you have seen and heard; the blind receive their
sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have good tidings preached
to them.
\v 23 And blessed is he, whoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me.
\p
\v 24 And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to say to the multitudes concerning John, What went you out into
the wilderness to behold? a reed shaken with the wind?
\v 25 But what went you out to see? a man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they that are gorgeously apparelled, and live
delicately, are in kings’ courts.
\v 26 But what went you out to see? a prophet? Yea, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.
\v 27 This is he of whom it is written,
\q Behold, I send my messenger before your face,
\q Who shall prepare your way before thee.
\m
\v 28 I say to you, Among them that are born of women there is none greater than John: yet he that is but little in the
kingdom of God is greater than he.
\v 29 And all the people when they heard, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.
\v 30 But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected for themselves the counsel of God, being not baptized of him.
\v 31 Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation, and to what are they like?
\v 32 They are like to children that sit in the marketplace, and call one to another; who say, We piped to you, and you did
not dance; we wailed, and you did not weep.
\v 33 For John the Baptist is come eating no bread nor drinking wine; and you say, He has a demon.
\v 34 The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and you say, Behold, a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans
and sinners!
\v 35 And wisdom is justified of all her children.
\p
\v 36 And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he entered into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down
to meat.
\v 37 And behold, a woman who was in the city, a sinner; and when she knew that he was sitting at meat in the Pharisee’s house,
she brought an alabaster cruse of ointment,
\v 38 and standing behind at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her
head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.
\v 39 Now when the Pharisee that had commanded him saw it, he spoke within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would
have perceived who and what manner of woman this is that touches him, that she is a sinner.
\v 40 And Jesus answering said to him, Simon, I have somewhat to say to thee. And he saith, Teacher, say on.
\v 41 A certain lender had two debtors: the one owed five hundred shillings, and the other fifty.
\v 42 When they had not \add wherewith\add* to pay, he forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love him most?
\v 43 Simon answered and said, He, I suppose, to whom he forgave the most. And he said to him, You have rightly judged.
\v 44 And turning to the woman, he said to Simon, Seest you this woman? I entered into your house, you gave me no water
for my feet: but she has wetted my feet with her tears, and wiped them with her hair.
\v 45 You gave me no kiss: but she, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet.
\v 46 My head with oil you did not anoint: but she has anointed my feet with ointment.
\v 47 Wherefore I say to thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven,
\add the same\add* loves little.
\v 48 And he said to her, Your sins are forgiven.
\v 49 And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that even forgives sins?
\v 50 And he said to the woman, Your faith has saved thee; go in peace.
