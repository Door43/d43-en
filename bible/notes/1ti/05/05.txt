====== 1 Timothy 05:5-6 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 The widows who are really alone and have no one \add to help them\add* confidently expect that God \add will help them\add*. So night and day they pray, earnestly asking \f + \ft doublet \f* \add God that he will help them and others\add*.
\v 6 But widows who just want to have a lot of pleasure are \add spiritually\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* dead, although they are \add physically\add* alive.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Now, a real widow is a widow who has no family members. So she depends on God and on what he gives her when she asks him and prays to him all day and night long.
\v 6 But a widow who lives for how she can please herself is dead, even though she is still alive.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 But a real widow is left all alone. She puts her certain hope in God. She always remains with requests and prayers both night and day.
\v 6 However, the woman who lives for pleasure is dead, even though she is still alive.
</usfm>
