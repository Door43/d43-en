===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **be enrolled as a widow**  - There seems to have been a list, written or not, of widows. The church met these women's needs for shelter, clothing, and food, and the women were expected to devote their lives to serving the church.
  * **who is not younger in years than sixty**  -  Widows who were younger than sixty years old might get married again, but the church was to care for widows who were older than sixty. 
  * **a wife of one husband** - "a woman who was faithful to her husband"
  * **She must be known for good deeds** - The phrases following this are examples of the kinds of good things a woman might be know for doing. 
  * **washed the feet**  - "does common work to help." Washing the dirty feet of people who have been walking in the dirt and mud is a metonym or metaphor for meeting other people's needs and making life more enjoyable for them. (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]], [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
  * **saints**  - "God's holy people"
  * **has followed every good work**  - "is known for doing good works"
