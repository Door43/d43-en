===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 Put a woman on the list of true widows if she is more than sixty years old. She also must have had only one husband, to whom she had been faithful.
\v 10 People must know that she does good deeds: perhaps she takes care of children; perhaps she welcomes strangers; perhaps she helps the believers or people who are suffering; or perhaps she is known for doing a large variety of good things.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 Let a widow be enrolled as a widow who is not younger in years than sixty, a wife of one husband.
\v 10 She must be known for good deeds, whether it is that she has cared for children, or has been  hospitable to strangers, or has washed the feet of the saints, or has relieved the afflicted, or has followed every good work.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **be enrolled as a widow**  - There seems to have been a list, written or not, of widows. The church met these women's needs for shelter, clothing, and food, and the women were expected to devote their lives to serving the church.
  * **who is not younger in years than sixty**  -  Widows who were younger than sixty years old might get married again, but the church was to care for widows who were older than sixty. 
  * **a wife of one husband** - "a woman who was faithful to her husband"
  * **She must be known for good deeds** - The phrases following this are examples of the kinds of good things a woman might be know for doing. 
  * **washed the feet**  - "does common work to help." Washing the dirty feet of people who have been walking in the dirt and mud is a metonym or metaphor for meeting other people's needs and making life more enjoyable for them. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]], [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **saints**  - "God's holy people"
  * **has followed every good work**  - "is known for doing good works"
