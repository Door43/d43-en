====== 1 Timothy 05:23-25 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 23 \add And Timothy\add*, no longer drink \add only\add* water, but instead, drink a little wine \add also\add*, because \add that may help to cure\add* your stomach's frequent illnesses.
\v 24 \add I tell you not\add* \add to set apart\f + \ft Or: appoint\add* \f* \add elders hastily, without seeing how they conduct their lives, because\add* some people \add sin secretly\add*, so that it is not known what they have done until after someone examines them \f + \ft Or: before God judges them \f*. But some people sin openly, so that people know what they have done before anyone examines them.
\v 25 Similarly, although \add some people\add* do good deeds openly, with the result that people know what they have done, some people \add do good deeds secretly\add*, yet the good deeds that they have done cannot remain secret either.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 23 No longer drink only water, Timothy. Instead, drink a little wine for your many stomach sicknesses.
\v 24 The sins of some people are clear to everyone, and the church does not need much time to judge them.  But the church does not discover some sins until later.
\v 25 In the same way, some good deeds are clear to everybody, but even the other good deeds will become clear at some time in the future.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 23 You should no longer drink water, but rather you should take a little wine for the stomach and your frequent sicknesses.
\v 24 The sins of some people are openly known, and they go before them into judgment. But some follow later.
\v 25 Likewise, some good works are openly known, but even the others cannot be hidden.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (It is not clear how verse 23 fits with verse 22 and verses 24-25. It may simply be something unrelated that Paul wanted to say before he forgot it. If it is related, it would likely be a way of saying that by "pure" in the previous verse Paul was talking about conduct, not diet.)
  * **You should no longer drink water**  - or "You should stop being a water-drinker," one who drinks only water (UDB). Paul is not forbidding water. He is suggesting that Timothy use wine as medicine.
  * (In verse 24, Paul continues what he was saying in verse 22. The "sins of some people" would be the sins likely to be committed by those on whom hands are hastily placed [verse 22].)
  * **they go before them into judgment**  - “their sins go before those people into judgment.” Possible meanings are 1) Their sins show what the person is like even before it is time for the church to judge whether or not the person should be a leader, or 2) Their sins show what the person is like before it is time for the church to judge whether or not the person is guilty, or 3) Their sins are evident and God judges them now.
  * **some follow later**  - “But some sins follow those people later.” Possible meanings are 1) Timothy will not know about some sins until later, or 2) The church will not know about some sins until later, or 3) God will not judge some sins until the final judgment.
  * **good** - Here this means if it fits with God's character, purposes, and will.
  * **even the others cannot be hidden**  - "the other good works will be known in the future"
