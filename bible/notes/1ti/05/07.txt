\v 8 If anyone does not take care of those who live in his own house, and especially if he does not take care of his own family, he has denied\f + \ft Or: quit believing \f* what we believe and \add we should consider that\add* he is worse than a person who does not believe \add in Christ\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 You should announce these things so that these widows and their families will not do anything wrong.
\v 8 But anyone who does not try to help his own relatives, especially those who live in his own house, that person rejects what we believe. He is, in fact, worse than an unbeliever.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 Preach these things so that they may be without reproach.
\v 8 But if someone does not provide for his own relatives, especially for those of his own household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Preach these things** - "Command these things as well"
  * **so that they may be without reproach** - "so that no one can find fault with them." Possible meanings of "they" are 1) "these widows and their families" or 2) "the believers." It might be best to leave the subject as "they."
  * **does not provide for his own relatives** - "does not provide for what his relatives need" or "does not help with his relatives' needs"
  * **for those of his own household** - "for those family members living in his home"
  * **he has denied the faith** - "he has acted contrary to the truth we believe"
  * **is worse than an unbeliever** - "is worse than those who do not believe in Jesus." Paul means this person is worse than an unbeliever because even unbelievers take care of their relatives. Therefore, a believer should certainly take care of his relatives.
