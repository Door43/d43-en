===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 You should announce these things so that these widows and their families will not do anything wrong.
\v 8 But anyone who does not try to help his own relatives, especially those who live in his own house, that person rejects what we believe. He is, in fact, worse than an unbeliever.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **And preach these things **- "Command these things as well" or "Also, teach these things with authority." Timothy was to obey Paul's words himself **and** also to command others to obey Paul's words.
  * **so that they may be beyond reproach**  - "so that no one can find fault with them." Possible meanings of **they**: 1) "these widows and their families" (UDB) or 2) "the church." It might be best to leave the subject as "they."
  * **does not provide for his own relatives**  - “does not provide what his relatives need” or “does not help with his relatives' needs”
  * **for his own relatives **- "for all his family members" or "for those living at his home"
  * **for those of his own household**  - "for his family" or "for those family living in his home"
  * **he has denied the faith **- "he has acted though he has denied the faith" or "he has acted contrary to the truth we believe" or "he has turned his back on his beliefs"
  * **… is worse than an unbeliever**  - "… is worse than those who do not believe Jesus" or "those who do not believe in Jesus are better than …" Even those who do not believe in Jesus take care of their own families; how much more should believers do so!
