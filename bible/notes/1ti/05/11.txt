====== 1 Timothy 05:11-13 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 As for younger widows, do not put their names on that list, because they \add promise to do work for the congregation, but instead of doing that, they usually\add* want to marry \add again\add* \f + \ft Or: marry an unbeliever \f* when they have strong desires.
\v 12 If that happens, they may become guilty of not having done what they had promised \add to do for the congregation\add* \f + \ft Or: promised \add Christ that they would do\add*. \f*
\v 13 In addition, they \add generally\add* become lazy. Specifically, as they \add just\add* go about from house to house they also begin to gossip\f + \ft Or: to talk about people \f* and to meddle in other people's affairs, saying what they should not say.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 But do not put younger widows on the widows' list, because they often want to marry again when they change their minds and put married love ahead of Christ.
\v 12 When they do this, then they become guilty of going back on their commitment to being widows.
\v 13 Also, they go from house to house and get into the habit of doing nothing. They also engage in foolish and trivial activities and say things that they should not say.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 But as for younger widows, refuse to enroll them in the list. For when they give in to bodily desires against Christ, they want to marry.
\v 12 In this way they incur guilt because they revoke their first commitment.
\v 13 They also become accustomed to being idle. They go around from house to house. Not only do they become idle, but they also become gossips and meddlesome. They say things they should not say.
