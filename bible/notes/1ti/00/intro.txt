=== What is the Book of 1 Timothy about? ===

Paul, an older minister, gives the younger minister, Timothy, various instructions in this letter. The topics he addresses include: church worship, qualifications for church leaders, and warnings against false teachers.  This letter reflects how Paul was training Timothy to be a leader among the churches.  1 Timothy contains many principles that can help church leaders in our day to manage the ministry of the local church.

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “1 Timothy” or "First Timothy." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul's First Letter to Timothy,” or “The First Letter to Timothy.” (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])

=== Who wrote the Book of 1 Timothy? ===

This book is the first letter Paul wrote to his disciple and close friend Timothy, probably near the end of his life. Paul was also known as “Saul” when he was a Pharisee and a persecutor of the church before his conversion to faith in Christ. He was a scholar in the Jewish law, but he became a Christian and an apostle of Jesus Christ.

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====
=== What is discipleship? ===

The term [[:en:obe:kt:disciple|disciple]] refers to a person who spends time with a teacher, learning from that teacher's character and teaching. Discipleship is the process of making disciples (sometimes called mentoring outside of Scripture). This letter gives many instructions about how a leader disciples a less mature Christian. The goal of discipleship is to encourage other Christians to grown in likeness to Christ. It is common for Paul to those he disciples as spiritual "sons."

=== In what roles can people serve within the church? ===

There is some controversial teachings in the book of Timothy concerning whether a woman or divorced man can serve in positions of leadership within the church. It is important to avoid inputing one's theological perspective into the translation. Further research on these issues prior to translation may be necessary.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== What are the major issues in the text of the Book of 1 Timothy? ===

The following are the most significant textual issues in the Book of 1 Timothy:\\

  * "And together we agree" or "we confess" (3:16). Some older versions read, "without controversy"
  * "From such withdraw yourself" (6:5) The best ancient copies do not have this phrase at the end of the verse.

Translators are advised not to translate this last passage. However, if older Bible versions exist in their region that have it, it is not wrong to translate it. If it is translated, it should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that it is probably not original to the Book of 1 Timothy.
