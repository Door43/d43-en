\v 5 The truth is this, that there is one God, and there is only one person who can make us acceptable to him. Christ Jesus, the man, is this one person.
\v 6 Of his own free will he died in order set all people free. God made this happen at the time he chose. It shows that he wants to save everyone.
\v 7 To declare this truth, God made me a messenger and an apostle. I speak the truth; I am not lying. I teach the Gentiles the things that they should truly believe.
