===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 Keep in mind that God made Adam first, and afterwards he made Eve,
\v 14 and that it was not Adam whom  \add Satan\add* deceived. As a result of the woman being deceived, she sinned. She did what God had told her not to do.
\v 15 But even though she did that, now women will be saved \f + \ft Or:God will accept women \f* as they bear children if they continue to trust  \add God\add* and if they continue to love others, and if they continue to conduct their lives  \add more and more\add* acceptably to God\f + \ft Or: like God wants them to \f*, and if they continue to be modest.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 For Adam was formed first, then Eve after him.
\v 14 And it was not Adam that the snake deceived. It was the woman whom he completely deceived, so that she sinned.
\v 15 But God will keep women safe as they bear and raise children, if they continue to believe in God, love him, live in a way that pleases him, and are wise in how they think.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 For Adam was formed first, then Eve.
\v 14 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman became completely deceived in transgression.
\v 15 However, she will be saved through bearing children, if they continue in faith and love and sanctification with soundness of mind.
