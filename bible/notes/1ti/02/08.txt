<usfm>
\v 8 I desire that in every place  \add where believers worship\add*, the men who pray publicly \f + \ft metonymy \f* should be men who are not practicing sin. When they pray, they should not be angry  \add with anyone\add* and they should not doubt  \add that God will answer\add* their prayers \f + \ft Or: should not quarrel with anyone \f*.
\v 9  \add I would like that\add* the clothing that women wear be modest and sensible\f + \ft Or: proper and appropriate \f* \f + \ft doublet \f*. I want them to not fix their hair in fancy, Or: elaborate ways, nor wear gold  \add jewelry\add*, nor pearls, nor expensive clothing  \add in order that they may make themselves attractive\add*.
\v 10 Instead, they should be doing things that women who claim to\f + \ft Or: say that they \f* worship God should do; that is, they should be doing good deeds.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Therefore, I want men everywhere to pray and to lift up their hands to God in a way that he will accept. Believers should not pray to show anger or doubt about God.
\v 9  I also want the women to dress themselves carefully. They should control themselves so that they do not dress to show themselves off to others. Instead of braided hair, gold, pearls, or expensive clothing,
\v 10 women should dress themselves in what is right for women who do good works and who say that they honor God.

\v 8 Therefore, I want men in every place to pray and to lift up holy hands without wrath and doubts.
\v 9 Likewise, I want the women to dress themselves in proper clothing, with modesty and self-control, not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or expensive clothing,
\v 10 but with what is appropriate to women who profess godliness through good works.
