====== 1 Timothy 06:1-2 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 As for slaves \f + \ft doublet \f* \add who are believers, teach them that they\add* should consider that it is right for them to honor their masters in every way. If they do that, people will not speak against\f + \ft Or: evil about \f* God \f + \ft metonymy \f* and they will not speak against\f + \ft Or: evil about \f* that which  \add we apostles\add* teach, \add because they will see that the slaves are being respectful of their masters\add*.
\p
\v 2  \add Slaves\add* who have masters who believe  \add in Christ\add* must not be disrespectful to their masters just because their masters are fellow believers. Instead, they should serve  \add their masters\add* even better because  \add their masters\add* are fellow believers whom  \add God\add* loves and who benefit when  \add the slaves\add* serve them well.
\p
As you teach these things  \add to your congregation\add*, exhort\f + \ft Or: urge \f*  \add people\add* that they do them.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 As for slaves who are believers, they should honor their masters in every way, so that no one will insult God or what we teach.

\p
\v 2  Slaves who have believing masters should not respect them less, for they are brothers. Instead, they should serve their masters even better, because the masters whom they serve are their brothers whom they should love. Teach and announce these things to the believers.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\c 6
\p
\v 1 Let as many as are under the yoke as slaves regard their own masters as worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and the teaching might not be blasphemed.
\v 2 Those slaves who have believing masters should not disrespect them, because they are brothers. Instead, they should serve them all the more, since the masters who receive their service are believers and are loved. Teach and declare these things.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **under the yoke as slaves** - This can be translated as a metaphor that views a slave as an ox or other strong animal with a wooden bar placed over its shoulders so it can pull a plow. If including this metaphor is too difficult, you can omit it. It can also be translated as a metaphor for being a Christian (UDB). (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **be blasphemed**  - "those outside the church have bad things to say about God and the message about God"
  * **slaves who have believing masters should not disrespect them, because they are brothers**  - "because their believing masters are brothers, slaves who have believing masters should not disrespect their masters"
  * **they should serve them**  - "slaves with believing masters should serve those masters"
