\v 3 Some people teach things that are different from the correct things we have written, which is what our Lord Jesus Christ taught and which honors God.
\v 4 Such people are very proud and do not understand anything. Instead, they want to argue about unimportant matters and about certain words. As a result, people who listen to them envy others. They quarrel with others and with one another. They say bad things about others. They suspect that others have evil motives.
\v 5 Their whole way of thinking has become completely wrong because they have rejected true things. As a result, they make the mistake of thinking that by doing religious things they will get a lot of  money.

===== ULB: =====

\p
\v 3 If someone teaches differently and does not accept our healthy words, the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the godly teaching,
\v 4 he is proud and knows nothing. Instead, he is sick with arguments and with word fights, from which come envy, strife, insults, evil suspicions, and 
\v 5 the contentions of people with decayed minds. They turn away from truth and think that godliness is a way to gain.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **If someone teaches**  - "Anyone who teaches" or "Those who teach." Paul assumes that people are in fact teaching **differently**; this is not a hypothetical case. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **someone … he … he**  - The UDB uses the plural "some people … such people … they" to say that the "someone" who "teaches" could be male or female, one person or many people. Use the form in your language that allows for this range of meaning.
  * **he is sick with arguments**  - "all he wants to do is argue" or "they crave arguments." Such people greatly desire the act of arguing itself, and do not really want to find a way to agree.
  * **word fights**  - "arguments over what words mean" or "words that cause fights" or "words meant to hurt others"
  * **envy**  - "the desire to have what others have"
  * **strife**  - "arguments between believers"
  * **insults**  - "people falsely saying bad things about each other"
  * **evil suspicions**  - Saying that anyone who disagrees with them is trying to do evil.
  * **contentions**  - "quarrels that last a long time"
  * **decayed minds**  - "minds that have been destroyed by bad thoughts"
