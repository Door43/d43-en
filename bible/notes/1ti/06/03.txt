===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 If anyone teaches false doctrines that do not agree with the reliable and true teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ,
\v 4 that person is very proud and does not understand anything. They want to argue about unimportant matters and about certain words, and people who listen to them envy others. They quarrel with others and with one another. They say bad things about others. They suspect that others have evil motives.
\v 5 Their whole way of thinking has become completely wrong because they have rejected true things. As a result, they make the mistake of thinking that by doing religious things they will get a lot of money.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 3 If anyone teaches something that does not agree with the reliable instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ and to godly teaching,
\v 4 he is proud and understands nothing. He has an unhealthy interest in controversies and arguments about words that result in envy, strife, insults, evil suspicions, 
\v 5 and constant conflict between people with depraved minds. They have lost the truth and they think that godliness is a way to get more money.
\f + \ft Some old copies add, \fqa Withdraw from such things, \fqa* but the best ancient copies do not. \f*
