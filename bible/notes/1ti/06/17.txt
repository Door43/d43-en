\v 17 Tell  \add the believers\add* who are rich here in this present world that they should not be proud, and that they should not trust in their many  \add possessions\add*, because they cannot be certain  \add how long they will have them\add*. Teach them that they should not\add trust in their wealth. Instead, they should trust\add* in God. He is the one who abundantly gives us everything we have in order that we may enjoy it.
\v 18 Also, tell them that their good deeds must be as plentiful  \add as their money\add*. Specifically, they should share very generously with others  \add what they have\add*.
\v 19 If they do that, \add Jesus will give them a great reward. It will be as though\add* they are storing up  \add in heaven\add* much treasure for themselves that will be a good  \add basis on which they may rely\add* for\f + \ft Or: result in their \f* receiving a great reward in the future \f + \ft Or: which will be  \add as\add* solid\add as\add* the foundation \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add of a house\add* \f*. By doing this they will have the life that is the real life.

\v 18 Also, tell them to do good things. These are true wealth. Indeed, they should share with others very much of what they have.
\v 19 If they do that, it will be as though they were storing up for themselves many things that God will give them. When they do this, they will have the life that is the real life.

\v 17 Tell the rich in this world not to be proud, and not to hope in riches, which are uncertain. Instead, they should hope in God. He offers to us all the true riches to enjoy.
\v 18 Tell them to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous, and willing to share.
\v 19 In that way, they will store up for themselves a good foundation for what is to come, so that they will take hold of real life.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Tell the rich** - Here "rich" is a nominal adjective. It can be stated as an adjective. AT: "Tell those who are rich" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]])
  * **in riches, which are uncertain** - "in the many things that they own that they may lose." The reference here is to physical objects.
  * **all the true riches** - "all the things that will make us truly happy." The reference here may include physical objects, but it more likely refers to states like love, joy, and peace that people try to obtain by means of physical objects.
  * **be rich in good works** - Paul speaks of spiritual blessings as if they were earthly wealth. AT: "serve and help others in many ways" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **they will store up for themselves a good foundation for what is to come** - Here Paul speaks about God's blessings that he gives in heaven as if they are riches that a person is storing away for later use. AT: "they will have a large amount of blessings from Christ when he returns" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **take hold of real life** - This recalls the sports metaphor of [[:en:bible:notes:1ti:06:11|6:12]], where the prize is something that the winner can actually hold in his hands. Here the "prize" is "real" life. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
