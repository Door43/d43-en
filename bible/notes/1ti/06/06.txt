<usfm>
\v 6  Well, we truly do gain great benefit when we behave in a way that honors God and when we are content with what we have.
\v 7 Indeed, we brought nothing into the world when we were born, and we cannot take anything out of it when we die.
\v 8 So if we have food and clothing, we should be satisfied with these.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 But godliness with contentment is great gain.
\v 7 For we have brought nothing into the world, and neither are we able to take out anything.
\v 8 Instead, let us be satisfied with food and clothing.
