\v 9 But some people strongly desire to be rich. As a result, they do wrong things to get money, and this will cause them to be caught as animals get caught in traps. They foolishly desire many things, and so they get hurt. God will completely destroy them!
\v 10 People do all sorts of evil things when they want to have a lot of money. Because some people longed for money, they have stopped believing the truth that all of us believe and they have caused themselves to be very sorrowful.

<usfm>
\v 9 Now those who want to become wealthy fall into temptation, into a trap, into many foolish and harmful passions, and into whatever else makes people sink into ruin and destruction.
\v 10 For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people who desire it have wandered away from the faith and have impaled themselves with much grief.
