\v 9 But some people strongly desire to be rich. As a result, they do wrong things to get money, and this will cause them to be caught as animals get caught in traps. They foolishly desire many things, and so they get hurt. God will completely destroy them!
\v 10 People do all sorts of evil things when they want to have a lot of money. Because some people longed for money, they have stopped believing the truth that all of us believe and they have caused themselves to be very sorrowful.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 Now those who want to become wealthy fall into temptation, into a trap. They fall into many foolish and harmful passions, and into whatever else makes people sink into ruin and destruction.
\v 10 For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people who desire it have been mislead away from the faith and have pierced themselves with much grief.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Now** - This word marks a break in the teaching. Here Paul returns to the topic about those who think being godly will make them wealthy (See: [[:en:bible:notes:1ti:06:03|6:5]]). 
  * **to become wealthy fall into temptation, into a trap** - Paul speaks about those who let the temptation of money cause them to sin as if they are animals that have fallen into a hole that a hunter has used as a trap. AT: "to become wealthy will encounter more temptation than they can resist, and they will be like an animal in a trap (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **They fall into many foolish and harmful passions** - This continues the trap metaphor. This means that their foolish and harmful passion will overcome them. AT: "And as an animal falls into a hunter's trap, they will fall into many foolish and harmful passions" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and into whatever else makes people sink into ruin and destruction** - Paul speaks about those that let sin destroy them as if they are a boat that sinks under the water. AT: "and into other kinds of evil that ruin and destroy a person like a boat sinking under the water" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil** - Paul speaks of the cause of evil as if it were a plant root. AT: "because loving money is a cause of all kinds of evil"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **who desire it** - "who desire money"
  * **have been mislead away from the faith** - Paul speaks of wrong desires as if they were evil guides who intentionally guide people down the wrong path. This can be stated in active form. AT: "have let their desires lead them away from the truth" or "have stopped believing the truth"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **have pierced themselves with much grief** - Paul speaks about grief as if it were a sword that a person uses to stab themselves. AT: "have caused themselves to be very sorrowful" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
