===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 You should rely on what I tell you here: If someone desires very much to oversee believers, he wants to do something really excellent.
\v 2 For that reason, however, an overseer  must be someone whom no one accuses of anything bad. He must have only one wife. He must not do anything to excess; he must think in wise ways. He must behave well, and he must welcome strangers. He should be able to teach others.
\v 3 He must not be an alcoholic and not quick to fight. Instead, he must be patient and peaceful with others. And he should not be greedy for money.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\c 3
\p
\v 1 This saying is trustworthy: If someone desires to be an overseer, he desires a good work.
\v 2 Therefore the overseer must be without reproach, a husband of one wife, moderate, sensible, orderly, hospitable, able to teach,
\v 3 not addicted to wine, not a brawler, but instead, gentle, peaceful , not a lover of money.
