<usfm>
\v 8 Deacons, in the same way, should be people whom others respect. They should be sincere when they speak. They should not drink too much wine, and  they must not be greedy for money.
\v 9 They should believe in the true things that God has told us, and at the same time know what is right, and then do it.
\v 10 Find these qualities in them first, and then choose them to serve because no one can find anything wrong with them.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Deacons, likewise, should be dignified, not double-talkers, not drinking too much wine, and not greedy.
\v 9 They should keep the revealed truth of the faith with a clean conscience.
\v 10 They should also be approved first, then they should serve because they are above reproach.
