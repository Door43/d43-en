===== translationNotes: =====

  * **It is undeniable** - "No one can deny"
  * **that the revealed truth of godliness is great** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "that the truth which God revealed is great" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **He appeared ... up in glory** - This is most likely a song or poem that Paul is quoting. If your language has a way of indicating that this is poetry you could use it here. If not, you could translate this as regular prose rather than poetry. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]])
  * **He appeared** - Here "He" is ambiguous. It could refers to "God" or to "Christ." It may be best to translate this as "He." If you must be more specific you could translate it as "Christ who is God" or "Christ." 
  * **in the flesh** - Paul uses "flesh" here to mean a human being. AT: "as a true human being" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
