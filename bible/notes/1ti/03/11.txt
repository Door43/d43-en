===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Women in the same way **- Here "women" may apply to women in general, but it seems to apply specifically to deacons' wives or female deacons. AT: "Wives likewise have requirements" or "Deaconesses, there are requirements like deacons"
  * **be dignified **- "act properly"
  * **not slanderers **- "they must not speak evil about other people"
  * **moderate **- "they must not do anything to excess"
  * **husbands of one wife **- A man must have only one wife. It is unclear if this excludes men who have been previously widowed, divorced, or never married.
  * **manage well their children and home**  - "properly take care of and lead their children and others who live in their houses"
  * **For those **- "For those deacons" or "For those bishops, deacons, and deaconesses" or "For these church leaders"
  * **acquire for themselves **- "receive for themselves" or "gain for themselves"
  * **a sure basis**  - Possible meanings are 1) a reputation within the church or 2) a standing before God or 3) a promotion in rank in the church, for example, the standing of a bishop.
  * **acquire … much boldness in faith **- "gain … great courage to speak about their faith" or "become confident that what they believe is true" or "become confident before men and God because they know what they believe is true" or "acquire … great courage to speak about what they believe in"
