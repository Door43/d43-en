===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Women in the same way **- "Wives, likewise have requirements" or "deaconesses, there are requirements like deacons." The general term **women**  may apply to women in general, but it seems to apply to deacons' wives or female deacons here because the preceding and following verses clearly speak about deacons.
  * **be dignified **- "act properly"
  * **not slanderers **- "they must not speak evil about other people"
  * **moderate **- "they must not do anything to excess"
  * **husbands of one wife **- This phrase means "one-woman men." It can be translated as "each man having one wife only." This is debated whether this excludes men who have been widowed or divorced or single men.
  * **manage well their children and home**  - "properly take care of and lead their children and others who live in their houses"
  * **For those **- "For those deacons" or "For those bishops, deacons, and deaconesses" or "For these church leaders"
  * **acquire for themselves **- "receive for themselves" or "gain for themselves"
  * **a sure basis**  - Possible meanings are 1) a reputation within the Church or 2) a standing before God or 3) a promotion in rank in the Church, e.g., to the standing of bishop.
  * **acquire … much boldness in faith**- "gain … great courage to speak about their faith" or "become confident that what they believe is true" or "become confident before men and God because they know what they believe is true" or "acquire … great courage to speak about what they believe in"
