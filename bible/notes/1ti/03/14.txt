\v 14 As I write to you these things, I hope to come to you soon.
\v 15 But if I do not come soon, I am writing to you now so that you may know how to act in the family of God, which is the group of those who believe in God, who gives life to all things. It is these who teach the truth and witness that it is true.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul tells Timothy the reason he wrote to him and then describes Christ's godliness.

  * **and I hope to come to you soon** - "although I hope to visit you very soon"
  * **But if I delay** - "But in case I cannot go there soon" or "But if something prevents me for being there soon"
  * **in the household of God** - Paul speaks of the group of believers as if they were a family. AT: "as members of God's family" or "among the people of God." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **which is the church** - This phrase gives us information about "the household of God" rather than making a distinction between a household of God which is the church and one that is not the church. This can be stated as a new sentence. AT: "Those who belong to the family of God are the community who believes in the living God." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_distinguish]])
  * **the living God** - Here this expression may be speaking of God as the one who gives life to all, as in the UDB.
  * **pillar and support of the truth** - Paul speaks of the believers bearing witness to the truth about Christ as if they were a pillar and a base supporting a building. This can be stated as a new sentence. AT: "And, by keeping and teaching God's truth, these members of the church support the truth just as a pillar and base support a building." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
