\v 14 As I write to you these things, I hope to come to you soon.
\v 15 But if I do not come soon, I am writing to you now so that you may know how to lead the family of God, which is the group of believers in the living God. It is the group of believers that teaches the truth and witnesses that it is true.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I write to you these things **- "I write these instructions to you"
  * **and I hope to come to you soon **- "although I hope to come to you very soon"
  * **but if I delay **- "but in case I cannot make it there soon" or "but if something prevents me for being there soon"
  * **I write so that **- "I write for the purpose that"
  * **the house of God ... must be guided**  - "how you must guide the family of God"
  * **pillar and support of the truth**  - The metaphor is of a large, strong platform on which God displays the truth. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) The platform in turn is expressed as a synecdoche of its parts, the base and the upright. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
