====== 1 Timothy 03:4-5 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 He must lead and care for his own household\f + \ft Or: family \f* well. For example, he must be a man whom his children obey and completely respect,
\v 5 because if anyone does not know how he should lead well and care for well the people who live in his own house, he certainly cannot care for God's congregation!\f + \ft Or: how can he care for God's congregation? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 He should control the people in his own home well. His children should obey him with respect.
\v 5 I say this because if a man does not even know how to control the people in his own house, how can he care for a group of God's people?
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 He should manage his own household well, and his children should obey him with all respect;
\v 5 for if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for a church of God?
</usfm>
