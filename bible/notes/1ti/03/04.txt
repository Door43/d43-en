<usfm>
\v 4 He must lead and care for his own household\f + \ft Or: family \f* well. For example, he must be a man whom his children obey and completely respect,

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 He should control the people in his own home well. His children should obey him with respect.
\v 5 I say this because if a man does not even know how to control the people in his own house, how can he care for a group of God's people?
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====
