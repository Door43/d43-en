  * **and fall into condemnation like the devil **- "become proud like the devil did and because of that be condemned as the devil was"
  * **He must also have a good reputation with those outside**  - "It is necessary also that those who do not believe in Jesus think well of him" or "Those outside of the church must also think well of him" (UDB)
  * **fall into disgrace**  - "bring shame upon himself" or "give anyone reason to disapprove of him"
  * **fall into … the trap of the devil**  - "allow the devil to trap him." Satan setting a trap or snare is a metaphor for Satan tricking a believer into unknowingly committing sin. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
