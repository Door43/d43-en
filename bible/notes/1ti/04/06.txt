\v 6 When you teach these things to your fellow believers, you will be showing that you, \add whom\add* Christ Jesus \add appointed\add*, serve them well. You will have become strong \add spiritually\add* by holding fast\f + \ft Or: by obeying \f* the true message that \add we all\add* believe.
\v 7 You must completely reject godless, silly\f + \ft Or: foolish \f* stories \add from your ancestors that old people tell\add*. Keep training yourself so that you have more godly behavior\f + \ft Or: behavior that pleases God \f*.
\v 8 \add Some people say\add*, "It helps us in some ways if we exercise our bodies." But \add I say that\add* people benefit very much if they live in a godly way\f + \ft Or: in a way that pleases God \f*, because \add if people live in a godly way, that\add* will benefit them both while they live now and when they live in the future life \add in heaven\add*.

\v 6 If you keep speaking this truth to the brothers and sisters, you will be a good servant of Jesus Christ. You will serve him well, because the message that we believe is strengthening you, as the good things God has taught you and that you have followed.
\v 7 But do not listen to the things that mean nothing and to the stories that only old women tell. Instead, train yourself to honor God.
\v 8 Physical exercise helps only a little, but if you honor God, this will help you with everything as you live now on earth and as you live in the future with God.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 6 If you place these things before the brothers, you will be a good servant of Jesus Christ. For you are being nourished by the words of faith and by the good teaching that you have followed.
\v 7 But reject worldly stories loved by old women. Instead, train yourself in godliness.
\v 8 For bodily training is a little useful, but godliness is useful for all things. It holds promise for this life now and the life to come.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **If you place these things before the brothers** - Here "to place before" is an idiom that means to instruct or to remind. AT: "If you help the believers remember these things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **these things** - This refers to the teaching that started in [[:en:bible:notes:1ti:03:16|3:16]].
  * **the brothers** - This refers to all believers whether male or female. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_gendernotations]])
  * **you are being nourished by the words of faith and by the good teaching that you have followed** - Paul speaks of God's word and its teaching as if it could physically feed Timothy and make him strong. This can be stated in active form. AT: "the words of faith and the good teaching that you have followed are causing you to trust more strongly in Christ" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **words of faith** - "words that cause people to believe"
  * **worldly stories loved by old women** - "profane stories and old wives' tales." The word for "stories" is the same as for "myths" in [[:en:bible:notes:1ti:01:03|1:4]], so you should translate it the same here.
  * **loved by old women** - This is probably an expression that means "silly" or "absurd." Paul is not purposely insulting women in his reference to "old women." Instead, he and his audience knew that men die younger than women, so there are more women than men whose minds have become feeble due to old age. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **train yourself in godliness** - "train yourself to honor God" or "train yourself to act in ways that please God"
  * **bodily training** - "physical exercise"
  * **holds promise for this life** - "is beneficial to this life" or "helps to make this life better"
