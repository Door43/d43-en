===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 When you teach these things to your fellow believers, you will be showing that you, \add whom\add* Christ Jesus \add appointed\add*, serve them well. You will have become strong \add spiritually\add* by holding fast\f + \ft Or: by obeying \f* the true message that \add we all\add* believe.
\v 7 You must completely reject godless, silly\f + \ft Or: foolish \f* stories \add from your ancestors that old people tell\add*. Keep training yourself so that you have more godly behavior\f + \ft Or: behavior that pleases God \f*.
\v 8 \add Some people say\add*, "It helps us in some ways if we exercise our bodies." But \add I say that\add* people benefit very much if they live in a godly way\f + \ft Or: in a way that pleases God \f*, because \add if people live in a godly way, that\add* will benefit them both while they live now and when they live in the future life \add in heaven\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 If you keep speaking this truth to the brothers and sisters, you will be a good servant of Jesus Christ. You will serve him well, because the message that we believe is training you, as the good things God has taught you and that you have followed are also training you.
\v 7 But do not listen to the things that mean nothing and to the stories that only old women tell. Instead, train yourself to honor God.
\v 8 Physical exercise helps only a little, but if you honor God, this will help you with everything as you live now on earth and as you live in the future with God.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 6 If you place these things before the brothers, you will be a good servant of Jesus Christ because you are being nourished by the words of faith and by the good teaching that you have followed.
\v 7 But do not accept profane stories loved by old women, but train yourself in godliness.
\v 8 For bodily training is only a little useful, but godliness is useful for all things and holds promise for this life now and the life to come.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **place these things before**  - "put these thoughts into the believers' minds" or "help the believers remember these words." The "thoughts" and "words" refer to all the teachings from [[:en:bible:notes:1ti:03:16|3:16]] to [[:en:bible:notes:1ti:04:03|4:5]].
  * **nourished**  - "trained" (UDB). God was making Timothy stronger and teaching him to do what pleases God.
  * **words of faith**  - "words that cause people to believe"
  * **profane stories loved by old women**  - "profane and old-womanish myths." The word for **stories**  is the same as for "myths" in [[:en:bible:notes:1ti:01:03|1:4]], so you should translate it the same here. The reference to **old women**  is probably a metaphor for "silly" or "absurd." Paul is not purposely insulting women in his reference to "old women." Instead, he and his audience knew that men die younger than women, so there are more women than men whose minds have become feeble due to old age. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **train yourself in godliness**  - "train yourself to be more godly" or "train yourself to act in ways that please God" or "work hard to become more godly"
  * **body training**  - "physical exercise"
  * **holds promise for this life**  - "is beneficial to this life" or "helps to make this life better"
