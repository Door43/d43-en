===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 What I have just written is something that you can rely on. It is worth believing completely.
\v 10 For this reason we work very hard, as hard as we can, because our hope is in God who lives, the savior of all humanity, but especially the savior of those who believe.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 This message is trustworthy and worthy of full acceptance.
\v 10 For it is for this that we struggle and work very hard. For we have hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all people, but especially of believers.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **worthy of full acceptance** - "worthy of your complete belief" or "worthy of your full trust"
  * **For it is for this** - "This is the reason"
  * **struggle and work very hard** - The words "struggle" and "work very hard" mean basically the same thing. Paul uses them together to emphasize the intensity with which they serve God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **we have confidence in the living God** - Here "living God" probably means, "God, who makes all things live."
  * **but especially of believers** - The understood information can be stated clearly. AT: "but he is especially the Savior of those people who believe" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
