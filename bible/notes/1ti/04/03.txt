====== 1 Timothy 04:3-5 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 \add For example\add*, they forbid that \add believers\add* marry \add because they say that it makes us unacceptable to God\add*. They also \add command\add* that people abstain from \add eating certain\add* foods. But God created such foods in order that we can eat them! We who believe \add in Christ\add* know the true \add teaching\add*, and we thank \add God for the food that he gives us. That is why we\add* can eat it.
\v 4 \add We can eat all kinds of food\add* because God has created all \add food\add*, and it is all good. We should not refuse to eat certain kinds of food if we thank \add God for it\add* when we eat it.
\v 5 It is acceptable \add to God\add* because God \add long ago\add* said \add that all things that he made are good\add*, and because we pray that God will bless it.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 They will try to stop believers from marrying. They will tell them not to eat certain things, even though God has created them, so that believers who have come to know the truth can share them with each other while thanking God for them.
\v 4 I say this because everything that God has made is good. We reject nothing that we receive from God while thanking him for it.
\v 5 For by praying to God and by believing his Word we set it apart for him.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 They will forbid to marry and to receive foods that God created for sharing with thanksgiving among believers who came to know the truth.
\v 4 For everything created by God is good, and nothing that we take with thanksgiving is rejected,
\v 5 since it is consecrated through the word of God and prayer.
