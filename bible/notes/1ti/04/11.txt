\v 11 Declare and teach these things to the believers.

\v 12 Do not allow anyone to say that you are too young to be important. Instead, show other believers how to live. Show them this by how you speak, by how you live, by how you love, by how you trust God, and by how you keep from committing evil deeds.
\v 13 Until I come to you, see to it that you read God's Word to the believers in public, and that you explain God's Word and teach the believers.
