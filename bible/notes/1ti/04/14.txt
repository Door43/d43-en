===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **laying on of the hands of the elders**  - This was a ceremony in which the church leaders literally put their hands on Timothy and prayed that God would enable him to do the work he had commanded him to do.
  * **you will save yourself and those who listen to you**  - "you will keep yourself and those who listen to you from believing false messages and from doing wrong actions." People who believe false messages and do wrong actions can expect to suffer as a result. Paul does not want Timothy and his friends to suffer for believing and doing wrong things.
  * **Do not neglect the gift that is in you** - "Use the gift God gave you"
  * **through prophecy**  - "when leaders of the church spoke God's Word"
  * **Care for these things, be in them** - "Do all these things and live according to them"
  * **so that your progress may appear to all people **  - "so other people will see your growth" or "so other people will see your improvement in doing them"
  * **Give careful attention to yourself**  - "Conduct yourself carefully" or "Control your own behavior"
  * **Continue in these things**  - "Continue to do these things"
