  * **leave the faith**  - "stop believing in Jesus" or "depart from what they believe in"
  * **in later times**  - Possible meanings are 1) times later than Paul's time, "in times to come" or "in the future" or 2) Paul's own time, "during this period of time before the end."
  * **and pay attention**  - "by giving attention" or "because they are paying attention" or "while listening" or "these are those who pay attention"
  * **deceitful spirits and the teachings of demons**  - "spirits who trick people and the things that demons teach"
  * **through lying hypocrisy**  - "taught by hypocrites who tell lies"
  * **their own consciences branded**  - The metaphor is of masters pressing hot metal against the skin of slaves or animals to make scars that show ownership. Possible meanings are 1) the branding is a mark of identification, "They do this even though they can see that they are hypocrites," or 2) their consciences are numb, "as if they had pressed hot metal against their consciences to make them numb."
