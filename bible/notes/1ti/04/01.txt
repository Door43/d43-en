\v 1 Now the Spirit clearly says that in later times, some people will stop believing the truth about Christ and pay attention to spirits who deceive believers and demons who teach false things.
\v 2 These people will say one thing but do any evil thing they wish, as if a hot iron had burned and ruined their minds.
