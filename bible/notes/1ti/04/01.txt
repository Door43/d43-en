===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul tells Timothy what the Spirit says will happen and encourages him in what he should teach.

  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in the main teaching. Here Paul starts to tell a new part of the teaching.
  * **in later times** - Possible meanings are 1) this is a time later than Paul's time. AT: "in times to come" or "in the future" or 2) this is Paul's own time. AT: "during this period of time before the end."
  * **leave the faith** - This is an idiom. AT: "stop trusting in Jesus." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **and pay attention** - "and give attention" or "because they are paying attention"
  * **deceitful spirits and the teachings of demons** - "spirits who trick people and the things that demons teach"
  * **in lying hypocrisy** - This can be stated as a new sentence. AT: "These people will be hypocrites and speak lies."
  * **Their own consciences will be branded** - Possible meanings are 1) Paul is speaking of people who can no longer tell that they are doing wrong as if their minds are ruined like skin that someone has burnt with a hot iron. Or, 2) Paul is speaking of these people as if Satan had put a mark on these people with a hot iron to indicate that they belong to him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
