====== 1 Timothy 01:18-20 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 Timothy, you \add are like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a son \add to me\add*. So, based on\f + \ft Or: in accordance with \f* what \add someone\add* previously prophesied\f + \ft Or: told what God revealed to them \f* about you, I am instructing you \add to strongly oppose those who teach false doctrines, Or: teachings. You should oppose them like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a soldier fights strongly against\f + \ft Or: opposes \f* \add those who attack his countrymen\add*.
\v 19 Continue to believe \add the true teaching\add* and do only what you know to be right! Remember that some people have pushed aside\f + \ft Or: rejected \f* the true teaching. As a result, they no longer believe \f + \ft metaphor \f* what is true.
\v 20 Among the ones who have done that are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I put in the hands of Satan, in order that \add when Satan punishes them\add* they may learn not to teach wrong teaching.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 Timothy, my child, I command you: remember what certain believers prophesied about you. Do this in order to follow those things as you work hard for the Lord.
\v 19 Trust God and keep a good conscience.  Some people have not paid attention to their own consciences. So what has happened to their faith is a disaster.
\v 20 Hymenaeus and Alexander are two men like this. I have handed them over to Satan for him to attack them, so that they may learn not to insult God.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 18 I set this command before you, Timothy, my child, and I agree with the prophecies that went forth about you, so that you might engage in the good fight;
\v 19 so that you may have faith and a good conscience. Some people have rejected these and have been shipwrecked in respect to the faith.
\v 20 Such are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I gave over to Satan so that they may be taught not to blaspheme.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I set this command before you **- "This command I give to you"" or "This command I entrust to you"
  * **child**  - This is a more general word than //son//  or //daughter//, but it still denotes kinship with the father. Paul uses this as a metaphor for his love for Timothy. (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
  * **engage in the good fight**  - "participate in a struggle that is worth the effort" or "work hard to defeat enemies." This is a metaphor that means "work hard for the Lord" (UDB). (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
  * **have been shipwrecked in respect to the faith**  - Paul uses another metaphor to compare the condition of their faith to a ship that has been wrecked on the rocks. The metaphor means "what has happened to their faith is a disaster" (UDB). You should use this or a similar metaphor if it will be understood in your language. 
  * **they may be taught**  - "that God may teach them"
