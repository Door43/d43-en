====== 1 Timothy 01:18-20 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 Timothy, you \add are like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a son \add to me\add*. So, based on\f + \ft Or: in accordance with \f* what \add someone\add* previously prophesied\f + \ft Or: told what God revealed to them \f* about you, I am instructing you \add to strongly oppose those who teach false doctrines, Or: teachings. You should oppose them like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a soldier fights strongly against\f + \ft Or: opposes \f* \add those who attack his countrymen\add*.
\v 19 Continue to believe \add the true teaching\add* and do only what you know to be right! Remember that some people have pushed aside\f + \ft Or: rejected \f* the true teaching. As a result, they no longer believe \f + \ft metaphor \f* what is true.
\v 20 Among the ones who have done that are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I put in the hands of Satan, in order that \add when Satan punishes them\add* they may learn not to teach wrong teaching.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 Timothy, my child, I command you: Remember what certain believers prophesied about you. Do this in order to follow those things as you work hard for the Lord.
\v 19 Trust God and keep a good conscience. Some people have not paid attention to their own consciences. So what has happened to their faith is a disaster.
\v 20 Hymenaeus and Alexander are two men like this. I have handed them over to Satan for him to attack them, so that they may learn not to insult God.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 18 I am placing this command before you, Timothy, my child, in accordance with the prophecies previously made about you, that you might fight the good fight,
\v 19 holding faith and a good conscience. By rejecting this, some have shipwrecked their faith.
\v 20 Such are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I gave over to Satan so that they may be taught not to blaspheme.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I am placing this command before you** - Paul speaks of his instructions as if he could physically put them in front of Timothy. AT: "I am entrusting you with this command" or "This is what I am commanding you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **my child** - Paul speaks of his close relationship to Timothy as though Paul is the father and Timothy is the child. Paul thinks of Timothy as a his child because Paul taught Timothy to have faith in Jesus. AT: "who is truly like my child" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in accordance with the prophecies previously made about you** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "in agreement with what other believers prophesied about you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **fight the good fight** - Paul speaks about Timothy working for the Lord as if he were a soldier fighting a battle. AT: "continue to work hard for the Lord" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a good conscience** - "a conscience that chooses right instead wrong." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:1ti:01:05|1:5]].
  * **have been shipwrecked in respect to the faith** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "they have shipwrecked their faith" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **some have shipwrecked their faith** - Paul speaks of these people's faith as if it were a ship that could be wrecked at sea. He means that they have ruined their faith and no longer believe in Jesus. You should use this or a similar metaphor if it will be understood in the project language. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Hymenaeus and Alexander** - These are names of men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **whom I gave over to Satan** - Paul speaks as if he physically handed these men to Satan. This probably means that Paul rejected them from the community of believers. Since they are no longer a part of the community, Satan can have power of them and harm them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **they may be taught** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "that God may teach them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
