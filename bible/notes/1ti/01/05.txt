<usfm>
\v 5 \add Teach them\add* to have pure desires \f + \ft metonymy \f* and \add thus to know within themselves that God\add* approves of what they do, and to sincerely believe \add the true teaching\add*. By doing that, \add they will\add* love \add God well\add*.
\v 6 There are some people who have turned away from these true teachings. As a result, they \add just\add* discuss what is useless.
\v 7 They desire to teach the laws \add that God gave to Moses\add*, but they do not understand what they are really saying nor the things about which they confidently speak\f + \ft Or: say that they understand well \f*.
\p
\v 8 We know that the laws \add that God gave to Moses are\add* good if people consider correctly \add what God intended them for\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Instead, the purpose of what we command you to teach is to love God from a pure heart, from a good conscience, and from faith that is sincere.
\v 6 Some men have stopped trying to do these good things; instead, they are now saying useless things.
\v 7 They want to teach about the law, but they do not understand it. Yet they insist that what they teach is true.
\p
\v 8 But we know that law is good if we know how to use it according to what the law says.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Now the goal of the commandment is love from a pure heart, from a good conscience, and from a sincere faith.
\v 6 Some people have missed the mark and have turned away from these things to foolish talk.
\v 7 They want to be teachers of the law, but they do not understand what they say or what they insist on.
\v 8 But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully.

  * **sincere** - "honest" or "true" or "without hypocrisy"
  * **Some people have missed the mark and have turned away from these things** - Paul speaks of faith in Christ as if it were a target to aim at. He also speaks of people disobeying his instructions as if they were in physical motion. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **law** - This refers to the Law of Moses.
  * **but they do not understand** - "even though they do not understand" or "and yet they do not understand"
