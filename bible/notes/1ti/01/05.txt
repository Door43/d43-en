\v 5 \add Teach them\add* to have pure desires \f + \ft metonymy \f* and \add thus to know within themselves that God\add* approves of what they do, and to sincerely believe \add the true teaching\add*. By doing that, \add they will\add* love \add God well\add*.
\v 6 There are some people who have turned away from these true teachings. As a result, they \add just\add* discuss what is useless.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Instead, the goal of what we command you to teach is to love God from a pure heart, from a good conscience, and from faith that is sincere.
\v 6 Some men have stopped trying to do these good things; instead, they are now saying useless things.
\v 7 They want to teach about the law, but they do not understand it. Yet they insist that what they teach is true.
\p
\v 8 But we know that law is good if we know how to use it according to what the law says.

\v 7 They want to be teachers of the law, but they do not understand what they say or what they insist on.

  * **the goal of the commandment**  - "the aim of the instruction" or "what we apostles are telling you to do"

  * **love**  - Possible meanings are 1) love for God (UDB) or 2) love for one's neighbor.
  * **from a pure heart**  - "desiring to have no sin in anything you do."
  * **good conscience **- "a conscience that has chosen right over wrong" or "a conscience that can choose right over wrong"
  * **sincere**  - "honest" or "true" or "without hypocrisy." This is the negative of the word for an actor on a stage: 
  * **law**  - The Law of Moses is meant.
  * **but they do not understand **- "even though they do not understand," or "and yet they do not understand."
