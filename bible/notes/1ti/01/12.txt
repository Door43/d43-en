\v 12 I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, because he gave me the strength to serve him. He also relies on me to serve him.
\v 13 In past times, I insulted and persecuted the believers. I did violent deeds, but God had mercy on me because I did not believe, and I did not know what I was doing.
\v 14 God was extremely kind to me, for he made me able to believe in Christ Jesus and love him because he united me to him.

\v 12 I thank Christ Jesus our Lord. He strengthened me, for he considered me faithful, and he placed me into service.

\v 13 I was a blasphemer, a persecutor, and a violent man. But I received mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief.
\v 14 But the grace of our Lord overflowed with faith and love that is in Christ Jesus.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul tells how he acted in the past and encourages Timothy to trust God.

  * **he considered me faithful** - "he considered me trustworthy" or "he regarded me as reliable"
  * **he placed me into service** - Paul speaks of the task of serving God as if it were a place that one could be placed in. AT: "he assigned me to serve him" or "he appointed me as his servant" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I was a blasphemer** - "I was a person who spoke evil against Christ." Paul is referring to his character before he was a Christian.
  * **a persecutor** - "a person who persecuted those who believed in Christ"
  * **violent man** - "a person was cruel towards other people." This is a person who believes he has the right to hurt others.
  * **But I received mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief** - "But because I did not believe in Jesus, and I did not know what I was doing, I received mercy from Jesus"
  * **I received mercy** - "Jesus showed me mercy" or "Jesus had mercy on me"
  * **But the grace** - "And the grace"
  * **the grace of our Lord overflowed** - Paul speaks of God's grace as if it were a liquid that could fill a container and spill out of the top when the container is full. AT: "God showed me much grace" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **with faith and love** - This is the result of God showing much grace to Paul. AT: "which caused me to trust in Jesus and love him"
  * **that is in Christ Jesus** - This speaks about Jesus as if he were a container that holds a liquid. Here "in Christ Jesus" refers to having a relationship with Jesus. AT: "that Christ Jesus enables me to give to God because I am united to him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
