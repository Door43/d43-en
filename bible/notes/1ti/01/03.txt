===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 \add I urge you now\add*, just like I urged you when I was going to Macedonia \add province\add*, that you remain there in Ephesus \add city\add*. Stay there so that you may command certain persons \add who teach other believers\add* that they not teach false \add doctrines\f + \ft Or: teachings \f*\add*.
\v 4 And tell people to not continually give their attention to stories \add that tell about our ancestors\add*, stories in which there are genealogies\f + \ft Or: lists of our ancestors' names \f* that \add seem to be\add* endless. \add You must command your congregation not to think that these stories are valuable\add*, because \add whenever people think\add* that, they \add just\add* start arguing about things uselessly, instead of \add teaching\add* God's plan, which \add is concerned with\add* what we believe \f + \ft Or: which \add we know because\add* we trust \add in Christ\add* \f*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 The reason that I urged you to remain in Ephesus while I travelled to Macedonia was so that you would command certain men not to teach what is different from what we teach.
\v 4 They should not give their time and attention to old useless stories and lists of ancestors that people never stop thinking about. These these things only cause people to argue with each other. They do not help them to know God's plan to save us, which we believe by faith.

\v 3 I urged you to wait in Ephesus while I travelled to Macedonia so that you would command certain men not to teach a different doctrine.
\v 4 They should not pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which cause arguments  rather than helping the plan of God, which is by faith.
