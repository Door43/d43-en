\v 12 Those people who teach false things—who are like animals that cannot think like us—they say bad things about God, whom they do not even know. So he will destroy them like we hunt down and destroy wild animals that even nature has no use for.
\v 13 The wrong things they do harm them themselves: They party and get drunk by day and night. They are like stains and spots on clothing that once was clean.
\v 14 They want to sleep with every woman whom they see. They can never sin enough. They persuade people who are not very faithful to God to join with them. As athletes train for sports, these people train themselves to be greedy. But God has cursed them!

\v 12 But these mindless animals are naturally made for capture and destruction. They do not know what they insult. They will be destroyed.
\v 13 They will receive the reward of their wrongdoing. They think that luxury during the day is a pleasure. They are stains and blemishes. They enjoy their deceitful actions while they are feasting with you.
\f + \ft Other versions read, \fqa They enjoy their actions while they are feasting with you in love feasts. \fqa* \f*
\v 14 They have eyes full of adulterous women; they are never satisfied with sin. They entice unstable souls into wrongdoing, and they have their hearts trained in covetousness. They are children of a curse!

  * **these mindless animals** - Just as animals cannot reason, these men cannot be reasoned with. AT: "these false teachers who are like mindless animals" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **They do not know what they insult** - They speak evil of what they do not know or understand.

  * **luxury during the day** - Here the word "luxury" refers to immoral activity that includes gluttony, drunkenness, and sexual activity. Doing these things during the day indicates that these people are not ashamed of this behavior.
  * **They are stains and blemishes** - The words "stains" and "blemishes" share similar meanings. Peter speaks of the false teachers as if they are stains on a garment that causes shame for those who wear it. AT: "They are like stains and blemishes on clothes, which causes disgrace" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **They have eyes full of adulterous women** - To have their "eyes full" means that they are obsessed with what they see. Possible meanings are 1) "They think of every woman whom they see as adulterous and want to sleep with her" or 2) "They are always looking for an adulterous woman to sleep with." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

  * **children of a curse** - The word "children" refers to those who have been cursed. AT: "they are people who are under God's curse" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
