\v 12 Those people who teach false things—who are like animals that cannot think like us—they say bad things about God, whom they do not even know. So he will destroy them like we hunt down and destroy wild animals that even nature has no use for.
\v 13 The wrong things they do harm them themselves: They party and get drunk by day and night. They are like stains and spots on clothing that once was clean.
\v 14 They want to sleep with every woman whom they see. They can never sin enough. They persuade people who are not very faithful to God to join with them. As athletes train for sports, these people train themselves to be greedy. But God has cursed them!

<usfm>
\v 12 But these unreasoning animals are naturally made for capture and destruction. They do not know what they insult. They will be destroyed.
\v 13 They will receive the reward of their wrongdoing. They think that luxury during the day is a pleasure. They are stains and blemishes. They enjoy their deceitful actions while they are feasting with you.
\f + \ft Other versions read, \fqa They enjoy their actions while they are feasting with you in love feasts. \fqa* \f*
\v 14 They have eyes full of adultery, they are never satisfied with sin. They entice unstable souls into wrongdoing, and they have their hearts trained in covetousness. They are cursed children!

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **these unreasoning animals are naturally made for capture and destruction.** - Just as animals cannot reason, these men cannot be reasoned with. AT: "these false teachers are like unreasoning animals who are made to be captured and destroyed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **They do not know what they insult** - They speak evil of what they do not know or understand.
  * **They will be destroyed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will destroy them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **They will receive the reward of their wrongdoing** - Peter speaks of the punishment that the false teachers will receive as if it were a reward. AT: "They will receive what they deserve for their wrongdoing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **luxury during the day** - Here the word "luxury" refers to immoral activity that includes gluttony, drunkenness, and sexual activity. Doing these things during the day indicates that these people are not ashamed of this behavior.
  * **They are stains and blemishes** - The words "stains" and "blemishes" share similar meanings. Peter speaks of the false teachers as if they were stains on a garment that cause shame for those who wear it. AT: "They are like stains and blemishes on clothes, which cause disgrace" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **They have eyes full of adultery** - Here the "eyes" represent their desires and "eyes full" means they constant want something. AT: "They constantly want to commit adultery" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **they are never satisfied with sin** - Although they sin in order to satisfy their lusts, the sin that they commit never satisfies.
  * **They entice unstable souls** - Here the word "souls" refers to persons. AT: "They entice unstable people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **hearts trained in covetousness** - Here the word "hearts" refers to the thoughts and emotions of the person. Because of their habitual actions, they have trained themselves to think and act out of covetousness. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
