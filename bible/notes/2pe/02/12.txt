===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 Those people who teach false things—who are like animals that cannot think like us—they say bad things about God, whom they do not even know. So he will destroy them like we hunt down and destroy wild animals that even nature has no use for.
\v 13 The wrong things they do harm them themselves: they party and get drunk by day and night. They are like stains and spots on clothing that once was clean.
\v 14 They want to sleep with every woman whom they see. They can never sin enough. They persuade people who are not very faithful to God to join with them. As athletes train for sports, these people train themselves to be greedy. But God has cursed them!

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 But these mindless animals are naturally made for capture and destruction. They do not know what they insult. They will be destroyed.
\v 13 They are harmed by the reward of their wrongdoing. They live in pleasure during the day. They are stains and blemishes. They enjoy their deceitful pleasures while they feast with you.
\v 14 They have eyes full of adulterous women; they are never satisfied with sin. They entice unstable souls into wrongdoing, and they have their hearts trained in covetousness, cursed children.
