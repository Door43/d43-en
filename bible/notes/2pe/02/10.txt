\v 10 \add He will punish especially severely\add* those \add ungodly teachers of false teachings\add* who do the things that their self-directed nature desires, things that defile them\f + \ft Or: cause them to be impure in every way \f*. Those \add teachers of false teachings\add* despise \add all beings who\add* rule \add over them\add*.


\p Because \add those teachers of false teachings are\add* extremely arrogant\f + \ft Or: proud \f* \f + \ft doublet \f*, they are not afraid to insult\f + \ft Or: boldly speak evil about \f* glorious beings \add in heaven\add* \f + \ft Or: glorious, Or: wonderful beings \add who rule over people\add* \f*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 He will punish especially severely those who do what they themselves want to do, things that make them displeasing to God. They boldly do whatever they wish to do; they even insult God's powerful angels.
\v 11 Unlike those people, God's angels insult no one in front of him, not even them!
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 This is especially true for those who continue in the corrupt desires of the flesh and despise authority. They are bold and self-willed. They are not afraid to blaspheme the glorious ones.
\v 11 Angels have greater strength and ability than all men, but they do not bring not insulting judgments against them to the Lord.
