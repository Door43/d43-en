====== 2 Peter 02:10-11 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 \add He will punish especially severely\add* those \add ungodly teachers of false teachings\add* who do the things that their self-directed nature desires, things that defile them\f + \ft Or: cause them to be impure in every way \f*. Those \add teachers of false teachings\add* despise \add all beings who\add* rule \add over them\add*.


\p Because \add those teachers of false teachings are\add* extremely arrogant\f + \ft Or: proud \f* \f + \ft doublet \f*, they are not afraid to insult\f + \ft Or: boldly speak evil about \f* glorious beings \add in heaven\add* \f + \ft Or: glorious, Or: wonderful beings \add who rule over people\add* \f*.
\v 11 In contrast, angels do not insult \add those teachers\add* when those teachers accuse the angels while the Lord God is watching, even though the angels are much more powerful \f + \ft doublet \f* \add than the teachers of false teaching\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 He will punish especially severely those who do what they themselves want to do, things that make them displeasing to God. They boldly do whatever they wish to do; they even insult God's powerful angels.
\v 11 But God's angels, even though they are much more powerful than those people, do not insult anyone in front of God, not even them!
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 This is especially true for those who continue in the corrupt desires of the flesh and despise authority. They are bold and self-willed. They are not afraid to blaspheme the glorious ones.
\v 11 Angels have greater strength and power, but they do not bring insulting judgments against them to the Lord.
</usfm>

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Peter begins describing the characteristics of unrighteous men.

  * **This is especially true** - The word "this" refers to God keeping unrighteous men in prison until judgment day in [[:en:bible:notes:2pe:02:07|2:09]].
  * **those who continue in the corrupt desires of the flesh** - Here the phrase "desires of the flesh" refers to the desires of the sinful nature. AT: "those who continue to indulge their corrupt, sinful desires"
  * **despise authority** - "refuse to submit to God's authority." Here the word "authority" probably refers to God's authority.
  * **self-willed** - "do whatever they want to do"
  * **the glorious ones** - This phrase refers to spiritual beings, such as angels or demons. See [[:en:bible:notes:jud:01:07|Jude 8-9]].
  * **greater strength and power** - There are two possible groups that the angels are compared to here: 1) the glorious ones or 2) the false teachers.
  * **they do not bring insulting judgments against them** - The word "they" refers to angels, and there are two possible meanings for the word "them": 1) the glorious ones or 2) the false teachers.
