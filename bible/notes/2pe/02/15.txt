\v 16 But God rebuked him for having done that which was wrong\add and for\add* behaving very foolishly. And even though donkeys do not speak, \add God used\add* a donkey to hinder Balaam \add by enabling it to\add* speak to him with a human voice.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 They refuse to live like God wants them to. They have imitated what the prophet Balaam, the son of Beor, did long ago. He thought he would act in a wicked way and gain a reward for it.
\v 16 But God rebuked him for sinning. And even though donkeys do not speak, God used Balaam's own donkey to speak to him with a human voice and stop his insane action.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 They have abandoned the right way. They went astray, and they have followed the way of Balaam son of Beor, who loved to receive payment for unrighteousness.
\f + \ft Some other versions read, \fqa Balaam, son of Bosor \fqa* \f*
\v 16 But he obtained a rebuke for his own trespass. A mute donkey speaking in a human voice stopped the prophet's insanity.
