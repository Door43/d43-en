===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 But when he did that, he rescued righteous Lot, who was greatly distressed by the filthy behavior of lawless men. 
\v 8 For that righteous man, living among them day after day, was tormenting his righteous soul because of what he saw and heard.
\v 9 Therefore the Lord knows how to rescue godly men out of trials, and how to hold unrighteous men for punishment at the day of judgment.
