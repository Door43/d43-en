\v 20 Those \add teachers of false teachings\add* learned about our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. As a result, they stopped doing those deeds that defile \add people\f + \ft Or: cause people to become impure\add* \f* \add spiritually\add*. Since they have begun to do \add those evil deeds again\add*, with the result that they are unable to stop doing such deeds, they are in a worse condition than \add they were in before they knew Jesus Christ\add*.
\v 21 \add Because God will severely punish them\add*, it would have been better for them if they had never known what it means to conduct their lives in a righteous manner. It is too bad that although they knew \add how to conduct their lives in a righteous manner\add*, they rejected the things that God commanded people to do, the things that \add were\add* taught to them \add by us apostles\f + \ft Or: by Christ\add* \f* \f + \ft Or:that \add we apostles\f + \ft Or: Christ\add* \f* taught to them \f*.
\v 22 \add The way in which they are behaving again\add* is just like the proverbs\f + \ft Or: what people often say \f*: \add They are like\add* dogs that return to \add eat\add* their vomit, and \add they are like\add* pigs that have washed and then roll \add again\add* in the mud.

\v 20 But suppose that you began to know our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and that you stopped doing the things that kept God from accepting you. Then suppose that you began doing those same wicked things again, you would be even worse off now than you were at first.
\v 21 It would have been better for them if they had never learned how to live in the right way. But God will punish them even more, since they have rejected what he instructed them to do, what we apostles passed on to them.
\v 22 The way in which they are behaving again is just like the proverbs that people say: "They are like dogs that return to eat their own vomit;"  and they are like "pigs that have washed themselves and then roll again in the mud."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 Whoever escapes the defilements of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and then returns to those defilements again, it has become for them worse than at the first.
\v 21 It would be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than to know it and turn away from the holy commandment delivered to them.
\v 22 This proverb is true for them: "A dog returns to its own vomit. A washed pig returns to the mud."
