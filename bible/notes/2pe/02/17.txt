\v 17 These teachers of false teachings mislead people by promising what they cannot do, as dried-up springs mislead people by causing them to expect to get water from them.

Therefore, God has reserved the darkness of hell for those teachers of false teachings.
\v 18 By boasting proudly as they make speeches that are worthless, they entice people who have recently become believers and have ceased to do the things that wicked people do. They entice them into sin by encouraging them to do the evil deeds that their self-directed nature urges them to do.

\v 17 These men are like springs without water. They are like clouds that a storm drives. Thick darkness is reserved for them.
\v 18 They speak with vain arrogance. They entice people through the lusts of the flesh. They entice people  who try to escape from those who live in error.
\v 19 They promise freedom to them, but they themselves are slaves of corruption. For a man is a slave to whatever overcomes him.
