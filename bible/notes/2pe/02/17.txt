\v 17 These \add teachers of false teachings mislead\f + \ft Or: deceive \f* people by promising what they cannot do\add*, as \f + \ft metaphor \f* dried-up springs \add mislead\f + \ft Or: deceive \f* people by causing them to expect to get water from them\add*. They \add mislead\f + \ft Or: deceive \f* people\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* just like clouds that are blown along by strong winds \add mislead\f + \ft Or: deceive \f* people by causing them to expect rain, but no rain falls. Therefore\add*, God has reserved the darkness of hell \add for those teachers of false teachings\add*.
\v 18 By boasting proudly as they make speeches that are worthless, they entice people who have recently \add become believers and\add* have ceased to do the things that wicked people do. They entice them \add into sin\add* by encouraging them to \add do the\add* evil deeds that their self-directed nature \add urges them to do\add*.
\v 19 \add The false teachers\add* tell people that they are free \add to do whatever they want to do, even though\add* they themselves are \add like\add* slaves \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add because their own self-directed nature forces them to do\add* sinful deeds\add . Think about these well-known words: 'Whenever a person is controlled by something\add* \f + \ft Or:\add something controls a person\add* \f*, \add it is as though\add* that person has become a slave of what controls him.'

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 These people who teach falsely are like springs that give no water; they are like clouds that quickly pass overhead before they can give rain. Therefore, God has reserved the darkness of hell for those teachers.
\v 18 They boast about themselves, but what they say is worth nothing. They persuade people who have recently become believers and who have just now ceased to do wicked things. They persuade them to sin again by doing whatever sinful people like to do.
\v 19 They tell them that they are free to do whatever they like. But they themselves are slaves who must obey whatever their evil minds tell them to do. Certainly a person is a slave to whatever controls him.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 These men are like springs without water. They are like clouds that a storm drives along. Thick darkness is reserved for them.
\v 18 They speak with vain arrogance. They entice people through the lusts of the flesh. They entice people who try to escape from those who live in error.
\v 19 They promise freedom to them, but they themselves are slaves of corruption. For a man is a slave to whatever overcomes him.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **These men are like springs without water** - Springs flowing with water promise refreshment for thirsty people, but "springs without water" will leave the thirsty disappointed. In the same way, false teachers, although they promise many things, are unable to do what they promise. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **They are like clouds that a storm drives** - When people see storm clouds, they expect rain to fall. When the winds from the storm blow the clouds away before the rain can fall, the people are disappointed. In the same way, false teachers, although they promise many things, are unable to do what they promise. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Thick darkness is reserved for them** - The word "them" refers to the false teachers. This can be stated in active form. AT: "God has reserved thick darkness for them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **They speak with vain arrogance** - They use impressive but meaningless words.
  * **They entice people through the lusts of the flesh** - They appeal to the sinful nature to engage people in immoral and sinful actions.
  * **people who try to escape ... promise freedom ... slaves of corruption** - Peter speaks of people who live sinfully as if they are slaves to sin who need to be released from their captivity. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **people who try to escape from those who live in error** - This phrase refers to people who recently became believers. The phrase "those who live in error" refers to unbelievers who still live in sin. AT: "people who try to live rightly, instead of living sinfully as they used to and as other people do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **They promise freedom to them, but they themselves are slaves of corruption** - "The false teachers promise freedom to these people, but the false teachers themselves are slaves of corruption." The false teachers promise people that they can help them to stop sinning, but the false teachers themselves cannot stop sinning. 
  * **For a man is a slave to whatever overcomes him** - Peter speaks of a person as a slave when anything has control over that person, and that thing as the master of that person. AT: "For if something has control over a person, that person becomes like a slave to that thing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
