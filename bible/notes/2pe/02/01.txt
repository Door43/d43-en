<usfm>
\v 1 Just like there were false prophets among the \add Israelite\add* people \add long ago\add*, so there will also be teachers of false \add teachings\add* among you. They will enter \add your congregations\add* without you realizing \add what\f + \ft Or: who \f* they are\add*, and they will \add spiritually\add* injure some people by what they teach. Specifically, these teachers will even deny \add that\add* the Lord \add Jesus died to\add* pay\add for the guilt of our sins\add*. As a result, they will soon destroy themselves \add spiritually, and God will also punish them\add*.
\v 2 And many \add people\add* will behave in an extremely immoral manner, imitating the extremely immoral manner in which \add these teachers of false teaching\add* behave. As a result, \add unbelievers\add* will discredit the true message\f + \ft Or: say the true message is false \f*.
\v 3 Because \add the teachers of false teaching\add* want a lot of things that other people have, \add they think that\add* by telling you stories that they themselves have made up\f + \ft Or: invented \f*, they will get money from you. \add God decided\add* long ago \add that he would\add* punish them, and he has not fallen asleep \f + \ft litotes \f*! \add He will certainly destroy them\add*!

\v 1 Long ago, various people among the Israelites pretended to give true messages from God, and people will do the same with you. At first you will not know who they are, and they make some stop trusting in Christ; they will start thinking that the Lord is not important—although he is the one who redeemed them. But soon, God will make these false prophets perish.
\v 2 And many believers will imitate how these false prophets live. In this way they will insult what is true about God.
\v 3 They will tell you lies in such a way that they will make money off you. God will not wait very long before he punishes them; they will soon perish.

\v 1 False prophets came to the people, and false teachers will also come to you. They will secretly bring with them destructive heresies, and they will deny the master who bought them. They are bringing quick destruction upon themselves.
\v 2 Many will follow their sensuality, and through them the way of truth will be blasphemed.
\v 3 With greediness they will make a profit off of you with deceptive words. Their condemnation does not delay for long; their destruction does not sleep.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Peter begins to warn the believers about false teachers.

  * **False prophets came to the Israelites, and false teachers will come to you** - Just as false prophets came deceiving Israel with their words, so will false teachers come teaching lies about Christ.
  * **destructive heresies** - The word "heresies" refers to opinions that are contrary to the teaching of Christ and the apostles. These heresies destroy the faith of those who believe them.
  * **the Master who bought them** - The word "Master" here refers to a person who owns slaves. Peter speaks of Jesus as the owner of people whom he has bought, the price being his death. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **sensuality** - "immoral sexual behavior"
  * **the way of truth will be blasphemed** - The phrase "way of truth" refers to the Christian faith as the true path to God. This can be stated in active form. AT: "unbelievers will blaspheme the way of truth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **make a profit off of you with deceptive words** - "convince you to give them money by telling you lies"
  * **Against them condemnation will not wait long; their destruction is not idle** - Peter speaks of "condemnation" and "destruction" as if they are persons who act. The two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize how soon the false teachers will be condemned. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Against them condemnation will not wait long; their destruction is not idle** - You can translate these phrases with verbs in positive terms. AT: "God will soon condemn them; he is ready to destroy them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
