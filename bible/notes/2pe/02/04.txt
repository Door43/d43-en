\v 5 He also destroyed the people who lived in the world long ago. He saved only eight of them, including Noah, who was a righteous preacher. He did this when he destroyed by a flood all the ungodly people who were living then.
\v 6 He also condemned Sodom and Gomorrah cities and then burned them completely to ashes. This is a warning to those who afterwards would live so as to dishonor God.

<usfm>
\v 4 For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but instead handed them down to Tartarus, to be kept in chains in darkness until the judgment—
\v 5 and if he did not spare the ancient world, but did preserve Noah—a herald of righteousness—with seven others—but brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly, 
\v 6 and reduced the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes and condemned them to destruction as an example of what is to come to the ungodly...
