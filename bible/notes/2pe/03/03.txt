\v 3 It is important for you to understand that in the time \add immediately\add* before Christ comes back, there will be people who will ridicule \add the idea of his coming back. Those people will do whatever\add* evil deeds they wish to do.

\v 4 They will say, "Although Christ promised that he would come back, he has not. Since the ancestors died, everything has remained the same. Things are as they always have been since God created the world!"

\v 3 Know this first, that mockers will come in the last days. They will mock and proceed according to their own desires.
\v 4 They will say, "Where is the promise of his return? From when our fathers fell asleep, all things have stayed the same, since the beginning of creation."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Know this first** - "Know this as the most important thing." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:2pe:01:19|1:20]]. 
  * **proceed according to their own desires** - Here the word "desires" refers to sinful desires that are opposed to God's will. AT: "living according to their own sinful desires" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **proceed** - act, behave
  * **Where is the promise of his return?** - The mockers ask this rhetorical question to emphasize that they do not believe that Jesus will return. The word "promise" refers to the fulfillment of the promise that Jesus will return. AT: "The promise that Jesus would return is not true! He will not return!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **our fathers fell asleep** - Here "fathers" refers to ancestors who lived long ago. "Fell asleep" is an idiom that means they died. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **all things have stayed the same, since the beginning of creation** - The mockers exaggerate with the word "all", and they argue that since nothing in the world has ever changed, it cannot be true that Jesus will return. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **since the beginning of creation** - This can be translated as a verbal phrase. AT: "since God created the world" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
