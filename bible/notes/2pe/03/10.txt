\v 10 Although God is being patient, at the time that he has appointed, the Lord Jesus Christ will certainly come back to judge people. He will come back unexpectedly, like a thief comes unexpectedly. At that time there will be a great roaring sound. The heavens will cease to exist. The elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth that God made and everything on it that people have made will disappear.

\v 10 However, the day of the Lord will come as a thief. The heavens will pass away with a loud noise. The elements will be burned with fire, and the earth and the works in it will be judged.

  * **However** - Although the Lord is being patient wants people to repent, he will return and bring judgment.
  * **the day of the Lord will come as a thief** - Just as a thief does not announce that he is coming to rob a house, Jesus will appear unannounced. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **The heavens will pass away with a loud noise. The elements will be burned with fire** - Loud noise and fire are vivid descriptions of the destruction of heaven and earth. It will not escape anyone's attention!
  * **the works in it will be judged** - God will judge all the good or bad things people have done.
