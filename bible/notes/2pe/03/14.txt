\v 14 Therefore, dear friends, because you are waiting for these things to happen, do all that you can to conduct your lives in a way that honors God, in order that Christ may see that you do not sin and that you are living peacefully with each other.
\v 15 And think about this: Our Lord Jesus Christ is patient because he wants to save people. Our dear brother Paul also wrote wise words to you about these same matters, because God enabled him to understand these events.
\v 16 In the letters that Paul wrote there are certain things that are difficult for people to understand. People who know nothing about God and who speak at random interpret these things wrongly, as they also interpret the other parts of the Scriptures wrongly. The result is that they they will lead God to punish them.

\v 14 Therefore, beloved, since you expect these things, do your best to be found spotless and blameless, and to be found at peace with him.
\v 15 And consider the patience of our Lord to be salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul wrote to you, according to the wisdom that was given to him.
\v 16 Paul speaks of these things in all his letters, in which there are things that are difficult to understand. Undiscipled  and unstable men distort these things, as they also do other scriptures, to their own destruction.
