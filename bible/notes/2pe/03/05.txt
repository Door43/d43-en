<usfm>
\v 5 They wilfully forget this, that the heavens and the earth were established out of water and through water, long ago, by the word of God—
\v 6 and that through his word and the water the world at that time, being flooded, was destroyed—
\v 7 and that the heavens and the earth are reserved by that same word for fire, being reserved for the day of judgment and the destruction of the ungodly people.

  * **that same word** - "the word of God"
  * **and that the heavens and the earth are reserved by that same word for fire** - "God's word is reserving the heavens and earth for fire."
