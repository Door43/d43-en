====== 2 Peter 01 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Knowing God ==
Christian spiritual growth is often described as knowing God more or knowing God better. This is because a growing Christian understands the things of God better as they grow. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:spirit]])

== Forgetting what God has done ==
Peter believes Christians, who are not leading godly lives, have forgotten the cost of their salvation. He reasons: if they remembered their former life and what Jesus has done, they would be sufficiently motivated to live godly lives. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:godly]] and [[:en:obe:kt:save]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Divine revelation ==
Peter describes Christianity as a religion, which has been revealed and proved by God and it is therefore implied that it is not a creation of man, like all other religions (except Judaism). (See: [[:en:obe:kt:reveal]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
