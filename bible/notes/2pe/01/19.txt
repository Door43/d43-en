\v 21 because no human beings decided \add to make those prophecies\add*.

\v 19 We are even more sure that what the prophets wrote about Christ long ago is completely reliable. Pay attention to what they wrote, because it is like a lamp that is shining in a dark place that helps people see where they are going. That light will shine until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.
\v 20 It is important that you understand that no prophet could interpret by his own imagination.
\v 21 No prophecies come from the decision of a human being. Those who spoke messages from God did so when the Holy Spirit helped them do it. Therefore the Spirit must also help us understand what they mean.

\v 19 We have this prophetic word made more sure. You do well to pay attention to it. It is like a lamp shining in a dark place until the morning comes and the morning star rises in your hearts.
\v 20 Know this first, that no prophecy is about one's own interpretation.

\v 21 For no prophecy ever came by the will of man. Instead, men carried along by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.
