\v 19 We are even more sure that what the prophets wrote about Christ long ago is completely reliable. Pay attention to what they wrote, because it is like a lamp that is shining in a dark place that helps people see where they are going. That light will shine until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.
\v 20 It is important that you understand that no prophet could interpret by his own imagination.
\v 21 No prophecies come from the decision of a human being. Those who spoke messages from God did so when the Holy Spirit helped them do it. Therefore the Spirit must also help us understand what they mean.

\v 19 For we have this prophetic word made more sure, and you do well to pay attention to it, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.
\v 20 Above all, you must understand that no prophecy comes from someone's own interpretation.
\v 21 For no prophecy was ever brought by the will of man, but men spoke from God when they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.

  * **you do well to pay attention to it** - Peter instructs the believers to pay close attention to the prophetic message.
  * **as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns** - Peter compares the prophetic word to a lamp that gives light in the dark until light comes in the morning. The coming of morning is a reference to Christ's coming. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **the morning star rises in your hearts** - Peter speaks of Christ as the "morning star," which indicates that daybreak and the end of darkness is near. Christ will bring light into the hearts of believers, ending all doubt and bringing full understanding of who he is. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **men spoke from God when they were carried along by the Holy Spirit** - Peter speaks of the Holy Spirit helping the prophets to write what God wanted them to write as if the Holy Spirit was carrying them from one place to another.
