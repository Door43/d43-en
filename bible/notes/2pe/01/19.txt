\v 19 And we have the word of prophecy made more sure; whereto you do well that you take heed, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts:
\v 20 knowing this first, that no prophecy of scripture is of private interpretation.
\v 21 For no prophecy ever came by the will of man: but men spoke from God, being moved by the Holy Spirit.
