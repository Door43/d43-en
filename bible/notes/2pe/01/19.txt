\v 19 In this way, because of what we saw, we are even more sure that what the prophets wrote about Christ long ago is completely reliable. You should pay attention to what they wrote, because it lets you know whether what we taught you is true or false, like a lamp that is shining in a dark place helps people see where they are going. You should pay attention to what they wrote until our Lord Jesus Christ comes back and enables you to know God fully. At that point, it will be like when the day dawns and the morning star rises, and we can see it clearly.
\v 20 It is important that you realize that no prophet could interpret by himself the meaning of what they wrote in the Scriptures without the help of God's Spirit,
\v 21 because no human beings decided to make those prophecies. On the contrary, those who spoke messages from God did so the Holy Spirit helped them do it. Therefore the Spirit must also help us understand what they mean.

\v 19 We have this prophetic word made more sure, to which you do well to attend. It is like a lamp shining in a dark place until the morning comes and the morning star rises in your hearts.
\v 20 Know this first, that written prophecy does not come from the reasoning of the prophet himself.

\v 21 For no prophecy ever came by the will of man, but by men carried along by the Holy Spirit who spoke from God.
