\v 19 We also have what the prophets wrote about Christ long ago, which is completely reliable. You should pay attention to what they wrote, because what they wrote enables you to know whether what is taught to you is true or whether it is false, like a lamp that is shining in a dark place enables people to see where they are going. You should pay attention to what they wrote until our Lord Jesus Christ comes back and enables you to know God fully, which will be like when a day dawns and the morning star rises and we can see it clearly.
\v 20 It is important that you realize that no one can interpret by himself the meaning of what the prophets wrote in the Scriptures without the help of God's Spirit,
\v 21 because no human beings decided to make those prophecies. On the contrary, those who spoke messages from God did that because it was the Holy Spirit who caused them to do it, and therefore the Spirit must help us to interpret their meaning.

\v 19 We are sure  about this prophetic word. You do well to attend to it. The word is like a lamp that shines in a dark place until the morning comes and the sun rises--in your hearts:
\v 20 Know this first, that all written prophecy does not come from the reasoning of the prophet.

\v 21 No prophecy ever came by the will of man, but it came by the Holy Spirit to men who spoke from God.
