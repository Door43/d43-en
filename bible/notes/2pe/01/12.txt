\v 12 Therefore I will  be ready always to remind you of these things, although you know them, and you are strong in the truth now.
\v 13 I think it is right for me to wake you up and to remind you about these things, as long as I am in this tent.
\v 14 For I know that soon I will remove my tent, as our Lord Jesus Christ has shown me.
\v 15 I will do my best for you to always remember these things after my departure.
