\v 12 Therefore I will always be ready to remind you of these things, although you know them, and although you are strong in the truth you now have.
\v 13 It is proper for me to think, as long as I am in this tent, to stir you up by way of reminder. 
\v 14 For I know that the putting off of my tent will be soon, because our Lord Jesus Christ has revealed this to me.
\v 15 I will make every effort to see that after my departure you may be able always remember these things.
