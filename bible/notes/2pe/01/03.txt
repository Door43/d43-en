<usfm>
\v 3 God has given us everything that we need in order that we might live forever and honor him. He does this by his power as God, and he does this because we know him. He has also given it to us as a result of our knowing him. He is the one who chose us to be his people because he is powerful and good.
\v 4 Because he is this way, he has promised us that he will do very great and priceless things for us. He has also said to you that as you believe in what he has promised, you will be able to act in a right way, just like God acts in a right way, and that you will no longer be on the way to perish because of desiring to do evil things, as the unbelievers are.

<usfm>
\v 3 All the things concerning divine power for life and godliness have been given to us through the knowledge of God, who called us through his own glory and excellence.
\v 4 Through these, he gave us precious and great promises, so that you might be sharers in the divine nature, as you escape from the corruption that is in the world because of wicked desires.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Peter begins to teach the believers about living godly lives.

  * **for life and godliness** - Here "godliness" describes the word "life." AT: "for a godly life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hendiadys]])
  * **who called us** - Here the word "us" refers to Peter and his audience. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
  * **through his own glory and virtue** - "through his own glory and moral excellence" 
  * **Through these** - Here "these" refers to "his own glory and virtue."
  * **you might be sharers** - "you might share"
  * **the divine nature** - what God is like
  * **as you escape from the corruption that is in the world because of wicked desires** - Peter speaks of people not suffering from the corruption that wicked desires cause as if they were escaping from that corruption. The word "corruption" is an abstract noun that can be translated with a verbal phrase. AT: "and so that the wicked desires in this world will no longer corrupt you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
