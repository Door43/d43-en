<usfm>
\v 3 God has given us everything that we need in order that we might live forever and honor him. He does this by his power as God, and he does this because we know him. He has also given it to us as a result of our knowing him. He is the one who chose us to be his people because he is powerful and good.
\v 4 Because he is this way, he has promised us that he will do very great and priceless things for us. He has also said to you that as you believe in what he has promised, you will be able to act in a right way, just like God acts in a right way, and that you will no longer be on the way to perish because of desiring to do evil things, as the unbelievers are.

<usfm>
\v 3 His divine power has given to us all the things for life and godliness, through the knowledge of God, who called us through his own glory and virtue. 
\v 4 Through these, he gave us precious and great promises. He did this so that you might be sharers in the divine nature, as you escape from the corruption that is in the world in wicked desires.
