\v 4 Because he is powerful and good, he has promised us that he will do very great and priceless things for us. He has also said to you that as you believe in what he has promised, you will be able to act in a right way, just like God acts in a right way, and that you will no longer be on the way to perish because of desiring to do evil things, as the unbelievers are.

\v 3 As all the things of divine power for life and godliness have been given to us  through the knowledge of God, who called us through his own glory and virtue.
\v 4 through these, he gave us precious and great promises. He did this so that you might be sharers in the divine nature, as you escape from the corruption that is in the world in wicked desires.
