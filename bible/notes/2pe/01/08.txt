\v 8 If you do all these things, and if you do them more and more, that shows that knowing our Lord Jesus Christ produces very great results in your lives.
\v 9 But if these things are not true about people, it means they are not aware that these things are important, just like a blind person is not aware of what is around him. They think only about earthly matters, just like a shortsighted person sees clearly only things that are near. It seems that they have forgotten that God has forgiven them for their former sinful lives.

\v 8 If these things are in you and grow in you, you will not be barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
\v 9 But whoever lacks these things sees only what is near; he is blind. He has forgotten the cleansing from his old sins.
