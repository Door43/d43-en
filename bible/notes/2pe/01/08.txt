\v 8 If you do all these things, and if you do them more and more, that shows that knowing our Lord Jesus Christ produces very great results in your lives.
\v 9 But if these things are not true about people, it means they are not aware that these things are important, just like a blind person is not aware of what is around him. They think only about earthly matters, just like a shortsighted person sees clearly only things that are near. It seems that they have forgotten that God has forgiven them for their former sinful lives.

\v 8 If these things are in you and grow in you, you will not be barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
\v 9 But whoever lacks these things is so nearsighted that he is blind, having forgotten he has been cleansed from his past sins.

  * **these things** - This refers to faith, virtue, knowledge, self-control, endurance, godliness, brotherly affection, and love, which Peter mentioned in the previous verses. 
  * **you will not be barren or unfruitful** - Peter speaks of a person who does not possess these qualities as if he is a field that will not produce a crop. This can be stated in positive terms. AT: "you will produce and be fruitful" or "you will be effective" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
  * **barren or unfruitful** - These words mean basically the same thing and emphasize that this person will not be productive or experience any benefits from knowing Jesus. AT: "unproductive" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ** - You can translate "knowledge" using a verbal phrase. AT: "through your knowing God and Jesus our Lord" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **whoever lacks these things** - any person who does not have these things
  * **sees only what is near; he is blind** - Peter speaks of a person who does not possess these qualities as if he were a nearsighted or blind person because he does not understand their value. AT: "is like a shortsighted person who cannot see their importance" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the cleansing from his old sins** - You can use a verb to translate this. AT: "that God has cleansed him from his old sins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
