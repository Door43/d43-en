\v 16 For we did not follow cleverly invented myths when we made known to  you the power and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 
\v 17 For he received honor and glory from God the Father when a voice was brought to him by the Majestic Glory saying, "This is my beloved Son, with him I am well pleased."
\v 18 We ourselves heard this voice brought from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain.

  * **For we did not follow cleverly invented myths** - Here the word "we" refers to Peter and the other apostles, but not to his readers. AT: "For we apostles did not follow cleverly made-up stories" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **the power and the coming** - These two phrases may refer to the same thing and be translated as a single phrase. AT: "the powerful coming" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hendiadys]])

  * **We ourselves heard this voice brought from heaven** - With the word "We," Peter is referring to himself and to the disciples James and John, who heard the voice of God. AT: "We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
