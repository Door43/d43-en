\v 16 For we did not follow cleverly invented myths when we told you about the power and the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ. Instead, we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
\v 17 For he received from God the Father honor and glory when a voice was brought to him by the majestic Glory saying, "This is my Son, the beloved One, with whom I am well pleased."
\v 18 We heard this voice that came out of heaven, while we were with him on the holy mountain.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Peter continues to explain his teachings to the believers and explains why they are trustworthy.

  * **For we did not follow cleverly invented myths** - Here the word "we" refers to Peter and the other apostles, but not to his readers. AT: "For we apostles did not follow cleverly made-up stories" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **the power and the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ** - Here the word "appearance" refers to Jesus' second coming. Possible meanings are 1) "the power of our Lord Jesus Christ and his coming" or 2) "the powerful coming of our Lord Jesus Christ." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hendiadys]]) 
  * **our Lord Jesus Christ** - Here the word "our" refers to all believers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
  * **when a voice was brought to him by the majestic Glory** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "when he heard a voice come from the majestic Glory" or "when the majestic Glory spoke to him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **a voice ... saying** - the sound of the words
  * **the majestic Glory** - Peter refers to God in terms of his glory. This is a euphemism that avoids using God's name, out of reverence for him. AT: "God, the supreme Glory" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **We heard this voice that came out of heaven** - Peter is referring to himself and to the disciples James and John, who heard the voice of God.
