===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **called to** - "shouted" or "yelled."
  * **"Must the sword devour forever? **  - AT: "We do not need to keep using our swords to fight and kill each other." A "sword" cannot literally eat. When it is said to eat or "devour" it is taking part in warfare and killing.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **Do you not know it will be bitter in the end? How long will it be before you tell your men to stop pursuing their brothers?** - AT: "This will not have a good ending, stop this now so that Israelite will not have to kill Israelite." Here "brother" is used to represent the members of the nation of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]] ) 
  * **as God lives** - This is a very strong vow. AT: "with God as my witness" or "God will affirm that I mean this thing I say."
  * **if you had not said that** - This refers to what Abner has said to Joab about stopping the battle.
