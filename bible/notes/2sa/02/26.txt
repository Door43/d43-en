===== translationNotes: =====

  * **called to** - "shouted" or "yelled"
  * **Must the sword devour forever?** - This rhetorical question emphasizes that they had fought for a long time and can be translated as a statement. AT: "We do not need to keep using our swords to fight and kill each other." A "sword" cannot literally eat. When it is said to eat or "devour," it means taking part in warfare and killing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **Do you not know it will be bitter in the end?** - This rhetorical question is intended for emphasis and can be translated as a statement. AT: "You know very well that when this ends we will all feel like we have eaten something bitter" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] ) 
  * **How long will it be before you tell your men to stop pursuing their brothers?** - This rhetorical question is intended for emphasis and can be translated as a statement.  Here "brother" is used to represent the members of the nation of Israel. AT: "Stop this now so that Israelites will not have to kill each other" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] ) 
  * **as God lives** - This is a very strong vow. AT: "with God as my witness" or "God will affirm that I mean what I say"
  * **if you had not said that** - This refers to what Abner has said to Joab about stopping the battle.
