\v 22 So Abner said again to Asahel, "Stop pursuing me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then
could I hold up my face to Joab your brother?"
\v 23 But Asahel refused to turn aside, and so Abner struck him in the body with the blunt end of his spear, so that the spear came out the other side.  Asahel fell down and died there. So it came about that anyone who came to the place where Asahel fell down and died, he stopped and stood still.
