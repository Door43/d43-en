\v 23 But Asahel refused to stop pursuing Abner. So Abner \add suddenly turned and\add* thrust the butt end of his spear into Asahel's stomach. Because he thrust it very strongly, that end of the spear \add went though his body and\add* came out at Asahel's back, and he fell to the ground, dead. All the other soldiers who came to the place where his body was lying stopped and stood there, \add stunned\f + \ft Or: looking \f* at Asahel's body\add*.

\v 22 So Abner said again to Asahel, "Stop pursuing me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then
could I hold up my face to Joab, your brother?"
\v 23 But Asahel refused to turn aside, and so Abner stabbed him in the body with the blunt end of his spear, so that the spear came out the other side.  Asahel fell down and died there. So it came about that anyone who arrived at the place where Asahel fell down and died, he stopped and stood still.

  * ** How then could I hold up my face to Joab, your brother?** - This rhetorical question continues to emphasize how much Abner does not want to fight and kill Asahel because it destroy Abner's relationship with Joab.

(See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
