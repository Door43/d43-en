\v 16 Each man seized his opponent by the head and thrust his sword into the side of his opponent, and they fell down together. Therefore that place was called in Hebrew, "Helkath Hazzurim," or "Field of Swords,"  which is in Gibeon.
\v 17 The battle was very severe that day and Abner and the men of Israel were defeated before the servants of David.
