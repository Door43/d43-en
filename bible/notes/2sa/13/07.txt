\v 7 Then David sent word to Tamar at his palace, saying, "Go now to your brother Amnon's house and prepare food for him."
\v 8 So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house where he was lying down. She took dough and kneaded it and formed bread in his sight, and then she baked it. 
\v 9 She took the pan and gave the bread to him, but he refused to eat. Then Amnon said to the others present, "Send everyone out, away from me." So everyone went out from him.
