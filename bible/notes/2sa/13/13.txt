\v 13 As for me, if I did that, I would not be able to \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* endure being disgraced by having done that. And as for you, everyone in Israel would condemn you for having done such a disgraceful deed. So I plead with you, talk to the king. I am sure that he will allow me to marry you."
\v 14 But he would not heed her. He was stronger than she was, so he forced her to have sex with him.

\v 13 Where could I go to escape the shame this would place on my life? And this act will mark you as a shameless fool throughout Israel. Please, I ask you to speak to the king. He would allow you to marry me."
\v 14 However Amnon would not listen to her. Since he was stronger than Tamar, he seized her and he slept with her.
