\v 34 In the meantime, Absalom ran away.
\p Just then, a soldier keeping guard on the city wall saw a large crowd of people coming down the hill along the road to the west. He ran and told the king what he had seen.
\v 35 Jonadab said to the king, "Look there! What I told you is true. Your other sons are alive and have come!"
\p
\v 36 And as soon as he said that, David's sons came in. They all started crying, and David and all his officials also cried very much.

\v 34 Absalom fled away. A servant keeping watch raised his eyes and saw many people coming on the road on the hillside west of him.
\v 35 Then Jehonadab said to the king, "Look, the king's sons are coming. It is just as your servant said."
\v 36 So it came about as soon as he had finished talking that the king's sons arrived and raised their voices and wept. And the king and all his servants also wept bitterly.
