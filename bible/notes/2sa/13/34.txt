\v 34 Absalom fled away. A servant keeping watch raised his eyes and saw many people coming on the road on the hillside west of him.
\v 35 Then Jehonadab said to the king, "Look, the king's sons are coming. It is just as your servant said."
\v 36 So it came about as soon as he had finished talking that the king's sons arrived and raised their voices and wept. And the king and all his servants also wept bitterly.
