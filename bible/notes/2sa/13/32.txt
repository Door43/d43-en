\v 32 Jehonadab the son of Shammah, David’s brother, answered and said, "Let not my master believe that they have killed all the young men who are  the king’s sons, for Amnon only is dead. Absalom has planned this from the day that Amnon raped his sister Tamar.
\v 33 So therefore let not my master the king take this report to heart, so as to believe that all the king’s sons are dead, for Amnon only is dead."

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Jonadab... Shimeah**  - Translate these men's names as you did in [[en:bible:notes:2sa:13:03]].
    * **Let not my master** - Jonadab is speaking to David but is calling him "my master" to show respect. "Do not"
    * **do not take this report to heart**  - Here "heart" represents David's belief. AT: "Do not believe this report." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
