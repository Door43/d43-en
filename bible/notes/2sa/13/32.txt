\v 32 Jonadab son of Shimeah, David's brother, answered and said, "Let not my master believe that they have killed all the young men who are the king's sons, for Amnon only is dead. Absalom has planned this from the day that Amnon violated his sister Tamar.
\v 33 So therefore let not my master the king take this report to heart, so as to believe that all the king's sons are dead, for Amnon only is dead."
