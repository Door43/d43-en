\v 27 Absalom pressed David, and so he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.
\v 28 Absalom commanded his servants saying, "Listen closely. When Amnon’s heart begins to be drunk with wine, and when I say to you, 'Strike Amnon,' then kill him. Do not be afraid. Have I not commanded you? Be courageous and brave." 
\v 29 So the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and every man mounted his mule and fled.
