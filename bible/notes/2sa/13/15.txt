\v 15 Then Amnon hated her very much. He hated her much more than he had desired her. He said to her, "Get up and get out of here!"
\p
\v 16 But she said to him, "No! It would be very wrong for you to send me away. It would be worse than what you just did to me!" But he would not heed her.
\p
\v 17 He summoned his personal servant and said to him, "Take this woman outside, away from me, and lock the door \add so that she cannot come in again\add*!"

\p
\v 15 Then Amnon hated Tamar with extreme hatred. He hated her even more than he had desired her. Amnon said to her, "Get up and go."
\v 16 But she responded to him, "No! Because this great evil of making me leave is even worse than what you did to me!" But Amnon did not listen to her.
\v 17 Instead, he called his personal servant and said, "Take this woman away from me, and bolt the door after her."
