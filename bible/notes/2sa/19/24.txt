===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Mephibosheth** - Translate this as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:2sa:04:04|4:4]].
  * **He had not dressed his feet, or trimmed his beard, or washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he came home in peace.** - These acts together represent that Mephibosheth was in mourning for David until he had returned safely. AT: "He did not care for himself; he mourned for David until David had safely returned home safely."
  * **Why did you not go with me, Mephibosheth?** - Possible meanings are 1) David truly did not know and wanted Mephibosheth to tell him, or 2) David believes that Mephibosheth had become his enemy and is rebuking Mephibosheth, AT: "If you really were my friend, you would have gone with me, Mephibosheth."
