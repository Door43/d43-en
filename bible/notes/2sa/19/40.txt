\v 40 So the king crossed over to Gilgal, and Kimham crossed over with him. All the army of Judah brought the king over, and also half the army of Israel.
\v 41 Soon all the men of Israel began to come to the king and say to the king, "Why have our brothers, the men of Judah, stolen you away and brought the king and his family over the Jordan, and all David's men with him?"

  * **Kimham** - Translate this as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:2sa:19:37|19:37]].

  * **Why have our brothers, the men of Judah, stolen you away and brought the king and his family over the Jordan, and all David's men with him?** - This question is asked because the people of Israel feel betrayed by the people of Judah. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement.
