===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Why are you the last to bring the king back to his palace, since the talk of all Israel favors the king, to bring him back to his palace?** - This question is asked to rebuke the elders in Judah. AT: "you should have been the first to favor the king and bring him back to the palace, not the people of the nation of Israel." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **You are my brothers, my flesh and bone. Why then are you the last to bring back the king?'** - This question continues the initial rebuke. In addition, the phrase "my flesh and bone" refers to the elders of Judah as an expression which means "family." AT: "You are my brothers, like my family. You should have been the first, not the last, to bring back the king."(See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
