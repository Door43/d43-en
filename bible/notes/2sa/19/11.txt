\v 11 King David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests saying, "Speak to the elders of Judah saying, 'Why are you the last to bring the king back to his palace, since the talk of all Israel favors the king, to bring him back to his palace?
\v 12 You are my brothers, my flesh and bone. Why then are you the last to bring back the king?'

  * **Why are you the last to bring the king back to his palace, since the talk of all Israel favors the king, to bring him back to his palace?** - This question is asked to rebuke the elders in Judah. AT: "You should have been the first to favor the king and bring him back to the palace, not the people of the nation of Israel." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **You are my brothers, my flesh and bone. Why then are you the last to bring back the king?** - Here the question continues the initial rebuke.
