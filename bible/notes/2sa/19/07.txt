\v 7 Now therefore get up and go out and speak kindly to your soldiers, for I swear by Yahweh, if you do not go, not one man will remain with you tonight. That would be worse for you than all the disasters that have ever happened to you from your youth until now."
\v 8 So the king got up and sat in the city gate, and it was told to all the men, "Look, the king is sitting in the gate." Then all the people came before the king.
\p And Israel fled, every man to his home.
