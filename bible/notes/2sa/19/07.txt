\v 7 So, now go and thank your soldiers \add for what they did\add*.

\p
\v 8 So the king got up and went and sat near the city gate. And all the people were told, "Hey, the king is sitting at the gate!" So they all came and gathered around him.

\p Meanwhile, all the Israelite troops \add who had been with Absalom\add* had returned to their homes.

<usfm>
\v 7 Now therefore get up and go out and speak kindly to your soldiers, for I swear by Yahweh, if you do not go, not one man will remain with you tonight. That would be worse for you than all the disaster that have ever happened to you from your youth until now."
\v 8 So the king got up and sat in the city gate, and it was told to all the men, "Look, the king is sitting in the gate." Then all the people came before the king.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I swear by Yahweh** - Joab is making a very strong oath. 
  * **all the people** - Here "the people" refers to the nation of Israel. It is unlikely that every person in the nation of Israel is present here, so this is likely an intentional exaggeration for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
