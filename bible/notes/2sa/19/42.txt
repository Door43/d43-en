\v 42 So the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, "It is because the king is more closely related to us. Why then are you angry about this? Have we eaten anything that the king had to pay for? Has he given us any gifts?"
\v 43 The men of Israel answered the men of Judah, "We have ten tribes related to the king, so we have even more right to David than you. Why then did you despise us. Was not our proposal to bring back out king the first to be heard?" But the words of the men of Judah were even more harsh than the words of the men of Israel.
