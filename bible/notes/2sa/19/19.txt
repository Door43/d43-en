\v 19 Shimei said to the king, "Do not, my master, find me guilty or call to mind what your servant stubbornly did the day that my master the king left Jerusalem. Please, may the king not take it to heart.
\v 20 For your servant knows that I have sinned. See, that is why I have come today as the first from all the family of Joseph to come down to meet my master the king."
