\v 5 Then Joab entered \add the room where\add* the king was, and said to the king, "Today you have caused your soldiers to be ashamed! You have humiliated the men who saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters and your ordinary wives and your slave wives!
\v 6 \add It seems that\add* you love those who hate you and that you hate those who love you. You have caused it to be clear today that your commanders and your officers are not at all important to you. I think that if Absalom were still alive and we were all dead today, you would be happy.

\v 5 Then Joab entered into the house to the king and said, "Today you have shamed the faces of all your soldiers, who this day have saved your life and the lives of your sons and of your daughters, and the lives of your wives, and the lives of your slave wives, 
\v 6 because you love them who hate you, and you hate them who love you. For today you have shown that captains and soldiers are nothing to you. Today I believe that if Absalom had lived, and we all had died today, then that would have pleased you.
