\v 34 And Barzillai said to the king, How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?
\v 35 I am this day fourscore years old: can I discern between good and bad? can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink?
can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should your servant be yet a burden to my lord
the king?
\v 36 Your servant would but just go over the Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?
