\v 26 And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for your servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride
thereon, and go with the king; because your servant is lame.
\v 27 And he has slandered your servant to my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is
good in your eyes.
\v 28 For all my father’s house were but dead men before my lord the king; yet did you set your servant among them that did
eat at your own table. What right therefore have I yet that I should cry any more to the king?
