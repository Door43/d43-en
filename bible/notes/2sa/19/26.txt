\v 26 He answered, "My master  the king, my servant deceived me, for I said, 'I will saddle a  donkey so I may ride on it and go with the king, because your servant is lame.'
\v 27 My servant Ziba has slandered me, your servant, to my master the king. But my master the king is like an angel of God. Therefore, do what is good in your eyes.
\v 28 For all my father's house were dead men before my master the king, but you set your servant among those who ate at your own table. What right therefore have I that I should still cry any more to the king?"
