\p Meanwhile, in Israel every man had fled to his home.
\v 9 All the people were arguing with each other throughout all the tribes of Israel saying, "The king rescued us out of the hand of our enemies. He  saved us out of the hand of the Philistines and now he has run out of the country from Absalom.
\v 10 And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. So why are we not talking about bringing the king back?"
