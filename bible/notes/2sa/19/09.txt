\v 9 All the people were arguing with each other throughout all the tribes of Israel saying, "The king rescued us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines, but now he has run out of the land because of Absalom.
\v 10 Absalom, whom we anointed over us, has died in battle. So why do you say nothing about bringing the king back?"
