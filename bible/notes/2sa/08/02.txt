\v 2 Then he defeated Moab and measured their men with a line by  making them lie down on the ground. He  measured off two lines to put to death, and one full line to keep alive. So the Moabites became servants to David and began to pay him tribute.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **He measured off two lines to put to death, and one full line to keep alive** -   Here the "line" is a "rope." David has the soldiers lie down on the ground to be measured and sorted into groups.
