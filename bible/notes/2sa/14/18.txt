\v 18 Then the king answered and said to the woman, "Please do not hide from me anything that I will ask you." And the woman replied, "Let my master the king now speak."
\v 19 The king said, "Is not the hand of Joab with you in all this?" The woman answered and said, "As your soul lives, my master the king, no one can escape to the right hand or to the left from anything that my master the king has spoken. Your servant Joab directed me and he told me to speak these words that your servant has spoken. 
\v 20 Your servant Joab has done this to change the course of what is happening. My master is wise, like the wisdom of an angel of God knows all things that are happening in the land."
