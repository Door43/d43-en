\v 32 Absalom answered Joab, "Look, I sent to you saying, 'Come here so I  may send you to the king to say,
"Why did I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to still be there. Now therefore let me see the king’s face,  and if I am guilty let him kill me." ' "
\v 33 So Joab came to the king and told him, and when the king had called for Absalom, he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the floor before the king, and the king kissed Absalom.
