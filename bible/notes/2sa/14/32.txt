\v 32 Absalom answered Joab, "Look, I sent word to you saying, 'Come here so I  may send you to the king to say, "Why did I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to still be there. Now therefore let me see the king's face,  and if I am guilty, let him kill me." ' "
\v 33 So Joab went to the king and told him. When the king called for Absalom, he came to the king and bowed low to the ground before the king, and the king kissed Absalom.
