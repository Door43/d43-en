\p
\v 13 The woman said, "Why have you done this bad thing to God's people? You have not allowed your son Absalom to return home. By saying what you have just said, you have certainly declared \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* that what you have done is wrong.
\v 14 We all die; we are like \f + \ft simile \f* water that cannot be picked up after it is spilled on the ground. \add After we die, we cannot become alive again\add*. Even God does not cause people who have died to become alive again. \add So Amnon cannot become alive again\add*.

\v 12 Then the woman said, "Please let your servant speak a further word to my master the king." He said, "Speak on."
\v 13 So the woman said, "Why then have you devised such a thing against the people of God? For in saying this thing, the king is like someone who is guilty, because the king has not brought back home again his banished son.
\v 14 For we all must die and are like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again. But God does not take away life; instead,  he finds a way to bring back someone whom he has driven away from himself.
