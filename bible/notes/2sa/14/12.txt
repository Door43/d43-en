\v 12 Then the woman said, "Your Majesty, please allow me to say one more thing to you." He replied, "Speak!"
\p
\v 13 The woman said, "Why have you done this bad thing to God's people? You have not allowed your son Absalom to return home. By saying what you have just said, you have certainly declared \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* that what you have done is wrong.
\v 14 We all die; we are like \f + \ft simile \f* water that cannot be picked up after it is spilled on the ground. \add After we die, we cannot become alive again\add*. Even God does not cause people who have died to become alive again. \add So Amnon cannot become alive again\add*. But God creates ways for those who have been exiled to be able to return to their homes.

\p
\v 12 Then the woman said, "Please let your servant speak a word to my master the king." And he said, "Speak on."
\v 13 So the woman said, "Why then have you devised such a thing against the people of God? For in speaking this word the king is like someone who is guilty, because the king has not brought back home again his banished son.
\v 14 For we all must die and are as water spilled on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again. But God does not take away life, rather he devises means to restore someone who has been banished so that he is no longer an outcast from him.
