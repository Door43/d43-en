===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **you, your**  - Here the king is addressing only the widow woman so these are singular.   See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]]
    * **may the king call to mind Yahweh your God**  - Here the widow woman in addressing only the king so this is also singular.   See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]]
    * **that they will not destroy my son**  - or "that they will not kill my son" or "that they will not execute my son"
    * **not one hair of your son will fall to the ground** - Here "one hair of your son" is [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]].  The idea is that not only will the son not be put to death but also that he will not even be hurt or physically punished.   The negative is used to greatly emphasize the kings authority on the matter (see: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
