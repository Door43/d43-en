===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **I am a widow, and my husband is dead ... One struck the other and killed him**  - Not every culture has a Social Security system to care for elderly.   In the absence of such a system widows depend upon their children.   Here an only child was guilty of a death-penalty crime which, if executed, would leave the widow mother with no financial support.  The context in verse 7 ([[:en:bible:notes:2sa:14:07]]) explains the other concern that her deceased husband's name ([[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] for her husband's descendants and inheritance) would come to an end.
