\v 15 Now, Your Majesty, I have come to you because others have threatened me. So I said to myself, 'I will do and talk to the king, and perhaps he will do what I request him to do.
\v 16 Perhaps he will listen to me, and save me from the man who is trying to kill my son. If my son is killed, it would result in us disappearing from the land that God gave to us.'
\p
\v 17 And I thought, 'What the king says will comfort\f + \ft Or: encourage \f* me, because the king is like \f + \ft simile \f* an angel of God. He knows what is good and what is evil.' I pray\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that Yahweh our God will be with\f + \ft Or: direct \f* you."

\v 15 Now then, seeing that I have come to speak this thing to my master the king, it is because the people have made me afraid. So your servant said to herself, 'I will now speak to the king. It may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.
\v 16 For the king will listen to me, in order to hand over his servant out of the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together, out of the inheritance of God.'
\v 17 Then your servant prayed, 'Yahweh, please let the word of my master the king give me relief, for as an angel of God, so is my master the king in telling good from evil.' May Yahweh your God be with you."
