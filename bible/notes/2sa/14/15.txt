====== 2 Samuel 14:15-17 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 Now, Your Majesty, I have come to you because others have threatened me. So I said to myself, 'I will do and talk to the king, and perhaps he will do what I request him to do.
\v 16 Perhaps he will listen to me, and save me from the man who is trying to kill my son. If my son is killed, it would result in us disappearing from the land that God gave to us.'
\p
\v 17 And I thought, 'What the king says will comfort\f + \ft Or: encourage \f* me, because the king is like \f + \ft simile \f* an angel of God. He knows what is good and what is evil.' I pray\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that Yahweh our God will be with\f + \ft Or: direct \f* you."

\v 15 Now therefore seeing that I am come to speak this word to my lord the king, it is because the people have made me
afraid: and your handmaid said, I will now speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.
\v 16 For the king will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out
of the inheritance of God.
\v 17 Then your handmaid said, Let, I pray thee, the word of my lord the king be comfortable; for as an angel of God, so is my
lord the king to discern good and bad: and Jehovah your God be with thee.
