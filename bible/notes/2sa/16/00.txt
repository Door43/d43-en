====== 2 Samuel 16 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===


== Absalom seeks advice from David's advisers ==
David's best adviser, Ahithophel, told Absalom to publicly seduce the concubines that David had left to take care of the palace. Because the concubines were the king's property, having sexual relations with a kings concubines implied that Absalom was now the king. This would show the people that the breach with David was complete. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])


=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===
== Simile ==
To show how seriously people took Ahithophel's advise, the author used a [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|simile]] comparing his advise to God's advise. "Now the advice of Ahithophel that he gave in those days was as if a man heard from the mouth of God himself."
