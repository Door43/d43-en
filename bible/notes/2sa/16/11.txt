\v 11 Then David said to Abishai and to all his officials, "You know that my own son is trying to kill me. So \add it is not surprising that\add* this man from the tribe of Benjamin is also trying to kill me. So ignore him, and allow him to curse me, because \add perhaps he thinks that\add* Yahweh told him to do that.
\v 12 Perhaps Yahweh will see that I am having all this trouble, and \add some day he will repay me by\add* blessing\f + \ft Or: doing good things for \f* me in return for this man cursing me today."

\v 11 So David said to Abishai and to all his servants, "Look, my son, who was born from my body, wants to take my life. How much more may this Benjamite now desire my ruin? Leave him alone and let him curse, for Yahweh has commanded him to do it.
\v 12 Perhaps Yahweh will look at the misery unleashed on me, and repay me with good for his cursing me today."
