\v 11 Then David said to Abishai and to all his officials, "You know that my own son is trying to kill me. So \add it is not surprising that\add* this man from the tribe of Benjamin is also trying to kill me. So ignore him, and allow him to curse me, because \add perhaps he thinks that\add* Yahweh told him to do that.

\v 11 So David said to Abishai and to all his servants, "Look, my son, who was born from my body, seeks my life. How
much more may this Benjamite now desire my ruin? Leave him alone and let him curse, for Yahweh has commanded him to do it.
\v 12 Perhaps Yahweh will look my misery unleashed on me, and repay me with good for his cursing me today."

  * [[:en:obe:other:servant]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:body]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **him alone and let him curse, for Yahweh has commanded him to do it** - Since Yahweh was with David, it is unlikely that Yahweh ordained for this Benjamite to curse David.   The idea here is that David is yielding his judgment in the event that per-chance Yahweh might have ordained he curse David (or at least that the Benjamite believed that Yahweh ordained he curse David).   Other versions are using "if" instead of "for".
