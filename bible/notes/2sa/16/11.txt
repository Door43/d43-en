\v 11 So David said to Abishai and to all his servants, "Look, my son, who was born from my body, wants to take my life. How much more may this Benjamite now desire my ruin? Leave him alone and let him curse, for Yahweh has commanded him to do it.
\v 12 Perhaps Yahweh will look at the misery unleashed on me, and repay me with good for his cursing me today."
