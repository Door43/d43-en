\v 22 So they set up a tent for Absalom on the roof \add of the palace\add*. And Absalom went into the tent and had sex \f + \ft euphemism \f* with his father's slave wives, \add one by one\add*, and everyone \f + \ft hyperbole \f* could see \add him going into the tent\add*.
\p
\v 23 In those days, people accepted what Ahithophel recommended as though he was speaking the words of God. So just as David had always accepted what Ahithophel said, now Absalom did also.

\v 22 So they spread for Absalom a tent on the top of the palace, and Absalom slept with his father's slave wives in the sight of all Israel.
\v 23 Now the advice of Ahithophel that he gave in those days was as if a man heard from the mouth of God himself. That was how all of Ahithophel's advice was viewed by both David and Absalom.
