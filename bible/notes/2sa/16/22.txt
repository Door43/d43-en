<usfm>
\v 22 So they set up a tent for Absalom on the roof \add of the palace\add*. And Absalom went into the tent and had sex \f + \ft euphemism \f* with his father's slave wives, \add one by one\add*, and everyone \f + \ft hyperbole \f* could see \add him going into the tent\add*.
\p
\v 23 In those days, people accepted what Ahithophel recommended as though he was speaking the words of God. So just as David had always accepted what Ahithophel said, now Absalom did also.

\v 22 So they spread for Absalom a tent on the top of the palace, and Absalom slept with his father's slave wives in the sight of all Israel.
\v 23 Now the advice of Ahithophel that he gave in those days was as if a man heard from the mouth of God himself. That was how all of Ahithophel's advice was viewed by both David and Absalom.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **spread** - "set up"
  * **in the sight of all Israel** - This means that people were able to see the tent and Absalom walking in and out of the tent with the women. The phrase "all of Israel" is a generalization, for only people near the palace could see it. AT: "where the Israelites could see him go into the tent" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]]) 
  * **Now the advice of Ahithophel ... was as if a man heard** - Here the author compare how much people trusted Ahithophel's advice with how much they would trust advice directly from God. AT: "Now people trusted the advice of Ahithophel in those days in the same way they would have trusted it if had come" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **a man heard it from the mouth of God himself** - Here God's mouth represents himself and emphasizes his speech. AT: "as if God had said it with his own mouth" or "a man hear it spoken by God himself" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_rpronouns]])
  * **viewed** - "understood" or "accepted"
