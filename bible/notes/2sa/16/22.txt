\v 22 So they spread for Absalom a tent on the top of the palace, and Absalom slept with his father’s slave wives in the sight of all Israel.
\v 23 Now the advice of Ahithophel that he gave in those days, was as if a man heard from the mouth of God himself. That was how all of Ahithophel's advice was viewed by both David and Absalom.
