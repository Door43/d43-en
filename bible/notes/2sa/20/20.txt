\v 20 Job replied, "I would certainly never want to ruin or destroy your town!
\v 21 That is not what we want to do. But Bichri's son Sheba, a man from the hilly area in the tribe of Ephraim, is rebelling against King David. Put this man into our hands, and then we will go away from\f + \ft Or: not attack \f* this town."
\p The woman replied to Joab, "Okay, what we will do is, we will \add cut off\add* his head and throw it over the wall to you."

\v 20 And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.
\v 21 The matter is not so: but a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted up his hand
against the king, even against David; deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said to Joab, Behold,
his head shall be thrown to you over the wall.
\v 22 Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it
out to Joab. And he blew the trumpet, and they were dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to
Jerusalem to the king.
