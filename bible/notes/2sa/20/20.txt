\v 20 Job replied, "I would certainly never want to ruin or destroy your town!
\v 21 That is not what we want to do. But Bichri's son Sheba, a man from the hilly area in the tribe of Ephraim, is rebelling against King David. Put this man into our hands, and then we will go away from\f + \ft Or: not attack \f* this town."
\p The woman replied to Joab, "Okay, what we will do is, we will \add cut off\add* his head and throw it over the wall to you."

\v 22 Then this wise woman went to the elders of the town and told them what she had said to Joab. So they cut off Sheba's head and threw it over the wall to Joab. Then Joab blew his trumpet \add to signal that the battle was ended\add*, and all his soldiers left the town and returned to their homes. And Joab returned to Jerusalem and told the king \add what had happened\add*.

\v 20 So Joab answered and said, "Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.
\v 21 That is not true. But a man from the hill country of Ephraim, named Sheba the son of Bichri, has lifted up his hand against the king, against the king David. Give up him alone, and I will withdraw from the city." The woman said to Joab, "His head will be thrown to you over the wall."
\v 22 Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom. They cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. Then he blew the trumpet and Joab's men left the city, every man to his home. And Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.
