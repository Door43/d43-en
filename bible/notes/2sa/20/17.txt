\v 17 So Joab came near to her, and the woman said, "Are you Joab?" He  answered, "I am." Then she said to him, "Listen to the words of your servant." He answered, "I am listening." 
\v 18 Then she spoke, "They used to say in old times, 'Surely seek advice at Abel,' and that advice would end the matter.
\v 19 We are a city that is one of the most peaceful and faithful in Israel. You are trying to destroy a city that is a mother in Israel.  Why do you want to swallow up the inheritance of Yahweh?"
