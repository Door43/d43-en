\v 6 So David said to Abishai, "Now Sheba son of Bikri will do us more harm than Absalom did. Take your master's servants, my soldiers, and pursue after him, or he will find fortified cities and escape out of our sight."
\v 7 Then Joab's men went out after him, along with the Kerethites and the Pelethites and all the mighty warriors. They left Jerusalem to pursue Sheba son of Bikri.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Abishai** - This is another commander of David's army. See how you translated his name in [[:en:bible:notes:2sa:02:18|2:18]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **do us more harm** - "hurt us more"
  * **your master's servants, my soldiers** - The phrase "my soldiers" clarifies which "servants." David refers to himself as "your master" as a formal way of speaking to someone with less authority.
  * **pursue after** - "chase after"
  * **he will find fortified cities** - This means that Sheba and his men will enter these cities to hide from David's army. The word "he" represents Sheba but refers to both him and his men. AT: "he and his men will hide in fortified cities" or "he and his men will take refuge in fortified cities" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **out of our sight** - Here David refers to his army by their sight to emphasize that Sheba and his men would be hidden and David's army would be unable to capture them. AT: "from us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Kerethites ... Pelethites** - These are the names of people groups who helped to protect King David. Translate these the same as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:2sa:08:15|8:18]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
