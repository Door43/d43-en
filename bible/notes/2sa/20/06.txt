    * **Abishai** - This is another commander of David's army. See how you translated his name in [[en:bible:notes:2sa:02:18|2:18]].
    * **do us harm** - "hurt us"
    * **your master's servants, my soldiers** - The phrase "my soldiers" clarifies which "servants." David refers to himself as "your master" as a formal way of speaking to someone with less authority. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
    * **pursue after**  - "seek after" or "chase after"
    * **he will find fortified cities and escape out of our sight**  - "he will get away from us and find protection in a strong city"
    * **Cherethites, Pelethites** - These are the names of people-groups who helped to protect King David. See how you translated these in  [[en:bible:notes:2sa:08:15|8:18]].
