\v 6 So David said to Abishai, "Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than did Absalom did. Take your master’s servants, my soldiers, and pursue after him, or he will find fortified cities and escape out of our sight."
\v 7 Then Joab's men went out after him, along with the Cherethites and the Pelethites and all the mighty warriors. They left Jerusalem to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.

===== Translation Notes: =====  

  * **Abishai** - This is another commander of David's army. See how you translated his name in [[:en:bible:notes:2sa:02:18|2:18]].
  * **do us more harm** - "hurt us more"
  * **your master's servants, my soldiers** - The phrase "my soldiers" clarifies which "servants." David refers to himself as "your master" as a formal way of speaking to someone with less authority. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **pursue after** - "seek after" or "chase after"
  * **he will find fortified cities and escape out of our sight** - "he will get away from us and find protection in a strong city"
  * **Cherethites, Pelethites** - These are the names of people-groups who helped to protect King David. See how you translated these in  [[:en:bible:notes:2sa:08:15|8:18]].
