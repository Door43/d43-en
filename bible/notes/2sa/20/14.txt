\v 14 Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel of Beth Maacah, and through all the land of the Bikrites, who gathered together and also pursued Sheba.
\v 15 They caught up with him and besieged him in Abel of Beth Maacah. They built up a siege ramp against the city against the wall. All the army who were with Joab battered the wall to knock it down.
\v 16 Then a wise woman cried out of the city, "Listen, please listen, Joab! Come near me so I may speak with
you."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Sheba passed through** - Here "Sheba" refers to both him and his army. AT: "Sheba and his army" or "Sheba and his men" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Abel of Beth Maacah** - "Abel Beth Maacah." Both names refer to the same place and may be combined. It is a city near the tribe of Dan. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **of the Bikrites** - This is the name of a people group. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **also pursued Sheba** - "also followed Sheba"
  * **They caught up with him** - "Joab and the soldiers caught up with him"
  * **against the city against the wall** - "against the city wall"
  * **battered the wall to knock it down** - This means that they used a battering ram to knock down the wall. A battering ram was a cut tree or large log with a sharpened end or an end covered in metal. It was held by several men who would pound the end against a wall. AT: "used a battering ram to knock down the wall" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Listen, please listen** - The repetition of "Listen" strengthens the woman's plea.
