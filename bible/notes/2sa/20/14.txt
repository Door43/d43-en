\v 14 Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, to Beth Maacah, and through all the land of the Berites, who gathered together and also pursued Sheba.
\v 15 They caught up with him and besieged him in Abel of Beth Maacah.  They built up a siege ramp against the city against the wall. All the army who were with Joab battered the wall to knock it down.

you."
