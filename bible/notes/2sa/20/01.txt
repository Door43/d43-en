\v 1 There also happened to be at the same place a troublemaker whose name was Sheba son of Bikri, a Benjamite. He blew the trumpet and said, "We have no part in David, neither have we any inheritance in the son of Jesse. Let every man go back to his home, Israel."
\v 2 So all the men of Israel deserted David and followed Sheba son of Bikri. But the men of Judah followed closely their king, from the Jordan all the way to Jerusalem.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **to be at the same place** - This refers to the town of Gilgal.
  * **Sheba ... Bichri** - These are names of men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **We have no part in David, neither have we any inheritance in the son of Jesse** - Both of these statements mean the same thing. Sheba is emphasizing that he and the tribes of Israel have no relationship with David. AT: "The inheritance of David and his father's family does not belong to us" or "We are not a part of David and his father's family" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]))
