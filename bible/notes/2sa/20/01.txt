\v 1 There also happened to be at the same place a trouble maker whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite. He blew the
trumpet and said, "We have no part in David, neither have we any inheritance in the son of Jesse. Let every man go back to his home,  Israel."
\v 2 So all the men of Israel deserted David and followed Sheba the son of Bichri. But the men of Judah followed closely their king, from the Jordan all the way to Jerusalem.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **to be at the same place** - This refers to the town of Gilgal.
    * **Sheba...Bichri** - These are names of men. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
    * **We have no part in David, neither have we any inheritance in the son of Jesse** - Both of these statements mean the same thing. Sheba is emphasizing that he and the tribes of Israel have no relationship with David and the tribe of Judah. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **Let every man go back to his home, Israel** - Sheba is speaking to the people of the northern tribes of Israel. This does not include the southern tribe of Judah.
