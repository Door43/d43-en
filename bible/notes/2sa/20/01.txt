\v 1 There also happened to be at the same place a trouble maker whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite. He blew the
trumpet and said, "We have no part in David, neither have we any inheritance in the son of Jesse. Let every man go back to his home,  Israel."
\v 2 So all the men of Israel deserted David and followed Sheba the son of Bichri. But the men of Judah followed closely their king, from the Jordan all the way to Jerusalem.
