\v 11 Then one of Joab's men stood by Amasa, and the man  said, "He who favors Joab, and he who is for David, let him follow Joab."
\v 12 Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the middle of the road. When the man saw that all the people stood still,
he carried Amasa off of the road and into a field. He threw a garment over him because he saw that everyone who came by him stood still.
\v 13 After Amasa was taken off the road, all the men followed on after Joab in pursuit of Sheba the son of Bichri.
