\v 13 If he escapes into some city, all our soldiers will bring ropes and pull that city down into the valley. As a result, not one stone will be left there \add on top of the hill where that city was\add*!"

\v 14 Absalom and all the other Israelite men \add who were with him\add* said, "What Hushai suggests is better than what Ahithophel suggested." The reason that happened was that Yahweh had determined that if they would accept the good advice that Ahithophel had given them, \add they would have been able to defeat\f + \ft Or: kill \f* David\add*. But \add as a result of their doing what Hushai suggested\add*, Yahweh would cause a disaster to happen to Absalom.

\v 13 If he retreats into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city and we will drag it into the river, until there is no longer even a small stone found there."
\v 14 Then Absalom and the men of Israel said, "Hushai the Arkite's advice is better than Ahithophel's." Yahweh had ordained the rejection of Ahithophel's good advice in order to bring destruction on Absalom.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **then all Israel** - This refers to Israel's soldiers, not to all of Israel. AT: "then all of our soldiers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **will bring ropes to that city and we will drag it into the river** - This means that the soldiers would tear down the city walls and drag the pieces to river. AT: "will destroy the city and drag the stones to the river with ropes" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **until there is no longer even a small stone found there** - This is an exaggeration to describe how completely they will destroy the city. The would not literally sweep away every small stone from the city. AT: "until the city is completely destroyed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **Hushai the Archite** - Translate this man's name the same as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:2sa:15:32|15:32]]. Archite is the name of a people group.
  * **Ahithophel** - Translate this man's name the same as you did in  [[:en:bible:notes:2sa:15:11|15:12]].
  * **the rejection of Ahithophel's good advice** - The word "rejection" can be expressed with the verb "reject." AT: "for the men of Israel to reject Ahithophel's good advice" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **to bring destruction on Absalom** - To "bring" something on someone means to cause it to happen to them. AT: "to cause a disaster to happen to Absalom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
