\v 13 If he escapes into some city, all our soldiers will bring ropes and pull that city down into the valley. As a result, not one stone will be left there \add on top of the hill where that city was\add*!"

\v 14 Absalom and all the other Israelite men \add who were with him\add* said, "What Hushai suggests is better than what Ahithophel suggested."

\v 13 If he retreats into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city and we will drag it into the river, until there is no longer even a small stone found there."
\v 14 Then Absalom and the men of Israel said, "Hushai the Archite's advice is better than Ahithophel's." Yahweh had ordained the rejection of Ahithophel's good advice in order to bring destruction on Absalom.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **then all Israel will bring ropes to that city and we will drag it into the river, until there is no longer even a small stone found there**  - This statement of Hushai uses the anger of Absalom's men against David to cause them to accept Hushai's advice. AT: "We will totally destroy any city where David hides." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
    * **Hushai the Archite**  - See how you translated this man's name in [[:en/bible/notes/2sa/15/32|2 Samuel 15:32]]. Archite is the name of a people group.
    * **Ahithophel** - See how you translated this man's name in [[:en/bible/notes/2sa/15/11|2 Samuel 15:12]].
    * **ordained** - "planned"
