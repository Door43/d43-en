\v 13 If he retreats into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city and we will drag it into the river, until there is no longer even a small stone found there."
\v 14 So Absalom and the men of Israel said, "The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel." Yahweh had ordained the  defeat of the good counsel of Ahithophel so that Yahweh might bring destruction upon Absalom.
