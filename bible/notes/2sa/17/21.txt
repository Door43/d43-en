\v 21 It came about after they had left that Jonathan and Ahimaaz came up out of the well. They went to report to King David; they said to him, "Get up and cross quickly over the water because Ahithophel has given such and such advice about you."
\v 22 Then David arose and all the people who were with him, and they crossed over the Jordan. By morning daylight not one of them had failed to cross over the Jordan.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **It came about** - "It happened"
    * **Jonathan and Ahimaaz**  - See how you translated these men's names in [[:en/bible/notes/2sa/15/27|2 Samuel 15:27]].
    * **cross quickly over the water** - Here "the water" refers to the Jordan River. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **has given such and such advice** - This refers to what Ahithophel advised Absalom, which is recorded in [[:en/bible/notes/2sa/17/01|2 Samuel 17:1-3]]. So, the writer does not repeat that here. AT: "has advised that Absalom send him to attack you now." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])  
    * **By morning daylight not one of them had failed to cross over the Jordan**  - AT: "By morning daylight they had all crossed the Jordan."  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
