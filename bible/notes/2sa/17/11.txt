\v 11 So what I suggest is that you summon all the Israelite soldiers, from Dan \add in the far north\add* to Beersheba \add in the far south\add*. They will be as many as the grains of sand on the seashore \f + \ft hyperbole \f*. And then you yourself lead us into the battle.
\v 12 We will find \add your father\add*, wherever he is, and we will attack him \add from all sides\add*, like \f + \ft simile \f* dew covers all the ground. And neither he nor any of the soldiers who are with him will survive.

\v 11 But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together to thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that is by the sea
for multitude; and that you go to battle in your own person.
\v 12 So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falls on the
ground; and of him and of all the men that are with him we will not leave so much as one.
