===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 So what I suggest is that you summon all the Israelite soldiers, from Dan \add in the far north\add* to Beersheba \add in the far south\add*. They will be as many as the grains of sand on the seashore \f + \ft hyperbole \f*. And then you yourself lead us into the battle.
\v 12 We will find \add your father\add*, wherever he is, and we will attack him \add from all sides\add*, like \f + \ft simile \f* dew covers all the ground. And neither he nor any of the soldiers who are with him will survive.

\v 11 So what I suggest is that you call all the Israelite soldiers, from Dan in the far north to Beersheba in the far south. They will be as many as the grains of sand on the seashore. Wait until they come, and then you yourself should lead us into the battle.
\v 12 We will find your father, wherever he is, and we will attack him from all sides, as dew covers all the ground. And neither he nor any of the soldiers who are with him will survive.

\v 11 So I advise you that all Israel should be gathered together to you, from Dan to Beersheba, as numerous as the sands that are by the sea, and that you go to battle in person.
\v 12 Then we will come on him wherever he may be found, and we will cover him as the dew falls on the ground. We will not leave even one of his men, or him himself, alive.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **that all Israel should be gathered together to you** - This can be stated in active form. Also, here "all Israel" represents only the Israelite soldiers. AT: "that you should gather together all of the Israelite soldiers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **from Dan to Beersheba** - This phrase means from the northern border of Israel to the southern border. AT: "from the whole nation of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **as numerous as the sands that are by the sea** - This is an exaggeration where all the grains of sand on a beach are compared to the number of Israelite soldiers. AT: "so many that they can barely be counted" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]]) 
  * **that you go to battle in person** - The phrase "in person" means to go yourself and not send someone else instead. AT: "then lead them yourself into battle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **come on him** - This means to purposefully go to where he is and then to attack. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **we will cover him as the dew falls on the ground** - Absalom's army is described as covering David's army like the dew covers the ground in the morning. AT: "we will overwhelm and completely defeat David's army" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **dew** - the fog or misty cloud of water that can fall onto the ground during the night, covering the ground and leaving it wet in the morning
  * **We will not leave even one of his men ... alive** - This negative sentence is used for emphasis and can be stated in a positive form. AT: "We will kill every one of his men" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]]) 
  * **him himself** - Both these words refer to David. AT: "David himself" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_rpronouns]])
