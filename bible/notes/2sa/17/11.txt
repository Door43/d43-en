<usfm>
\v 11 So what I suggest is that you summon all the Israelite soldiers, from Dan \add in the far north\add* to Beersheba \add in the far south\add*. They will be as many as the grains of sand on the seashore \f + \ft hyperbole \f*. And then you yourself lead us into the battle.
\v 12 We will find \add your father\add*, wherever he is, and we will attack him \add from all sides\add*, like \f + \ft simile \f* dew covers all the ground. And neither he nor any of the soldiers who are with him will survive.

\v 11 So what I suggest is that you call  all the Israelite soldiers, from Dan in the far north to Beersheba in the far south. They will be as many as the grains of sand on the seashore. Wait until they come, and then you yourself should lead us into the battle.
\v 12 We will find your father, wherever he is, and we will attack him from all sides, as dew covers all the ground. And neither he nor any of the soldiers who are with him will survive.

\v 11 So I advise you that all Israel should be gathered together to you, from Dan to Beersheba, as numerous as the sands that are by the sea, and that you go to battle in person.
\v 12 Then we will come on him wherever he may be found, and we will cover him as the dew falls on the ground. We will not leave even one of his men, or him himself, alive.

    * **we will cover him as the dew falls on the ground** - Absalom's army is described as covering David's army like the dew covers the ground in the morning. AT: "we will completely defeat David's army." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
