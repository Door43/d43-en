\v 1 Then Ahithophel said to Absalom, "Allow me to choose 12,000 men, and I will leave \add with them\add* tonight to pursue David.
\v 2 We will attack him while he is tired and discouraged, and cause him to be very frightened. All the soldiers who are with him will run away. We will kill only the king.
\v 3 Then we will bring back all his soldiers to you, like \f + \ft simile \f* a bride\f + \ft Or: woman comes to her husband when she is married \f*. You are wanting to kill only one man; so the other people will not be harmed."
\v 4 Absalom and all the Israelite leaders \add who were with him\add* thought that what Ahithophel said would be good to do.

\v 1 Then Ahithophel said to Absalom, "Allow me to choose twelve thousand men, and I will take them tonight to go after David.
\v 2 We will attack him while he is tired and discouraged, and make him very afraid. Everyone with him will run away. We only need to kill the king.
\v 3 Then we will bring back all his soldiers to you, and they will come happily. You need to kill only one man—David, and then all trouble will be over."
\v 4 Absalom and all the Israelite leaders who were with him thought that what Ahithophel said would be good to do.

\v 1 Then Ahithophel said to Absalom, "Now let me choose twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue David tonight.
\v 2 I will come on him while he is weary and weak and will surprise him with fear. The people who are with him will flee, and I will attack only the king.
\v 3 I will bring back all the people to you, like a bride coming to her husband, and all the people will be at peace under you."
\v 4 What Ahithophel said pleased Absalom and all the elders of Israel.
