\v 8 You know that your father and the men who are with him are strong soldiers, and that now they are very angry, like \f + \ft simile \f* a mother bear whose cubs have been stolen from her. Furthermore, your father knows how to fight because he has fought in many battles. He will not stay with his troops during the night.
\v 9 Right now he is probably already hiding in one of the pits, or in some other place. \add If his soldiers start to attack your soldiers, and\add* if they kill some of them, whoever hears about that will say 'Many of the soldiers with Absalom have been killed!'
\v 10 Then your other soldiers, even if they are as fearless [SIM, IDI] as lions, they will become very afraid. Do not forget that everyone in Israel knows that your father is a great\f + \ft Or: strong \f* soldier, and that the soldiers who are with him are also very brave\f + \ft Or: courageous \f*.

Furthermore, your father knows how to wage war because he has fought in many battles. He will not stay with his troops during the night.
\v 9 Right now he is probably already hiding in one of the pits, or in some other place. If his soldiers start to attack your soldiers, and if they kill some of them, whoever hears about that will say, 'Many of the soldiers with Absalom have been killed!'
\v 10 Then your other soldiers, even if they are as fearless as lions, they will become very afraid. Do not forget that everyone in Israel knows that your father is a great soldier, and that the soldiers who are with him are also very brave.

\v 8 Hushai added, "You know your father and his men are strong warriors, and that they are bitter, and they are like a bear robbed of her cubs in a field. Your father is a man of war; he will not sleep with the army tonight.
\v 9 Look, right now he is probably hidden in some pit or in some other place. It will happen that when some of your men have been killed at the beginning of an attack, that whoever hears it will say, 'A slaughter has taken place among the soldiers who follow Absalom.'
\v 10 Then even the bravest soldiers, whose hearts are like the heart of a lion, will be afraid because all Israel knows that your
father is a mighty man, and that the men who are with him are very strong.
