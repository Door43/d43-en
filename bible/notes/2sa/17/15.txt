\v 15 Then Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, "Ahithophel advised Absalom and the elders of  Israel in such and such a way, but I have advised something else. 
\v 16 Now then, go quickly and report to David; say to him, 'Do not camp tonight at the fords of the Arabah, but by all means cross over, or the king will be swallowed up along with all the people who are with him.' "

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Hushai...Zadok...Abiathar...Ahithophel...Absalom** - These are the name of men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]) See how you translated Zadok and Abiathar in [[:en/bible/notes/2sa/15/24|2 Samuel 15:24-25]].
  * **in such and such a way** - This phrase refers to what Ahithophel advised Absalom, which has already been recorded in [[:en/bible/notes/2sa/17/01|2 Samuel 17:1-3]]. So, the writer does not repeat that here. AT: (do not translate this phrase) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])  
  * **the fords of the Arabah** - A ford is a shallow part of a river where people can walk across. The Arabah is the land along both sides of the Jordan river.
  * **by all means** - "it is very important to" 
  * **the king will be swallowed up** - Swallowed up refers here to the king being killed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
