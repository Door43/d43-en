\v 17 Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at the spring of Rogel, and a female servant used to go and relay messages to them, and then they went and told king David so that they would not be seen coming into the city.
\v 18 But a young man saw them and told Absalom. So they both went away quickly and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his courtyard, and they went down into the well.
