\v 24 David and his soldiers arrived at Mahanaim. At the same time, Absalom and all his soldiers also crossed the Jordan River.
\v 25 Now Absalom had appointed his cousin Amasa to be the commander of his army, instead of Joab. Amasa, son of Jether, an Ishmaelite \f + \ft There is a question whether the word describing Jether should be "Ishmaelite" as we have chosen, or "Israelite" which is found in the Hebrew text, and which some scholars believe is a scribal error. "Ishmaelite" is found in a parallel passage (see 1CH 2:17, in Hebrew) and in other ancient translations of 2SA 17:25, and so it is included here. \f*.

\v 24 Then David came to Mahanaim. As for Absalom, he crossed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.
\v 25 Then Absalom set Amasa over the army instead of Joab. Amasa was the son of Jether the Ishmaelite \f + \ft Scholars disagree about whether the word describing Jether should be "Ishmaelite" as it is in some ancient Greek versions, or "Israelite" as it is in the ancient Hebrew text. Some scholars believe that "Israelite" is a scribal error in the Hebrew. "Ishmaelite" is the word used in a parallel passage (see 1CH 2:17), in both the ancient Hebrew and Greek texts.  You may want to choose the word that is used in the majority language Bible in your area. \f*, who had slept with Abigail, who was the daughter of Nahash and sister of Zeruiah, the mother of Joab.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Mahanaim ... Gilead** - These are the names of places. See how you translated them in [[:en:bible:notes:2sa:02:08|2:8-9]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Absalom ... Amasa ... Joab ... Jether ... Nahash** - These are the names of men. See how you translated Joab and Zeruiah (Joab's mother) in [[:en:bible:notes:2sa:02:12|2:13]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Ishmaelite** - Some versions say "Ishmaelite" following the parallel passage (1CH 2:17) which has "Ishmaelite" as do many other ancient versions, which we are following. The Masoretic text has "Israelite" but this appears to many scholars to be a scribal error.
  * **Abigail ... Zeruiah** - These are the names of women. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
