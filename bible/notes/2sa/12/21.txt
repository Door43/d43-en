\v 21 Then his servants said to him, "We do not understand why you have done this! While the baby was still alive, you cried for him and refused to eat anything. But now that the baby has died, you are not crying anymore. You got up and ate some food!"
\p
\v 22 He replied, "While the baby was still alive I fasted and cried. I thought, 'Perhaps Yahweh will act mercifully toward me and not allow the baby to die.'
\v 23 But now the baby is dead. So there is no reason for me to fast anymore. I cannot bring him back to myself. Some day I will go to where he is, but he will not return to me."

\v 21 Then his servants said to him, "Why have you done this? You fasted  and wept for the child while he was alive, but when the child died, you got up and ate."
\v 22 David answered, "While the child was still alive I fasted and wept. I said, 'Who knows whether or not Yahweh will be gracious to me, that the child may live?'
\v 23 But now he is dead, so why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me."
