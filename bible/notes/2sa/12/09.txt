\v 9 Therefore why have you despised the word of Yahweh to do that which is evil in his sight? You have killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword and have taken his wife to be your wife, and you have slain him with the sword of the army of Ammon.
\v 10 Now therefore the sword will never depart from your house, because you have despised me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.'
