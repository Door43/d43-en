\v 9 So why have you despised my commandment \add about not committing adultery\add*? You have done what I consider to be very evil! You have arranged for Uriah to be killed in a battle by the Ammon people-group's soldiers, and you have taken his wife to be your wife!
\v 10 You have despised me, and have taken Uriah's wife to be your wife. So for many generations some of your descendants will die violently. \f + \ft metonymy, personification \f*

<usfm>
\v 9 So why have you rejected what I have commanded, when I said that my people must not commit adultery? You have done what I consider to be very evil! You have arranged for Uriah to  die in battle with the Ammonites, and you have taken his wife to be your wife!
\v 10 You have rejected me, because you took Uriah's wife to be your wife. So some of your descendants will always die in battle.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 So why have you despised the commands of Yahweh, so as to do what is evil in his sight? You have killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword and have taken his wife to be your own wife. You killed him with the sword of the army of Ammon.
\v 10 So now the sword will never leave your house, because you have despised me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite as your wife.'
