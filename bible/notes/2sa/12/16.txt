\v 16 David therefore implored God for the boy. David fasted and went inside and lay all night on the floor.
\v 17 The elders of his house arose and stood beside him, to raise him up from the floor, but he would not get up, and he would not eat with them.
\v 18 So it came about on the seventh day that the child died. The servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, "Look,  while the child was still alive we spoke to him, and he did not listen to our voice. What might he do to himself if we tell him that the boy is dead?!"
