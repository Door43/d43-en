\v 4 A traveller came to the rich man, but the rich man would not take an animal from his own flocks and herds  to provide food for the traveller. Instead he took the poor man’s ewe lamb and cooked it for the traveller who came to him."
\v 5 David was hot with anger against the rich man, and he raged to Nathan, "As Yahweh lives, the man who has done this deserves to be put to death, 
\v 6 and he must restore the lamb fourfold because he did such a thing, and because he had no pity."
