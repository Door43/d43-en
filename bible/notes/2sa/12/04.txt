\v 4 One day a visitor came to see the rich man. The rich man did not want to take one of his own animals and kill it to prepare a meal for his guest. So instead, he sent men to take the poor man's lamb; then he had someone kill it and prepare a meal with it for his guest."
\p
\v 5 When David heard that, he was very angry. He said to Nathan, "I solemnly declare that the man who did that should be executed!
\v 6 He should at least pay back to the poor man four lambs for doing this, and for not having pity on the poor man."

\v 4 One day a visitor came to the rich man, but the rich man was unwilling to take an animal from his own flocks and herds to provide food for him. Instead he took the poor man's ewe lamb and cooked it for his visitor."
\v 5 David was hot with anger against the rich man, and he raged to Nathan, "As Yahweh lives, the man who has done this deserves to be put to death.
\v 6 He must pay back the lamb four times over because he did such a thing, and because he had no pity on the poor man."
