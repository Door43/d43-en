\v 1 Then Yahweh sent Nathan to David. He came to him and said, "There were once two men in a city. One man was rich and the other poor.
\v 2 The rich man had huge numbers of flocks and herds, 
\v 3 but the poor man had nothing except one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and fed and raised. It grew up together with him and with his children. The lamb even ate with him and drank from his own cup, and it slept in his arms and was like a daughter to him.
