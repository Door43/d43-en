\v 26 Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.
\v 27 And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah; yea, I have taken the city of waters.
\v 28 Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it; lest I take the city, and
it be called after my name.
