\v 26 Meanwhile, Joab's soldiers attacked Rabbah, the capital city of the Ammon people group. They captured the king's fortress, which protected the water supply.
\v 27 Then Joab sent messengers to David to tell him this, "My troops are attacking Rabbah, and we have captured the city's water supply.
\v 28 Now gather your troops and come and surround the city and capture it. If you do not do that, my troops will capture the city and it will then be named for me instead: the City of Joab."

\v 26 Now Joab fought against Rabbah, the royal city of the people of Ammon, and he captured its fortress. 
\v 27 So Joab sent messengers to David and said, "I have fought against Rabbah, and I have taken the city's water supply.
\v 28 Now therefore gather the rest of the army together and camp against the city and take it, because if I take the city, it will be named after me."
