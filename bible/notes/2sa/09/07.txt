===== translationNotes: =====

  * **for Jonathan your father's sake** - "because I loved your father, Jonathan"
  * **you will always eat at my table** - Here "my table" represents being together with David or in his presence. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **What is your servant, that you should look with favor on such a dead dog as I am?** - This rhetorical question shows that Mephibosheth understands his place. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "I am like a dead dog. I do not deserve for you to be kind to me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **such a dead dog** - Here Mephibosheth represents the line of Saul, and he compares himself to a "dead dog." Dogs were feral animals, not cared for, and of little importance. A dead dog would be considered even less important. AT: "such a person like me who is worthless as a dead dog" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
