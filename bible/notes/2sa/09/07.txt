===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **you will always eat at my table**  - Here the "my table" refers to being together with or in David's presence. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]]) 
  * **What is your servant, that you should look with favor on such a dead dog as I am?** - This question is asked to show Mephibosheth understands his place. AT: "I am of no importance at all." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **such a dead dog**  - Here the Mephibosheth represents the line of Saul, and compares himself to a "dead dog." Dogs were all feral and while alive were of little importance and were not directly cared for. So, a dead dog would have even less importance. AT: "I am like a dead dog"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
