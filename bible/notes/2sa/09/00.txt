====== 2 Samuel 09 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter is another interruption to the story of David's expanding. David is concerned with fulfilling his oath to Jonathan's descendants.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== David's vow ==
David determined to fulfill his vow to Jonathan to care for Jonathan's descendants. He asked around and found Jonathan's son and told him he would treat him as if he was one of his sons. He restored all of Saul's property to him and had him eat every day at his table. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:fulfill]] and [[:en:obe:kt:vow]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical question and Metaphor ==
Jonathan's son expressed his surprise and feeling of unworthiness with a rhetorical question: "What is your servant, that you should look with favor on such a dead dog as I am?" and by a metaphor comparing himself  to "a dead dog." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
