===== Important Terms: =====

  * [[:en:obe:other:servant]]
  * master, [[:en:obe:kt:lord]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:king]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:command]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:life]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **you**  and **your**  - All of the occurrences of these words refer only to the king since Ziba is directly addressing David as king. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you|Forms of You]])
  * **he always ate at the king’s table, though he was lame in both his feet**  - Usually a lame person would eat in their wheelchair or wherever most convenient. David, however, went to extra lengths to make Mephibosheth feel like part of the family, so he could sit with him and spend time with him.
