\v 20 Benaiah from Kabzeel was the son of Jehoiada; he was a strong man who did mighty feats. He killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down into a pit and killed a lion while it was snowing.
\v 21 And he killed a very large Egyptian man. The  Egyptian had a spear in his hand, but Benaiah fought against him with only a staff. He wrested the spear out of the Egyptian's hand and then killed him with his own spear.
