===== Translation Notes: =====
This continues David's last words.

  * **Indeed, is my family not like this before God?** - David uses a question to emphasize that his family does fear God and God is pleased with them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Has he not made...fulfill my every desire** - David uses these questions to emphasize that God has certainly done all these things.
  * **Ordered and sure** - This means God's covenant will not change and David's family can trust it.
  * **Does he not increase my salvation and fulfill** - "Does he not keep me safe and fulfill." AT: "He certainly keeps me safe and fulfills"
