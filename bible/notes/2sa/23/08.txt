\v 8 These are the names of David's elite soldiers: Jeshbaal the Hachmonite was the leader of the elite soldiers. He killed eight hundred men on one occasion.
\f + \ft Instead of "Jeshbaal," some versions have "Josheb Basshebah," "Jashobeam," "Ishbaal," or Ishbosheth." These all are probably forms of the same name. \f*

  * **Jeshbaal** - This is the name of a man. Other versions read Josheb Basshebeth, Jashobeam, Ishbaal, or Ishbosheth because various ancient copies have these variations. Translators may choose to say this in a footnote to their translation (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Hachmonite** - This is the name of a people group. AT: "the Tahchemonite" or "son of Hachmon"
  * **eight hundred** - "800" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
