\v 9 After him was Eleazar son of Dodo, son of an Ahohite, one of the three mighty men of David. He was present when they defied the Philistines who had gathered together to do battle, and when the men of Israel had retreated.
\v 10 Eleazar stood and fought the Philistines until his hand became weary and his hand stiffened to the grip of his sword. Yahweh brought about a great victory that day. The army returned after Eleazar, only to strip the bodies.
