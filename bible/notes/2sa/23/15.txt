\v 15 \add One day\add* David very much wanted \add some water\add* to drink, and said "I wish that someone would bring me some water from the well near the gate at Bethlehem!"
\v 16 So his three greatest warriors forced through the camp of Philistia soldiers and drew some water from the well, and brought it to David. But he would not drink it. Instead, he poured it out \add on the ground\add* to be an offering to Yahweh.
\v 17 He said, "Yahweh, it would certainly not be right for me to drink this water! That would be like \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* drinking the blood of these men who were willing\f + \ft Or: ready \f* to die for me!" So he refused to drink it.
\p That was one of the things that those three great warriors did.

\v 15 David was longing for water and said, "If only someone would give me water to drink from the well at Bethlehem, the well that is by the gate!"
\v 16 So these three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, the well at the gate. They took the water and brought it to David, but he refused to drink it. Instead, he poured it out to Yahweh.
\v 17 Then he said, "Far be it far from me, Yahweh, that I should drink this. Should I drink the blood of men who have risked their lives?" So he refused to drink it. 
\p These are things the three mighty men did.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **broke through the army** - "fought their through the enemy army"
  * **Should I drink the blood of men who have risked their lives?** - David uses a question for emphasis. He compares the water to blood because the men risked their lives to bring the water to him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
