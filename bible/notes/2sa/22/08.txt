===== Translation Notes: =====
David's song to Yahweh continues. He uses parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **Then the earth shook...were ignited by it** - This is Yahweh's response to David's cry for help from his enemies. David uses the imagery of the earth shaking and fire coming from Yahweh to emphasize Yahweh's terrible anger. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and were shaken, because God was angry** - "because God's anger shook them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Coals were ignited by it** - It was like if God's anger was heat, it would cause coals to ignite and burn."The flame from his mouth set coals on fire" or "He also sent burning coals from his mouth"
