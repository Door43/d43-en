===== Translation Notes: =====
David's song to Yahweh continues. He uses parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **From the lightning before him...ligtning bolts and dispersed them** - David continues describing Yahweh, who is coming to save him from his enemies, as a storm. This emphasizes God's power and anger towards David's enemies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **From the lightning before him coals of fire fell** - "Out of his bright light he sent burning coals" or "From his brightness he sent lightning"
  * **He shot arrows...lightning bolts** - David compares the lightning from Yahweh's storm to arrows that a soldier would use.
