===== Translation Notes: =====
This continues David's song to Yahweh. He uses parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **out of the surging water** - David compares his enemies to a flood that threatens to drown him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **He rescued me from my strong enemy** - David's enemies were overwhelming. He praises God for delivering him from all his enemies.
