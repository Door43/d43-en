===== Translation Notes: =====
David's song to Yahweh continues. He uses parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **He opened the heavens...rain clouds in the skies** - David describes Yahweh's approach to save David from his enemies as a storm cloud gathering over a place. This emphasizes God's power and his anger. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **He was seen flying on the wings of the wind** - AT: "He appeared and he soared through the wind" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
    * **And he made darkness a tent around him** - AT: "And he hid himself in the darkness"
