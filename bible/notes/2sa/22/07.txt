===== Translation Notes: =====
David's song to Yahweh continues. He uses parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])


    * **In my distress** - "In my great trouble"
    * **he heard my voice from his temple** - David is referring to the heavenly temple where Yahweh dwells. The earthly temple has not yet been built.
    * **my call for help went into his ears** - AT: "he heard my prayer for help" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
