===== Translation Notes: =====
David's song to Yahweh continues. He uses parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **For the waves of death surrounded me. The rushing waters of worthlessness overwhelmed me** - David compares the wicked men who wanted to kill him to flood waters that are about to drown him. David felt helpless against the power of his enemies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **The rushing waters of worthlessness** - This is a picture of fast flowing flood waters that destroy everything in it's path.
  * **The cords of sheol surrounded me; the snares of death trapped me** - David speaks about death and Sheol as if they are people who are trying to trap him as a hunter traps an animal. David thought he was certainly going to die. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
