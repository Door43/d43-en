===== Translation Notes: =====
This continues David's song to Yahweh. He uses parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **They came against me on the day of my distress** - "My enemies fought against me when I was in great trouble"
  * **But Yahweh was my support** - "But Yahweh supported me" or "But Yahweh helped me"
  * **a wide open place** - This refers to a place where there was no danger and his enemies could not trap him.
  * **to the measure of the cleanness of my hands** - Here "cleanness of my hands" means the same as "righteousness." AT: "because I obey his commands" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
