===== Translation Notes: =====
David's song to Yahweh starts. He uses parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])


  * **out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul** - This is a progression from enemies in general to one specific enemy of David, King Saul.
  * **out of the hand** - AT: "out of the power" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Yahweh is my rock, my fortress** - This is a part-whole progression. A Fortress is built of many large rocks. This means Yahweh has the strength to protect his people from harm. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
