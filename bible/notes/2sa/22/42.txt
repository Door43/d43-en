===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - David continues his song to Yahweh.

  * **They cried** - "My enemies cried"
  * **they cried out to Yahweh, but he did not answer them** - The time for Yahweh's judgment had come upon them.
  * **like dust on the ground ... like mud in the streets** - This means that David completely destroyed his enemies. These two phrases "like dust on the ground" and "like mud on the streets" have a similar meaning and are used for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
