===== Translation Notes: =====
David continues his song to Yahweh.

  * **I can run over a barricade** - Here "barricade" may refer to a group of soldiers or to a stone wall. Either way it means God enables David to defeat his enemies.
  * **The word of Yahweh is pure** - "Everything Yahweh says is true"
  * **He is a shield** - This emphasizes God's power to protect his people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
