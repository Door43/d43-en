===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - David continues his song to Yahweh.

  * **He makes my feet swift like a deer and places me on the high hills** - Here David's feet are compared to those of a deer using exaggeration. Yahweh gives David the strength to move quickly and provides secure places for protection and rest. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **my hands ... and my arms** - Both of these refer to David. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **to bend a bow of bronze** - Only a very strong man could use a bow made from metal.
