David's song to Yahweh continues. He uses parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **God is my rock...He is my shield, the horn of my salvation, my stronghold** - All of these are symbols of God's strength and power. They emphasize God's ability to protect and save his people. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **who is worthy to be praised** - AT: "who is worthy to receive praise" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
    * **I will be saved from my enemies** - AT: "He will save me from my enemies"
