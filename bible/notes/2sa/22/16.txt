===== Translation Notes: =====
This continues David's song to Yahweh. He uses parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **Then the water channels appeared...breath of his nostrils** - Again, David emphasizes Yahweh's power and anger. When Yahweh shouted in his attack against David's enemies, its power uncovered the deepest parts of the ocean and the earth. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
