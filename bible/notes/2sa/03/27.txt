===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the middle of the gate** - This refers to one of the gates in the city wall at Hebron. As the UDB makes implies, city gates were constructed as part of buildings set into the city walls. Inside the passageway were doors leading to side rooms, where guests could be received and business and judicial proceedings could be conducted. It was probably into one of these side rooms that Abner was murdered. 
  * **blood of Asahel** - This phrase refers to the life of Asahel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Asahel** - This is the name of a male person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
