From the beginning I have been loyal to Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends. And I have kept David's army from defeating you. So now why are you criticizing me about what I have done with some woman?

\v 8 Then Abner was very angry at the words of Ishbosheth and said, "Am I a dog’s head that belongs to Judah? Today I am showing faithfulness to the house of Saul, your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, by not handing you over into the hand of David. And yet you accuse me about this woman today?
