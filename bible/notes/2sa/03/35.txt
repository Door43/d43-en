===== translationNotes: =====

  * **All the people came** - This deliberate exaggeration is used to show that the nation of Israel wanted to take care of David in his grief. AT: "Many people came" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **May God do so to me, and more also, if** - This is the form of a solemn vow in that time. David is asking God to judge him severely if he eats anything before sunset. Your language many have a way of expressing vows. AT: "I am asking God to punish me if"
