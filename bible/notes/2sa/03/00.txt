====== 2 Samuel 03 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter records the first attempt to end the civil war.

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations, songs and poems. The ULB and many other English translations indent all the lines of 3:33-34, which is part of a song.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

David never wanted to hurt Saul's family. Isbosheth criticized Abner and Abner became angry. He decided to help David become king of all of Israel. He came and made a treaty with David. As he left, Joab arrived and told him he wanted to talk to him and he murdered Abner. David was very unhappy that Abner had been killed.
