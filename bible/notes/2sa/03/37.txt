\v 37 So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not the king's desire to kill Abner the son of Ner.
\v 38 The king said to his servants, "Do you know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?
\v 39 And I am weak today, though I am an anointed king. These men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too brutal for me. May Yahweh repay the evildoer, by punishing him for his wickedness, as he deserves."

  * **Ner, Zeruiah**  - These are a male names. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])
  * ** brutal ** - AT: "without mercy"
