\v 17 Then David sung this funeral song over Saul and over Jonathan his son,
\v 18 and said to [them] to teach the Song of the Bow to the sons of Judah. Behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):
\q
\v 19 "Your glory, O Israel, is slain upon your high places!
\q How have the mighty fallen!
\q
\v 20 Do not tell it in Gath,
\q Do not proclaim it in the streets of Ashkelon;
\q Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,
\q Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph."
