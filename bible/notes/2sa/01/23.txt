===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **they were not separated** - AT: "they were together" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
  * **They were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.** - Saul and Jonathan were powerful warriors. ( See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **who clothed you in scarlet delicately, who put ornaments of gold on your garments.** - "who made it so you could have nicer clothes and wear jewelry." These two phrases share similar meanings that focus on making a woman look pretty. This is how David describes King Saul's achievements for Israel. AT: "who made your lives better." (See:[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
