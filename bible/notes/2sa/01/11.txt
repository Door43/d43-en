===== translationNotes: =====

  * **David tore his clothes ... the men with him did the same** - David and his men tore their clothes as a sign of mourning for the death of King Saul. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **had fallen** - This here means "had been killed." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **by the sword** - The sword here is associated with battle. AT: "in combat" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Where are you from?** - The man had already stated that he is an Amalekite in [[:en:bible:notes:2sa:01:08|1:8]]. David apparently asks the man to confirm this because of the serious judgment that David was going to pronounce on the man.
