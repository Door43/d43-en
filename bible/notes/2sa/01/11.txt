===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **David tore his clothes** - David tore his clothes as a sign of mourning the death of King Saul.
  * **the people of Yahweh, and for the house of Israel ** - These two phrases are very similar. They are emphasizing that all of Israel was being mourned.  
  * **fallen by the sword ** - This is a more polite way to say that many people died in battle. The phrase "by the sword" here means "combat." The word "fallen" means "died."  AT: "died in combat"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
