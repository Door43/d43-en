\v 8 He said to me, 'Who are you?' I answered him, 'I am an Amalekite.'
\v 9 He said to me, 'Please stand over me and kill me, for great suffering has taken hold of me, but life is still in me.'
\v 10 So I stood over him and killed him, because I knew that he would not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown that was on his head and the band that was on his arm, and brought them here to you, my master."
