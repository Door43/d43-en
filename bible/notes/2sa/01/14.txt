\v 14 David asked him, "Why were you not afraid that you would be punished if you killed Saul, whom Yahweh made king?
\v 15-16 You yourself said, 'I killed the man whom Yahweh appointed to be the king.' So you have made yourself guilty; you deserve to die!" Then David summoned one of his soldiers and said to him, "Kill him!" So the soldier killed him.

\v 14 David said to him, "Why were you not afraid to kill Yahweh's anointed king with your own hand?"
\v 15 David called one of the young men and said, "Go and kill him." So that man went and struck him down, and the Amalekite died.
\v 16 Then David said to the dead Amalekite, "Your blood is on your head because your own mouth has testified against you and said, 'I have killed Yahweh's anointed king.'"
