\v 21 I hope there will be no rain or dew ever again on the mountains of Gilboa
\q1 and that no grain will grow in the fields there,
\q2 because it was there that the shield of Saul, the mighty king, fell to the ground.
\q1 Now there is no one to rub olive oil on Saul's shield.
\q1
\v 22 Jonathan's arrows were his servants who always pierced his enemies and drew their blood.
\q2 and Saul's sword was his servant who always struck his enemies.

\q
\v 21 Mountains of Gilboa,
\q2 Let there not be dew or rain 
on you, 
\q2 nor fields giving grain for offerings, 
\q For there the shield of the mighty was defiled.
\q2 The shield of Saul is no longer  anointed with oil.
\q
\v 22 From the blood of those who have been killed, 
\q2 from the bodies of the mighty,
\q The bow of Jonathan did not turn back,
\q And the sword of Saul did not return empty.
