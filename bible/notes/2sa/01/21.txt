\v 21 I hope there will be no rain or dew ever again on the mountains of Gilboa
\q1 and that no grain will grow in the fields there,
\q2 because it was there that the shield of Saul, the mighty king, fell to the ground.
\q1 Now there is no one to rub olive oil on Saul's shield.
\q1
\v 22 Jonathan's arrows were his servants who always pierced his enemies and drew their blood.
\q2 and Saul's sword was his servant who always struck his enemies.

\q
\v 21 Mountains of Gilboa,
\q2 let there not be dew or rain on you, 
\q2 nor fields giving grain for offerings, 
\q for there the shield of the mighty was defiled.
\q2 The shield of Saul is no longer anointed with oil.
\q
\v 22 From the blood of those who have been killed, 
\q2 from the bodies of the mighty,
\q the bow of Jonathan did not turn back,
\q and the sword of Saul did not return empty.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Mountains of Gilboa** - The "Mountains of Gilboa" are addressed here as if they were people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **let there not be dew or rain on you** - David curses the ground where King Saul died in the battle. This was out of reverence for Saul, who was God's anointed king.
  * **the shield of the mighty was defiled** - The "mighty" here refers to Saul. The shield was defiled because it fell on the ground, and because the king's blood was shed on it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **The shield of Saul is no longer anointed with oil** - Saul's shield was made of leather. To care for the shield, it was rubbed with oil. AT: "No one will care for Saul's shield anymore"
  * **From the blood of those who have been killed, from the bodies of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan did not turn back, and the sword of Saul did not return empty** - Saul and Jonathan are shown here to have been fierce and valiant warriors. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) 
  * **the sword of Saul did not return empty** - Saul killed many enemies with his sword before he was killed in battle.
