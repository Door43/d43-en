\v 21 Mountains of Gilboa,
\q2 Let there not be dew or rain 
upon you, 
\q2 nor fields of offerings, 
\q For there the shield of the mighty was defiled,
\q2 The shield of Saul is no longer  anointed with oil.
\q
\v 22 From the blood of the slain, 
\q2 from the fat of the mighty,
\q The bow of Jonathan did not turn back,
\q And the sword of Saul did not return empty.
