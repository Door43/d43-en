\p When those messengers arrived in the land of Ammon,
\v 3 the Ammonite leaders said to Hanun, "Do you think that it is to honor your father that King David has sent these men to say that he is sorry that you father died? We think that he has sent them here to look around the city to determine how his army can conquer us!"

\p
\v 1 It came about later that the king of the people of Ammon died, and that Hanun his son became king in his place.
\v 2 David said, "I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness to me." So David sent his servants to comfort Hanun concerning his father. His servants entered the land of the people of Ammon.
\v 3 But the leaders of the people of Ammon said to Hanun their master, "Do you really think that David is honoring your father because he has sent men to comfort you? Has not David sent his servants to you to look at the city, to spy it out, in order to overthrow it?"
