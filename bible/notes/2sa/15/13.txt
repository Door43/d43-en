\v 13 A messenger came to David saying, "The hearts of the men of Israel are following after Absalom."
\v 14 So David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, "Arise and let us flee, or none of us will escape from Absalom. Prepare to leave immediately, or he will quickly overtake us, and he will bring down disaster on us and attack the city with the edge of the sword."
