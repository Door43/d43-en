    * **And will you not have there with you Zadok and Abiathar the priests?**  - This question is asked to show that Hushai the Archite will not be alone. AT: "Zadok and Abiathar the priests will be there." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]}
    * **So whatever you hear in the king’s palace, you must tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.**  - This is why David wanted Hushai to remain behind, so he could be a spy and pass information along through the priests.
    * **Ahimaaz... Jonathan** - These are the names of men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
    * **You must send to me by their hand ** - AT: "The sons will tell me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
