===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Will you not have there with you Zadok and Abiathar the priests?** - David asks this rhetorical question to tell Hushai that he will not be alone. This can be written as a statement. AT: "Zadok and Abiathar the priests will be there to help you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **whatever you hear ... anything that you hear** - This is a generalization. It means all of the important and insightful things that he hears, not every single word he hears. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **Ahimaaz ... Jonathan** - These are the names of men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **by their hand** - The phrase "their hand" refers to the sons and means that they were to serve as messengers. AT: "their sons to tell me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
