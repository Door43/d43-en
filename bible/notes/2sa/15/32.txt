\v 33 David said to him, "If you go with me, you will not be able to help me.
\v 34 But if you return to the city, \add you can help me by\add* saying to Absalom, 'Your Majesty, I will serve you as faithfully as I served your father.' If you do that \add and stay near Absalom\add*, you will be able to oppose any advice that Ahithophel gives to Absalom.

\v 32 When they arrived at the top of the hill, where there was a place where the people had previously been accustomed to worship God, suddenly Hushai, from the Arki people group, met David. He had torn his clothes and put dirt on his head to show that he was very sad.
\v 33 David said to him, "If you go with me, you will not be able to help me.
\v 34 But if you return to the city, you can help me by saying to Absalom, 'Your Majesty, I will serve you as faithfully as I served your father.' If you do that and stay near Absalom, you will be able to oppose any advice that Ahithophel gives to Absalom.

\v 32 It came about that when David arrived at the top of the road, where God used to be worshiped, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn and earth on his head.
\v 33 David said to him, "If you travel with me, then you will be a burden to me. 
\v 34 But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, 'I will be your servant, king, as I have been your father's servant in time past, so will I now be your servant,' then you will confuse Ahithophel's advice for me.
