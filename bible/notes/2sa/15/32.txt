\v 33 David said to him, "If you go with me, you will not be able to help me.
\v 34 But if you return to the city, \add you can help me by\add* saying to Absalom, 'Your Majesty, I will serve you as faithfully as I served your father.' If you do that \add and stay near Absalom\add*, you will be able to oppose any advice that Ahithophel gives to Absalom.

\v 32 And it came about that when David arrived at the top of the
road, where God used to be worshipped, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn and dirt upon his head.
\v 33 David said to him, "If you travel with me, then you will be a burden to me, 
\v 34 but if you return to the city and say to Absalom, 'I will be your servant, O king, as I have been your father’s servant in time past, so will I now be your servant,' then you will confuse the counsel of Ahithophel for me.
