\v 21 But Ittai answered the king and said, "As Yahweh lives, and as my master the king lives, surely in whatever place where my master the king goes, there also will your servant go, whether that means living or dying." 
\v 22 So David said to Ittai, "Go ahead and continue with us."  So Ittai the Gittite marched with the king, along with all his men and all the families who were with him.
\v 23 All the country wept with a loud voice as all the people passed by over the Kidron Valley, and as the king also himself crossed over. All the people traveled on the road toward the wilderness.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **As Yahweh lives, and as my master the king lives** - He is making a solemn promise. "I solemnly promise" 
    * **whether that means living or dying** - "even if I get killed supporting you"
    * **All the country wept with a loud voice ** - This deliberate exaggeration is used to emphasize the concern for King David. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
    * **Kidron Valley**  - The name of a place just outside of Jerusalem. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
