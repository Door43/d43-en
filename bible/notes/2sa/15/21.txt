\v 21 But Ittai answered the king and said, "As Yahweh lives, and as my master the king lives, surely in whatever place where my master the king goes, even there also will your servant go, whether that means living or dying." 
\v 22 So David said to Ittai, "Go ahead and continue with us."  And Ittai the Gittite marched with the king, along with all his men and all the families who were with him.
