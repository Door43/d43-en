\v 24 And even Zadok with all the Levites, carrying the ark of the covenant of God, were present. They set the ark of God down, and then Abiathar joined them. They waited until all the people had passed by out of the city.
\v 25 The king said to Zadok, "Carry the ark of God bacl into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of Yahweh, he
will bring me back here and show me the ark and his dwelling place again.
\v 26 But if he says, 'I am not pleased with you,' look, here am I, let him do to me whatever seems good to him."
