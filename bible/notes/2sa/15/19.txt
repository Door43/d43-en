\v 19 Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, "Why will you come with us? Return and stay with the king, for you are a foreigner and an exile. Return to your own place.
\v 20 Since you just left yesterday, why should I make you wander all over with us? I do not even know where I am going. So return and take your fellow countrymen back. May loyalty and faithfulness go with you."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Ittai** - This is the name of a man. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Gittite** - Translate the name of this people group the same as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:2sa:06:10|6:10]].
  * **Why will you come with us?** - This rhetorical question indicates that the king does not think they should go along with him. This question can be written as a statement. AT: "You do not need to go with us." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **why should I make you wander all over with us?** - This rhetorical question emphasizes David did not want Ittai to come. This question can be translated as a statement. AT: "I do not want to cause you to wander around with us." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Since you just left yesterday** - Here "yesterday" is an exaggeration that emphasizes a short amount of time. Ittai the Gittite had lived there for several years. AT: "Since you have lived here only a short time" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **May loyalty and faithfulness go with you** - This is a blessing that David is giving to him. AT: "May Yahweh be faithful and loyal to you always" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
