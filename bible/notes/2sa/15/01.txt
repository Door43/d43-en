\v 1 It came about after this that Absalom prepared a chariot and horses for himself, with fifty men to run before him.
\v 2 Absalom rose up early and stood beside the road leading to the city gate. So when any man had a dispute which should come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called to him and said, "From what city have you come?" And the man would answer, "Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel."
