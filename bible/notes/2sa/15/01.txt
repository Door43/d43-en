\v 1 It came about after this that Absalom prepared a chariot and horses for himself, with fifty men to run before him.
\v 2 Absalom would get up early and stand beside the road leading to the city gate. When any man had a dispute to come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called to him and said, "From what city have you come?" And the man would answer, "Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel."
