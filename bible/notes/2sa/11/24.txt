\v 24 And their shooters shot at your soldiers from off the wall, and some of the king's servants were killed, and your servant Uriah the Hittite was killed too."

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **king's servants** - Here "servants" refers to soldiers, not slaves, since soldiers were servants of the king.
    * **the sword devours one** - This phrase has the "sword" eating like a person. AT: "the sword kills one person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
