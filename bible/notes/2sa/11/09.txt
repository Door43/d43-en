\v 9 But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.
\v 10 And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down to his house, David said to Uriah, Are you not come from a
journey? wherefore did you not go down to your house?
\v 11 And Uriah said to David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in booths; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my
lord, are encamped in the open field; shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as you
livest, and as your soul liveth, I will not do this thing.
