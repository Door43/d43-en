\v 9 But Uriah slept at the door of the kingâ€™s palace with all the servants of his master, and he did not go down to his house.
\v 10 When they told David, "Uriah did not go down to his house," David said to Uriah, "Have you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?"
\v 11 Uriah answered David, "The ark, and Israel and Judah are staying in tents, and my master Joab and my master's servants are camped in an open field. How then can I go into my house to eat and to drink and to sleep with my wife? As sure as you are alive, I will not do this."

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **Have you not come from a journey?**  - David is seeking to convince Uriah to go home (to his wife). Both David and Uriah knew that Uriah had just come from a journey. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **How then can I go into my house to eat and to drink and to sleep with my wife?**  -  Uriah asks this question because he felt it would not be right or respectful for him as a soldier to go home when the army is in danger.
    * **As sure as you are alive, I will not do this.** - Uriah swears a strong promise that he will not enjoy his wife when many other men in Israel are at war to defend Israel and cannot enjoy their wives.
