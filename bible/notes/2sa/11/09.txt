\v 9 But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s palace with all the servants of his master, and he did not go down to his house.
\v 10 When they had told David, "Uriah did not go down to his house," David said to Uriah, "Have you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?"
\v 11 Uriah answered David, "The ark, and Israel and Judah are staying in tents, and my master Joab and my master's servants are camped in an open field. How then can I go into my house to eat and to drink and to sleep with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this."
