=== What is the Book of 2 Samuel about? ===

This book is about David's rule as king over Israel. At first he rule over the tribe of Judah for seven years. Then the other eleven tribes agreed for him to become their king as well, and he ruled over all Israel for thirty-three years. 

Throughout this time, David fought foreign enemies who attacked Israel. His most difficult struggle, however, was against someone in his own family, when his son Absalom rebelled against him (See: 2 Samuel 13-19).

Besides telling about David's struggles and victories, the Book of 2 Samuel tells about how David committed adultery with Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah the Hittite. David went further into sin by arranging for the death of her husband. David's moral failure led to great suffering for himself and all Israel. 

However, the writer also presents the divine grace and love that David repeatedly experienced when he turned to God in repentance.

=== How should the title of this book be translated? ===
Like the Book of 1 Samuel, this book has a very vague meaning at best. Translators should use the same kind of title as they gave to that book, perhaps "The Second Book about Samuel, Saul, and David." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])

=== What was the purpose of the Book of 2 Samuel? ===
The Book of 2 Samuel is a continuation of 1 Samuel. The writer continues in this book with the same purposes in mind, telling how Israel developed into a unified nation under its first kings. It seems clear that the writer also wanted to defend David's right to rule in the place of Saul. This theme implies that the northern tribes had no right to rebel against the descendants of David, the king whom Yahweh had chosen to rule. It is likely that the author wrote at a time when the nation of Israel was in a civil war, and that he supported the kingdom of Judah.

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== What covenant has its beginning in the Book of 2 Samuel? ===
2 Samuel 7 records how Yahweh made a covenant, in which he promised to make descendants of David rule forever over Israel. This covenant is viewed by Christians as being fulfilled by Jesus Christ, who in his human nature is a descendant of David. In this way, Jesus Christ is the ultimate "anointed one," the person chosen by God to be king forever. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:covenant]])

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== Why does the book refer to someone being addressed indirectly? ===
David frequently refers to himself as "your servant" when he speaks to King Saul. He also calls Saul "my master." This type of indirect reference can be difficult to translate. It is intended to show submissiveness to the one addressed. English sometimes uses the address "sir" or "ma'am" in this way.

=== Can I translate this book before 2 Samuel? === 
1 Samuel should be translated before 2 Samuel, since it is a continuation of that book.

=== How is the name "Israel" used in the Bible? ===
The name "Israel" is used in many different ways in the Bible. The descendants of Jacob, who was also named Israel, were a people group who became known as Israel. This people group developed into the unified nation of Israel. After the civil war in the nation of Israel, the tribes in the north took the name Israel, while the southern kingdom became known as the Kingdom of Judah. 2 Samuel speaks of both the northern kingdom of Israel and the whole nation of Israel as "Israel." This can cause confusion because the civil war has not begun at this point in the history of Israel (see 2 Samuel 2:10; 3:10; 5:5; 11:11; 12:8; 19:4-,42,43; 21:2; 24:1).
