\v 21 And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshing floor of thee,
to build an altar to Jehovah, that the plague may be stayed from the people.
\v 22 And Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him: behold, the oxen for the
burnt-offering, and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood:
\v 23 all this, O king, does Araunah give to the king. And Araunah said to the king, Jehovah your God accept thee.
