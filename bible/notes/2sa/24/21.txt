\v 21 Then Araunah said, "Why has my master the king come to me, his servant?" David replied, "To buy your threshing floor, so I can build an altar for Yahweh, so that the plague may be removed from the people."
\v 22 Araunah said to David, "Take it as your own, my master the king. Do with it what  is good in your sight. Look, here are oxen for the burnt offering and threshing sledges and ox yokes for the wood.
\v 23 All this, my king, I, Araunah, will give to you." Then he said to the king, "May Yahweh your God accept you."
