===== translationNotes: =====
  * **I have sinned, and I have acted perversely** - These phrases mean the same thing and are combined for emphasis. AT: "I have sinned terribly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **But these sheep, what have they done?** - David uses a question and compares the people to sheep to emphasize that they have done nothing wrong. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "These ordinary people have done nothing wrong." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Please let your hand punish me** - Here the metonym "hand" refers to power. AT: "Please punish me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
