\v 24 But the king said to Araunah, "No, I will \add not take these things as a gift\add*. I will pay you for it. I will not offer sacrifices that have cost me nothing, and offer them to Yahweh to be completely burned on the altar." So he paid fifty pieces of silver to Araunah for the oxen and the ground.

\v 25 Then David built an altar to Yahweh, and he offered \add the oxen\add* to be completely burned on the altar, and he also offered sacrifices to restore fellowship with Yahweh. Then, Yahweh answered David's prayers, and he caused the plague in Israel to end.

\v 24 The king said to Araunah, "No, I insist on buying it at a price. I will not offer as a burnt offering to Yahweh anything that costs me nothing." So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
\v 25 David built an altar for Yahweh there and offered on it burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. So they pleaded with Yahweh on behalf of the land, and he caused the plague to be contained throughout Israel.
