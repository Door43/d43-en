\v 24 The king said to Araunah, "No, I insist on buying it at a price. I will not offer as a burnt offering to Yahweh anything that costs me nothing." So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
\v 25 David built an altar for Yahweh there and offered on it burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. So Yahweh was pleaded with for the land, and the plague in Israel was stopped.
