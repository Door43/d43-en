\v 13 So Gad went to David and said to him, "Will three years of famine come to you in your land? Or will you flee three months from your enemies while they pursue you? Or will there be three days of plague in your land? Now decide what answer I should return to him who sent me."
\v 14 Then David said to Gad, "I am in deep trouble. Let us fall into Yahweh's hands rather than into the hands of people, for his merciful actions are very great."
