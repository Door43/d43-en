\v 9 And Absalom chanced to meet the servants of David. And Absalom was riding upon his mule, and the mule went under the thick
boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between heaven and earth; and the mule that was
under him went on.
\v 10 And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.
\v 11 And Joab said to the man that told him, And, behold, you saw it, and why did you not strike him there to the
ground? and I would have given you ten pieces of silver, and a girdle.
