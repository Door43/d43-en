\v 28 Then Ahimaaz called out and said to the king, "All is well." And he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground and said, "Blessed be Yahweh your God, who has handed over the men who lifted up their hand against my master the king."
\v 29 So the king replied, "Is it well with the young man Absalom?" Ahimaaz answered, "When Joab sent me, the king’s servant, to you, king, I saw a great disturbance, but I did not know what it was."
\v 30 Then the king said, "Turn aside and stand here." So Ahimaaz turned aside, and stood still.
