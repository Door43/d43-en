\v 12 The man replied to Joab, "Even if you gave me a thousand pieces of silver, I would not have done anything to harm [IDI] the king's son. We all heard the king command you and Abishai and Ittai, 'For my sake, do not harm my son Absalom!'
\v 13 If I had disobeyed the king and killed Absalom, the king would have heard about it, because the king hears about everything, and even you would not have defended me!"

\v 12 The man replied to Joab, "Even if I received a thousand silver shekels, still I would not have reached out my hand against the king’s son, because we all heard the king command you, Abishai, and Ittai, saying, 'No one must touch the young man Absalom.'
\v 13 If I had risked my life by a falsehood (and there is nothing hidden from the king), you would have abandoned me."
