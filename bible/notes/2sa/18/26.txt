\v 26 Then the watchman noticed another man running, and the watchman called to the gatekeeper; he said, "Look, there is another man running alone." The king said, "He is also bringing news." 
\v 27 So the watchman said, "I think the running of the man in front is like the running of Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok." The king said, "He is a good man and is coming with good news."
