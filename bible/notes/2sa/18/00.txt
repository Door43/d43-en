== David's mercy ==
David reorganized his army and sent them out to battle but told them to be [[:en:obe:kt:mercy|merciful]] to Absalom. When David's army defeated Absalom's army, Absalom fled on a mule but his hair caught in a tree limb and the mule ran on leaving him hanging. One of David's soldiers saw him and told Joab. Joab went and killed him. When David heard about this he mourned for his son, Absalom.
