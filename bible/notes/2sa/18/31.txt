\v 31 Immediately then the Cushite arrived  and said, "There is good news for my master the king, for Yahweh has avenged you today from all who rose up against you."
\v 32 Then the king said to the Cushite, "Is it well with the young man Absalom?" The Cushite answered, "The enemies of my master the king, and all who rise up against you to do harm to you, should be as that young man is."
\v 33 Then the king was deeply unnerved, and he went up to the room over the gate and wept. As he went he grieved, "My son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! I wish I had died instead of you, Absalom, my son, my son!"
