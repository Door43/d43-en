\v 3 But his soldiers said, "No, we will not allow you to go with us. If they force us to all run away, they will not be concerned about that. Or if they kill half of us, they will also not be what they want. To them, \add capturing\add* you is more important than \add capturing\add* ten thousand of us. So it will be better that you \add stay here\add* in the city and send help to us."
\p
\v 4 The king replied to them, "Okay, I will do whatever seems best to you." So he stood at the gate \add and watched\add* while his soldiers marched out, group by group.

\v 3 But his soldiers said, "No, we will not allow you to go with us. If they force us to all run away, they will not be concerned about us. Or if they kill half of us, they will not care about that, either. To them, capturing you is more important than capturing ten thousand of us. So it would be better that you stay here in the city and send help to us."
\p
\v 4 The king replied to them, "Very well, I will do whatever seems best to you." So he stood at the city gate and watched while his soldiers marched out, group by group.

\v 3 But the men said, "You must not go to battle, for if we flee away they will not care about us, or if half of us die they not care. But you are worth ten thousand of us! Therefore it is better that you be ready to help us from the city."
\v 4 So the king answered them, "I will do whatever seems best to you." The king stood by the city gate, while all the army went out by hundreds and by thousands.
