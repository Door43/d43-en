\v 1 When Saul's son Ishbosheth heard that Abner had been killed at Hebron, he became very discouraged, and all the Israelite people with him.
\v 2 Ishbosheth had two officers who were leaders of groups of soldiers. They were brothers with the names of Baanah and Rechab; they were sons of Rimmon from the town of  Beeroth in the tribe of Benjamin. Now Beeroth is in the area that had been assigned to the tribe of Benjamin.
\v 3 But the original inhabitants of Beeroth had fled to the town of Gittaim, where they still live.

\v 1 When Ish Bosheth, Saul’s son, heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became weak, and all 
Israel was troubled.

\v 2 Now Saul’s son had two men who were captains of groups of soldiers. The name of one was Baanah 
and the other Rechab, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite of the people of Benjamin (for Beeroth is also considered part of Benjamin, 
\v 3 and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and have been living there until this very time).
