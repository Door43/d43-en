\v 1 And when Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became feeble, and all 
Israel was troubled.

\v 2 Now Saul’s son, had two men that were captains of bands. The name of one was Baanah,
and the name of the other Rechab, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin (for Beeroth is also considered part to Benjamin;
\v 3 and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have been sojourners there until this day).
