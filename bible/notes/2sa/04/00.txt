While the end of the civil war occurs in this chapter, David still only reigned over Judah (1-4).

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== David and Ishbosheth ==
David never sought revenge against Saul's family. When two men snuck into Ishbosheth's room, cut off his head and brought it to David, David had them killed for killing an innocent man. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:avenge]])


=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical questions ==
When two men brought Ishbosheth's head to David and expected to get a reward for it. David condemned them with the rhetorical question: "should I not now require his blood from your hand, and remove you from the earth?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]], [[:en:obe:kt:condemn]] and [[:en:obe:kt:reward]])
