\v 11 How much more, when wicked men have killed an  innocent person in his own house on his bed, should I not now require his blood from your hand, and remove you from the earth?"
\v 12 Then David gave orders to the young men, and they killed them and cut off their hands and feet and hung them up beside the pool at Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron.
