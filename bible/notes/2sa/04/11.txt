\v 11 So because you two evil men have murdered a man who did nothing wrong—and you killed him when he was sleeping on his bed in his own house, I will do something worse to you. I will surely get revenge on you two for murdering him, and wipe you off from the earth!"
\p
\v 12 Then David gave a command to his soldiers, and they killed the two men, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hung their bodies on a pole near the pool at Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth and buried it respectfully in the tomb of Abner, there at Hebron.

\v 11 How much more, when wicked men have killed an  innocent person in his own house on his bed, should I not now require his blood from your hand, and remove you from the earth?"
\v 12 Then David gave orders to the young men, and they killed them and cut off their hands and feet and hung them up beside the pool at Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron.

  * **require his blood from your hand** - Here the word "blood" refers to the life of Ishbosheth. The word "hand" refers to Rehab and Baanah. AT: "hold you responsible for his murder" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
