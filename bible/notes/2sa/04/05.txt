\v 5 So the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went and came during the heat of the day to the house of
Ish-bosheth, as he took his rest at noon.

\v 6 And they came there into the middle of the house, as if to fetch wheat; and they struck him in the
body. And Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.

\v 7 Now when they came into the house, as he was laying on his bed in his bedroom, they struck him and killed him. And took his head,
and took his head and went by the way of the Arabah all night.
