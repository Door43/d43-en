===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh finishes describing his promises to King David through the prophet, Nathan.

  * **But my covenant faithfulness will not leave him**  - Here "will not leave" uses to two negative statements to make a positive statement. AT: "my covenant faithfulness will remain with him."(See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes|Litotes]])
  * **Your house and kingdom will be confirmed forever before you. Your throne will be established forever.** - These two phrases have similar meanings and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
