===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh finishes describing his promises to King David through the prophet Nathan.

  * **But my covenant faithfulness will not leave him, as I took it from Saul** - The word "faithfulness" is an abstract noun that can be stated as "faithfully loving." AT: "I will never stop faithfully loving him as I stopped loving Saul" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **from before you. Your house ... before you. Your throne** - If in [[:en:bible:notes:2sa:07:08|7:8-9]] you translated the direct quotations as indirect quotation, then here you may need to translate "you" as "David" or "him" or "his" as in the UDB. AT: "from before David. David's house ... before him. His throne" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]]) 
  * **Your house and kingdom will be confirmed forever before you. Your throne will be established forever.** - These two sentences have similar meanings and emphasize that David's dynasty will last forever. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Your house and kingdom will be confirmed forever before you** - Here the word "house" represents David's descendants, who will rule as kings. Here "kingdom" means about the same thing as "house." This can also be stated in active form. AT: "You will live to see me establish your family and their rule over the people of Israel forever" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Your throne will be established forever** - Here "throne" represents the power to rule as king. AT: "I will cause your descendants to rule over Israel forever" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **all these words** - Here "words" represents what Yahweh said. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **he told him about the entire vision** - "he told him about everything Yahweh revealed to him"
