===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh finishes describing his promises to King David through the prophet, Nathan.

  * **But my covenant faithfulness will not leave him** - AT: "But my covenant faithfulness will certainly remain with him."(See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **Your house and kingdom will be confirmed forever before you. Your throne will be established forever.** - These two phrases have similar meanings and emphasize that David's dynasty will last forever. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Your house and kingdom will be confirmed** - Here the word "house" refers to David's descendants who will rule as king and means basically the same thing as "kingdom." AT: "I will confirm your house and kingdom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
