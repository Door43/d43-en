<usfm>
\v 10 I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them there, so that they may live in their own place and be troubled no more. No longer will wicked people oppress them, as they did before,
\v 11 as they were doing from the days that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. And I will give you rest from all
your enemies. Moreover, I, Yahweh, declare to you that I will make you a house.

===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues describing his promises to King David through the prophet, Nathan.

  * **appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them there**  - These two clauses have similar meanings and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **I will make you a house** - Here the word "house" refers to David's ancestors continuing on as the rulers of Israel. AT: "I will make you and your descendants the rulers of the nation of Israel." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
