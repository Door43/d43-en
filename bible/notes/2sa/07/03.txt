===== translationNotes: =====

  * **do what is in your heart** - Here "heart" represents the mind. AT: "do what you think you should" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **for Yahweh is with you** - Here "with you" means God is helping and blessing David. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **the word of Yahweh came to Nathan, saying,** - The idiom "the word of Yahweh came to" is used to introduce a special message from God. AT: "Yahweh gave a message to Nathan. He said," or "Yahweh spoke this message to Nathan:" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **saying, "Go and tell David my servant, 'This is what Yahweh says: Will you build me a house in which to live?** - This has quotations within quotations. It may be necessary to translate them as indirect quotation. AT: "saying, "Go and ask David if he thinks that he will be the one to build a house in which I will live." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotesinquotes]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **Will you build me a house in which to live?** - Yahweh uses a question to emphasize that David is not the one to build a house for Yahweh. This question can be translated as a statement. AT: "You will not build a house for me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **build me a house** - Here "house" means a temple. In 7:11 Yahweh will say that he will build a house for David. There "house" means a family. If your language has a word that can express both ideas, use it here and in 7:11.
