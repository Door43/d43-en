\v 18 Then David the king went in and sat before Yahweh; he said, "Who am I, Yahweh God, and what is my family that you have brought me to this point?
\v 19 And this was a small thing in your sight, Lord Yahweh. You have even spoken about your servant's family for a great while to come, and have shown me future generations, Lord Yahweh!
\v 20 What more can I, David, say to you? You have honored your servant, Lord Yahweh.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Who am I, Yahweh God, and what is my family that you have brought me to this point?** - David asks this question to express the deep emotion he felt from hearing Yahweh's proclamation.

  * **this was a small thing in your sight** - Here "your sight" represents what Yahweh considers something to be. AT: "this even seemed to you to be a small thing to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **your servant's family** - Here David refers to himself as "your servant." This can be stated in first person. AT: "my family" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **for a great while to come** - This speaks about time as if it were something that travels and arrives somewhere. AT: "and what will happen to them in the future" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **What more can I, David, say to you?** - David uses this question to emphasize that he has nothing left to say to Yahweh. AT: "There is nothing more I can say to you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
