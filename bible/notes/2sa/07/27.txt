\v 27 For you, Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house. That is why I, your servant, have found courage to pray to you.
\v 28 Now, Lord Yahweh, you are God, and your words are trustworthy, and you have made this good promise to your servant.
