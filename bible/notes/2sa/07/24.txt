\v 24 You established Israel as your own people forever, and you, Yahweh, became their God.
\v 25 So now, Yahweh God, may the promise that you made concerning your servant and his family be established forever. Do as you have spoken.
\v 26 May your name be forever great, so the people will say, 'Yahweh of hosts is the God of Israel,' while the house of me, David, your servant is established before you.
