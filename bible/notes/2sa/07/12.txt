===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues describing his promises to King David through the prophet, Nathan.

  * **When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers**  - These two clauses have similar meaning and are combined for emphasis. They are both a polite way to refer to death and dying. (See:[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism|Euphemism]])
  * **a house for my name** - Here "name" refers to Yahweh. AT: "a permanent dwelling for Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **I will be a father to him, and he will be my son**  - God will be like a father to David's prophesied son. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
