<usfm>
\v 7 The king did not put Saul's grandson Mephibosheth into their hands, because of what he and \add Mephibosheth's father\add* Jonathan had solemnly promised to each other.
\v 8 Instead, he took Armoni and another man named Mephibosheth, the two sons that Saul's slave wife Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, had given birth to, and the five sons that Saul's daughter Merab had given birth to. Merab's husband was Adriel the son of a man named Barzillai from Meholah \add town\add*.
\v 9 David put these men into the hands of the men from Gibeon. Then they hanged those seven men on a hill where they worshiped Yahweh. They were all killed during the time of the year that the people started to harvest the barley.

\v 7 But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of Yahweh’s oath between them, between David and Jonathan, the son of Saul.
\v 8 But the king took the two sons of Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, sons whom she bore to Saul—the two sons were named Armoni and Mephibosheth; and David also took the five sons of Michal, the daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite. 
\v 9 He handed them over into the hands of the Gibeonites. They hanged them on the mountain before Yahweh, and they died all seven together. They were put to death during the time of harvest, during the first days at the beginning of barley harvest.
