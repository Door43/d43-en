\v 7 The king did not put Saul's grandson Mephibosheth into their hands, because of what he and \add Mephibosheth's father\add* Jonathan had solemnly promised to each other.
\v 8 Instead, he took Armoni and another man named Mephibosheth, the two sons that Saul's slave wife Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, had given birth to, and the five sons that Saul's daughter Merab had given birth to. Merab's husband was Adriel the son of a man named Barzillai from Meholah \add town\add*.
\v 9 David put these men into the hands of the men from Gibeon. Then they hanged those seven men on a hill where they worshiped Yahweh. They were all killed during the time of the year that the people started to harvest the barley.

\v 7 The king did not hand over Saul's grandson Mephibosheth to them, because of what he and Mephibosheth's father Jonathan had solemnly promised to each other.
\v 8 Instead, he took the two sons of Rizpah and Saul, named Armoni and Mephibosheth—Rizpah was the daughter of Aiah and had been Saul's slave wife; David also the five sons of Merab, Saul's daughter. Merab's husband was Adriel son of Barzillai, was from the city of Meholah.

\v 7 But the king spared Mephibosheth son of Jonathan son of Saul, because of Yahweh's oath between them, between David and Jonathan son of Saul.
\v 8 But the king took the two sons of Rizpah daughter of Aiah, sons whom she bore to Saul—the two sons were named Armoni and Mephibosheth; and David also took the five sons of Merab \f + \ft Some versions read: \fqa Michal,\fqa* but 2SA 6:23 says she had no children; or Michal may have been another name for Merab \f* daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholathite.
\v 9 He handed them over into the hands of the Gibeonites. They hanged them on the mountain before Yahweh, and they died all seven together. They were put to death during the time of harvest, during the first days at the beginning of barley harvest.
