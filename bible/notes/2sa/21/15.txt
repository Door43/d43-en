\v 15 Then the Philistines went to war again with Israel. So David went down  with his army and fought against the Philistines. David was overcome with battle fatigue.
\v 16 Ishbibenob, a descendant of the giants, whose bronze spear weighed three hundred shekels, and who was armed with a new sword, intended to kill David.
\v 17 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah rescued David, attacked the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, "You must not go to battle anymore with us,  so that you do not put out the lamp of Israel."
