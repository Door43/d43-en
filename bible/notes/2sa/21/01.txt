===== translationNotes: =====

  * **sought the face of Yahweh** - Here "face" is a synecdoche for Yahweh's presence. This means David prayed to Yahweh for an answer about the famine. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **because of Saul and his murderous family** - Saul had killed many Gibeonites, and Saul's descendants are guilty because of this sin.
