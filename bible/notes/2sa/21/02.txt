\v 2 The people of Gibeon were not native born Israelites. They were a small group of the Amor people group whom the Israelites had solemnly promised to protect when they invaded the land of Canaan. But Saul had tried to kill all of them because he was very eager to enable the people of Judah and Israel to be the only ones living in that land. So the king summoned the leaders of Gibeon
\v 3 and said to them, "What should I do for you? How can I make up for what Saul did to your people, in order that you will bless us who belong to Yahweh and have so many good things from him?"

\v 2 Now the Gibeonites were not from the people of Israel; they were from what remained of the Amorites. The people of Israel had sworn not to kill them, but Saul tried to kill them all anyway in his zeal for the people of Israel and Judah.
\v 3 So King David called together the Gibeonites and said to them, "What should I do for you? How can I make atonement, so that you may bless the people of Yahweh, who inherit his goodness and promises?"

  * **Now** - Here "Now" marks a break in the main storyline. This gives background information about the Gibeonites. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **What should I do for you? How can I make atonement ... promises?** - These two sentences have similar meanings. AT: "What can I do to remove this sin, so that you may bless the people of Yahweh, who inherit his goodness and promises?"" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
