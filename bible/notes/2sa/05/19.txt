\v 20 So David \add and his army\add* went to \add where the Philistia army was\add*, and there they defeated them. Then David said, "Yahweh has burst through my enemies like a flood. \f + \ft simile \f*" So that place is called 'Lord of bursting-through.'

\v 20 So David and his army went to where the Philistine army was, and there they defeated them. Then David said, "Yahweh has burst through my enemies like a flood. " So that place is called Baal Perazim.

\v 19 Then David asked for help from Yahweh. He said, "Should I attack the Philistines? Will you give victory over them?" Yahweh said to David, "Attack, for I will certainly give you victory over the Philistines."
\v 20 So David attacked at Baal Perazim, and there he defeated them. He commented, "Yahweh has burst through my enemies before me like a bursting flood of water." So the name of that place became Baal Perazim.
\v 21 The Philistines left their idols there, and David and his men carried them away.
