\v 8 At that time David said, "Whoever attacks the Jebusites should go through the water shaft to reach the 'lame and the blind,' the enemies of David." That is why people say, "The ' blind and the lame ' cannot come into the palace."
\v 9 Then David began to live in the stronghold and called it the City of David. He fortified it round about from the Millo and inside it.
\v 10 David became greater and greater because Yahweh, the God of hosts, was with him.
