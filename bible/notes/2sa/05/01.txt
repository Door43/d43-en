  * **you** - This refers to David. (See: [[ en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]]) 
  * **You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become ruler over Israel** - These two clauses mean basically the same thing and emphasize that Yahweh had chosen David to be king. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **You will shepherd my people Israel** - Here ruling over the people is spoken of as shepherding them. AT: "You will care for my people Israel" or "You will ruler over my people Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
