\v 22 Even though you think that what I did was disgraceful, I will continue to do it even more. Perhaps you despise me because of what I did, but the women whom you were talking about will honor me!"

\v 21 David responded to Michal, "I did that before Yahweh, who chose me above your father and above all his family, who appointed me leader over the people of Yahweh, over Israel. Before Yahweh I will be joyful!
\v 22 I will be even more ' crude ' than this. I will be humiliatated in my own eyes, but among the slave girls of whom you have spoken, I will be honored."
\v 23 So Michal, the daughter of Saul, had no children to the day of her death.
