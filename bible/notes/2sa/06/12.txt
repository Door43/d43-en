\v 12 Now King David was told, "Yahweh has blessed Obed Edom's house and everything that belongs to him because of the ark of God." So David went and brought up the ark of God from Obed Edom's house to the city of David with joy.
\v 13 When those who were carrying the ark of Yahweh had gone six steps, he sacrificed an ox and a fattened calf.
