===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **David danced before Yahweh with all his might** - Dancing here is a form of worship of Yahweh. 
  * **linen**  - a cloth made from fibers of the flax plant
  * **all the house of Israel **  - There were only 30,000 men with David, the whole nation is not with him. Here this smaller group represents the nation of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
