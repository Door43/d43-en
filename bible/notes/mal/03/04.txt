\v 4 Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to Yahweh, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.
\v 5 "Then I will approach you for judgment. I will quickly become a witness against the sorcerers, the adulterers, the false witnesses, and against those who oppress the hired worker in his wages, those who oppress the widow and the fatherless, against those who turn away the foreigner, and against those who do not honor me," says Yahweh of hosts.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh is speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **as in the days of old, and as in ancient years** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that the offering was once pleasing to Yahweh. AT: "as it was in the past" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) 
  * **oppress the hired worker in his wages** - "cause the hired worker hardship by not paying him for his work" 
  * **turn away the foreigner** - That is, turning away the foreigner from gaining his rights. Depriving people of their rights is spoken of as if it were physically turning them away from oneself. Perhaps the idea is turning away someone who comes for a wrong to be set right. AT: "deny foreigners living in Israel the rights that they should have" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]], [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
