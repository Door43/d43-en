\v 13 I, Yahweh, \add have something else\add* to say to you. You have said terrible things about me."

\v 14 \add I reply\add*, "You have said, 'It is useless for us to serve God. We have gained nothing \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* by obeying the commands that he gave to us and by trying to show the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels that we are sorry \add for the sins that we have committed\add*.
\v 15 From now on, we will say\f + \ft Or: consider \f* that those who are proud are the ones whom \add God has\add* blessed. We will say that because it seems that it is those who do evil who become rich, and that it is those who try to find out how many evil things they can do without God punishing them who are not punished.'~"

\v 13 Your words have been stout against me, says Jehovah. Yet you say, What have we spoken against thee?
\v 14 You have said, It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it that we have kept his charge, and that we have walked
mournfully before Jehovah of hosts?
\v 15 And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are built up; yea, they tempt God, and escape.
