====== Malachi 03:1-3 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says this: "Look\f + \ft Or: Listen \f*! I am about to send my messenger who will prepare \add the people to receive me\add* when I come. You \add claim that\add* \f + \ft irony \f* you are wanting to see me, and I will suddenly come to my temple. The messenger \add who will tell you about a new\add* agreement, the one whom you are eagerly \f + \ft sarcasm \f* awaiting, is certainly going to come to you."
\p
\v 2 But will anyone \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* be able to survive when he comes? Will anyone \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* be able to remain standing in front of him? \add Probably not\add*, because he will be like \f + \ft simile \f* a blazing fire that refines\f + \ft Or: purifies \f* \add metal\f + \ft Or: gold \f*\add*. He will be like \f + \ft simile \f* a very strong soap \add that bleaches clothes\add*.
\v 3 \add He will be like a worker\add* who sits \add in front of his work\add* to cause silver to become pure by burning all the impurities. Like \add a worker refines\add* silver and gold, he will cause the descendants of Levi\f + \ft Or: priests \f* to become pure, \add in order that they will again become acceptable to\add* offer sacrifices that will be acceptable to him.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, says this:
\pi "Look, I will soon send a messenger to you, who will get you ready to welcome me. I, the Lord, whom you say you desire to come, will appear suddenly in my temple. A messenger will come, whom Yahweh had promised in the covenant that you say you take pleasure in. I myself am coming." This is what Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, says.
\p
\v 2 And none of you will be able to stop Yahweh from judging you. For he will declare no one innocent when he comes. He will act like a fire that burns hot enough to refine precious metals. He will act as the strong soap that laundrymen use to clean clothing.
\v 3 Yahweh will judge you; he will be like a silversmith who sits down and makes his silver pure, free from all impurities. Yahweh will forgive you and make all of you priests and Levite temple workers not want to sin any longer. He will make you like pure gold or silver. Then he will accept your offerings that you bring to him, because you will be righteous."

\c 3
\p
\v 1 "See, I am about to send my messenger, and he will prepare the way before me. Then the Lord, whom you seek, will suddenly come to his temple. The messenger of the covenant in whom you delight, see, he will come," says Yahweh of hosts.
\p
\v 2 But who will be able to endure the day of his coming? Who will be able to stand when he appears? For he will be like a refiner's fire and like
laundry soap.
\v 3 He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi. He will refine them like gold and silver, and they will bring offerings of righteousness to Yahweh.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh begins speaking again to the people of Israel in verse 1, but the prophet Malachi begins speaking in verse 2. 

  * **See** - "Look" or "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you"
  * **he will prepare the way before me** - Here getting people ready to welcome Yahweh is spoken of as if a road were being cleared for Yahweh to travel on. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Then the Lord, whom you seek ... The messenger of the covenant in whom you delight** - Some modern versions translate so as to imply that these two expressions refer to the same person. Other modern versions leave this question ambiguous. We recommend that translations leave this matter ambiguous, as do the ULB and UDB.
  * **The messenger of the covenant** - Almost all versions leave ambiguous the sense of this expression. But translators may need to make explicit the relationship between "messenger" and "the covenant." The UDB presents "the messenger" as one promised by the covenant that Yahweh had with Israel. Another choice is to present the messenger as a person who will either confirm that covenant or announce a new covenant.
  * **But who will be able to endure the day of his coming? Who will be able to stand when he appears?** - These rhetorical questions imply that no one will be able to resist Yahweh when he comes. They can be combined into one statement. AT: "However, no one will be able to resist Yahweh when he comes to judge them." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the day of his coming** - Here "day" stands for "time." AT: "the time when he comes"
  * **be able to stand** - Here standing represents resisting someone's attack or accusations. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For he will be like a refiner's fire and like laundry soap** - This sentence gives the reason why no one will be able to resist God when he comes. God's power to judge the people and to stop them from sinning is spoken of as if it were the power of strong soap to clean clothes, or the power of fire to melt an object. These are ways of saying that God's power to do these things cannot be stopped. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **he will purify the sons of Levi** - Forgiving the sons of Levi and persuading them not to sin any longer is spoken of as if it were purifying metal. AT: "he will correct the sons of Levi and forgive them for having sinned" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the sons of Levi** - Here "sons" refers to descendants. The male descendants of Levi were the priests and workers in the temple. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **He will sit** - Here sitting implies the action of a metalworker, who sits down in order to purify small amounts of gold or silver. It also implies the action of a king, who sits down to judge people and give decrees. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **He will refine them like gold and silver** - Here persuading people not to sin any longer is spoken of as if a metalworker were making gold and silver more pure. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]]).
  * **they will bring offerings of righteousness to Yahweh** - Here "of righteousness" means "motivated by righteous desires to worship God." AT: "they will bring acceptable offerings to Yahweh in order to worship Yahweh"
