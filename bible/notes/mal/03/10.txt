\v 10 Now bring all the tithes to the storerooms of the temple, in order that there may be enough food for the people who serve me there. If you do that, I, Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, promise that I will open the windows of heaven and pour out from them blessings on you. If you bring your tithes to the temple, the blessings will be very great, with the result that you will not have enough space to store all of them. So test me to see if I am telling the truth.
\v 11 You will have abundant crops to harvest, because I will protect them in order that locusts do not harm them. Your grapes will not fall from the vines before they are ripe.
\v 12 When that happens, the people of all nations will say that I have truly helped you, because your country will be delightful. That is what I, Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, say."

\v 10 Bring the full tithe into the storehouse, so that there may be food in my house. And test me now in this," says
Yahweh of hosts, "if I do not open to you the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing on you, until there is no more room for it.
\v 11 I will speak against those who destroy your crops, so that they do not destroy the harvest of your land. Your vines in the fields will not lose their fruit," says Yahweh of hosts.
\v 12 "All the nations will call you blessed, for you will be a land of delight," says Yahweh of hosts.
