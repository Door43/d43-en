\v 10 Bring the full tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. And test me now in this, says
Yahweh of armies, if I will not open to you the windows of heaven, and pour out a blessing on you, that there will not be enough room to receive it.
\v 11 I will rebuke the devourer for you, so that it will not destroy the fruits of your ground; and your
vine will not cast its fruit before its time in the field, says Yahweh of armies.
\v 12 And all nations will call you blessed; for you will be a land of delight, says Yahweh of armies.
