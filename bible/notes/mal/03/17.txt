===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says this \add about those people\add*: "They will be my people. On the day that I judge people, they will be like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a special treasure to me. I will be kind to them, like \f + \ft simile \f* fathers are kind to their sons who obey them.
\v 18 When that happens, you will again see that \add the manner in which I treat\add* righteous people is different from \add the manner in which I treat\add* wicked people. You will see that the manner in which I act toward those who serve me is different from the manner in which I act toward those who do not."

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies, says this about those people: "They will be my people. On the day that I judge people, I will not punish them, as a father does not punish his son who obeys him.
\v 18 When that happens, you will again see that the manner in which I treat righteous people is different from the manner in which I treat wicked people. You will see that the manner in which I act toward those who worship me is different from the manner in which I act toward those who do not."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 "They will be mine," says Yahweh of hosts, "my own treasured possession, on the day that I act; I will
spare them, as a man spares his own son who serves him.
\v 18 Then once more you will distinguish between the righteous and the wicked, between one who worships God and one who does not worship 
him.
