<usfm>
\v 17 The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says this \add about those people\add*: "They will be my people. On the day that I judge people, they will be like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a special treasure to me. I will be kind to them, like \f + \ft simile \f* fathers are kind to their sons who obey them.
\v 18 When that happens, you will again see that \add the manner in which I treat\add* righteous people is different from \add the manner in which I treat\add* wicked people. You will see that the manner in which I act toward those who serve me is different from the manner in which I act toward those who do not."

\v 17 And they will be mine, says Yahweh of armies, even my own treasured possession, in the day that I make; and I will
spare them, as a man spares his own son that serves him.
\v 18 Then onece more you will distinguish between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve
him.
