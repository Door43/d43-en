\v 14 You cry out, saying "Why does Yahweh not like our offerings?" The answer is that Yahweh heard what each of you men solemnly promised to your wives when you were young. But you men have not done what you promised your wives; you sent them away, the ones with whom you made that agreement.
\p
\v 15 It is certainly \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* Yahweh who joined you together. Your spirits and your bodies belong to him. So what he wants \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* from you are godly children. So make sure that each of you men remain with\f + \ft Or: loyal to \f* the woman that you married when you were young.
\p
\v 16 Yahweh, the God to whom we Israelites belong, says, "I hate divorce!" So if you men divorce your wives, you are overwhelming them by acting cruelly toward them. So be sure that you are not disloyal\f + \ft Or: remain united \f* to your wives. That is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says.

\v 14 But you say, Why does he not? Because Yahweh was witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have
been faithless, though she is your companion and your wife by covenant.
\v 15 Did he not make one, with a portion of the Spirit? And what did that one do while he was seeking godly offspring? So guard yourselves in your spirit, and let no one be faithless to the wife of your youth.
\v 16 For I hate divorce, says Yahweh, the God of Israel, and him that covers his garment with violence, says Yahweh
of armies. So guard yourselves in your spirit and do not be faithless."
