====== Malachi 02:14-16 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 You cry out, saying "Why does Yahweh not like our offerings?" The answer is that Yahweh heard what each of you men solemnly promised to your wives when you were young. But you men have not done what you promised your wives; you sent them away, the ones with whom you made that agreement.
\p
\v 15 It is certainly \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* Yahweh who joined you together. Your spirits and your bodies belong to him. So what he wants \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* from you are godly children. So make sure that each of you men remain with\f + \ft Or: loyal to \f* the woman that you married when you were young.
\p
\v 16 Yahweh, the God to whom we Israelites belong, says, "I hate divorce!" So if you men divorce your wives, you are overwhelming them by acting cruelly toward them. So be sure that you are not disloyal\f + \ft Or: remain united \f* to your wives. That is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says.

\v 14 You cry out, saying "Why does Yahweh not like our offerings?" The answer is that Yahweh heard that each of you men solemnly promised to be faithful to your wives when you were young. But you men have not done what you promised; you have sent them away, the ones with whom you made that covenant, so you could marry foreign women.
\p
\v 15 Indeed, Yahweh made you one with your wife, and he gave you some of his spirit. He did this because he wanted you to have children who would honor him. So you must be careful not to let other women attract you. Let none of you be faithless to the woman whom you married when you were young.
\p
\v 16 Yahweh, the God to whom we Israelites belong, says, "I hate divorce!" So if you men divorce your wives, you are overwhelming them by acting cruelly toward them. So be sure that you are not disloyal to your wives. That is what Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, says.

\v 14 But you say, "Why does he not?" Because Yahweh was a witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have been faithless, even though she was your companion and your wife by your covenant.
\v 15 Did he not make one, with a portion of his spirit? And why did he make you one? Because he was hoping to have offspring of God. So guard yourselves in your spirit, and let no one be faithless to the wife of your youth.
\v 16 "For I hate divorce," says Yahweh, the God of Israel, "and the one who covers his garment with violence," says Yahweh of hosts. "So guard yourselves in your spirit and do not be faithless."

(See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
