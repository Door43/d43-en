====== Malachi 02:5-7 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 My agreement with \add your ancestor Levi\add* was because I wanted the priests to live prosperously and peacefully. And that is what I have done for them. I required that they greatly respect me and revere \f + \ft doublet \f* me.
\v 6 They told the people that what I instructed them to do was right. And they did not tell \f + \ft metonymy \f* lies. They worked for me peacefully and loyally, and they helped many people to stop sinning.
\p
\v 7 What priests say \f + \ft metonymy \f* should enable more people to know \add about me\add*, and people should go to them \f + \ft metonymy \f* to be taught \add what I want them to know\add*, because priests should be messengers from me, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 He also says, 
\pi "I made my covenant with your ancestor Levi because I wanted the priests to live prosperously and peacefully. And that is what I enabled them to do. I required that they greatly respect me and honor me, and they did so.
\v 6 They taught the people what was true and right; they did not tell lies. They worked for me peacefully and loyally, and they helped many people to stop sinning.
\p
\v 7 What priests say should enable people to continue to learn the truth from generation to generation. They should be certain that the priests will teach them correction, because they must be true messengers from me, Yahweh, commander of the angel armies.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 "My covenant with him was life and peace, and I gave them to him; honor, and he honored me and stood in awe before my name.
\v 6 Instruction of truth was in his mouth, and perversity was not found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and he turned many away from sin.
\v 7 For a priest's lips should keep knowledge, and people should seek instruction from his mouth, for he is a messenger of Yahweh of hosts.
