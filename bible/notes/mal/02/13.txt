===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Malachi continues to speak to his fellow Israelites.

  * **You cover the altar of Yahweh with tears** - This sarcastically exaggerates the amount of tears the people cry to show that Yahweh knows that the people do not really feel sad. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **with weeping and sighing** - The words "weeping" and "sighing" share similar meanings and intensify the idea of weeping. AT: "with great weeping" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **does not turn toward the offering** - Here turning toward a gift stands for receiving it and showing favor to the giver. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **does not turn toward the offering** - This implies that those who are weeping at Yahweh's altar have offered sacrifices to him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **from your hand** - Here "hand" stands for the person giving the offering. AT: "from you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
