====== Malachi 02 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Levites ==
The priests are given a strong warning in this chapter. They have not followed the law of Moses and have led the people in the wrong direction. Yahweh has not accepted their sacrifices. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:priest]] and [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses]])

== Marital unfaithfulness ==
Because the Jews lived under a covenantal arrangement with Yahweh, their relationship is described using the imagery of a marriage. Marital unfaithfulness indicates a person's unfaithfulness to Yahweh. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:covenant]], [[:en:obe:kt:unfaithful]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
