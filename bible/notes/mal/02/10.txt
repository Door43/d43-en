====== Malachi 02:10-12 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 \add Now I will warn you about something else\add*. We all certainly \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* have the same \add heavenly\add* Father. We are certainly \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* all created by the same God. So why are \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* some of you disobeying\f + \ft Or: despising \f* the agreement that Yahweh made with our ancestors, by not doing for each other what you said that you would do?
\p
\v 11 You people of Judah have been unfaithful \add toward Yahweh\add*. You have done detestable things in Jerusalem and in other places in Israel. You Israelite men have defiled the temple that Yahweh loves. You have done that by marrying women who worship idols.
\v 12 I wish that Yahweh will expel from Israel every man who has done that, even though they \add say that they are obeying\add* the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels by bringing offerings to him.

\v 10 Now I, Malachi, will warn you about something else. It is certain that we Israelites are a people group only because God has created us as a people group. But we lie to each other and harm each other; in this way we disgrace the covenant that Yahweh made with our ancestors.
\p
\v 11 You people of Judah have been unfaithful toward Yahweh. You have done disgusting things in Jerusalem and elsewhere in Israel. You Israelite men have defiled the temple that Yahweh loves. You have done that by marrying foreign women, women who worship idols.
\v 12 I wish that Yahweh would drive away from Israel absolutely every man who has done that, along with his descendants—even if they bring offerings to Yahweh, commander of the angel armies.

\v 10 Is there not one father for us all? Has not one God created us? Why are we faithless each man against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers?
\v 11 Judah has been faithless. A disgusting thing has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem. For Judah has profaned the holy place of Yahweh which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.
\v 12 May Yahweh cut off from the tents of Jacob the man who does this, the one who is awake and the one who answers, even if he is bringing an offering to Yahweh of hosts.
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa the one who is awake and the one who answers \fqa* , some versions have other expressions such as \fqa the master and the one who studies \fqa* . \f*

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Here the prophet Malachi begins to speak to his fellow Israelites.

  * **Is there not one father for us all? Has not one God created us?** - Malachi asks these questions in order to remind his fellow Israelites about what they already know. AT: "You know that we all have one father, that our God has created a nation out of us." or "You all know that God is the father of all us Israelites, because he is the one who made our nation." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Has not one God created us?** - This question is meant to express a statement. AT: "Certainly it is the same God who has created us." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])  
  * **created us** - This probably refers to God forming the Hebrews into a nation. 
  * **Why are we faithless each man against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers?** - Malachi asks this question in order to rebuke his fellow Israelites. This question may be expressed as a statement. AT: "We should certainly not mistreat our brothers and disrespect God's covenant by disobeying his commands, as you have been doing." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Judah has been faithless** - Here "Judah" stands for the people in the region of Judah, and the fact that they have been faithless to Yahweh is spoken of as if they were one man named "Judah." AT: "The people of Judah have been faithless" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **A disgusting thing has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem** - This can be expressed in active form. AT: "People have done disgusting things in Israel and in Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **For Judah has profaned the holy place of Yahweh** - Here "Judah" refers again to the people of Israel. AT: "For the people of Judah have profaned the holy place of Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **has married the daughter of a foreign god** - The people of Judah are again referred to as if they were one man named "Judah." AT: "have married women from other nations, women who worship idols" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **May Yahweh cut off from the tents of Jacob the man who** - Destroying something is often spoken of as it were cutting it off from something else. AT: "May Yahweh destroy anyone in the tents of Jacob who" or "May Yahweh kill anyone in the community of Israel who" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the tents of Jacob** - Here "tents of Jacob" stands for the community of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Jacob** - Here "Jacob" stands for all the Israelites, because Jacob was one of the patriarchs from whom the Israelites were descended. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the one who is awake and the one who answers** - This expression seems to mean "absolutely everyone."  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
