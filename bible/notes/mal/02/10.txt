<usfm>
\v 10 \add Now I will warn you about something else\add*. We all certainly \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* have the same \add heavenly\add* Father. We are certainly \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* all created by the same God. So why are \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* some of you disobeying\f + \ft Or: despising \f* the agreement that Yahweh made with our ancestors, by not doing for each other what you said that you would do?
\p
\v 11 You people of Judah have been unfaithful \add toward Yahweh\add*. You have done detestable things in Jerusalem and in other places in Israel. You Israelite men have defiled the temple that Yahweh loves. You have done that by marrying women who worship idols.
\v 12 I wish that Yahweh will expel from Israel every man who has done that, even though they \add say that they are obeying\add* the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels by bringing offerings to him.

\v 10 Now I will warn you about something else. It is certain that we Israelites are a people group only because God has created us as a people group. But we lie to each other and harm each other; in this way we disgrace the covenant that Yahweh made with our ancestors.
\p
\v 11 You people of Judah have been unfaithful toward Yahweh. You have done disgusting things in Jerusalem and elsewhere in Israel. You Israelite men have defiled the temple that Yahweh loves. You have done that by marrying foreign women, women who worship idols.
\v 12 I wish that Yahweh would drive away from Israel every man who has done that, along with his descendants—even if they bring offerings to Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies.

\v 10 Do we not all have one father? Has not one God created us? Why do we deal treacherously each against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers?
\v 11 Judah has dealt treacherously, and a disgusting thing has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem. For Judah has profaned the
sanctuary of Yahweh which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.
\v 12 May Yahweh cut off from the tents of Jacob any descendant of the man that does this, even one who brings an offering to Yahweh of hosts.
