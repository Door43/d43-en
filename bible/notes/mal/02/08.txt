\v 8 But, you priests have stopped doing what I wanted you to do. What you have taught people has caused many of them to sin. You have rejected the agreement that I made with the descendants of Levi \add long ago\add*.
\v 9 Therefore I have caused all the people to despise you, and I have caused you to be humiliated, because you have not obeyed me. When you teach people my commands, you do not treat all people equally."

\v 8 But you are turned aside out of the way; you have caused many to stumble in the law; you have corrupted the covenant of Levi,
says Jehovah of hosts.
\v 9 Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as you have not kept my ways, but
have had respect of persons in the law.
