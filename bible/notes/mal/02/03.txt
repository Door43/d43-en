===== translationNotes: =====

  * **and I will spread dung on your faces** - Here "dung on your faces" stands for disgrace. AT: "I will most certainly put you in deep disgrace" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you will be taken away with it** - This expression continues the same metaphor, and can be put in active form. AT: "they will throw you on the dung pile and take you away when they remove all the dung" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **you will be taken away with it** - The Israelites knew that the large piles of dung from the many animal sacrifices had to be carried away and disposed of by temple workers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Levi** - Yahweh speaks of Levi as though he was the same as his descendants, the tribe of Levi. AT: "so that my covenant may be with you, the descendants of Levi." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
