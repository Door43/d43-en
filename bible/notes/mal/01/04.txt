\v 4 If Edom says, "We are beaten down, but we will return and build the ruins;" Yahweh of hosts says, "They
will build, but I will throw down; and men will call them 'The country of wickedness,' and 'The people with whom Yahweh is angry forever.'"
\v 5 Your own eyes will see this, and you will say, "Great is Yahweh beyond the borders of Israel."
