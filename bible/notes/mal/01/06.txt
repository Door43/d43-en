\v 6 But the Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies, says to the people, "Boys honor their fathers, and servants respect their masters. So, if I am like your father and your master, why do you not honor me? Why do you not obey me?" And Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies, has something to say to you priests: "You show no respect for me!
\p But you priests ask, 'How have shown no respect for you?'
\p
\v 7 I answer: Instead of honoring me, you have disgraced me by offering sacrifices on my altar that are unworthy of me, sacrifices that I would never accept.
\p Then you dare to ask, 'What sacrifices have we given that are unworthy of you?'
\p I answer: You think that it does not matter if you do not honor my altar.

\v 6 "A son honors his father, and a servant honors his master. If I, then, am a father, where is my honor? And if I am a master, where is the reverence for me? Yahweh of hosts speaks to you, priests, who despise my name. But you say, 'How have we despised your name?'
\v 7 By offering polluted bread upon my altar. And you say, 'How have we polluted you?' By saying that Yahweh's table may be despised.
