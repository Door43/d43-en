So, if I am like your father and your master, why do you not honor me? Why do you not obey me?" And Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies, has something to say to you priests: "You show no respect for me!
\p But you priests ask, 'How have shown no respect for you?'

\p I answer: You think that it does not matter if you do not honor my altar.
