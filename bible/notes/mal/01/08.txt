\v 8 You offer for sacrifices animals that are blind.

\v 9 \add And he also says\add*, "You plead with me to act mercifully toward you. But you bring to me sacrifices that are not acceptable to me, so why should I act kindly toward you?"

\v 8 You offer for sacrifices animals that are blind. Is that not wrong? You offer animals that are sick or lame. Do you really think I would accept such gifts? You would not dare to offer such gifts to your own governor! You know that he would not take them. You know that he would be displeased with you and would not welcome you!" 
\m That is what Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, says!
\p
\v 9 I, Malachi, see you go through the motions of asking God to help us. But Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, says, 
\pi "If you bring to me sacrifices that are not acceptable to me, why should I help you?"

\v 8 When you offer blind animals for sacrifice, is that not evil? And when you offer the lame and sick, is that not evil? Present that to your governor; will he accept you or will he lift up your face?" says Yahweh of hosts.
\v 9 And now, keep asking for God's favor, so that he may be gracious to us. But Yahweh of hosts says that with such an offering on your part, would he lift up any of your faces?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **When you offer blind animals for sacrifice, is that not evil?** - Here Yahweh is asking a question in order to make a statement. This sentence functions as a rebuke to the people. AT: "You know very well that it is evil for you to offer blind animals for sacrifice!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **And when you offer the lame and sick, is that not evil?** - Here Yahweh is asking a question in order to make a statement. AT: "And you know very well that it is evil for you to offer the lame and sick!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Present that to your governor** - Here Yahweh gives a command in order to express a conditional idea. AT: "If you present that to your governor" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_imperative]])
  * **will he accept you?** - Here Yahweh is asking a question in order to make a statement of rebuke. AT: "You know he would not accept you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **will he lift up your face?** - Lifting up someone's face refers to accepting him with favor. AT: "will he accept you with favor?" or "will he agree to help you?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Present** - give as a gift to show respect
  * **And now, keep asking for God's favor, so that he may be gracious to us** - Malachi is no longer speaking for God. He is talking directly to the Israelites; he is criticizing them for daring to think that God will have mercy on them.
  * **with such an offering on your part, would he lift up any of your faces?** - Here Yahweh is asking a question in order to make a statement of rebuke. AT: "If you offer unacceptable offerings, God will certainly not lift up your faces." (See:  [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]], [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
