\v 8 You offer for sacrifices animals that are blind. Is that not wrong? You offer animals that are sick or lame. Do you really think I would accept such gifts? You would not dare to offer such gifts to your own governor! You know that he would not take them. You know that he would be displeased with you!" That is what Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies, says!
\p
\v 9 You go through the motions of asking God to help us. But Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies, says, "If you bring to me sacrifices that are not acceptable to me, why should I help you?"

\v 8 When you offer blind animals for sacrifice, is that not evil? And when you offer the lame and sick, is that not evil? Present that to your governor; will he accept you or will he show you favor?" says Yahweh of hosts.
\v 9 And now, you try to ask for God's favor, so that he may be gracious to us. "With such an offering on your part, will he receive any of you kindly?" says Yahweh of hosts.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Present that to your governor** - "If you present that to your governor"
  * **Present** - give as a gift to show respect
  * **will he accept you or will he show you favor?** - "will he be pleased with you?" This is a rebuke. Alternate translation: "he will certainly not be pleased with you!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **And now, ...gracious to us** - Malachi is no longer speaking for God. He is talking directly to the Israelites.
  * **With such an offering on your part, will he receive any of you kindly?** - "When you offer unacceptable  sacrifices, will God be pleased with you?" This is a rebuke. Alternate translation: "If you offer unacceptable offerings, God will certainly not be pleased with you!"
