\v 8 You offer for sacrifices animals that are blind. Is that not wrong? You offer animals that are sick or lame. Do you really think I would accept such gifts? You would not dare to offer such gifts to your own governor! You know that he would not take them. You know that he would be displeased with you!" That is what Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies, says!
\p
\v 9 You go through the motions of asking God to help us. But Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies, says, "If you bring to me sacrifices that are not acceptable to me, why should I help you?"
