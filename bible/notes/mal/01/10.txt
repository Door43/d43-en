\v 10 Oh that there were one among you who would shut the doors, that you might not kindle fire on my altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, says Yahweh of armies, and I will not accept an offering from your hand.
\v 11 For from the rising of the sun to its setting my name
will be great among the nations; and in every place incense
will be offered to my name, and a pure offering. For my name
will be great among the nations, says Yahweh of armies.
\v 12 But you are profaning it when you say  the Lord's table is polluted, and its fruit, its food is to be despised.
