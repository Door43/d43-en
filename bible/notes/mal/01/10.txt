\v 10 The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels also says, "I wish\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that one of you would shut the gates \add of the temple courtyard\add*, in order that no one could offer those worthless sacrifices. I am not pleased with you, and I will not accept the offerings that you bring to me.
\v 11 People of other nations honor me \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add every day\add*, from sunrise\f + \ft Or: morning \f* until sunset\f + \ft Or: evening \f*. All over the world people offer incense and other pure\f + \ft Or: acceptable \f* offerings to me \f + \ft metonymy \f*. They do that because people among all the nations know that I \f + \ft metonymy \f* am very great.
\p
\v 12 But you \add priests\add* despise me \add by what you do\add*. You say, '\add It is all right if\add* people pollute the altar by bringing sacrifices that are unacceptable.'

\v 10 Yahweh also says, "I wish that one of you would shut the gates of the temple courtyard, in order that no one could offer those worthless sacrifices. I am not pleased with you, and I will not accept the offerings that you bring to me." This is what Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies, says.
\v 11 He also says, "People of other nations from east to west will indeed honor me. They will burn incense to honor me, and they will bring right offerings, offerings that I will accept. This will happen because people in all the nations will praise and honor me.
\p
\v 12 But you priests—you priests act in a way that shows me no honor at all. You say, 'It is all right if people disgrace the altar by bringing sacrifices that he will not accept.'

\v 10 "Oh, if only there were one of you who would shut the temple gates, so that you might not light fires on my altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you," says Yahweh of hosts, "and I will not accept any offering from your hand.
\v 11 For from the rising of the sun to its setting my name
will be great among the nations; in every place incense
will be offered to my name, and also a pure offering. For my name
will be great among the nations," says Yahweh of hosts.
\v 12 "But you are profaning it when you say  the Lord's table is polluted, and its fruit, its food is to be despised.
