\v 13 "You also say, 'How tiresome this is,' and you distainfully snort at it," says Yahweh of Hosts. "You bring what has been
taken by a wild animal or is lame or sick; and this you bring as your offering! Should I accept this from your hand?" says
Yahweh.
\v 14 Cursed be the deceiver, who has a male animal in his flock and vows it to give it to me, and yet sacrifices to me, the Lord, what is flawed;
for I am a great King," says Yahweh of Hosts, "and my name is feared among the nations."
