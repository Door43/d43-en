\v 13 You also say,
\pi2 'We are tired of burning all these sacrifices on the altar.'
\pi2 You turn up your noses at doing this. You bring sheep or goats that wild animals have attacked and torn in two. You also bring animals that are sick or that cannot walk. You cannot really think that I should accept these from you, can you?"
\m This is what Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, says.
\p
\v 14 Yahweh also says,
\pi "I will curse anyone who tries to cheat me by swearing that he will bring to me a perfect animal from his herd, and who then brings me one that has defects. If anyone does that, I will punish him, because I am a great king, and people of the other nations honor me, but you do not!"
\m This is what Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, says.

\v 13 You also say, 'How tiresome this is,' and you snort at it," says Yahweh of hosts. "You bring what has been taken by a wild animal or is lame or sick; and this you bring as your offering. Should I accept this from your hand?" says Yahweh.
\v 14 "May the deceiver be cursed who has a male animal in his flock and vows to give it to me, and yet sacrifices to me, the Lord, what is flawed! For I am a great king," says Yahweh of hosts, "and my name will be honored among the nations."
