===What is the Book of Malachi about?===

The Book of Malachi is a collection of messages from God for the Jews who had returned from Babylon to Judah and Jerusalem. Although the Jews had by this time built a new temple, they were demoralized and in great need of encouragement. Many of them had also been unfaithful to God's law in various ways that Malachi criticized them for. However, Malachi also provided them with the promise that God would come and purify them so that they would worship him in sincerity and faithfulness.

===How should the title of this book be translated?=== 

"The Book of Malachi" may also be called the "The Book about Malachi" or "The Sayings of Malachi." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])

=== Who wrote the Book of Malachi? ===

The prophet named Malachi brought these messages from Yahweh to the Jews. However, since "Malachi" means "my messenger," it is possible that this was a title for this prophet. If so, his real name is not known to us.
