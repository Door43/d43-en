<usfm>
\v 1 This is also what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says: "There will be a time that I will judge \add and punish\add* people. When that happens, it will be like \f + \ft simile \f* a very hot furnace. On that day, all the proud and wicked people will be burned up like \f + \ft metaphor \f* stubble burns. They will be burned up completely—like roots and branches \add and everything else on a tree burns completely in a very hot fire\add*.
\v 2 But for you who revere me \f + \ft metonymy \f*, the one who will save you will \add come to you\add* like \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add the sun shines in the morning, and enable you to\add* become righteous \f + \ft Or: \add do what is\add* righteous \f*; he will restore you \add and protect you like a bird protects its chicks\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* under its wings. \add When he comes\add*, you will \add be very joyful, like\add* \f + \ft simile \f* calves that go out from the barn into the pasture leaping joyfully.
\v 3 On the day when I judge people, you will tread on wicked people as though \f + \ft simile \f* they were the dirt under your feet. That is what I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, promise.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 This is also what Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies, says: "There will be a time when I will judge and punish all people. When that happens, it will be like a day that they burn stubble in the fields. Those people will burn up completely—as roots and branches and everything else on a tree burns completely in a very hot fire.
\v 2 But for you who honor me, I, who always act righteously will come to you and heal you, as the sun rises in the morning. You will be as happy as young calves when they leave their stalls to play in the fields.
\v 3 On the day when I judge people, you will completely defeat the wicked people. It will be as if you had walked all over them." This is what Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies, promises.

\v 1 For see, the day is coming, burning like a furnace, when all the proud and all the evildoers will become stubble.
The day that is coming will burn them up," says Yahweh of hosts, "so that it will leave them neither root nor branch.
\v 2 But for you who fear my name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings. You will go out leaping like calves from the stall.
\v 3 And you will tread down the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day that I act," says Yahweh of hosts.
