\v 32 They were walking on the road that goes up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was going ahead of them. The disciples were amazed, and those who were following behind were afraid. Then Jesus took the Twelve aside again and began to tell them what would soon happen to him:
\v 33 "See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death and deliver him to the Gentiles.
\v 34 They will mock him, spit on him, whip him, and put him to death. But after three days he will rise."
