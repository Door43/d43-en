\v 45 \add You should imitate me\add*. Even though I am the one who has come from heaven, I did not come to be served \f + \ft Or:for others to serve me \f*.

\v 43 But it shall not be this way among you. Whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant,
\v 44 and whoever wishes to be first among you must be the slave of all.
\v 45 For the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."
