\v 43 But do not be like them! On the contrary, all those among you who want \add God to consider them\add* great must become \add like\add* servants to \add the rest of\add* you.
\v 44 Furthermore, if anyone among you wants \add God to consider him\add* to be the most important, he must \add act like\add* a servant for the rest of you.
\v 45 \add You should imitate me\add*. Even though I am the one who has come from heaven, I did not come to be served \f + \ft Or:for others to serve me \f*. On the contrary, I came in order to serve others and to allow others to kill me, in order that my dying for people would be like a payment to rescue \add many people from being punished\add* \f + \ft Or:\add God punishing them\add* \f* \add for their sins\add*."

\v 43 But it shall not be this way among you. Whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant,
\v 44 and whoever wishes to be first among you must be the slave of all.
\v 45 For the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."
