\v 7 That explains why \add God said\add*, 'When a man \add and\add* woman marry, they should no longer live with their fathers and mothers \add after they marry\add*.
\v 8 Instead, the two of them shall \add live together, and they shall\add* become so\add closely united\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add that they are like\add* one person.' Therefore, although the people \add who marry\add* were two \add separate persons\add* before, \add God regards them\add* as one person now, \add so he wants them to remain married\add*.
\v 9 Because that is true, a man must not separate from his \add wife\add* whom God has joined \add to him, because God's plan is for them to remain together\add*!"

\v 7 That explains why God said, 'When a man marries, he must leave his parents and join with his wife.
\v 8 They should become so closely united  that they are like one person. And the two people will be like one person.
\v 9 Because that is true, a man must not separate from his wife.  God has joined them together and he wishes them to stay together!"
