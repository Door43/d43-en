\v 7 That explains why \add God said\add*, 'When a man \add and\add* woman marry, they should no longer live with their fathers and mothers \add after they marry\add*.
\v 8 Instead, the two of them shall \add live together, and they shall\add* become so\add closely united\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add that they are like\add* one person.' Therefore, although the people \add who marry\add* were two \add separate persons\add* before, \add God regards them\add* as one person now, \add so he wants them to remain married\add*.
\v 9 Because that is true, a man must not separate from his \add wife\add* whom God has joined \add to him, because God's plan is for them to remain together\add*!"

\v 7 That explains why God said, 'When a man and woman marry, they should leave their fathers and mothers after they marry.
\v 8 Instead, the two of them should live their lives together, and they should become so closely united  that they are like one person. Even though they are still two separate persons, God considers them as one person.
\v 9 Because that is true, a man must not separate from his wife.  God has joined them together and his plan is for them to stay together!"

\v 7 For this cause for a man will leave his father and mother, he will be united to his wife;
\v 8 and the two shall become one flesh, so they are no longer two, but one flesh.
\v 9 Therefore what God has joined together, let not man tear apart."
