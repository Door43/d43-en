\v 46 They came to Jericho. As he left Jericho with his disciples and a great crowd of people, there was a man there named Bartimaeus (he was the son of Timaeus), a blind beggar who sat by the road.
\v 47 When he heard that Jesus the Nazarene was on his way, he began to shout and to say, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"
\v 48 Many rebuked the blind man, telling him to be quiet. But he cried out all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"
