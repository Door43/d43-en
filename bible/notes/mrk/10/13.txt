===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Permit the little children come to me, and do not forbid them** - These two sentences have similar meaning, repeated for emphasis. In some languages it is more natural to emphasize in another way. AT: "Be sure to allow the little children to come to me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **do not forbid** - This is a double negative. In some languages it is more natural to use a positive statement. AT: "allow." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
