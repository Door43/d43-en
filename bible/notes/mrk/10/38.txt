\v 38 But Jesus said to them, "You do not understand what you are asking for." Then he asked them, "Can you endure suffering like I am about to suffer? Can you endure others to kill you as they will kill me?"
\v 39 They said to him, "Yes, we are able to do that!" Then Jesus said to them, "It is true that you will endure suffering like I will suffer, and you will endure others to kill you as they will kill me.
\v 40 But I am not the one who chooses who will sit next to me. God will give those places to the ones whom he chooses in advance."

\v 38 But Jesus replied to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup which I will drink or endure the baptism with which I will be baptized?"
\v 39 They said to him, "We are able." Jesus said to them, "The cup that I will drink, you will drink, and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you also will be baptized.
\v 40 But who is to sit at my right hand or at my left hand is not mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared."
