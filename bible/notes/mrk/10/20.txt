\v 20 The man said, "Teacher, all these things I have obeyed from the time I was a youth."
\v 21 Jesus looked at him and loved him. He said to him, "One thing you lack. You must sell all that you have and give it to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."
\v 22 But because of this statement he looked very sad and he went away distressed, because he had many possessions.
