\v 24 The disciples were confused by what he said. Jesus said again, "My dear friends, it is very difficult for anyone to agree for God to rule over them.
\v 25 In fact, it would be easier for a very large animal like a camel to enter through the eye of a needle than for rich people to accept God to rule over them."
