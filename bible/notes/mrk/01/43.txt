\v 43 Jesus spoke sternly to him before he sent him away.
\v 44 What Jesus said was, "Go to a local priest and show yourself to him \add in order that he may examine you and verify that you are healed\add*. Then, \add after the priest tells the local people\add*, they will know \add that you have been healed, and you will be able to associate with them again\add*. Make sure that you do not tell others \add about what happened\add*! Then go to \add Jerusalem and take to the priest what Moses commanded that people who have been healed from leprosy should offer, in order that he\add* may offer it \add as a sacrifice to God\add*."

\v 43 Jesus spoke sternly to him before he sent him away.
\v 44 This is what Jesus said, "Do not tell anyone what just happened. Instead, go to a priest and show yourself to him in order that he may examine you. Then make the offering that Moses commanded for people who have been healed from leprosy. This will be the testimony to the community that you have been healed."

  * **General Information:** - The word "him" used here refers to the leper whom Jesus healed.

  * **Be sure to say nothing to anyone** - "Be sure to not say anything to anyone"
  * **show yourself to the priest** - Jesus told the man to show himself to the priest so that the priest could look at his skin to see if his leprosy was really gone. It was required in the law of Moses for a man to present himself to the priest if he had been cleansed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **show yourself** - The word "yourself" here represents the skin of the leper. AT: "show your skin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **a testimony to them** - It is best to use the pronoun "them," if possible, in your language. Possible meanings are 1) "a testimony to the priests" or 2) "a testimony to the people."
