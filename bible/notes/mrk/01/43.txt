\v 43 Jesus spoke sternly to him before he sent him away.
\v 44 What Jesus said was, "Go to a local priest and show yourself to him \add in order that he may examine you and verify that you are healed\add*. Then, \add after the priest tells the local people\add*, they will know \add that you have been healed, and you will be able to associate with them again\add*. Make sure that you do not tell others \add about what happened\add*! Then go to \add Jerusalem and take to the priest what Moses commanded that people who have been healed from leprosy should offer, in order that he\add* may offer it \add as a sacrifice to God\add*."

\v 43 Jesus spoke sternly to him before he sent him away.
\v 44 This is what Jesus said, "Do not tell anyone what just happened.  Instead, go to a priest and show yourself to him in order that he may examine you. Then make the offering that Moses commanded for people who have been healed from leprosy.  This will be the testimony to the community that you have been healed."
