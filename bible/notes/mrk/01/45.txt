\v 45 The man did not follow Jesus' instruction. He began telling many people about how Jesus had healed him. As a result, Jesus was no longer able to enter towns publicly because the crowds of people would surround him. Instead, he remained outside the towns in places where no one lived. But people kept coming to him from all over that region.

\v 45 But he went out and began to tell everyone and spread the word so much that Jesus could no longer freely enter into any town. So he stayed out in solitary places and people came to him from everywhere.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But he went** - The word "he" refers to the man Jesus healed.
  * **tell everyone ... spread the word** - These two phrases share similar meanings and are used together to emphasize that the man told a lot of people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **everyone** - The word "everyone" is an exaggeration to emphasize how very many people he told. AT: "many people he met" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **Jesus could no longer freely enter into any town** - It is implied that the large crowds prevented Jesus from being able to enter the towns because the crowds made it difficult for him to walk around there. AT: "the crowds prevented Jesus from moving freely in towns" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **solitary places** - "lonely places" or "places where no one lived" 
  * **from everywhere** - The word "everywhere" is a hyperbole used to emphasize how very many places the people came from. AT: "from all over the region" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
