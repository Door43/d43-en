\v 1-2 This is the good news concerning Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Isaiah the prophet mentioned this good news when he wrote:
\q "Listen! I am sending my messenger ahead of you. 
\q He will prepare the people to welcome you.
\q
\v 3 He will call out to anyone who hears him in the wilderness,  
\q 'Make yourselves ready to welcome the Lord.'"

===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **your...your**  - singular (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **Make ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight**  - These two commands mean the same thing: "Prepare" to meet someone important. If they are the same in your language, you can omit the second sentence, as the UDB does. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
