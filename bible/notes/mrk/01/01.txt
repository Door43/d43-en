===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **before your face**  - To be "before the face" means to be in front of or very close to someone. Alternate translation: "before you." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:idiom|Idiom]])
  * **your...your**  - singular (See: [[en:ta:translate:formsofyou]])
  * **Make ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight**  - These two commands mean the same thing: "Prepare" to meet someone important. If they are the same in your language, you can omit the second sentence, as the UDB does. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:translate:doublet]])
