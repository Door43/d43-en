===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He preached** - "John preached" See ([[:en:bible:notes:mrk:01:01|1:2-3]])
  * **I am not worthy even to stoop down to untie the strap of his sandals** - John is comparing himself to a servant to show how great Jesus is. AT: "I am not even worthy to do the lowly task of removing his shoes" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the strap of his sandals** - At the time Jesus was alive, people wore sandals that were often made of leather and tied to the foot with leather straps.
  * **stoop down** - "bend down"
  * **but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit** - This metaphor compares John's baptism with water to the future baptism with of the Holy Spirit. This means John's baptism only symbolically cleanses people of their sins. The baptism by the Holy Spirit will truly cleanse people of their sins. If possible, use the word "baptize" in your translation to keep the comparison to John's baptism. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
