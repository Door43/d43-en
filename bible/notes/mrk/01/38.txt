===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Here the words "he" and "I" refer to Jesus.

  * **Let us go elsewhere** - "We need to go to some other place." Here Jesus uses the word "us" to refer to himself, along with Simon, Andrew, James, and John.
  * **He went throughout all of Galilee** - The words "throughout all" are an exaggeration used to emphasize that Jesus went to many locations during his ministry. AT: "He went to many places in Galilee" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
