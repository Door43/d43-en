===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Here the words "him" and "he" refer to Jesus.
 
  * **all who were sick or possessed by demons** - The word "all" is an exaggeration  to emphasize the great number of people who came. AT: "many who were sick or possessed by demons" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **The whole city gathered together at the door** - The word "city" is a metonym for the people who lived in the city. Here the word "whole" is probably a generalization to emphasize that most people from the city gathered. AT: "Many people from that city gathered outside the door" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
