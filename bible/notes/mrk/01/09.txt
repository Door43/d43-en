\v 9 It happened in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and he was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
\v 10 As Jesus came up out of the water, he saw the heavens split open and the Spirit coming down on him like a dove,
\v 11 while a voice came out of the heavens, "You are my beloved Son. I am very pleased with you."
