===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus takes time to pray in the midst of his time of healing people. He then goes to towns throughout Galilee to preach, heal, and cast out demons.
  * **General Information:** - Here the words "he" and "him" refer to Jesus.

  * **a solitary place** - "a place where he could be alone"
  * **Simon and those who were with him** - Here "him" refers to Simon. Also, those with him include Andrew, James, John, and possibly other people. 
  * **Everyone is looking for you** - The word "Everyone" is an exaggeration to emphasize the very many people who were looking for Jesus. AT: "Many people are looking for you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
