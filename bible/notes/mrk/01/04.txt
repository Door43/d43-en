\v 5 A great number of people from the district of Judea and the city of Jerusalem went out to the wilderness to hear John speak. Many of those who heard him agreed that they had sinned. Then John baptized them in the Jordan River.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In these verses the words "he," "him," and "his" refer to John.

  * **John came** - Be sure your reader understands that John was the messenger spoken of by the prophet Isaiah in the previous verse.
  * **The whole country of Judea and all the people of Jerusalem** - The words "whole country" are a metaphor for the people who live in the country and a generalization that refers to a great number of people, not to every single person. AT: "Many people from Judea and Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **They were baptized by him ... confessing their sins** - These two actions happened simultaneously. The people were baptized because they repented of their sins. AT: "When they repented of their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River"
