===== translationNotes: =====

  * **What do we have to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth?** - The demons ask this rhetorical question meaning there is no reason for Jesus to interfere with them and that they desire him to leave them. AT: "Jesus of Nazareth, leave us alone! There is no reason for you to interfere with us." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Have you come to destroy us?** - The demons ask this rhetorical question to urge Jesus not to harm them. AT: "Do not destroy us!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **threw him down** - Here the word "him" refers to the demon-possessed man.
  * **while crying out with a loud voice** - The demon is the one who is crying out, not the man.
