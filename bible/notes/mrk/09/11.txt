\v 11 \add The three disciples had just seen Elijah, but Elijah had not done anything to prepare people to accept Jesus. So\add* they asked Jesus, "The men who teach the \add Jewish\add* laws say that Elijah must come back to the earth before \add the Messiah comes to earth. But you have been here a long time and Elijah came just today. So is what they are teaching wrong?\add*"
\v 12-13 \add Jesus wanted them to know that John the Baptizer was the one who represented Elijah. So\add* he answered them, "It is true that \add God promised to send Elijah to come\add* first\add so that people would be ready when I came\add*. Elijah's representative has already come, and our leaders treated him very badly, just like they wanted to do, just like it was prophesied \f + \ft Or:\add the prophets\add* prophesied \f* long ago. But, I also want you to consider what is written \f + \ft Or:what \add the prophets\add* wrote \f* in the Scriptures about me, the one who came from heaven.\f + \ft Or: why have you not thought about what is written \f + \ft Or:what \add the prophets\add* wrote \f* about me, the one who came from heaven? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* It is written \f + \ft Or:They wrote \f* that I would suffer much and that I would be rejected \f + \ft Or:that \add many people\add* would reject me \f*."

\v 11 They asked Jesus, "Why do the men who teach the our laws say that Elijah must come back to the earth before the Messiah comes to earth?"
\v 12-13 Jesus answered them, "It is true that God promised to send Elijah to come first to put everything as it should be. But Elijah has already come, and our leaders treated him very badly, just like they wanted to do, as prophets long ago had said they would. But I also want you to consider what is written in the scriptures about me, the Son of Man. They say that I would suffer much and that people would reject me."

\v 11 They asked him, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
\v 12 He said to them, "Elijah does indeed come first to restore all things. Then why is it written that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be treated as one who is worthless?
\v 13 But I say to you that Elijah has come, and they did whatever they wanted to him, just as scripture says about him."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Though Peter, James, and John wondered what Jesus might mean by "rising from the dead," they asked him instead about Elijah's coming.
  * **General Information:** - The UDB uses a verse bridge to combine verses 12 and 13, giving the information Jesus is telling them in an order that is easier to understand. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_versebridge]])

  * **They asked him** - The word "they" refers to Peter, James, and John.
  * **Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?** - Prophecy foretold that Elijah would come again from heaven. Then the Messiah, who is the Son of Man, would come to rule and reign. Other prophecies also foretold that the Son of Man would suffer and be hated by people. The disciples are confused how both could be true.
  * **that Elijah must come first** - The scribes taught that Elijah would come back to earth before the Messiah came. AT: "that Elijah must come first before the Messiah comes" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Then why is it written ... who is worthless?** - As Jesus is teaching his disciples, he asks this question and then tells his disciples the answer. This may be expressed as a statement. AT: "But I also want you to consider what is written about the Son of Man. The scriptures say that he must suffer many things and be treated as one who is worthless" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **be treated as one who is worthless** - This may be stated in active form. AT: "people will treat him as one who is worthless" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **they did whatever they wanted to him** - It may be helpful to state what people did to him. AT: "our leaders treated him very badly, just as they wanted to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
