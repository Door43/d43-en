\v 11 \add The three disciples had just seen Elijah, but Elijah had not done anything to prepare people to accept Jesus. So\add* they asked Jesus, "The men who teach the \add Jewish\add* laws say that Elijah must come back to the earth before \add the Messiah comes to earth. But you have been here a long time and Elijah came just today. So is what they are teaching wrong?\add*"
\v 12-13 \add Jesus wanted them to know that John the Baptizer was the one who represented Elijah. So\add* he answered them, "It is true that \add God promised to send Elijah to come\add* first\add so that people would be ready when I came\add*. Elijah's representative has already come, and our leaders treated him very badly, just like they wanted to do, just like it was prophesied \f + \ft Or:\add the prophets\add* prophesied \f* long ago. But, I also want you to consider what is written \f + \ft Or:what \add the prophets\add* wrote \f* in the Scriptures about me, the one who came from heaven.\f + \ft Or: why have you not thought about what is written \f + \ft Or:what \add the prophets\add* wrote \f* about me, the one who came from heaven? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* It is written \f + \ft Or:They wrote \f* that I would suffer much and that I would be rejected \f + \ft Or:that \add many people\add* would reject me \f*."

\v 11 They asked Jesus, "Why do the men who teach the our laws say that Elijah must come back to the earth before the Messiah comes to earth?"
\v 12-13 Jesus answered them, "It is true that God promised to send Elijah to come first to put everything as it should be. But Elijah has already come, and our leaders treated him very badly, just like they wanted to do, as prophets long ago had said they would. But I also want you to consider what is written in the Scriptures about me, the Son of Man. They say that I would suffer much and that people would reject me."

\v 11 They asked Jesus, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
\v 12 He said to them, "Elijah does indeed come first so he can restore all things. Then why is it written that Son of Man must suffer many things and that people will hate him?
\v 13 But I say to you that Elijah has come, and they did whatever they wanted to him, just as scripture says about him."
