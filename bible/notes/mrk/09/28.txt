  * **privately** - This means they were alone.

  * **This kind cannot be cast out except by prayer** - The words "cannot" and "except" are both negative words. In some languages it is more natural to use a positive statement. AT: "This kind can be cast out only by prayer" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
  * **This kind** - This describes unclean spirits. AT: "This kind of unclean spirit" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
