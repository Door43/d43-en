But God will punish you more severely\add* than that \add if you cause a person who believes in me to sin\add*.
\v 43-44 \add So\add*, if you are \add wanting to use one of\add* \f + \ft metonymy, personification \f* \add your hands to sin, stop using your hand! Even if you have to\add* cut your hand off and throw it away \add to avoid sinning, do it\add* \f + \ft hyperbole \f*! It is good that you not sin and that you live eternally, \add even though you lack one of\add* your hands\add while you are here on earth\add*.

\v 42 Jesus also said, "But if you cause someone who believes in me to sin, God will severely punish you, even if that person is socially unimportant like this little child. If someone tied a heavy stone around your neck and threw you into the sea, it would be better for you than if God punished you for causing a person who believes in me to sin.
\v 43 So if you are wanting to use one of your hands to sin, do not use it! Even if you have to cut your hand off and throw it away to avoid sinning, do it! It is good that you live eternally, even though you lack one of your hands while you are here on earth. But it is not good that you sin and as a result for God to throw your whole body into hell.

\v 42 Whoever causes one of these little ones who believes in me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a large millstone tied around his neck and be thrown into the sea.
\v 43 If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed than to have two hands and to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire.
\v 44 \f + \ft The best earliest manuscripts do not have verse 44, or verse 46; They appear to be copiest errors taken from verse 48 \f*
