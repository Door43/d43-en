  * **its saltiness** - "its salty taste"

  * **salty again** - "taste salty again"
  * **Have salt among yourselves** - Jesus speaks of doing good things for one another as if good things were salt that people possess. AT: "Do good to each other, like salt adds flavor to food" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
