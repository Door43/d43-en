\v 10 So they did not tell others about it \add for a long time\add*. But they discussed among themselves what it meant when he said that he would rise from the dead\f + \ft Or: become alive again \f* after he died.

\v 9 As they were coming down the mountain, he commanded them to tell no one what they had seen, until the Son of Man had risen from the dead ones.
\v 10 So they kept the matter to themselves, but they discussed among themselves what "to rise from the dead ones" could mean.
