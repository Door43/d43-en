\v 17 One of the crowd answered him, "Teacher, I brought you my son; he has a spirit that makes him unable to speak,
\v 18 and it causes him to have convulsions and throws him down; he foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive it out of him, but they could not."
\v 19 He answered them, "Unbelieving generation, how long will I have to stay with you? How long will I bear with you? Bring him to me."
