\v 17 A man in the crowd answered him, "Teacher, I brought my son \add here in order that\add* you \add would heal him\add*. There is an evil spirit in him \add that makes him\add* unable to talk.
\v 18 Whenever the spirit attacks him, it throws him down. He foams at the mouth, he grinds his teeth together, and he becomes stiff. I asked your disciples to expel the spirit, but they were not able to do it."

\v 18 Whenever the spirit begins to control him, it throws him down. He foams at the mouth, he grinds his teeth together, and he becomes stiff. I asked your disciples to expel the spirit, but they were not able to do it."
\v 19 Jesus replied by saying to those people, "You faithless people! You test my patience! Bring the boy to me."

\v 17 Someone in the crowd answered him, "Teacher, I brought my son to you. He has a spirit that makes him unable to speak.
\v 18 It seizes him and it throws him down and he foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and he becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive it out of him, but they could not."
\v 19 He answered them, "Unbelieving generation, how long will I have to stay with you? How long will I bear with you? Bring him to me."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - To explain what the scribes and other disciples were arguing about, a father of a demon-possessed man tells Jesus that he has asked the disciples to send the demon out of his son, but they could not. Jesus then casts the demon out of the boy. Later the disciples ask why they were not able to send the demon away.

  * **He has a spirit** - This means the boy is possessed by an unclean spirit. "He has an unclean spirit" or "He is possessed by an unclean spirit" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **he foams at the mouth** - When a person has a seizure, they can have trouble breathing or swallowing. This causes white foam to come out of the mouth. If your language has a way to describe that, you could use it.
  * **becomes rigid** - "becomes stiff." It may be helpful to state that it is his body that becomes rigid. AT: "his body becomes rigid" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **they could not** - This refers to the disciple not being about to drive the spirit out of the boy. AT: "they could not drive it out of him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **He answered them** - Though it was the boy's father who made a request of Jesus, Jesus responds to the whole crowd. This can be made clear. AT: "Jesus responded to the crowd" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Unbelieving generation** - "You unbelieving generation." Jesus calls the crowd this, as he begins to respond to them.
  * **how long will I have to stay with you? ... bear with you?** - Jesus uses these questions to express his frustration. Both questions have the same meaning. They can be written as statements. AT: "I have become weary by your unbelief!" or "Your unbelief tires me! I wonder how long I must bear with you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **bear with you** - "endure you" or "put up with you"
  * **Bring him to me** - "Bring the boy to me"
