===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 45 If you are wanting to use one of your feet to sin, do not use it! Even if you have to cut off your foot to avoid sinning, do it! It is good that you live eternally, even though you lack one of your feet while you are here on earth. But it is not good that you sin and as a result for God to throw your whole body into hell.
\v 46 \f + \ft The best ancient copies do not have verse 46 \f*

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 45 If your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life lame than to have your two feet and be thrown into hell.
\v 46 \f + \ft The best ancient copies omit this phrase from verses 44 and 46, \fqa where their worm does not die, and the fire is not put out \f*
