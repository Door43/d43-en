===== Important Terms: ===== 

  * [[:en:obe:other:stumble]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:hell]]
===== Translation Notes: =====

While talking to his disciples, Jesus had just given two other illustrations about how important it is not to cause simple people or children not to believe.

  * **better for you to enter into life lame** - Whatever the personal cost, separate from sin and embrace obedient faith. This is the third similar illustration Jesus uses to make his point strongly. (See: Parallelism and Hyperbole)
  * **maimed** - "crippled"
  * **unquenchable fire** - "fire that never goes out" or "fire that cannot stop burning"
