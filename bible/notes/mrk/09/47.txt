<usfm>
\v 47 If because of what you see you are tempted to sin, stop looking at those things! Even if you have to gouge out your eye and throw it away to avoid sinning, do it! It is better to have only one eye and for God to agree to rule over you, than him to throw you with two eyes into hell.
\v 48 In that place worms feed on the people there forever and the fires are never put out."

<usfm>
\v 47 If your eye causes you to stumble, tear it out. It is better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than to have two eyes and to be thrown into hell,
\v 48 where their worm does not die, and the fire is not put out.
