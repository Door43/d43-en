Jesus had just been talking to the people and his disciples about following him.

  * **he was transfigured** - "he changed into another form" or "he appeared very different" (UDB)
  * **radiantly brilliant** - "exceedingly white"
  * **bleacher on earth could bleach them** - "Bleach" is a chemical used to remove stains from clothes and to make them white. A "bleacher" is someone who does the stain removal.
