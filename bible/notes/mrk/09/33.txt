\v 33 They came to Capernaum. When he was in the house he asked them, "What were you discussing along the way?"
\v 34 But they were silent. For they had disputed with one with another along the way about who was the greatest.
\v 35 He sat down and he called the Twelve together. He said to them, "If anyone would be first, he must be last of all and servant of all."
