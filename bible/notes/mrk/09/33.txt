\v 33 Then Jesus and his disciples returned to Capernaum. When they were in the house, he asked them, "What were you talking about while we were traveling on the road?"
\v 34 But they did not reply. They were ashamed to reply because, while they were traveling, they had been arguing with each other about which one of them would be the most important when Jesus became king.
\v 35 He sat down, he called the twelve disciples to come close to him and then said to them, "If anyone wants God to consider him to be the most important person of all, he must consider himself to be the least important person of all, and he must serve everyone else."

\v 33 They came to Capernaum. When he was in the house he asked his disciples, "What were you discussing along the way?"
\v 34 But they were silent. For they had been arguing with one with another along the way about who was the greatest.
\v 35 He sat down and called the Twelve together. He said to them, "If anyone wants to be first, he must be last of all and servant of all."
