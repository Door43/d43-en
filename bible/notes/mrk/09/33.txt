\v 33 Then they came to Capernaum. After he entered the house he asked them, "What were you discussing on the way?"
\v 34 But they were silent. For they had been arguing with one with another on the way about who was the greatest.
\v 35 Sitting down, he called the twelve together and he said to them, "If anyone wants to be first, he must be last of all and servant of all."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - When they come to Capernaum, Jesus teaches his disciples about being humble servants. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_newevent]])

  * **they came to** - "they arrived at." The word "they" refers to Jesus and his disciples.
  * **discussing** - "discussing with one another"
  * **they were silent** - They were silent because they were ashamed to tell Jesus what they had been discussing. AT: "they were silent because they were ashamed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **who was the greatest** - It may be helpful to add the missing information. AT: "who was the greatest among them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **If anyone wants to be first, he must be last of all** - Here the words "first" and "last" are opposites of one another. Jesus speaks of being the "most important" as being "first" and of being the "least important" as being "last." AT: "If anyone wants God to consider him to be the most important person of all, he must consider himself to be the least important of all" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **of all ... of all** - "of all people ... of all people"
