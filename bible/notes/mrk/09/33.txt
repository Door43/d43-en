\v 33 Then they came to Capernaum. After he entered the house he asked them, "What were you discussing on the way?"
\v 34 But they were silent. For they had been arguing with one with another on the way about who was the greatest.
\v 35 Sitting down, he called the twelve together and he said to them, "If anyone wants to be first, he must be last of all and servant of all."
