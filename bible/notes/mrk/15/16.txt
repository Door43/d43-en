===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the barracks** - This is the place where the soldiers stayed.
  * **cohort** - "large amount" or "many"
  * **They put a purple robe on Jesus** - This was an act of mockery. Purple was a color attributed to royalty and by clothing him this way they were mocking his title, "King of the Jews."
  * **They began to salute him and said, "Hail, King of the Jews!"**  - Again, the soldiers were mocking Jesus because they did not believe that he was the King of the Jews. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
