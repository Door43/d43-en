Jesus had been condemned by Pilate and hung on a cross.

  * **You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself and come down from the cross!** - These people said this because they believed that if Jesus were powerful enough to rebuild the temple in three days then he should have been powerful enough to come down off the cross.
