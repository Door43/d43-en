===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - When the chief priests, elders, scribes, and the council gave Jesus over to Pilate, Pilate did not want to condemn him. Though the crowd brought many accusations against Jesus, he did not reply to them.
 
  * **they bound Jesus and led him away** - They commanded for Jesus to be bound, but it would have been the guards who actually bound him and led him away. AT: "they commanded for Jesus to be bound and then he was led away" or "they commanded the guards to bind Jesus and then they led him away" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **They handed him over to Pilate** - They had Jesus led to Pilate and transferred control of Jesus over to him. 
  * **You say so** - Possible meanings are 1) by saying this, Jesus was saying that Pilate, not Jesus, was the one calling him the King of the Jews. AT: "You yourself have said so" or 2) by saying this, Jesus implied that he is the King of the Jews. AT: "Yes, as you said, I am" or "Yes. It is as you said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **were presenting many charges against Jesus** - "were accusing Jesus of many things" or "were saying that Jesus had done many bad things"
