\v 31 In the same way the chief priests were mocking him with each other, along with the scribes, and said, "He saved others, but he cannot save himself.
\v 32 Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe." And those who were crucified with him also taunted him.
