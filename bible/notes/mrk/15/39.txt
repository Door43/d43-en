===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **"Truly this man was the Son of God."** - Since Jesus had just died for the sins of the world, it is important here that the centurion's words, that Jesus is "the Son of God," be translated clearly. The Son of God was the one who died for the sins of the world.
  * **Salome** - (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
