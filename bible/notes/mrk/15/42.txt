\v 42 When evening had come, because it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath,
\v 43 Joseph of Arimathea came there. He was a respected member of the council, who was waiting for the kingdom of God. He boldly went in to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
\v 44 Pilate was amazed that Jesus was already dead; he called the centurion and asked him if Jesus was dead.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Joseph of Arimathea asks Pilate for the body of Jesus, which he wraps in linen and puts in a tomb.

  * **evening had come** - Here evening is spoken of as if it were something that is able to "come" from one place to another. AT: "it had become evening" or "it was evening" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Joseph of Arimathea came there** - "Joseph of Arimathea came to Pilate"
  * **Joseph of Arimathea** - "Joseph from Arimathea." Joseph is the name of a man and Arimathea is the name of the place his is from. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **He was a respected member of the council ... for the kingdom of God** - This is background information about Joseph. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **asked for the body of Jesus** - If he did not bury Jesus that evening he would have to wait until the Sabbath was over because the law did not permit anyone to do any type of work on the Sabbath. "asked for the body of Jesus so that he could bury him immediately, while it was still the day of Preparation" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
