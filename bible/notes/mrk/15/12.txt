===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The crowd asks for Jesus' death so Pilate turns him over to the soldiers who mock him, crown him with thorns, strike him, and lead him out to crucify him.

  * **What then should I do with the King of the Jews** - Pilate asks what he should do with Jesus if he releases Barabbas to them. This can be written clearly. AT: "If I release Barabbas, what then should I do with the King of the Jews" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
