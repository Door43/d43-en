\v 21 He told them another parable: "People certainly do not light an oil lamp and then bring it in the house in order to put something over it to cover its light. Instead, they put it on a lampstand so that the light will shine.
\v 22 Similarly, things that were hidden—one day everyone will know them, and the things that have happened in secret—one day everyone will see them in full light.
\v 23 If you want to understand this, you should consider carefully what you have just heard."

\v 21 Jesus said to them, "Do you bring a lamp inside the house to put it under a basket, or under the bed? You bring it in and you put it on a lampstand.
\v 22 For nothing is hidden that will not be known, and nothing is secret that will not come out into the open.
\v 23 If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Jesus said to them** - "Jesus said to the crowd"
  * **Do you bring a lamp inside the house to put it under a basket, or under the bed?** - This question may be written as a statement. AT: "You certainly do not bring a lamp inside the house to put it under a basket, or under a bed!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **For nothing is hidden that will not be known ... come out into the open** - This can be stated in positive form. AT: "For everything that is hidden will be made known, and everything that is secret will come out into to open" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **nothing is hidden ... nothing is secret** - "there is nothing that is hidden ... there is nothing that is secret" Both of the phrases have the same meaning. Jesus is emphasizing that everything that is secret will be made known. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mrk:04:08|4:9]].
