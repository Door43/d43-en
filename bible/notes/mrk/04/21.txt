\v 21 He told them another parable: "People certainly do not light an oil lamp and then bring it in the house in order to put something over it to cover its light. Instead, they put it on a lampstand so that the light will shine.
\v 22 Similarly, things that were hidden—one day everyone will know them, and the things that have happened in secret—one day everyone will see them in full light.
\v 23 If you want to understand this, you should consider carefully what you have just heard."

\v 21 Jesus said to them, "Do you bring a lamp inside the house to put it under a basket, or under the bed? You bring it in and you put it on a lampstand.
\v 22 For nothing is hidden, that will not be known, nor anything in secret, that will not come into the light.
\v 23 If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear."

  * **If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.** - Translate this as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:mrk:04:08|4:9]].
