\v 10 Later, when only the twelve disciples and other close followers were with him, they asked him about the parables.
\v 11 He said to them, "To you I will explain the message about how God reveals himself as king, but to the others I will speak in parables.
\q
\v 12 When they see what I am doing, they will not learn.
\q When they hear what I say, they will not understand.
\q If they learned or understood,
\q they would be sorry that they had sinned and decide to stop sinning,
\q and God would forgive them."

\v 10 When Jesus was alone, those who were close to him and with the Twelve asked him about the parables.
\v 11 He said to them, "To you is granted the mystery of the kingdom of God. But for those outside everything is in parables,
\q
\v 12 so that when they look, yes they look, but do not see, 
\q and so that when they hear , yes they hear, but do not understand, 
\q or else they would repent and God would forgive them."
