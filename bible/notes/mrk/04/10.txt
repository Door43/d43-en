\v 10 \add Later\add*, when only the twelve \add disciples\add* and a few \add other\add* people were with him, they asked him about the parables.
\v 11 He said to them, "People have not understood before \add the new message\add* about how God wants to rule people's lives.

But I tell about this \add only\add* in parables\f + \ft Or: figuratively \f* to those who have not \add yet invited God to rule their lives\add*.
\v 12 As a result \add it is true what a prophet has written\add*,

Although they hear \add what I say\add*, they do not understand \add what it means\add* \f + \ft doublet \f*. So they do not repent\f + \ft Or: turn away from their sinful behavior \f* in order that they would be forgiven \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* would forgive them \f*."

\v 10 Later, when only the twelve disciples and other close followers were with him, they asked him about the parables.
\v 11 He said to them, "To you I will explain the message about how God reveals himself as king, but to the others I will speak in parables.
\q
\v 12 When they see what I am doing, they will not learn.
\q When they hear what I say, they will not understand.
\q If they learned or understood,
\q they would be sorry that they had sinned and decide to stop sinning,
\q and God would forgive them."

\v 10 When Jesus was alone, those who were close to him and with the Twelve asked him about the parables.
\v 11 He said to them, "To you is given the mystery of the kingdom of God. But to those outside everything is in parables,
\q
\v 12 so that when they look, yes they look, but do not see, 
\q and so that when they hear, yes they hear, but do not understand, 
\q or else they would turn and God would forgive them."
