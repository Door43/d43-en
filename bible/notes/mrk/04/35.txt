\v 35 On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, "Let us go over to the other side."
\v 36 So they left the crowd. The disciples took Jesus along with them, since he was already in the boat. Other boats were with him also.
\v 37 There began a violent storm with wind, and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat was about to be full of water.
