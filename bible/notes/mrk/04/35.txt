\v 35 On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, "Let us go over to the other side."
\v 36 So they left the crowd, taking Jesus with them, since he was already in the boat. Other boats were also with him.
\v 37 And a violent windstorm arose and the waves were breaking into the boat so that the boat was already full.
