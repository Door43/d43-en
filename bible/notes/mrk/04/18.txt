\v 18 Others are the ones sown among the thorn plants. These heard the word,
\v 19 but the cares of the world, the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires for other things, entered in and choked the word, and it became unfruitful.
\v 20 Those that were sown on the good soil, they are the ones who heard the word and received it and it produced fruit, some thirty, and some sixty, and some a hundred times what was planted."
