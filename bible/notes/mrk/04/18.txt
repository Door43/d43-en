\v 18 Others are the ones sown among the thorns. These hear the word,
\v 19 but the cares of the world, the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires for other things, they enter in and choke the word, and it produces nothing.
\v 20 Those that were sown on the good soil, they are the ones who hear the word and receive it and bear fruit, some thirty, and some sixty, and some a hundred times what was planted."
