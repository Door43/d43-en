\p
\v 30 And he said, How shall we liken the kingdom of God? or in what parable shall we set it forth?
\v 31 It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown upon the earth, though it be less than all the seeds that are
upon the earth,
\v 32 yet when it is sown, grows up, and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches; so that the
birds of the heaven can lodge under the shadow thereof.
