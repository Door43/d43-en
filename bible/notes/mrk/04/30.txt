\v 30 Jesus told them another parable. He said, "When God begins to show himself as king, what is it like? What parable can I use to describe it?
\v 31 It is like mustard seeds. You know what happens to mustard seeds when we plant them. Though mustard seeds are among the smallest of seeds, they become large plants.
\v 32 After they are planted, they grow up and become larger than the other garden plants. They put out big branches so that birds are able to make nests in their shade."

\v 30 Again he said, "To what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable can we use to explain it?
\v 31 It is like a mustard seed which, when it is sown, is the smallest of all the seeds on earth.
\v 32 Yet, when it is sown, it grows and becomes greater than all the garden plants, and it forms large branches, so that the birds of heaven can make their nests in its shade."
