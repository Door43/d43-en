\v 30 He said, "To what can we compare the kingdom of God and what parable can we use to explain it?
\v 31 It is like a mustard seed, which when it is sown it is the smallest of all the seeds sown that lay upon the ground.
\v 32 Yet when it is sown, it grows up and becomes greater than all the garden plants. It puts out great branches, so even the birds of heaven can make their nests under its shade."
