\v 26 Jesus also said, "When God begins to show himself as king, it is like a man who has scattered seed on the ground.
\v 27 Afterwards he slept each night and rose up each day without worrying about the seeds. During that time the seeds sprouted and grew in a way that he did not understand.
\v 28 The ground produced the crop on its own. First the stalks appeared. Then the heads appeared. Then the full kernels in the heads appeared.
\v 29 As soon as the grain was ripe he sent people to harvest it because it was time to harvest the grain."

\v 26 Jesus said, "The kingdom of God is like a man who sows his seed on the ground.
\v 27 He sleeps and gets up, night and day; and the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.
\v 28 The earth bears grain by itself, first the blade, then the ear, then the mature grain in the ear.
\v 29 But when the grain is ripe, immediately he puts out the sickle because the harvest has come."
