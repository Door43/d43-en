\v 26 And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed upon the earth;
\v 27 and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he knows not how.
\v 28 The earth bears fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.
\v 29 But when the fruit is ripe, straightway he puts forth the sickle, because the harvest is come.
