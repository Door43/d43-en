\v 26 And he said, "The kingdom of God is as if a man should cast seed upon the ground.
\v 27 He sleeps and rises night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows, he does not know how.
\v 28 The earth bears grain by itself, first the blade, then the ear, then the mature grain in the ear.
\v 29 But when the grain is ripe, right away he puts out the sickle, because the harvest is come."
