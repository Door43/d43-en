\v 24 He said to them, "Pay attention to what you hear, for the measure you use, is the measure you will receive; and even more you will get.
\v 25 Because whoever has, to him will be given more, and whoever has not, from him will be taken away even what he has."

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues telling his disciples another parable.

  * **for the measure you use, is the measure you will receive; and even more you will get**- "the better you listen, the more understanding God will give to you."
  * **whoever has **- "whoever has understood my words." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
