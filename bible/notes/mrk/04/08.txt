===== translationNotes: =====

  * **some brought forth thirty times as much** - The amount of grain produced by each plant is being compared to the single seed from which it grew. AT: "Some plants bore thirty times as much as the seed that the man had planted" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **thirty ... sixty ... a hundred** - "30 ... 60 ... 100." These may be written as numerals. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])  
  * **and some sixty, and some a hundred** - Jesus continues to describe the amount of grain that was produced. Ellipsis is used here to shorten the phrases but they can be written out. AT: "and some produced sixty times as much grain and some produced a hundred times as much grain" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **Whoever has ears to hear** - This is a way of referring to everyone listening. AT: "Everyone who is listening to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **let him hear** - Here the word "hear" means to pay attention. AT: "must pay careful attention to what I am saying" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
