===== translationNotes: =====

  * **in the middle of everyone** - "in the middle of this crowd"
  * **Is it lawful ... to kill?** - Jesus asked this question to challenge the people.  AT: "You should know that it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath day and not to do harm, and to save a life and not to kill!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **to save a life, or to kill** - It may be helpful to repeat "is it lawful," as that is the question Jesus is asking again in another way. AT: "is it lawful to save a life or to kill" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **a life** - This refers to physical life and is a metonym for a person. AT: "someone from dying" or "someone's life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
