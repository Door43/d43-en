===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Get up and stand here in the middle of everyone.** - "Get up and stand here in the middle of this crowd."
  * **Is it lawful...?** - Because the author notes that "they were silent," it seems that Jesus was challenging them and expecting an answer. Alternate translation: "You should know that it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath day and to do harm; to save a life, not to kill." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **lawful** - according to the Law of Moses
