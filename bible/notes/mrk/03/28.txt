\v 28 Truly I say unto you, all sins of human beings may be forgiven, even all the blasphemies by which they blaspheme;
\v 29 but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never have forgiveness, but that person is guilty of an eternal sin."
\v 30 Jesus said this because they were saying, "He has an unclean spirit."
