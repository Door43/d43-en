\v 26 Similarly, if Satan and his \add evil spirits\add* were fighting one another, instead of remaining strong, he would become powerless.
\v 27 Contrary to \add what you say about me\add*, someone can enter the house of a strong man \add like Satan\add* and carry off his possessions only if he first ties up the strong man. Then \add and only then\add* will he \add be able to\add* steal the things in that man's house."

\v 26 If Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he is not able to stand, but has come to an end.
\v 27 But no one can enter into the house of a strong man and steal his belongings without tying up the strong man first. Then he will steal his belongings from his house.
