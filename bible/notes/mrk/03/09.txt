===== translationNotes: =====

  * **And he asked his disciples to have a small boat...not crush him** - As the large crowd was pushing forward towards Jesus, he was in danger of crushed by all the people. In the UDB, verses 9-10 are bridged and they state this implicit information clearly. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_versebridge]])
  * **he asked his disciples** - "Jesus told his disciples"
  * **For he healed many, so that** - The word "many" is used here to refer the large number of people Jesus had healed. AT: "Because Jesus had healed many people," (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **everyone who had afflictions eagerly approached him in order to touch him** - "all the sick people pushed forward trying to touch him"
