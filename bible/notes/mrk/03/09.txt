\v 9-10 Because he had healed many people, many other people who had various illnesses pushed forward in order to touch him.  They believed that if only they touched him, it would make them well. So he told his disciples that they should get a small boat ready for him in order that the crowd would not crush him when they pushed forward to touch him.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 He said to his disciples to have a boat ready for him because the pressure of the crowd was so great, they might crush him.
\v 10 He healed many, so many that all who had afflictions pressed upon him; they were hoping just to touch him.
