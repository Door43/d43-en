\v 38 In his teaching he said, "Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes and exchange salutations in the marketplaces,
\v 39 and to sit in places of importance in the synagogues, and to be given seats of honor at the feasts.
\v 40 These are the ones who devour widows houses, and solely for outward appearance offer their long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.
