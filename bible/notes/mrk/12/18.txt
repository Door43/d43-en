\v 18 Men who belong to the group of Sadducees deny what other Jews believed, that people become alive again after they die. Some Sadducees came to Jesus and asked him,

Then if those two bear children, everyone will consider that those children are the children of the man who died, and in that way the dead man will continue to have descendants.
