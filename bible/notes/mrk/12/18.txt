\v 18 Men who belong to the group of Sadducees deny what other Jews believed, that people become alive again after they die. Some Sadducees came to Jesus and asked him,
\v 19 "Teacher, Moses wrote for us Jews that if a man who has no children dies, his brother should marry the dead man's widow. Then if those two bear children, everyone will consider that those children are the children of the man who died, and in that way the dead man will continue to have descendants.

\v 18 Then Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him. They asked him, saying,
\v 19 "Teacher, Moses wrote for us, 'If a man's brother dies and leaves a wife behind him, but no child, the man should take the brother's wife, and have children for his brother.'
