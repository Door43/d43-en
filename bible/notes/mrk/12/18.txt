\v 18 Men who belong to the group of Sadducees deny what other Jews believed, that people become alive again after they die. Some Sadducees came to Jesus and asked him,
\v 19 "Teacher, Moses wrote for us Jews that if a man who has no children dies, his brother should marry the dead man's widow. Then if those two bear children, everyone will consider that those children are the children of the man who died, and in that way the dead man will continue to have descendants.

\v 18 Then Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him. They asked him, saying,
\v 19 "Teacher, Moses wrote for us, 'If a man's brother dies and leaves a wife behind him, but no child, the man should take the brother's wife, and have children for his brother.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **who say there is no resurrection** - This phrase explains who the Sadducees were. This can be written more clearly. AT: "who say there is no resurrection from the dead" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Moses wrote for us, 'If a man's brother dies** - The Sadducees are quoting what Moses had written in the law. Moses' quote can be expressed as an indirect quote. AT: "Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]]) 
  * **wrote for us** - "wrote for us Jews." The Sadducees were a group of Jews. Here they use the word "us" to refer to themselves and all Jews. 
  * **the man should take the brother's wife** - This means that the man should marry his brother's wife, not only that he take her and sleep with her to produce children. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **have children for his brother** - This means the children will be considered the dead brother's descendants. This can be made explicit. AT: "have children for his brother who will be considered his descendants" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
