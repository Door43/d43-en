===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Have you not read this scripture?** - AT: "Now think carefully about these words, which you have read in the Scriptures:" (See: [[:en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion]])
  * **'The stone which the builders rejected, has been made the cornerstone. This was from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes.'** - Jesus is now giving the meaning of the parable that he told in 12:1-9. The grape farmers are the religious leaders. The grape vineyard is the people of God. The religious leaders were to care for the people and help them to become better followers of God. Instead, the leaders made the people do many things that God never commanded and they killed God's son.
  * **The stone which the builders rejected has been made the cornerstone** - This is comparing Jesus as the foundation of God's kingdom to a stone that becomes a cornerstone (the most important foundation stone) in a physical building. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor]]) Jesus is the foundation of God's kingdom whom the religious leaders will reject but whom God the Father will make the foundation of God's kingdom.
