<usfm> \v 10 Now think carefully about these words, which you have read in the Scriptures: \p "The men who were building the building refused to use a certain stone. But the Lord has put that same stone in its proper place, and it has become the most important stone in the building! \v 11 The Lord has done this, and we marvel as we look at it." \p \v 12 Then the Jewish leaders realized that Jesus was accusing them when he told this story about what those wicked people did. So they wanted to arrest him. But they were afraid of what the crowds would do if they did that. So they left him and went away.
