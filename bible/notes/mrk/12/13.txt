\v 13 The \add Jewish leaders\add* sent to \add Jesus\add* some Pharisees \add who thought that the Jews should pay only the tax that their own Jewish authorities required people to pay\add*. They also sent some members of the party that supported Herod \add Antipas and the Roman government\add*. They wanted to make Jesus say something wrong \add that would make one of those groups very angry with him\add*.
\v 14 After they arrived, they said to him \add deceivingly\add*, "Teacher, we know that you \add teach\add* the truth. We also know that you are not concerned about \add what\add* people \add say about you, even if an important person does not like what you say\add*. Instead, you teach truthfully what God wants \add us to do\add*. So \add tell us what you think about this matter:\add* Is it right that we pay taxes to the Roman government, or not \f + \ft metonymy \f*? Should we pay the taxes, or should we not pay them?"
\v 15 Jesus knew that they did not really want to know \add what God wanted them to do\add*. So he said to them, "I \add know that\add* you are \add just\add* trying to make me say something wrong for which you can arrest me.\f + \ft Or: Why are you \add just\add* trying to make me say something wrong for which you can arrest me? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add But I will answer your question anyway\add*. Bring me a coin so that I might \add ask you something after\add* I look at it."

\v 13 The Jewish leaders sent to Jesus some Pharisees and some members of the party that supported Herod Antipas and the Roman government. They wanted to trick  Jesus; they wanted to make him say something wrong, so they could show people that he taught wrong things and get him into trouble with the Roman government.
\v 14 After they arrived, they said to him, "Teacher, we know that you teach the truth. We also know that you are not concerned about what people say about you, even if an important person does not like what you say. Instead, you teach truthfully what God wants us to do. So tell us what you think about this matter: Is it right that we pay taxes to the Roman government, or not? Should we pay the taxes, or should we not pay them?"
\v 15 Jesus knew that they did not really want to know what God wanted them to do. So he said to them, "I know that you are just trying to make me say something wrong for which you can accuse me. But I will answer your question anyway. Bring me a coin so that I might look at it."

\v 13 Then they sent to him some of the Pharisees and some of the Herodians, to entrap him in speaking.
\v 14 When they came, they said to him, "Teacher, we know that you care for no one's opinion, and you do not show partiality between people. You truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not? Should we pay or not?"
\v 15 But Jesus knew their hypocrisy and said to them, "Why do you test me? Bring me a denarius so I can look at it."
