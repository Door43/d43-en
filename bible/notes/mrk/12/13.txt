So \add tell us what you think about this matter:\add* Is it right that we pay taxes to the Roman government, or not \f + \ft metonymy \f*? Should we pay the taxes, or should we not pay them?"
\v 15 Jesus knew that they did not really want to know \add what God wanted them to do\add*.

\v 13 The Jewish leaders sent to Jesus some Pharisees and some members of the party that supported Herod Antipas and the Roman government. They wanted to trick  Jesus; they wanted to make him say something wrong, so they could show people that he taught wrong things and get him into trouble with the Roman government.
\v 14 After they arrived, they said to him, "Teacher, we know that you teach the truth. We also know that you are not concerned about what people say about you, even if an important person does not like what you say. Instead, you teach truthfully what God wants us to do. So tell us what you think about this matter: Is it right that we pay taxes to the Roman government, or not? Should we pay the taxes, or should we not pay them?"
\v 15 Jesus knew that they did not really want to know what God wanted them to do. So he said to them, "I know that you are just trying to make me say something wrong for which you can accuse me. But I will answer your question anyway. Bring me a coin so that I might look at it."

\v 13 Then they sent to him some of the Pharisees and some of the Herodians, to entrap him in speaking.
\v 14 When they came, they said to him, "Teacher, we know that you care for no one's opinion, and you do not show partiality between people. You truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not? Should we pay or not?"
\v 15 But Jesus knew their hypocrisy and said to them, "Why do you test me? Bring me a denarius so I can look at it."
