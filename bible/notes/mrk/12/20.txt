\v 20 So here is an example. There were seven brothers in one family. The oldest one married a woman, but he and his wife did not bear any children. Then he later died.
\v 21 The second brother also married that woman, but he, too, did not bear any children. Then he later died. The third brother did like his other brothers did. But he also did not bear any children, and later died.
\v 22 Eventually all seven brothers married that woman one by one, but no one had any children, and one by one they died. Afterwards the woman died, too.
\v 23 Now on the day when people will become alive again after they die, whose wife will that woman be? Keep in mind that she had been married to all seven brothers!"

\v 20 There were seven brothers; the first took a wife and then died, leaving no children.
\v 21 Then the second took her and died, leaving no children. And the third likewise.
\v 22 And the seven left no children. Last of all the woman also died.
\v 23 In the resurrection, when they rise again, whose wife will she be? For all seven brothers had her as their wife."
