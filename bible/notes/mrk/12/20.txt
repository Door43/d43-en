\v 20 So here is an example. There were seven brothers in one family. The oldest one married a woman, but he and his wife did not bear any children. Then he later died.
\v 21 The second brother also married that woman, but he, too, did not bear any children. Then he later died. The third brother did like his other brothers did. But he also did not bear any children, and later died.
\v 22 Eventually all seven brothers married that woman one by one, but no one had any children, and one by one they died. Afterwards the woman died, too.
\v 23 Now on the day when people will become alive again after they die, whose wife will that woman be? Keep in mind that she had been married to all seven brothers!"

\v 20 There were seven brothers; the first took a wife and then died, leaving no children.
\v 21 Then the second took her and died, leaving no children, and the third likewise.
\v 22 The seven left no children. Last of all, the woman also died.
\v 23 In the resurrection, when they rise again, whose wife will she be? For all seven brothers had her as their wife."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **There were seven brothers** - The Sadducees propose a scenario to test Jesus. This is a hypothetical situation. AT: "Suppose there were seven brothers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **the first ... the second ... the third** - These numbers refer to each of the brothers and can be expressed as such. AT: "the first brother ... the second brother ... the third brother" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **The seven** - This refers to all the brothers. AT: "The seven brothers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **the first took a wife ... the second took her** - "the first married a woman ... the second married her." Here marrying a woman is spoken of as "taking" her.
  * **the third likewise** - It may be helpful to explain what "likewise" means. AT: "the third brother married her as his other bothers did, and he also died leaving no children" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **The seven left no children** - Each of the brothers married the woman and then died before he had any children with her. This can be stated clearly. AT: "Eventually all seven brothers married that woman one by one, but none of them had any children with her, and one by one they died" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **In the resurrection, when they rise again, whose wife will she be?** - The Sadducees are testing Jesus by asking this question. This can be written as a statement. AT: "Now tell us whose wife she will be in the resurrection, when they all rise again." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
