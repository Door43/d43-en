\v 22 Eventually all seven brothers married that woman one by one, but no one had any children, and one by one they died. Afterwards the woman died, too.
\v 23 Now on the day when people will become alive again after they die, whose wife will that woman be? Keep in mind that she had been married to all seven brothers!"

\v 20 There were seven brothers; the first took a wife and then died, leaving no offspring.
\v 21 Then the second married her and died, leaving no offspring. And the third likewise.
\v 22 And the seven left no offspring. Last of all the woman also died.
\v 23 In the resurrection, when they rise again, whose wife will she be? For all seven brothers had her as a wife."
