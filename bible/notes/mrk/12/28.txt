\v 28 A man who taught the \add Jewish\add* laws heard their discussion. He knew that Jesus answered the question well. So he stepped forward and asked Jesus, "Which commandment is the most important?"
\v 29 Jesus answered, "The most important commandment is this: 'Listen, \add you people of\add* Israel! \add You must worship\add* the Lord, our God, our only Lord.
\v 30 \add You must show that you love him in all the ways that you live\add*! Show it in all that you want and feel, in all that you think, and in all that you do!'
\v 31 The next \add most important commandment\add* is: 'You must love people you come in contact with as much as you love yourself.' No other commandment is more important than these two!"

\v 28 A man who taught the Jewish laws heard their discussion. He knew that Jesus had answered the Sadducees' question very well. So he stepped forward and asked Jesus, "Which commandment is the most important?"
\v 29 Jesus answered, "The most important commandment is this: 'Listen, O Israel! The Lord our God is one Lord.
\v 30 You must love the Lord your God in all that you want and feel, in all that you think, and in all that you do!'
\v 31 The next most important commandment is: 'You must love the people around you as much as you love yourself.' No other commandment is more important than these two!"

\v 28 One of the scribes came and heard their discussion; he saw that Jesus answered them well. He asked him, "What commandment is the most important of all?"
\v 29 Jesus answered, "The most important is, 'Hear, Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.
\v 30 You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.'
\v 31 The second commandment is this, 'You must love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other greater commandment than these."
