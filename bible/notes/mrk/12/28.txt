\v 28 One of the scribes came and heard their discussion; he saw that Jesus answered them well. He asked him, "What commandment is the most important of all?"
\v 29 Jesus answered, "The most important is, 'Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.
\v 30 You must love the Lord your God with all you heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.'
