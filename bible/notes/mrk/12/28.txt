\v 28 A man who taught the \add Jewish\add* laws heard their discussion. He knew that Jesus answered the question well. So he stepped forward and asked Jesus, "Which commandment is the most important?"
\v 29 Jesus answered, "The most important commandment is this: 'Listen, \add you people of\add* Israel! \add You must worship\add* the Lord, our God, our only Lord.
\v 30 \add You must show that you love him in all the ways that you live\add*! Show it in all that you want and feel, in all that you think, and in all that you do!'
\v 31 The next \add most important commandment\add* is: 'You must love people you come in contact with as much as you love yourself.' No other commandment is more important than these two!"

\v 28 A man who taught the Jewish laws heard their discussion. He knew that Jesus had answered the Sadducees' question very well. So he stepped forward and asked Jesus, "Which commandment is the most important?"
\v 29 Jesus answered, "The most important commandment is this: 'Listen, O Israel! The Lord our God is one Lord.
\v 30 You must love the Lord your God in all that you want and feel, in all that you think, and in all that you do!'
\v 31 The next most important commandment is: 'You must love the people around you as much as you love yourself.' No other commandment is more important than these two!"

\v 28 One of the scribes came and heard their discussion; he saw that Jesus answered them well. He asked him, "What commandment is the most important of all?"
\v 29 Jesus answered, "The most important is, 'Hear, Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.
\v 30 You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.'
\v 31 The second commandment is this, 'You must love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other greater commandment than these."

  * **Hear, Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one** - "Listen, O Israel! The Lord our God is one Lord" 
  * **with all your heart, with all your soul** - The "heart" and "soul" are a metaphor for a person's inner being and his desires and feelings. AT: "in all that you want and feel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **your mind, and with all your strength** - The "mind" refers to how a person thinks and "strength" refers to a person's strength to do things. AT: "in all that you think, and in all that you do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **love your neighbor as yourself** - Jesus uses this simile to compare how people are to love each other with the same love as they love themselves. AT: "love your neighbor as much as you love yourself" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
