\v 30 \add You must show that you love him in all the ways that you live\add*! Show it in all that you want and feel, in all that you think, and in all that you do!'

\v 28 One of the scribes came and heard their discussion; he saw that Jesus answered them well. He asked him, "What commandment is the most important of all?"
\v 29 Jesus answered, "The most important is, 'Hear, Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.
\v 30 You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.'
\v 31 The second commandment is this, 'You must love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other greater commandment than these."
