\v 32 The man said to Jesus, "Teacher, you have answered well. You correctly said that God is the only God and that there is no other God.
\v 33 You have also said correctly that we should love God in all that we want and feel, in all that we think, and in all that we do. And you have said correctly that we must love people with whom we come in contact as much as we love ourselves. And you have also correctly said that doing these things pleases God more than offering animals to him or burning other sacrifices."
\v 34 Jesus realized that this man had answered wisely. So he said to him, "You are close to the point where God will agree to rule over you." After that, the Jewish leaders were afraid to ask him any more questions like that to try to trick him.

\v 32 The scribe said, "Good, Teacher! You have truly said that God is one, and that there is no other besides him.
\v 33 To love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself, is even more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices."
\v 34 When Jesus saw that he had given a wise answer, he said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God." After that, no one dared to ask Jesus any more questions.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus compliments the scribe on his comment on what Jesus has said.

  * **Good** - "Good answer"
  * **God is one** - This means that there is only one God. AT: "there is only one God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **that there is no other** - The missing may be added. AT: "that there is no other God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **with all the heart ... all the understanding ... all the strength** - The "heart" is a metaphor for a person's inner being and his desires and feelings. "Understanding" refers to a person's thinking, and "strength" refers to a person's strength to do things. AT: "in all that we want and feel, in all that we think, and in all that we do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the heart ... the understanding ... the strength** - The word "the" is placed in these ellipses where the word "your" has been left out. It may be added. AT: "your heart ... your mind ... your strength" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **to love one's neighbor as oneself** - This simile compares how people are to love each other with the same love that they love themselves. AT: "to love your neighbor as much as you love yourself" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **is even more than** - This idiom means that something is more important than something else. In this case, these two commandments are more pleasing to God that burnt offering and sacrifices. This may be written clearly. AT: "is even more important than" or "is even more pleasing to God than" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **You are not far from the kingdom of God** - This can be stated in positive form. Here Jesus speaks of the man being ready to submit to God as king as being physically close to the kingdom of God, as if it where a physical place. AT: "You are close to submitting to God as king" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **no one dared** - This can be stated in positive form. AT: "everyone was afraid" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
