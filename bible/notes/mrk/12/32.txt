\v 32 The scribe said, "Good, Teacher! You have truly said that God is one, and that there is no other besides him.
\v 33 To love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself, is much more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices."
\v 34 When Jesus saw that he had given a wise answer, he said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God." After that no one dared to ask Jesus any more questions.
