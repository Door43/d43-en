\v 35 Later, while Jesus was teaching in the temple area, he said to the people, "How is it that those who teach the law say—and they are correct in saying—that the Messiah is the son of David?
\v 36 The Holy Spirit caused David to say about the Messiah, 'God said to my Lord, "Sit here beside me at my right hand, in the place where I will highly honor you above everyone else! Sit here while I completely defeat your enemies!"'
\v 37 In this Psalm of David he refers to the Messiah as 'Lord.' But how—as the teachers of the law correctly say—can the Messiah also be the son of David?" Many people listened to him gladly as he taught these things.

\v 35 Jesus responded, while he was teaching in the temple; he said, "How is it that the scribes say the Christ is the son of David?
\v 36 David himself, in the Holy Spirit, said,
\q 'The Lord said to my Lord,
\q sit at my right hand,
\q until I make your enemies your footstool.'
\m
\v 37 David himself calls him 'Lord,' so how can the Christ be David's son?" The large crowd gladly listened to him.

  * **Jesus responded, while he was teaching in the temple; he said** - Some time has passed and Jesus is now in the temple. This is not part of the previous conversation. AT: "Later, while Jesus was teaching in the temple area, he said to the people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **How is it that the scribes say the Christ is the son of David?** - Jesus uses this question to get the people to think deeply about the Psalm he is about to quote. This can be written as a statement. AT: "Consider why the scribes say the Christ is the son of David." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the son of David** - "a descendant of David"

  * **so how can the Christ be David's son?** - This can be written as a statement. AT: "so consider how the Christ can be a descendant of David" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
