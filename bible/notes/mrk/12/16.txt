\v 16 After they had brought him a coin, he asked them, "Whose picture is on this coin? And whose name is on it?" They replied, "It is a picture and the name of Caesar."
\v 17 Jesus said to them, "That is correct, so give to Caesar what belongs to him, and give to God what belongs to him." They were completely amazed by what he said.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **They brought one** - "The Pharisees and the Herodians brought a denarius"
  * **likeness and inscription** - "picture and name"
  * **They said, "Caesar's** - Here "Caesar's" refers to his likeness and inscription. AT: "They said, 'They are Caesar's likeness and inscription'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **Give to Caesar the things that are Caesar's** - Jesus is teaching that his people must respect the government by paying taxes. This figure of speech can be clarified by changing Caesar to Roman government. AT: "Give to the Roman government the things that belong to the Roman government" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **and to God** - It may be helpful to add the missing information. AT: "and give to God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **They marveled at him** - They were amazed at what Jesus had said. This can be made explicit. AT: "They marveled at him and at what he said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
