\v 26 But as to people becoming alive again after they die, in the book that Moses \add wrote, he said something about people who have died\add* that I am sure that you have read \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. When Moses \add was looking at\add* the bush \add that was burning\add*, God said to him, 'I am the God whom Abraham \add worships\add* and the God whom Isaac \add worships\add* and the God whom Jacob \add worships\add*.'
\v 27 It is not dead people who worship God. It is living people who worship him. \add Abraham, Isaac and Jacob died long before Moses lived, but God said that they were still worshipping him, so we know their spirits were still alive!\add* So your \add claim that dead people do not become alive again\add* is very wrong."

\v 26 But let me talk about people becoming alive again after they die. In the book that Moses wrote, he wrote about people who have died; I am sure that you have read it. When Moses was looking at the bush that was burning, God said to him, 'I am the God whom Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob worship.'
\v 27 Now it is not dead people who worship God. It is living people who worship him. So when you say that dead people do not become alive again, you are very wrong."

\v 26 But concerning the dead, that they are raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the account about the bush, how God spoke to him and said, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?'"
\v 27 He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are quite mistaken."
