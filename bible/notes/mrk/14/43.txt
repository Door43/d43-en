\v 43 Immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived, and a large crowd was with him with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.
\v 44 Now his betrayer had given them a sign, saying, "Whomever I kiss, he is the one. Seize him and lead him away under guard."
