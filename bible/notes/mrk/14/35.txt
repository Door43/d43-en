===== translationWords: =====

  * [[:en:obe:kt:hour]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:godthefather]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **if it were possible** - This means "if God would allow it."
  * **this hour might pass** - "This hour" refers to Jesus' time of suffering, both now in the garden and that which was about to happen. AT: "that he would not have to go through this time of suffering" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Abba** - "Abba" is a Greek term used by children to address their father. It implies a close relationship. Since it is followed by "Father," it is best to keep the Greek term "Abba." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_transliterate]])
  * **Remove this cup from me** - Jesus speaks of the suffering that he must endure as if it were a cup. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Father** - This is an important title for God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **But not my will, but yours** - Jesus is asking God to do what he wants to be done and not what Jesus wants. AT: "But do not do what I want, but do what you want" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
