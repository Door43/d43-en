===== translationNotes: =====

  * **this hour might pass** - "he might be strengthened to endure the suffering he was experiencing"
  * **Abba** - "Abba" is a Greek term that is used by children to address their father. It implies a close relationship. Since it already addresses Father, it might be important to keep the Greek term, "Abba." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **Remove this cup from me** - The cup refers to the wrath of God Jesus must endure. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Jesus...said, "Abba, Father...Remove this cup from me. But not my will, but yours."** - Jesus asked his Father to remove the suffering he would have to endure on the cross to die for all the sins of humanity, for all time. But the Father required the sacrifice of his only, perfect Son to satisfy his infinite holiness. So Jesus went to the cross.
  * **Father** - This is an important title for God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
