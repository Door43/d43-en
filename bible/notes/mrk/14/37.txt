\v 37 Then he returned and found his disciples sleeping. He woke them up and said, "Simon! Are you sleeping? Were you not able to stay awake for just a short time?"
\v 38 And he said to them, "You want to do what I say, but you are weak. So keep awake and pray so that you can resist when you are tempted!"
\v 39 Then he went away again and prayed again what he prayed before.

\v 37 He came back and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, "Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch for one hour?
\v 38 Watch and pray that you do not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **and found them sleeping** - The word "them" refers to Peter, James, and John.
  * **Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch for one hour?** - Jesus rebukes Simon Peter for sleeping. This can be written as a statement. AT: "Simon, you are asleep when I told you to stay awake. You could not even stay awake for one hour." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **that you do not enter into temptation** - Jesus speaks of being tempted as if it were entering into a physical place. AT: "that you are not tempted" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak** - Jesus warns Simon Peter that he is not strong enough to do what he wants to do in his own strength. AT: "You are willing in your spirit, but you are too weak to do what you want to do" or "You want to do what I say, but you are weak" 
  * **The spirit ... the flesh** - These refer to two different aspects of Peter. "The spirit" is his inmost desires. "The flesh" is his human ability and strength. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **used the same words** - "prayed again what he prayed before"
