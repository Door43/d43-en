  * [[:en:obe:kt:temple]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:testimony]]
===== translationNotes: =====

  * **brought false testimony against him** - Here speaking false testimony is described as if it were a physical object that someone can carry. AT: "accused him by speaking false testimony against him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **We heard him say** - "We heard Jesus say." The word "we" refers to the people who brought false testimony against Jesus and does not include the people to whom they are speaking. (See:  [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **made with hands** - Here "hands" refers to men. AT: "made by men ... without man's help" or "built by men ... without man's help" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **in three days** - "within three days." This means that the temple would be built within a three day period.
  * **will build another** - The missing word may be added. AT: "will build another temple" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **did not agree** - "contradicted each other.** - This can be written in positive form.
