===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - After the crowd of the chief priests, scribes, and elders lead Jesus to the high priest, Peter watches nearby while some stand to give false testimony against Jesus.

  * **There gathered with him all the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes** - This can be reordered so that it is easier to understand. "All of the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes had gathered there together"
  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a shift in the storyline as the author begins telling us about Peter.
  * **as far as the courtyard of the high priest** - As Peter followed Jesus, he stopped at the high priest's courtyard. This can be written clearly. AT: "and he went as far as the courtyard of the high priest" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **He sat among the guards** - Peter sat with the guards who were working at the courtyard. AT: "He sat in the courtyard among the guards" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
