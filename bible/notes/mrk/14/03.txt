\v 3 While Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he was reclining at table, a woman came to him having an alabaster jar of very costly liquid, which was pure nard. She broke the vial and poured it on his head.
\v 4 But there were some who were angry.  They spoke among themselves and said, "What is the reason for this waste?
\v 5 This perfume could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and given to the poor." And they were rebuking her.
