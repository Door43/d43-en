\v 3 Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon, who was known as a leper. While they were eating, a woman came to him. She was carrying a stone jar that contained expensive fragrant perfume called nard. She opened the jar and then poured all the perfume on Jesus' head.
\v 4 Some of the people who were present became angry and said to themselves, "It is terrible that she wasted that perfume!
\v 5 It could have been sold for almost a year's wages, and then the money could have been given to poor people!" So they scolded her.

\v 3 While Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he was reclining at table, there came in a woman having an alabaster vial which contained pure nard, which was very costly. She broke the vial and poured its contents on his head, to anoint him.
\v 4 But there were some who were angry about this; they spoke among themselves and said, "Why was this expensive ointment wasted like this?
\v 5 This perfume could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and the money given to the poor." And they were rebuking her.
