\v 3 Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon, who was known as a leper. While they were eating, a woman came to him. She was carrying a stone jar that contained expensive, fragrant perfume called nard. She opened the jar and then poured all the perfume on Jesus' head.
\v 4 Some of the people who were present became angry and said to themselves, "It is terrible that she wasted that perfume!
\v 5 It could have been sold for almost a year's wages and then the money could have been given to poor people!" So they scolded her.

\v 3 While Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he was reclining at the table, a woman came to him having an alabaster jar of very costly liquid, which was pure nard. She broke the jar and poured it on his head.
\v 4 But there were some who were angry. They spoke among themselves and said, "What is the reason for this waste?
\v 5 This perfume could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and given to the poor." Then they scolded her.
