\v 66 While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came to him.
\v 67 She saw Peter as he stood by a fire to keep warm, and she looked closely at him. Then she said, "You were also with the Nazarene, Jesus."
\v 68 But he denied it, saying, "I neither know nor understand what you are talking about." Then he went out into the courtyard.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - As Jesus had predicted, Peter denies Jesus three times before the rooster crows.

  * **below in the courtyard** - "outside in the courtyard" (UDB) 
  * **one of the servant girls of the high priest** - The servant girls worked for the high priest. AT: "one of the servant girls who worked for the high priest" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **denied** - This means to claim that something is not true. In this case, Peter was saying that what the servant girl said about him was not true.
  * **neither know nor understand what you are talking about** - Both "know" and "understand" have the same meaning here. The meaning is repeated to add emphasis to what Peter is saying. AT: "I really do not understand what you are talking about!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
