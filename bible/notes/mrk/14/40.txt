\v 40 When he returned, he found that they were sleeping again because they were so sleepy that they could not keep their eyes open. Because they were ashamed, they did not know what to say to him when he awakened them.
\v 41 Then he went and prayed again. He returned a third time; and he found them sleeping again. He said to them, "Go ahead and sleep.  Be rested. The time for me to suffer is about to begin. Look! Someone is about to enable sinful men to capture me, the Son of Man.
\v 42 So get up! Let's go! Look! Here comes the one who is enabling them to capture me!"

\v 42 Get up, let us go. Look, the one who betrays me is close.
