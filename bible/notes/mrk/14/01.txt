\v 1 It was only two days before the people would begin to celebrate the week-long festival that they called the Passover. During those days they also celebrated the festival which they called Unleavened Bread. The chief priests and the men who taught the Jewish laws were planning how they could arrest Jesus secretly and put him to death.
\v 2 But they were saying to one another, "We must not do it during the festival because if we do it then, the people will be very angry with us and riot!"

\v 1 It was now two days before the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread. The chief priests and the scribes were considering how they might stealthily arrest Jesus and then kill him.
\v 2 For they were saying, "Not during the feast, so that a riot does not arise among the people."
