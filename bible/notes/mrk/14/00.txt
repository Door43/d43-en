====== Mark 14 General Notes ======


=== Structure and format ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 14:27, 62, which are quotations from the Old Testament.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== The eating of the body and blood ==

To this day, this symbolic action is practiced in nearly all churches in remembrance of Christ's sacrifice for the [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sins]] of man.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Past Events ==

Parts of this chapter are a sequence of events that have already happen. In a given passage, Mark sometimes writes as if the events have already happened while other events are still in progress (even though they are complete at the time he writes). This can cause difficulty in translation by creating an illogical order of events. It may be necessary to make these consistent by writing as if all the events have already happened.

== "Son of Man" ==

Jesus refers to himself as the "Son of Man" in this passage.

== Abba ==
This is a phrase in Aramaic. Mark does not "translate" this phrase into Greek but chooses to "transliterate" or transfer it into Greek by substituting Greek letters for Aramaic letters. The translators of the ULB and UDB have not translated this word either. The translator should try to form the sounds of this word without translating its meaning.

== "I am" ==
This is a reference to the name of God, Yahweh. Jesus is explicitly claiming to be Yahweh. (see: [[:en:bible:notes:mrk:14:60|14:62]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
