===== translationNotes: =====

  * **bread** - This was a flat loaf of unleavened bread, which was eaten as part of the Passover meal.
  * **broke it** - This means that he broke the bread into pieces for the people to eat. AT: "broke it into pieces" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Take this. This is my body** - "Take this bread. It is my body." Though most understand this to mean that the bread is a symbol of Jesus' body and that it is not actual flesh, it is best to translate this statement literally. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_symlanguage]])
  * **He took a cup** - Here "cup" is a metonym for wine. AT: "He took the cup of wine" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **This is my blood of the covenant, the blood that is poured out for many** - The covenant is for the forgiveness of sins. This can be written more explicitly. AT: "This is my blood that confirms the covenant, the blood that is poured out so that many may receive the forgiveness of sins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **This is my blood** - "This wine is my blood." Though most understand this to mean that the wine is a symbol of Jesus' blood and that it is not actual blood, it is best to translate this statement literally. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_symlanguage]])
  * **Truly I say to you** - This indicates that the statement that follows is especially true and important. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mrk:03:28|3:28]].
  * **fruit of the vine** - "wine." This is a descriptive way to refer to wine.
  * **new** - Possible meanings are 1) "again" or 2) "in a new way"
