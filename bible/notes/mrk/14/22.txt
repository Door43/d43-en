===== translationNotes: =====

  * **bread** - This was a flat loaf of unleavened bread, which was eaten as part of the Passover meal.
  * **broke it** - This means that he broke the bread into pieces for the people to eat. AT: "broke it into pieces" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **He took a cup** - Here "cup" is a metonym for wine. AT: "He took the cup of wine" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **This is my blood of the covenant, the blood that is poured out for many** - The covenant is for the forgiveness of sins. This can be written more explicitly. AT: "This is my blood that confirms the covenant, the blood that is poured out so that many may receive the forgiveness of sins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **This is my blood** - "This wine is my blood." It is best to translate this literally, though most understand this to mean that the wine represents Jesus' blood and that the wine is not actual blood. 
  * **Truly I say to you** - This indicates that the statement that follows is especially true and important. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mrk:03:28|3:28]].
  * **fruit of the vine** - "wine." This is a descriptive way to refer to wine.
  * **new** - Possible meanings are 1) "again" or 2) "in a new way"
