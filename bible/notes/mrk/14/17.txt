===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - That evening as Jesus and the disciples eat the Passover meal, Jesus tells them that one of them will betray him.

  * **he came with the twelve** - It may be helpful to state where they came to. AT: "he came with the twelve to the house" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **lying down at the table** - In Jesus' culture, when people gathered to eat, they lay down on their sides, propping themselves up on pillows beside a low table. 
  * **Truly I say to you** - This indicates that the statement that follows is especially true and important. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mrk:03:28|3:28]].
  * **one by one** - This means that "one at a time" each disciple asked him. 
  * **Surely not I** - Possible meanings are 1) this was a question for which the disciples expected the answer to be "No" or 2) this was a rhetorical question that did not require a response. AT: "Surely, I am not the one who will betray you!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
