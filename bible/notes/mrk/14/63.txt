\v 63 The high priest tore his garments and said, "Do we still need witnesses?
\v 64 You have heard the blasphemy. What is your decision?" And they all condemned him as one who deserved death.
\v 65 Some began to spit on him and to cover his face and strike him and say to him, "Prophesy!" The officers took him and beat him.
