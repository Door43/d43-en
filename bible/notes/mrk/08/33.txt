===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **You do not care for the things of God, but for the things of people. **- Satan wants Jesus to avoid becoming God's sacrifice for mankind's sins; Peter is Jesus' friend, and doesn't want to see him die like this.  Jesus demands that Peter, and every follower, submit to what God intends.
  * **take up his cross **- Jesus is teaching that his followers will live each day as a sacrifice to God, and accept even their death, if that is what God wants from them that day.
