===== Translation Notes: =====

Just before this, Christ had told the disciples about his suffering, death, and resurrection that was coming. Peter rebuked him.

  * **You do not care for the things of God, but for the things of people. **- Satan wants Jesus to avoid becoming God's sacrifice for mankind's sins. Though Peter is Jesus' friend and doesn't want to see him die like this, Jesus demands that Peter submit to what God intends.
  * **take up his cross **- Jesus is teaching that his followers will live each day as a sacrifice to God, and accept even death, if that is what God wants for them that day.
