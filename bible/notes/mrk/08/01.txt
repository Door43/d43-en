\v 1 In those days, when there was again a great multitude, and they had nothing to eat, he called to him his disciples, and
says to them,
\v 2 I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat:
\v 3 and if I send them away fasting to their home, they will faint on the way; and some of them are come from far.
\v 4 And his disciples answered him, Whence shall one be able to fill these men with bread here in a desert place?
