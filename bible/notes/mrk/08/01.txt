\v 1 During those days, a large crowd of people gathered again. After they had been there for two days, they had no food to eat. So Jesus called the disciples to come close to him, and then he said to them,
\v 2 "This is the third day that these people have been with me, and they have nothing left to eat, so now I am very concerned for them.
\v 3 If I send them home while they are still hungry, some of them will faint on the way home. Some of them have come from far away."
\v 4 The disciples knew that he was suggesting that they give the people something to eat, so one of them replied, "We cannot possibly find food to satisfy this crowd. No one lives in this place!

\v 1 In those days, there was again a great crowd, and they had nothing to eat. Jesus called his disciples and said to them,
\v 2 "I have compassion on the crowd, because they continue to be with me already for three days and have nothing to eat.
\v 3 If I send them away to their home without eating, they may faint on the way. Some of them have come a long way."
\v 4 His disciples answered him, "Where can we get enough loaves of bread in such a deserted place to satisfy these people?"
