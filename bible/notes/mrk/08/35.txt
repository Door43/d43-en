\v 35 You must do that, because those who try to save their lives by denying that they belong to me will lose their lives. Those who are killed because they are my disciples and because they tell others the good news will live forever with me.
\v 36 People might get everything they want in this world, but they are really gaining nothing if they do not gain eternal life!
\v 37 Think carefully about the fact that there is absolutely nothing that people can give to God that would enable them to gain eternal life!

\v 35 For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake and for the gospel, will save it.
\v 36 What does it profit a person, to gain the whole world, and then forfeit his life?
\v 37 What can a person give in exchange for his life?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For whoever wants** - "For anyone who wants"
  * **life** - This refers to both physical life and spiritual life.
  * **for my sake and for the gospel** - "because of me and because of the gospel." Jesus is talking about people who lose their lives because they follow Jesus and the gospel. This can be stated clearly. AT: "because he follows me and tells others the gospel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **What does it profit a person, to gain the whole world, and then forfeit his life?** - This can be written as a statement. AT: "Even if a person gains the whole world, it will not benefit him if he forfeits his life." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **to gain the whole world** - The words "the whole world" are an exaggeration for great riches. AT: "if he gains everything he ever wanted" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **forfeit** - To forfeit something is to lose it or to have another person take it away.
  * **What can a person give in exchange for his life?** - This can be written as a statement. AT: "There is nothing a person can give in exchange for his life." or "No one can give anything in exchange for his life." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **What can a person give** - If in your language "giving" requires someone to receive what is given, "God" can be stated as the receiver. AT: "What can a person give to God"
