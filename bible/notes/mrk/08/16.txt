\v 17 Jesus was aware of this, and he said to them, "Why are you reasoning about not having bread? Do you not yet perceive? Do you not understand? Have your hearts become so dull?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **It is because we have no bread** - In this statement, it may be helpful to state that "it" refers to what Jesus had said. AT: "He must have said that because we have no bread" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **no bread** - The word "no" is an exaggeration. The disciples did have one loaf of bread ([[:en:bible:notes:mrk:08:14|8:14]]), but that was not much different from having no bread at all. AT: "very little bread" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **Why are you reasoning about not having bread?** - Here Jesus is mildly rebuking his disciples because they should have understood what he had been talking about. This can be written as a statement. AT: "You should not be thinking that I am talking about actual bread." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Do you not yet perceive? Do you not understand?** - These questions have the same meaning and are used together to emphasize that they do not understand. This can be written as one question or as a statement. AT: "Do you not yet understand?" or "You should perceive and understand by now the things I say and do." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and  [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Have your hearts become so dull?** - This metaphor refers to them not being open or willing to understand what Jesus meant. This can also be written as a statement. AT: "How are your hearts not open to understanding what I say?" or "Your hearts are not willing to understand." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
