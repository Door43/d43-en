===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the four thousand** - This refers to the 4000 people Jesus fed. AT: "the 4000 people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]]) 
  *   * **how many basketfuls did you take up** - It may be helpful to state when they collected the basketfuls. AT: "how many baskets full of broken pieces of bread did you collect after everyone finished eating" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
 * **Do you not yet understand?** - Jesus is mildly rebuking his disciples for not understanding. This can be written as a statement. AT: "You should understand what by now the things I say and do!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
