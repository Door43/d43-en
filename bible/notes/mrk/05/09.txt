===== translationNotes: =====

  * **And he asked him** - "And Jesus asked the unclean spirit"
  * **And he answered him, "My name is Legion, for we are many"** - One spirit was speaking for many here. He spoke of them as if they were a legion, a Roman army unit of about 6,000 soldiers. AT: "And the spirit said to him, 'Call us an army, for many of us are inside the man'" (See: [[: en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
