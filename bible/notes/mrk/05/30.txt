===== translationNotes: =====

  * **that power had gone out from him** - When the woman had touched Jesus and was healed, Jesus felt his power healing her. Jesus himself did not lose any of his power to heal people when the woman was healed. AT: "that his healing power had healed the woman"
  * **this crowd pressed around you** - This means they crowded around Jesus and pressed themselves together to be closer to Jesus. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mrk:05:21|5:24]].
