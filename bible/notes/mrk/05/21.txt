\v 21 Now when Jesus had crossed over again to the other side, in the boat, a great crowd gathered around him, as he was beside the sea.
\v 22 Then one of the leaders of the synagogue, named Jairus, came, and when he saw him, fell at his feet.
\v 23 He begged again and again, saying, "My little daughter is near death. I beg you, come and lay your hands on her that she may be made well and live."
\v 24 So he went with him, and a great crowd followed him and pressed close around him.
