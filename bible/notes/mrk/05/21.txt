\v 21 When Jesus crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a great crowd gathered around him, and he was standing beside the lake.
\v 22 One of the synagogue leaders, a man named Jairus, when he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet.
\v 23 He begged over and over, saying, "My little daughter is near death. I beg you, come and lay your hands on her that she may be made well and live."
\v 24 Jesus went with him and a great crowd followed him, and they pressed close around him.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **One of the synagogue leaders-**  This man held a very important and respected position within the synagogue so it would have been unexpected for him to seek out Jesus for help.
  * **he fell at his feet**  - This is an act of submission and humility. By doing this Jairus is admitting that Jesus can do something that he himself cannot.
  * **lay your hands on her**  - When Jarirus asked Jesus to lay hands on his daughter he was actually asking Jesus to come and pray for her and heal her.
