\v 25 There was a woman in the crowd who had a bleeding disorder. She had been bleeding every day for twelve years.
\v 26 She had suffered much over the years while doctors treated her. She had spent all her money to pay the doctors and after all they did to her, she got worse instead of better.
\v 27 When she heard that Jesus healed people, she came to where he was and pushed in the crowd close behind Jesus.

\v 25 Now there was a woman who's blood had flowed for twelve years.
\v 26 She had suffered a lot under many doctors and had spent everything that she had. Yet she was helped by nothing, but instead got worse.
\v 27 She had heard reports about Jesus. So she came up behind him when he was walking in the crowd, and she touched his cloak.
