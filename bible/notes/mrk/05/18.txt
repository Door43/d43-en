\v 18 The man who had been controlled by demon came to Jesus when he was getting in a boat, about to leave. The man asked him if he might go with him.
\v 19 Jesus did not permit him to come with them, but said, "Go to your house and to your people, and tell them what the Lord did for you, and what mercy he gave you."
\v 20 So the man went away and he proclaimed in the Decapolis what Jesus did for him. And they all were amazed.
