\v 18 And when he was getting into the boat, the demon-possessed man begged him that he may go with him.
\v 19 But Jesus did not allow it. Instead he said to him, "Go to your house and to your people, and tell them what the Lord did for you, and what mercy he gave you."
\v 20 So he went away and began to proclaim the great things that Jesus had done for him in the Decapolis, and everyone was amazed.
