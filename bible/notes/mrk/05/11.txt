\v 11 Now a great herd of pigs was there feeding on the hill,
\v 12 and they begged him, saying, "Send us into the pigs; let us enter into them."
\v 13 So he allowed them; the unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs, and they rushed down the steep hill into the sea, and about two thousand pigs drowned in the sea.
