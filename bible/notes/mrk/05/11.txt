\v 11 Now a great herd of pigs was there feeding on the hill.
\v 12 They implored him, saying, "Send us into the pigs; let us enter into them."
\v 13 He permitted them to do that. The unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs, and they rushed down the steep hill into the lake. There were about two thousand pigs that drowned in the lake.
