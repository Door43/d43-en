\v 17 After Jesus had left the crowd, he entered a house with the disciples. They questioned him about the parable that he had just spoken.
\v 18 He replied to them, "Did you not understand what it means? You ought to understand that nothing that enters us from outside can cause God to consider us defiled.
\v 19 Instead of entering and ruining our minds, it goes into our stomachs, and afterwards the refuse passes out of our bodies." By saying this, Jesus was declaring that people can eat any food without causing God to consider them defiled.

\v 17 Now when Jesus left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about the parable.
\v 18 Jesus said, "Are you also still without understanding? Do you not see that whatever enters into a person from outside cannot defile him,
\v 19 because it cannot go into his heart, but it goes into his stomach and then passes out into the latrine?" With this statement Jesus made all foods clean.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The disciples still do not understand what Jesus has just said to the scribes, Pharisees, and crowds. Jesus explains his meaning more thoroughly to them.

  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Jesus is now away from the crowd, in a house with his disciples.
  * **Are you also still without understanding?** - Jesus asked his disciples this question to help them to pay attention better. This can be expressed as a statement. AT: "After all I have said and done, I would expect you to understand." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Do you not see that whatever enters ... toilet?** - Jesus asks this question to teach his disciples. This is the beginning of rhetorical question that can be expressed as a statement. AT: "Whatever enters ... toilet." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **because it** - Here "it" refers to what goes into a person; that is, what a person eats.
  * **Jesus made** - "Jesus declared"
  * **all foods clean** - It may be helpful to explain clearly what this phrase means. AT: "all foods clean, meaning that people can eat anything without God considering the eater defiled" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
