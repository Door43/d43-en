\v 33 He took him aside from the crowd privately, and he put his fingers into his ears, and after spitting, he touched his tongue.
\v 34 He looked up to heaven; he sighed and said to him, "Ephphatha," that is to say, "Open!"
\v 35 Jesus made his ears so they could hear, and at once what had hold of his tongue was released, so he now spoke plainly.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **sighed** - took in and let out a long breath to show he was not happy
  * **what had hold of his tongue was released** - "Jesus released what had hold of his tongue" or "Jesus healed what had caused him not to speak clearly"
