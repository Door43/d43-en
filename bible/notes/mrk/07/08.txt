===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **He said, "You conveniently reject the commandment of God so you may keep your tradition!"**  - Jesus uses irony to point out that the religious people are more concerned about upholding tradition than they are doing what God said and intended.  This is ironic because the traditions were started to help people remember what God intended but have replaced that truth in some cases.
