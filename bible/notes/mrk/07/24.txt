\v 24 And from thence he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered into a house, and would have
no man know it; and he could not be hid.
\v 25 But straightway a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his
feet.
\v 26 Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. And she implored him that he would cast forth the demon out of her
daughter.
