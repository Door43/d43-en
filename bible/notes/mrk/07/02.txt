===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 2 They saw that some of his disciples ate bread with hands that were defiled, that is, unwashed.
\v 3 (For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands, because they hold to the tradition of the elders.
\v 4 When the Pharisees come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they bathe themselves, and they hold fast to many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pots, copper vessels, and the couches upon which they eat.)

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Verses 3 and 4 give background information about the Pharisees' washing traditions. The UDB uses a verse bridge to rearrange the information in verses 3 and 4 to make it easier to understand. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_versebridge]])

  * **They saw** - "The Pharisees and the scribes saw"
  * **that is, unwashed** - "that is, their hands were not washed" or "that is, they had not washed their hands" 
  * **elders** - Jewish elders were leaders in their communities and were also judges for the people.
  * **copper vessels** - "copper kettles" or "metal containers"
  * **the couches upon which they eat** - "benches" or "beds." At that time, the Jews would recline when eating.
