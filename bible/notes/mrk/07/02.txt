===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 2 And they saw that some of his disciples ate bread with hands that were defiled, that is, unwashed.
\v 3 (For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands, because they hold to the tradition of the elders.
\v 4 When the Pharisees come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they bathe themselves. And there are many other rules which they strictly follow, including the washing of cups, pots, copper vessels, and the couches upon which they eat.)

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Verses 3 and 4 give background information about the Pharisees' washing traditions. The UDB uses a verse bridge to rearrange the information in verses 3 and 4 to make it easier to understand.

  * **And they saw** - "And the Pharisees and the scribes saw"
  * **that is unwashed** - It may be helpful to add the missing information. AT: "that is, they ate with unwashed hands" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **elders** - Jewish elders were leaders in their communities and were also judges for the people.
  * **copper vessels** - "copper kettles" or "metal containers"
