\v 11-12 But you \add teach people that it is all right that people no longer must help their parents. You teach people that it is all right if people\add* give their things to God \add instead of giving them to their parents\add*. You allow them to say to their parents, 'What I was going to give to you \add to provide for you, I have now promised to\add* give to God. So I \add cannot any longer help you!\add*' As a result, you are \add actually telling people\add* that they no longer have to help their parents!
\v 13 And, by doing that, you disregard what God commanded! You teach your own traditions to others \add and tell them strongly that they should obey them\add*! And you do many other things like that."

\v 11 But you say, 'If a man says to his father or his mother, whatever help you would have received from me is Corban,' (that is to say, 'Given to God')—
\v 12 then you no longer require him to do anything for his father or his mother.
\v 13  You are making the commandment of God void by your tradition which you have handed down. And many similar things you do."
