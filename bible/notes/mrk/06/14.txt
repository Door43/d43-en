\v 14 Now King Herod Antipas heard about what Jesus was doing, because many people were talking about it. Some people were saying about Jesus, "He must be John the Baptizer! He has risen from the dead! That is why he has God's power to perform these miracles!"
\v 15 Others were saying about Jesus, "He is the ancient prophet Elijah, whom God promised to send back again." Others were saying about Jesus, "No, he is a different prophet, like one of the other prophets who lived long ago."

\p
\v 14 King Herod heard this, for Jesus' name had become well known. Some were saying, "John the Baptist had been raised from the dead and on account of this, these miraculous powers are at work in him."
\v 15 Some others said, "He is Elijah." Still others said, "He is a prophet, like one of the prophets in ancient times."
