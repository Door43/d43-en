\v 16 Having heard \add what the people were saying, King\add* Herod \add Antipas\add* himself repeatedly said, "The man \add performing those miracles\add* must be John! I \add commanded my soldiers to\add* cut off his head, but he has become alive again \add to get revenge for my killing him\add*!"

\v 16 But Herod heard this he said, "John, whom I beheaded, has been raised."
\v 17 For Herod himself had sent and arrested John and bound him in prison, because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, because Herod had married her.
