\v 48 And he saw that they were having great difficulty as they pulled against the oars because the wind was against them. Around the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea, and he wanted to pass by them.
\v 49 But when they saw him walking on the sea, they thought he was a ghost and cried out,
\v 50 because they saw him and were terrified. And immediately he spoke to them and said to them, "Be courageous! It is I! Do not be afraid!"
