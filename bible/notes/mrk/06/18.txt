\v 18 For John told Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."
\v 19 Herodias set herself against John and wanted to kill him. But she could not,
\v 20 for Herod feared John, and he knew that he was a righteous and holy man. So Herod tried to keep him safe. When he heard John preach, his message upset him, and yet he was still glad to hear him.
