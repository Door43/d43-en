\v 26 Though this deeply grieved the king, he could not refuse her request because of the oath he had made and because of his dinner guests.
\v 27 So the king sent a soldier from his guard and commanded him to bring him John's head. The guard went and beheaded him in the prison.
\v 28 He brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.
\v 29 And his disciples, hearing this, came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.
