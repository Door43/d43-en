\v 26 The king became very sorry, but because of his oaths, and for his guests, he could not refuse her request.
\v 27 So the king sent a soldier from his guard and commanded him to bring him John's head. The guard went and beheaded him in the prison.
\v 28 He brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.
\v 29 Hearing this, his disciples came and took his corpse and laid it in a tomb.
