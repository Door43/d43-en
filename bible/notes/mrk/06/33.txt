\v 33 But many people saw them leave and they recognized them. They ran there together on foot from all the towns, and they arrived there before them.
\v 34 When he came ashore, Jesus saw a great crowd; he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began to teach them many things.
