\v 30 The apostles gathered together around Jesus, and they told him all that they had done and taught.
\v 31 He said unto them, "Come away by yourselves into a deserted place and rest a while." For many were coming and going, and they took no time apart for leisure, not even time to eat.
\v 32 They went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves.
