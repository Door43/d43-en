\v 1 Jesus left Capernaum and went to his hometown, Nazareth. His disciples went with him.
\v 2 On the Sabbath, he entered the synagogue and taught the people. Many who were listening to him were amazed. They wondered where he gained all his wisdom and the power to perform miracles.
\v 3 They said, "He is just an ordinary carpenter! We know him and his family! We know Mary his mother! We know his younger brothers James, Joses, Judas and Simon! And his younger sisters also live here with us!" So they resented him.

\v 1 Jesus went out from there and came into his home town, and his disciples followed him.
\v 2 When the Sabbath day came, he taught them in the synagogue. Many who heard him were shocked. They said, "Where did he get these teachings?" "What is this wisdom that God gave him?"  "What are these miracles he does with his hands?"
\v 3 Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? Are his sisters not here with us?" And they took offense at Jesus.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? Are his sisters not here with us?** - "He is just an ordinary carpenter! We know him and his family! We know Mary his mother!  We know his younger brothers James, Joses, Judas and Simon! And his younger sisters also live here with us!" (UDB) This is a rhetorical question raising doubt as to why Jesus would be able to do all these things.
