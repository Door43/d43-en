  * **pick heads of grain** - The disciples picked the heads of grain to eat them. This can be worded to show the full meaning. AT: "pick and eat heads of grain" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **heads of grain** - This is the topmost part of the wheat plant, which is a kind of tall grass. It holds the mature grain or seeds of the plant.
  * **Look, why are they doing something that is not lawful on the Sabbath day?** - The Pharisees ask Jesus a question to condemn him. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "Look! They are breaking the Jewish law concerning the Sabbath." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Look** - "Look at this" or "Listen." This is a word used to get the attention of someone to show them something. If there is a word in your language that is used to draw a person's attention to something, you could use that here.
