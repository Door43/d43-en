===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **No man puts new wine into old wineskins** - This is a metaphor or parable to answer the question "Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?" ([[:en:bible:notes:mrk:02:17|2:17]]; See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **new wine** - "grape juice." This refers to wine that has not fermented yet. If grapes are unknown in your area, use the general term for fruit.
  * **old wineskins** - This refers to wineskins that have been used many times.
  * **wineskins** - These were bags made out of animal skins. They could also be called "wine bags" or "skin bags" (UDB).
  * **the wine would burst the skins** - When the new wine ferments and expands, they would tear open because they could no longer stretch out.
  * **lost** - "ruined" (UDB)
  * **fresh wineskins** - "new wineskins" or "new wine bags." This refers to wineskins that have never been used.
