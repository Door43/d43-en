<usfm>
\v 8 Jesus knew right away within himself that they were deliberating like that within themselves. So he said to them, "You should not question within yourselves \add whether I have the right to forgive this man's sins\add*!\f + \ft Or: Why do you question \add whether I have the right to forgive this man's sins\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 9 It is \add not risky\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* for someone to tell the man who is paralyzed, 'Your sins are forgiven \f + \ft Or:\add I\add* forgive your sins \f*,' \add because no one can prove that it has happened\add*. But no one would say to him, 'Get up, pick up your stretcher, and then walk away', \add unless he really had the power to heal him, because people can easily see whether it happens or not\add*.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **they were thinking within themselves** - The scribes were thinking each to himself; they were not talking to each other.
  * **Why are you thinking this in your hearts?** - Jesus is scolding the scribes for doubting his authority. Alternate translation: "You scribes are questioning my authority." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **hearts** - The word “heart” is often used to refer to a person's thoughts, emotions, desires, or will.  
  * **What is easier...?** - Jesus asked this question to remind the scribes that they believed that the man was paralyzed because of his sins and that if his sins were forgiven, he would be able to walk, so that when he healed the paralyzed man, the scribes would know that he could forgive sins. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **What is easier to say...'Your sins are forgiven' or to say 'Get up...and walk'?** - "Is it easier to say...'Your sins are forgiven'? Or is it easier to say 'Get up...and walk'?"
