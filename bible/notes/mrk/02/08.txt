====== Mark 02:8-9 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Jesus knew right away within himself that they were deliberating like that within themselves. So he said to them, "You should not question within yourselves \add whether I have the right to forgive this man's sins\add*!\f + \ft Or: Why do you question \add whether I have the right to forgive this man's sins\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 9 It is \add not risky\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* for someone to tell the man who is paralyzed, 'Your sins are forgiven \f + \ft Or:\add I\add* forgive your sins \f*,' \add because no one can prove that it has happened\add*. But no one would say to him, 'Get up, pick up your stretcher, and then walk away', \add unless he really had the power to heal him, because people can easily see whether it happens or not\add*.

\v 8 Jesus knew right away within himself what they were thinking. He said to them, "Why are you thinking these things?
\v 9 Which would be easier for me to say, 'I have forgiven your sins' or 'Get up! Take your sleeping pad and walk'?

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Immediately Jesus, knowing in his spirit what they were thinking within themselves, said to them, "Why are you thinking this in your hearts?
\v 9 What is easier to say to the paralyzed man, 'Your sins are forgiven' or to say 'Get up, take up your bed, and walk'?

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **they were thinking within themselves** - The scribes were thinking each to himself; they were not talking to each other.
  * **Why are you thinking this in your hearts?** - Jesus asks this question to reprove the scribes for doubting his authority. AT: "You should not question my authority!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **hearts** - The word "heart" is often used to refer to a person's thoughts, emotions, desires, or will.
  * **What is easier...walk'?** - Jesus asked this question because the scribes believed the man was paralyzed because of his sins and if the man's sins were forgiven, he would be able to walk. If Jesus healed the paralyzed man, the scribes would have to acknowledge Jesus can forgive sins. AT: "It is easier to say to the paralyzed man your sins are forgiven!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
