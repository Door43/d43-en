====== Mark 02:8-9 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Jesus knew right away within himself that they were deliberating like that within themselves. So he said to them, "You should not question within yourselves \add whether I have the right to forgive this man's sins\add*!\f + \ft Or: Why do you question \add whether I have the right to forgive this man's sins\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 9 It is \add not risky\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* for someone to tell the man who is paralyzed, 'Your sins are forgiven \f + \ft Or:\add I\add* forgive your sins \f*,' \add because no one can prove that it has happened\add*. But no one would say to him, 'Get up, pick up your stretcher, and then walk away', \add unless he really had the power to heal him, because people can easily see whether it happens or not\add*.

\v 8 Jesus knew right away within himself what they were thinking. He said to them, "Why are you thinking these things?
\v 9 Which would be easier for me to say, 'I have forgiven your sins' or 'Get up! Take your sleeping pad and walk'?

\v 8 Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit what they were thinking among themselves. He said to them, "Why are you thinking this in your hearts?
\v 9 What is easier to say to the paralyzed man, 'Your sins are forgiven' or to say 'Get up, take up your bed, and walk'?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **in his spirit** - "in his inner being" or "in himself" 
  * **they were thinking among themselves** - Each of the scribes was thinking to himself; they were not talking to each other.
  * **Why are you thinking this in your hearts?** - Jesus uses this question to tell the scribes that what they are thinking is wrong. AT: "What you are thinking is wrong." or "Do not think that I am blaspheming." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **this in your hearts** - The word "hearts" is a metonym for their inner thoughts and desires. AT: "this inside yourselves" or "these things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **What is easier to say to the paralyzed man ... take up your bed, and walk'?** - Jesus asked this question because the scribes believed the man was paralyzed because of his sins, and if the man's sins were forgiven, he would be able to walk. If Jesus healed the paralyzed man, the scribes would have to acknowledge that Jesus can forgive sins. Therefore, they would be acknowledging, too, that he was God. This question can be changed to a statement. AT: "It is easier to say to the paralyzed man 'Your sins are forgiven' than it is to say 'Get up, take up your bed, and walk!'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
