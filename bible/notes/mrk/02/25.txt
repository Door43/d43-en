<usfm>
\v 25 \add Jesus wanted to show them that the record in the Scriptures indicated that God permitted people to disobey certain religious laws when they needed food\add*. So he said to them, "\add It is written in the Scriptures\add* what \add our revered ancestor, King\add* David, did when he needed food, and both he and the men with him were hungry. You have read about that, but \add you do not think about what it implies.\f + \ft Or: why do you not think about what it implies\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 26 During the time Abiathar was high priest, David entered the big tent \add where people worshipped\add* God \add and asked for some bread. The high priest gave him some\add* of the loaves of bread. That bread was the bread he had presented to God. It was permitted in one of Moses' laws that only the priests could eat that bread! But David ate some of it. Then he also gave some of it to the men who were with him. \add But God did not consider that was wrong!\add*"

\v 25 Jesus said to them, "Have you never read the scriptures concerning King David and the men who were with him when they were hungry?
\v 26 During the time Abiathar was high priest, David entered the house of God and asked for some bread. The high priest gave him some of the bread that had been on display before God. According to our laws, only the priests could eat that bread! But David ate some of it. Then he also gave some of it to the men who were with him."

\v 26 how he went into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the bread of the presence, which it is unlawful for anyone to eat except the priests, and he even gave some to those who were with him?"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He said to them** - "Jesus said to the Pharisees"
  * **Have you never read what David ... those who were with him?** - Jesus asks this question to remind the scribes and Pharisees of something David did on the Sabbath. The question is very long, so it can be divided into two sentences. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Have you never read what David did when he was in need and hungry—he and the men who were with him—how he** - This can be stated as a command. AT: "Remember what you read about what David did when he and the men who were with him were in need and hungry, how he" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **read what David** - Jesus refers to reading about David in the Old Testament. This can be translated showing the implicit information. AT: "read in the scriptures what David" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **how he went into the house of God ... to those who were with him?** - This can be expressed as a statement separate from verse 25. AT: "He went into the house of God ... to those who were with him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **how he went** - The word "he" refers to David.
  * **bread of the presence** - This refers to the twelve loaves of bread that were placed on a golden table in the tabernacle or temple building as a sacrifice to God during Old Testament times.
