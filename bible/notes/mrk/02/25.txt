\v 25 \add Jesus wanted to show them that the record in the Scriptures indicated that God permitted people to disobey certain religious laws when they needed food\add*. So he said to them, "\add It is written in the Scriptures\add* what \add our revered ancestor, King\add* David, did when he needed food, and both he and the men with him were hungry. You have read about that, but \add you do not think about what it implies.\f + \ft Or: why do you not think about what it implies\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 26 During the time Abiathar was high priest, David entered the big tent \add where people worshipped\add* God \add and asked for some bread. The high priest gave him some\add* of the loaves of bread. That bread was the bread he had presented to God. It was permitted in one of Moses' laws that only the priests could eat that bread! But David ate some of it. Then he also gave some of it to the men who were with him. \add But God did not consider that was wrong!\add*"

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues teaching the Scribes and Pharisees about the Sabbath.

  * **Have you not even read what David...with him? How he went** - Jesus knew that the Scribes and Pharisees had read the story. He is accusing them of wilfully misunderstanding it. Alternate translations: "Remember what David...with him and how he went" or "If you had understood what David...with him, you would know that he went" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Abiathar** - One of the high priests during the time of David in Jewish history. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **How he went into the house of God** - "David entered the house of God" (UDB)
