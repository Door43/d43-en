\v 31 They discussed between themselves and argued and said, "If we say, 'From heaven'—he will say, 'Why then did you not believe him?'
\v 32 But if we say, 'From men'"—they feared the people, for they all held that John was a prophet.
\v 33 Then they answered Jesus and said, "We do not know." Then Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."
