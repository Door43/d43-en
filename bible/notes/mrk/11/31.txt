\v 31 They discussed between themselves, arguing, if we shall say, "From heaven," he will say, "Why then did ye not believe him?"
\v 32 But if we say, "From men'"â€”they feared the people; for they all held that John truly was a prophet.
\v 33 So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." And Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell by what authority I do these things."
