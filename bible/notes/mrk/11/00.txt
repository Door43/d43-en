== Colt ==

The way in which Jesus entered into Jerusalem, mounted on an animal, was similar to the way a king would have entered into a city after a great victory. It was traditional for the kings of Israel to ride on a donkey. There was also a donkey present with colt but it is unclear which animal Jesus rode. There was also a donkey present with colt but it is unclear which animal Jesus rode. It is best to translate this as it appears in the ULB without trying to reconcile these two passages. (See:[[:en:bible:notes:mat:21:01|Matthew 21:1-7]]).
