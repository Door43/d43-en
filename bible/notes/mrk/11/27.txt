===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The next day when Jesus returns to temple, Jesus gives the chief priests, scribes, and elders an answer to their question about his casting the money changers out of the temple area, by asking them another question which they were not willing to answer.

  * **By what authority do you do these things?** - The words "these things" refer to Jesus turning over the seller's tables in the temple and speaking against the things they did and taught. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **By what authority do you do these things? And who gave you the authority to do them?** - AT: "You do not have authority to do these things because we have not given you authority!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
