===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The next day when Jesus returns to temple, he gives the chief priests, scribes, and elders an answer to their question about his casting the money changers out of the temple area, by asking them another question, which they were not willing to answer.

  * **They came to** - "Jesus and his disciples came to"
  * **Jesus was walking in the temple** - This means that Jesus was walking around inside of the temple; he was not walking into the temple.
  * **They said to him** - The word "They" refers to the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.
  * **By what authority do you do these things, and who gave you the authority to do them?** - Both of these questions have the same meaning and are asked together to strongly question Jesus' authority. They can be combined. AT: "Who gave you authority to do these things?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **you do these things** - The words "these things" refer to Jesus turning over the sellers' tables in the temple and speaking against what the chief priests and scribes taught. AT: "you to do things like those you did here yesterday" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information]])
