\v 24 Therefore I say to you, Everything for which you ask in prayer, believe that you received it, and it will be yours.
\v 25 When you stand and pray, you must forgive whatever you have against anyone, so that your Father who is in heaven will also forgive you your transgressions.
\v 26 \f + \ft None of the early and best manuscripts include this verse; it appears to be an insertion by later copyists from Mt. 6:15.
\fqa But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your sins. \f*
