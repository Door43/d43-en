\v 13 He saw from a distance a fig tree with all its leaves, so he went \add to it\add* to see if he could find any \add figs\add* on it. But when he came to it, he found only leaves on it. This was because it was not yet time when \add normal fig trees have ripe\add* figs.
\v 14 \add But to illustrate how God would punish the nation of Israel,\add* he said to the tree, "No one shall ever eat from you again \add because you will no longer bear figs\add*." The disciples heard what he said.

\v 13 He saw in the distance a fig tree with all its leaves, so he went to it to see if he could find any figs on it. But when he came to it, he found no fruit on it, because it was not yet the season for figs to appear.
\v 14 He said to the tree, "No one will ever eat from you again." And the disciples heard this.

\v 13 He saw a fig tree off in a distance that was showing leaves, so he went to see if he could find any fruit on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.
\v 14 He spoke to it, "No one will ever eat fruit from you." His disciples heard what he said.
