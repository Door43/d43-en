\v 14 \add But to illustrate how God would punish the nation of Israel,\add* he said to the tree, "No one shall ever eat from you again \add because you will no longer bear figs\add*." The disciples heard what he said.

\v 13 And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find anything thereon: and when he came to it,
he found nothing but leaves; for it was not the season of figs.
