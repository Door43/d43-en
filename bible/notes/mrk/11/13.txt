\v 13 He saw in the distance a fig tree with all its leaves, so he went to it to see if he could find any figs on it. But when he came to it, he found no fruit on it, because it was not yet the season for figs to appear.
\v 14 He said to the tree, "No one will ever eat from you again." And the disciples heard this.

\v 13 He saw a fig tree off in a distance that was showing leaves, so he went to see if he could find any fruit on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.
\v 14 He spoke to it, "No one will ever eat fruit from you." His disciples heard what he said.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **He saw a fig tree**  - The word "He" refers to Jesus.  
    * **a fig tree**  - A fig tree is a kind of fruit tree found in dry places where it doesn't get too cold.  It has a large root system that allows it to live in places where there isn't a lot of water.  When Mark was written the fruit was a common food in the Middle East and western Asia.  Now it is popular throughout the world, though usually in a dried form which helps it to stay fresh longer. (See: [[en:ta:translate:translateunknowns]])
