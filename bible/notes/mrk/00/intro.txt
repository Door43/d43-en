=== What is the Book of Mark about? ===

The Gospel according to Mark is one of four books in the New Testament that describe some of the life of Jesus Christ, but focus especially on his work. The four Gospels emphasize different aspects of who Jesus was and what he did. It is probable that the book was written to defend the Jesus's importance despite his shameful death like a criminal. This would have also encouraged the Christians who were being persecuted in Rome. It seems clear that Mark had mainly Gentile, non-Christian readers in mind. 

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "The Gospel of Mark," or "The Gospel according to Mark." Or they may choose a title that may be clearer, for example, "The Good News about Jesus that Mark wrote." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])

=== Who wrote the Book of Mark? ===

The book does not give the reader the name of the author. Since early Christian times, however, it has been generally believed that the author was Mark, also known as John Mark, a close friend of Peter. Although Mark may not have been an eyewitness to the life of Jesus, many believe that Peter's testimony provided Mark with the information for this book. 

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== What were Jesus' teaching methods? ===

Jesus came to be regarded as a rabbi, a teacher of God's law, by the people. He followed some standard methods of other religious teachers in Israel: he had students, called disciples; he also made up parables, fictional stories, in order to teach various principles. 

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== Why does Mark often refer to Jesus as the "Son of Man"? ===

Mark shows Jesus as adopting this title for himself. It is a reference to Daniel 7:13–14, where a person described as "a son of man," that is, someone who looked like a human being, received authority from God to rule over the nations forever, and to be worshiped by all people forever. Besides being human, this person must also be God, because God would never allow someone other than himself to be worshiped. Because the Jews of Jesus' time did not use "Son of Man" as a title for anyone, Jesus used it for himself to help them come to understand who he was truly was.

Translating the title "Son of Man" can be difficult in many languages. A literal translation might be very misunderstood by readers. Translators can consider alternatives, such as "The Human One." An explanatory footnote might be useful also.


=== Why does Mark frequently use terms indicating short periods of time? ===

The Gospel of Mark uses the word "immediately" some forty-two times. This emphasizes the quickness of the events. This gives the reader the impression that it is a fast-paced account of the events.

=== What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Mark? ===

The text of some English translations do not agree concerning what to include. This is because of the discovery of more accurate manuscripts. The follow are the most significant issues in Mark:

  * "If any man has ears to hear, let him hear." (7:16) (so noted in ULB)
  * "where their worm never dies and the fire is never quenched" (9:44)(so noted in ULB)
  * "where their worm never dies and the fire is never quenched" (9:46) (so noted in ULB)
  * "And the scripture was fulfilled that says, 'He was counted with the lawless ones'" (15:28) (so noted in ULB)
  * (16:20) (so noted in ULB)


Translators are advised not to translate these passages. However, if older Bible versions exist in their region that have some of these verses, it is not wrong to translate them. If they are translated, they should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that they are probably not original to Mark's Gospel.

=== What are the Synoptic Gospels? ===

The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called the Synoptic Gospels because they share a large amount of textual material. However, the authors often used the same accounts and the same teachings of Jesus to emphasize different aspects of his life, ministry, and message.

When text is the same or almost the same among two or three gospels, it is said to be "parallel." When these parallel passages are translated, the wording in the project language should be kept the same as much as possible.
