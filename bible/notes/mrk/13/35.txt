\v 35 That man must always be ready, because he does not know whether his master will return in the evening, at midnight, when the rooster crows, or at dawn. Similarly, you also must always be ready, because you do not know when I will return.
\v 36 May it not happen that when I come suddenly, I will find that you are not ready!
\v 37 These words that I am saying to you disciples I am saying to everyone: Always be ready!"

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 35 Therefore stay alert, because you do not know when the master of the house will come home; it could be in the evening, at midnight, when the rooster crows, or in the morning.
\v 36 If he comes suddenly, do not let him find you sleeping.
\v 37 What I say to you I say to everyone: Watch!"
</usfm>
