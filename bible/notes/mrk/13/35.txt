\v 35 That man must always be ready, because he does not know whether his master will return in the evening, at midnight, when the rooster crows, or at dawn. Similarly, you also must always be ready, because you do not know when I will return.
\v 36 May it not happen that when I come suddenly, I will find that you are not ready!
