\v 7 Whenever people tell you about wars \add that are close\add* or wars that are far away, do not be troubled. \add God has said\add* that those things must happen. \add But when they do happen, do not think\add* that \add God\add* will finish all \add that he has planned\add* at that time!
\v 8 \add Groups who live in various\add* countries will fight each other, and various governments will fight each other. There will also be \add big\add* earthquakes in various places; and there will be famines. Yet, \add when these things happen, people will have only just begun to suffer. The first things that they suffer will be like\add* the first pains a woman \add suffers\add* who is about to bear a child. \add They will suffer much more after that\add*.

\v 7 When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be troubled, these things must take place, but the end is not yet.
\v 8 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in different places. There will be famines. These are the beginnings of birth pains.
