\v 7 Whenever people tell you about wars \add that are close\add* or wars that are far away, do not be troubled. \add God has said\add* that those things must happen. \add But when they do happen, do not think\add* that \add God\add* will finish all \add that he has planned\add* at that time!
\v 8 \add Groups who live in various\add* countries will fight each other, and various governments will fight each other. There will also be \add big\add* earthquakes in various places; and there will be famines. Yet, \add when these things happen, people will have only just begun to suffer. The first things that they suffer will be like\add* the first pains a woman \add suffers\add* who is about to bear a child. \add They will suffer much more after that\add*.

\v 7 When you hear the sound of soldiers fighting battles, or when you hear news about wars that are far away, do not be troubled. These things will definitely happen. But when they do happen, do not think that God will finish all that he has planned at that time!
\v 8 Groups who live in various countries will fight each other, and various kings and leaders will fight each other. There will also be earthquakes in various places, and there will be famines. Yet, when these things happen, people will have only just begun to suffer. These first things that they suffer will be like the first pains a woman suffers who is about to bear a child. They will suffer much more after that.

\v 7 When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not worry; these things must happen, but the end is not yet.
\v 8 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in many places, and famines. These are the beginnings of birth pains.
