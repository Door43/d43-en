\v 11 And when they lead you to judgment, and deliver you up, be not anxious beforehand what you shall speak: but
whatever shall be given you in that hour, that speak you; for it is not you that speak, but the Holy Spirit.
\v 12 And brother shall deliver up brother to death, and the father his child; and children shall rise up against parents, and
cause them to be put to death.
\v 13 And you shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that endures to the end, the same shall be saved.
