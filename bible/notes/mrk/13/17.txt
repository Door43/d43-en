\v 18-19 In those days people will suffer very severely. People have never suffered like that since the time when God first created the world until now; and people will not suffer that way again. So pray that this painful time will not happen in winter, when it will be hard to travel.
\v 20 If the Lord God had not decided that he would shorten that time when people suffer so much, everyone would die. But he has decided to shorten that time because he is concerned about the people whom he has chosen.

\v 17 How miserable it will be for those who are pregnant or nursing babies in those days.
\v 18 Pray that your escape not be in winter.
\v 19 The affliction in those days will be like nothing that has been since the beginning of creation, which God created, until now and never again will be.
\v 20 Unless the Lord shortened the days, no one would have been saved, but on account of the elect whom he chose, he shortened the days.
