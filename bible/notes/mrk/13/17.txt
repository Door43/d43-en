\v 18-19 In those days people will suffer very severely. People have never suffered like that since the time when God first created the world until now; and people will not suffer that way again. So pray that this painful time will not happen in winter, when it will be hard to travel.
\v 20 If the Lord God had not decided that he would shorten that time when people suffer so much, everyone would die. But he has decided to shorten that time because he is concerned about the people whom he has chosen.

\v 17 But woe to those who are with child and to those who are nursing infants in those days!
\v 18 Pray that that it might not occur in the winter.
\v 19 For there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning, when God created the world, until now, no, nor ever will be again.
\v 20 Unless the Lord had shortened the days, no flesh would be saved, but for the sake of the elect, those he chose, he shortened the number of the days.
