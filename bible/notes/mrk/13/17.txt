\v 17 But woe to those who are with child and to those who are nursing infants in those days!
\v 18 Pray that it might not occur in the winter.
\v 19 For there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning, when God created the world, until now, no, nor ever will be again.
\v 20 Unless the Lord had shortened the days, no flesh would be saved. But for the sake of the elect, those whom he chose, he cut short the days.

  * **shortened** - This word does not mean that the days will be less than 24 hours each, but rather that they will be fewer days of suffering.

  * **sake** - "well-being"
  * **the elect, those whom he chose** - The phrase "those whom he chose" means the same thing as "the elect." Together, they emphasize that God chose these people.
