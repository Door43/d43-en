\v 17 But woe to those who are with child and to those who are nursing infants in those days!
\v 18 Pray that that it might not occur in the winter.
\v 19 For there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning, when God created the world, until now, no, nor ever will be again.
\v 20 Unless the Lord had shortened the days, no flesh would be saved, but for the sake of the elect, those he chose, he shortened the number of the days.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **great tribulation **- Jesus is preparing the disciples, and we who believe in Jesus through their teaching, for the real persecution to come just before Jesus returns. This is different than the trouble that wars, famines and natural disasters which happen from time to time will cause. It is much worse than that, and there will never be more troubles than the great tribulation will cause.
