\p
\v 14 When you see the abomination of desolation standing where it should not be standing (let the reader understand), let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains,
\v 15 let him who is on the housetop not go down into the house or take anything out of it,
\v 16 and let him who is in the field not return to take his cloak.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the abomination of desolation** - This phrase is from the book of Daniel. His audience would have been familiar with this passage and the prophesy about the abomination entering the temple and defiling it. AT: "the shameful thing that defiles the things of God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **standing where it should not be standing** - Jesus' audience would have known that this refers to the temple. This can be made explicit. AT: "standing in the temple where it should not be standing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **let the reader understand** - This is not Jesus speaking. Matthew added this to get the readers' attention, so that they would listen to this warning. AT: "may everyone who is reading this pay attention to this warning" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **on the housetop** - Housetops where Jesus lived were flat, and people could stand on them.
  * **not return** - This refers to returning to his house. This can be made explicit. AT: "not return to his house" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **to take his cloak** - "to get his cloak"
