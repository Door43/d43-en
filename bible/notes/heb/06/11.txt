===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 We greatly desire each of you to continue to fully expect to receive what God has provided for you, until you finally receive everything from him.
\v 12 I do not want you to be lazy. Instead, I want you to do what other believers have done, those who are receiving what God promised them, because they trusted in him and were patient.

\v 11 And we greatly desire that each of you may show the same diligence to the very end with full assurance of confidence.
\v 12 We do not want you to become  sluggish, but rather that you be imitators of those who  inherit the promises because of faith and patience.
