\v 14 He said \add to Abraham\add*, "I will certainly bless you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add*, and I will certainly increase \add the number of\add* your \add descendants\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f*."
\v 15 As a result, after Abraham patiently waited \add for God to do what he promised\add*, he obtained what \add God\add* promised him.

\v 13 When God promised to do great things for Abraham, since God could not promise to fulfill all that he had promised by any name greater than his own name, God said that He himself would be the One to make sure his promises to Abraham were all fullfilled.
\v 14 He said to Abraham, "I will certainly bless you and I will certainly increase the number of your descendants into great numbers."
\v 15 As a result, after Abraham patiently waited for God to do what he promised, he obtained the beginnings of what God promised him.

\v 13 For when God made his promise to Abraham, since he could not swear by anyone greater, he swore by himself,
\v 14 saying, "I will certainly bless you, and I will exponentially multiply your descendants."
\v 15 And thus, after waiting patiently, Abraham obtained what was  promised.
