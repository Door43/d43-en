====== Hebrews 06:9-10 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 Although I am writing \add to you\add* like this as a \add warning\add*, I am certain concerning you whom I love that \add you are doing\add* better than that. Specifically, I am certain that \add you are doing\add* the things that are appropriate \add for those whom God\add* has saved.
\v 10 Since God always acts justly \f + \ft litotes \f*, he will not overlook all you have done \add for him. He will also not overlook\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add your showing that you love\add* him by the way you helped your fellow believers and \add by the way you still\add* help them. \add Instead, God will reward you for doing good deeds\add*.

\v 9 You can see that I am warning you, dear friends, not to reject Christ. At the same time, I am certain that you are doing better than that. You are doing the things that are right for those whom God has saved.
\v 10 Since God always acts justly, he will not overlook all you have done for him; he will not overlook how you have loved and helped your fellow believers, and how you are still helping them.

\v 9 But we are convinced about better things concerning you, beloved ones, things that also cause salvation.
\v 10 For God is not so unjust as to forget your work and the love that you have shown for his name, because you served the believers and still serve them.
