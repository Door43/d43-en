\v 1 So, we\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* must not keep \add discussing\add* the elementary principles about Christ. Instead, we must proceed \add to the teaching that will make us spiritually\add* mature \f + \ft metonymy \f*. We must not \add be people who always need someone to teach them\add* the elementary truths\add about Christ that are like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a foundation. \add I am referring to the teaching that people who do sinful\add* things, things that \add those who are spiritually\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* dead do, must turn away from their sinful behavior. \add I am referring to the teaching\add* that people must believe in God.
\v 2 \add I am referring to the teaching about what\add* various \add Jewish and Christian\add* rituals for purifying people \add signify. I am referring to the teaching about how elders enable people to receive spiritual gifts by\add* laying hands \add on them\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. \add I am referring to the teaching that God will\add* \add cause\add* those who have died to live again\f + \ft Or: raise people from the dead \f*. And \add I am referring to the teaching that God\add* will judge \add some people and punish them\add* eternally.
\v 3 \add Instead of continuing to discuss these elementary truths\add*, we\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* \f + \ft Or: I \f* will \add go on to give people mature teaching\add*, if God allows it.

<usfm>
\v 1-3 So, we must not keep discussing what we first learned about Christ, things that all believers must learn at first. Some of these things are how to stop sinning and how to start trusting in God. There are also important things we teach about various kinds of baptism, why we often pray while putting our hands on each other; and also about how God will raise us all from the dead and judge everyone in a way that will last forever. Indeed, we will discuss these things again later, if God gives us the chance to do it. But now we must discuss things that are harder to understand; these are things that will help us to trust in Christ in all times, no matter what happens.

\c 6
\p
\v 1 So then, leaving what we first learned about the message of Christ, we must press on to maturity, not again laying out the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith in God,
\v 2 nor the foundation of teaching about baptisms, laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.
\v 3 We will also do these things if God permits.
