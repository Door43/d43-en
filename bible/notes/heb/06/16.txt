====== Hebrews 06:16-18 ======

<usfm>
\v 16 \add Keep in mind that when people promise something\add*, they ask a more important person to punish them if they do not do what they promise. Furthermore, when people ask God to punish them \add if they do not tell the truth\add*, that causes the people who are disputing to stop disputing.
\v 17 So, when God wanted to demonstrate very clearly to us\f + \ft Or: to those people \f* who would receive what he had promised that he would not change what he had purposed \add to do\add*, he solemnly guaranteed that he would declare himself guilty if he did not do what he promised.
\v 18 He did that to strongly encourage us as a result of our \add knowing\add* that \add God has done\add* two things that cannot change. \add Namely, he promised to bless us, and he solemnly declared that he would declare himself guilty if he did not bless us\add*. We \add know\add* that God, who did those things, cannot lie. We have fled \add to him\add* in order that we might continue confidently to expect to receive what he promised us.

\v 16 Keep in mind that when people promise something, they ask a more important person to punish them if they do not do what they promise. This is how they often settle disputes.
\v 17 So when God wanted to demonstrate very clearly to us who would receive what he had promised that he would not change what he had planned to do, he said that he would declare himself guilty if he did not do what he promised.
\v 18 He did that to strongly encourage us, because he has done two things that cannot change: He promised to help us, and he told us that he would declare himself guilty if he did not help us. Now, God cannot lie. That is why we have trusted in him, just as he has encouraged us to do.

\v 16 For people swear by someone greater than themselves. At the end of each of their disputes, an oath serves as confirmation.
\v 17 When God decided to show more clearly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable quality of his purpose, he guaranteed it with an oath.
\v 18 He did this so that by two unchangeable things—with which it is impossible for God to lie—we, who have fled for refuge, will have a strong encouragement to hold firmly to the hope set before us.
