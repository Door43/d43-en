\v 8 But \add what will happen to believers who do deeds\f + \ft Or: things \f* that do not please God will be like what happens to land\add* on which \add only\add* thorns and thistles grow \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add Such land\add* is worthless.

\v 7 Think about this: God has blessed the  land on which rain has frequently fallen and on which plants grow that are useful for the people who worked the land. Similarly, it is those believers who have received God's Good News and who obey Jesus who please God, whom God will bless.
\v 8 But what will happen to believers who do not obey God is like what happens to land on which only thorns and thistles grow. Such land is worthless. It has become land that the farmer will curse and burn away its plants.

\v 7 For the land which has received the rain that often falls upon it, and produces a crop useful for those who worked the land, receives a blessing from God.
\v 8 But if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and will be cursed and burned.
