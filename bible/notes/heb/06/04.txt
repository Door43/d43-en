\v 4 \add I will explain why it is important to do that. Some\add* people have at one time fully understood \add the message about Christ\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. They have experienced \add a relationship with Jesus Christ\add* that God [EUP\f + \ft Or: MTY \f*] gave \add to them\add*. They have received the Holy Spirit the same as \add others have\add*.
\v 5 They have experienced that God's message is good. And by what they have experienced \add now\add*, they know how \add God will work\add* powerfully in the future. If those people reject \add the message about Christ\add*, it will not be possible for anyone to persuade them to turn away from their sinful behavior again!
\v 6 What those \add believers who later renounce the message about Christ do is as though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* they themselves are nailing the Son of God to a cross again! They are causing others to publicly despise Christ.

\v 4 I will explain why it is important to do this. Some people have at one time understood the message about Christ. They learned what it was like for God to forgive them and for Christ to love them, and they received gifts from the Holy Spirit.
\v 5 They found for themselves that God's message is good, and they learned how God will work powerfully in the future.
\v 6 But now, if these people reject Christ, no one will be able to persuade them to stop sinning and to trust in him again! That is because it is as though these people have nailed the Son of God to his cross again! They are causing people to despise Christ in front of others.

\v 4 For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, who tasted the heavenly gift, who were sharers of the Holy Spirit,
\v 5 and who tasted God's good word and the powers of the age to come,
\v 6 and who then fell awayâ€”it is impossible to restore them again to repentance. This is  because they have crucified for themselves the very Son of God again, making him an object of public ridicule.
