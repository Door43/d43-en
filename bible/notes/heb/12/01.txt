\v 1 We \add know about\add* many people like that\add who showed they trusted in God\add*. They are like a crowd of spectators \add who are cheering for us inside a stadium\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Knowing that, we must put away all the things that hinder us, \add as a runner puts aside everything that would hinder him because they are heavy\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Especially we must put away sinful actions that \add hinder us, as a runner\add* sets aside clothes he does not need, clothes that would entangle him \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Let us \add wholeheartedly strive to achieve what God has planned for us, as someone\add* in a race wholeheartedly runs the course that is before him \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 2 And let us \add keep our minds on\add* Jesus, \add as a runner\add* keeps his eyes on \add the goal\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. He is the one we should imitate concerning how he perfectly trusted \add God. When he died on\add* the cross he endured it when he suffered greatly \f + \ft metonymy \f*, instead of \add thinking about the things he would\add* rejoice about \add later\add*. He disregarded being disgraced by \add dying that way\add*. He is now sitting at the place of highest honor \f + \ft metonymy \f* at the throne \add where God rules\add*.


\p
\v 3 \add Jesus\add* patiently endured it when sinful people acted so hostilely against him. Compare yourselves with him so that you do not give up \add trusting\add* God or become discouraged.

\v 1 We know about many people like these who proved that they trusted in God. So we also must put away everything that hinders us. Especially we must stop doing anything that would keep us back, like a runner who takes off his clothes. Then let us patiently do everything that God gives us to do until we cross the finish line.
\v 2 And let us keep thinking about Jesus. He endured the intense suffering on the cross and ignored the people who shamed him. He did this because he knew how joyful God would make him later. He now sits at the place of highest honor beside the throne where God rules in heaven.


\p
\v 3 Jesus patiently endured it when sinful people hatefully acted against him. Strengthen your hearts and minds with Jesus' example so that you will not give up trusting God or become discouraged.

\p
\v 1 Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a large cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight and sin that clings closely to us. Let us patiently run the race that is placed before us.
\v 2 Let us pay attention to Jesus, the beginner and perfecter of faith. For the joy that was placed before him, he endured the cross, despised its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
\v 3 For think of him who has endured such opposition from sinners against himself, so that your hearts do not become discouraged and you give up.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Because of this great number of Old Testament believers, the author talks of the life of faith that believers should live with Jesus as their example.
  * **General Information:** - The words "we" and "us" refer to the author and his readers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]]) The word "you" is plural and here refers to the readers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **we are surrounded by such a large cloud of witnesses** - The writers speaks about the Old Testament believers as if they were a cloud that surrounded the present-day believers. This can be stated in active form. AT: "such a large cloud of witnesses surrounds us" or "there are so many examples of faithful people about whom we learn in the scriptures" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) 
  * **witnesses** - The word "witnesses" here refers to the Old Testament believers talked about in chapter 11 who came before the race of faith that believers now run.
  * **let us lay aside every weight and easily entangling sin** - Here "weights" and "easily entangling sin" are spoken of as if a person could take them off himself and put them down. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **every weight** - Attitudes or habits that keep believers from trusting and obeying God are spoken of as if they were loads that would make it difficult for a person to run. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **beginner and perfecter** - "creator and finisher." This means that Jesus is the source of a believer's faith. He is the one in whom believers trusts, and he will also ensure that believers reach their goal.
  * **the joy that was placed before him** - The joy that would belong to Jesus is spoken of as if God the Father had placed it before him to reach as a goal. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
