<usfm>
\v 12 So, instead of acting as though you were spiritually tired out, trust God's discipline to renew you.
\v 13 Go straight forward following Christ so that believers who are weak in trusting Christ will gain strength from you and not leave God's way. Instead, they will be spiritually restored as an injured and useless limb is restored.

===== Translation Notes: =====

The followers of Jesus are like runners in a race ([[:en:bible:notes:heb:12:01|12:1]]) who have gotten tired. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

    * **lift up your hands that hang down and make your weak knees strong again**  - A person who faces challenges in life is like a tired runner whose hands and knees have become weak. AT: "strengthen yourself like a racer strengthens his body when he is determined to finish a race"
    * **make straight paths for your feet**  - Obeying God is like walking on a smooth straight path. AT: "do what God wants you to do"
    * **whoever is lame**  - AT: "whoever wants to quit" 
    * **be led astray** - "follow someone down the wrong path." AT: "will not decide to do things that are easy but do not honor God"
    * **rather be healed** - "instead become strong"
