\v 27 The words "again, one more time" indicate that things \add on earth\add* will be shaken \f + \ft Or:that \add he\add* will shake things \add on earth\add* \f*, meaning that he will set aside all that \add he\add* has created, in order that the things \add in heaven\add* that cannot be shaken \f + \ft Or:that nothing can shake \f* may remain forever.
\v 28 So, let us thank God that we are becoming members of a kingdom that nothing can shake. Let us worship\f + \ft Or: serve \f* God in a way that pleases him by being greatly in awe \f + \ft doublet \f* before him.
\v 29 Remember that the God we \add worship\f + \ft Or: serve \f*\add* is like a fire that burns up everything \add that is impure\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*!

\v 27 The words "again, one more time" indicate that God will remove those things on earth that he will shake, everything that he has created. He will do this in order that the things in heaven that cannot shake may remain forever.
\v 28 So let us thank God that we are becoming members of a kingdom that nothing can shake. Let us worship God by gratefully thanking him and by being greatly in awe of his great power and love.
\v 29 Remember that the God we worship is like a fire that burns up everything that is impure!

<usfm>
\v 27 These words, "One more time," mean the removal of those things that can be shaken, that is, of the things that have been created, so that the things that cannot shaken will remain.
\v 28 Therefore, receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be grateful and in this manner worship God with reverence and awe.
\v 29 For our God is a consuming fire.
