\v 10 Our natural fathers disciplined us for a short time just like they considered right, but God always disciplines us to help us. He does it so that we may be holy as he is.
\v 11 During the time that God is disciplining us, that does not seem to be something about which we should rejoice. Instead, it is something that pains us. But later it causes those who have learned from it to be peaceful and to \add live\add* righteously.

\v 9 Furthermore, we had earthly fathers to discipline us, and we respected them. Should we not even more so obey the Father of spirits and live?
\v 10 For our fathers indeed disciplined us for a few years as it seemed right to them, but God disciplines us for our good so that we can share in his holiness.
\v 11 No discipline seems pleasant at present but instead painful. Nevertheless, it later produces peaceful fruit of righteousness for those who have been trained by it.
