\v 9 Furthermore, our natural fathers disciplined us \add when we were young\add*, and we respected them for doing that. So we should certainly more readily accept God our spiritual Father disciplining us, with the result that we live eternally!\f + \ft Or: shouldn't we more readily accept \add God\add*, our spiritual Father, \add disciplining us\add*, with the result that we live \add eternally\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 10 Our natural fathers disciplined us for a short time just like they considered right, but God always disciplines us to help us. He does it so that we may be holy as he is.
\v 11 During the time that God is disciplining us, that does not seem to be something about which we should rejoice. Instead, it is something that pains us. But later it causes those who have learned from it to be peaceful and to \add live\add* righteously.

\v 9 Furthermore, we had fathers in the flesh as disciplinarians, and we respected them. Should we not even more so obey the Father of spirits and live?
\v 10 For our fathers indeed disciplined us for a few days as it seemed right to them. But God does so for our good so that we can share in his holiness.
\v 11 No discipline seems pleasant at the time; instead, it seems painful. But it later yields peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.
