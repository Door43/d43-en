\v 9 Furthermore, our natural fathers disciplined us \add when we were young\add*, and we respected them for doing that. So we should certainly more readily accept God our spiritual Father disciplining us, with the result that we live eternally!\f + \ft Or: shouldn't we more readily accept \add God\add*, our spiritual Father, \add disciplining us\add*, with the result that we live \add eternally\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 10 Our natural fathers disciplined us for a short time just like they considered right, but God always disciplines us to help us. He does it so that we may be holy as he is.
\v 11 During the time that God is disciplining us, that does not seem to be something about which we should rejoice. Instead, it is something that pains us. But later it causes those who have learned from it to be peaceful and to \add live\add* righteously.

\v 9 Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?
\v 10 For they indeed for a few days chastened us as seemed good to them; but he for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness.
\v 11 All chastening seems for the present to be not joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yieldeth peaceful fruit to them that have been exercised thereby, even the fruit of righteousness.
