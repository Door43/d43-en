\v 25 See that you do not refuse the one who is speaking. For if they did not escape when they refused the one who warned them on earth, we will certainly not escape if we turn away from the one who warns from heaven.
\v 26 At that time his voice shook the earth. But now he has promised and said, "Yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also the heavens."

===== Translation Notes: =====

Having contrasted the Israelites' experience at Mount Sinai with the the believers' experience after Christ died, the writer reminds us that we have the same God who warns us today.

     * **shook...shake** - Use the word for what an earthquake does to move the ground and to destroy buildings.
     * **you** - the readers (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]]) 
    * **if they did not escape**  - AT: "if the people of Israel did not escape judgment" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
    * **we** - the writer and the readers  (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
    * **the one who warns...he has promised**  - "God, who warns...God has promised"
