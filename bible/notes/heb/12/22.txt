\v 22 Instead, you have come to the presence of God who truly lives in heaven, to the "New Jerusalem." That is like what your ancestors did when they came to worship God on Mount Zion in Israel, upon which the earthly Jerusalem was built. You have come to where there are countless angels who are rejoicing as they have gathered together.
\v 23 You have joined the assembly of all the believers who have privileges as firstborn sons, whose names God has written down in heaven. You have come to God, who will judge everyone. You have come to where the spirits of God's people are, people who lived righteously before they died, and whom God has now made perfect in heaven.
\v 24 You have come to Jesus, who arranged a new covenant between us and God by the blood that flowed when he died on the cross. Jesus' blood made it possible for God to forgive us, and his blood is better than was Abel's blood.

\v 22 Instead, you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to ten thousands of angels in celebration.
\v 23 You have come to the assembly of all the firstborn registered in heaven, to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous who have been perfected.
\v 24 You have come to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks better than Abel's blood.
