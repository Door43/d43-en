\v 22 But you have come to mount Zion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable hosts of angels,
\v 23 and to the general assembly, the church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of righteous men made complete,
\v 24 and to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks better than Abel's blood.
