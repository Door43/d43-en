\v 18 In coming \add to God\add* you have not \add experienced things like what the Israelite people experienced\add* at Sinai Mountain. \add They\add* approached \add a mountain that God told them they\add* should not touch. \add They approached\add* a blazing fire, and it was gloomy and dark \f + \ft doublet \f*, and there was a hurricane\f + \ft Or: cyclone \f*.
\v 19 They heard a trumpet sounding and they heard \add God\add* speak. The result was that those who heard it pleaded for him not to speak to them like that again.
\v 20 When \add God\add* commanded them saying, "If \add a person or\add* even an animal touches this mountain, \add you\add* must \add kill him\f + \ft Or: it \f* by\add* throwing stones at him\f + \ft Or: it \f*," they were terrified.
\v 21 Truly, because Moses was terrified after seeing what happened \add on the mountain\add*, he said, "I am trembling because I am very afraid!"

\v 18 In coming to God, you have not experienced things like what the Israelite people experienced at Mount Sinai. They approached a mountain that God commanded them not to touch because he himself had come down to that mountain. They approached a blazing fire, and it was gloomy and dark, with a violent storm.
\v 19 They heard a trumpet sound, and they heard God speak a message. It was so powerful that they  pleaded for him not to speak to them like that again.
\v 20 For God had commanded them, "If a person or even an animal touches this mountain, you must kill him." The people were terrified.
\v 21 Truly, because Moses was terrified after seeing what happened on the mountain, he said, "I am trembling because I am very afraid!"

\v 18 For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched, a mountain of burning fire, darkness, gloom, and storm.
\v 19 You have not come to trumpet blasts, or to words from a voice that caused those hearing it to beg that not another word be spoken to them.
\v 20 For they could not bear what was commanded: "If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned."
\v 21 So fearful was this sight that Moses said, "I am so terrified that I am trembling."
