\v 18 For you have not come to a mount that might be touched, a mount that has burned with fire, and blackness, and darkness, and storm.
\v 19 There was the sound of a trumpet, and a voice which those who heard it begged that not one more word should be spoken to them.
\v 20 For they could not endure the commandment they were given, "If even a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned."
\v 21 And so fearful was this sight, that Moses said, "I am so filled with fear that I tremble."
