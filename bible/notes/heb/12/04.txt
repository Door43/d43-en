\v 4 You have not yet resisted to blood, struggling against sin.

\q "My son, do not lightly regard the chastening of the Lord,
\q Nor faint when you are disciplined by him;"
\q
\v 6 For whom the Lord loves he disciplines,
\q And  he punishes every son whom he receives.

===== Translation Notes: =====


The author of Hebrews has been comparing the Christian life to a race.

    * **not yet resisted to blood** - This is said in a negative way to emphasize their persecution is slight. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]]) 
    * **resisted to blood** - "resisted to death." This phrase means a person does what is right even if he were killed because of it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **the encouragement which instructs you** - The words "the encouragement" refer to the encouraging writings of Solomon in the Old Testament. These writings help a person understand how to be encouraged during times of discipline by the Lord. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
    * **as sons** - Sometimes “sons” is used figuratively in the New Testament to refer to  believers in Christ. As a result of belief, they are now “sons of God” and are entitled to the inheritance that is reserved for sons. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **do not lightly regard** - AT: "respect." This is said in a negative way to emphasize it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
    * **the chastening of the Lord** - "when the Lord criticizes you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
    * **nor faint** - AT: "nor quit" or "nor become discouraged." - Someone faints when he feels weak and falls down because he can no longer stand.  This is used to refer to a person's becoming weak in his willingness to do what the Lord expects because it is too difficult. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
    * **the Lord disciplines anyone whom he loves, and he punishes every son whom he receives** - AT: "anyone the Lord receives as a son, he loves and will discipline." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) Both phrases mean basically the same thing.
