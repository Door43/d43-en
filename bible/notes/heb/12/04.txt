\v 4 You have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin:
\v 5 and you have forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with sons,
\q My son, regard not lightly the chastening of the Lord,
\q Nor faint when you are reproved of him;
\q
\v 6 For whom the Lord loves he chasteneth,
\q And scourges every son whom he receiveth.
