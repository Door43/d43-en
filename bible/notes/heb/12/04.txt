\v 4 You have not yet resisted to blood, struggling against sin.
\v 5 And you have forgotten the encouragement which instrcts you as sons,
\q "My son, do not lightly regard the chastening of the Lord,
\q Nor faint when you are disciplined by him;"
\q
\v 6 For whom the Lord loves he disciplines,
\q And  he punishes every son whom he receives.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **resisted to blood** - This phrase means a person does what is right even if they are killed because of it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **the encouragement which instructs you** - The words "the encouragement" refer to the encouraging writings of Solomon. These writings help a person understand how to be encouraged during hard times. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
    * **as sons** - Sometimes “son” is used figuratively in the New Testament to refer to an believer in Christ. As a result of their belief, they are now “sons of God” and are entitled to the inheritance that is reserved for sons. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **do not lightly regard** - AT: "respect" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
    * **the chastening of the Lord** - AT: "when the Lord criticizes you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
    * **nor faint** - AT: "or quit" or "or become discouraged" - Someone faints when they feel weak and fall down because they can no longer stand.  This is used to refer to a person becoming weak in their willingness to do what the Lord expects because it is too difficult. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
    * **the Lord disciplines anyone whom he loves, and he punishes every son whom he receives** - Both phrases mean basically the same thing.  AT: "anyone the Lord receives as a son, he loves and will discipline" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
