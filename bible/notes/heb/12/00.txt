=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Discipline ==
God disciplines his children in the same way parents discipline or correct their children. This imagery is used because discipline is out of love. Different cultures may have different standards of parental discipline, some of which may be unbiblical. God's discipline is the way he uses different circumstances to correct his children and to bring them to [[:en:obe:kt:repent|repentance]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]).

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

Many different figures of speech are used, which is more common to poetic writings than in narrative. The author uses this style of writing as away to teach people.
