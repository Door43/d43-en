\v 12 \add Beware of being insincere about doing this\add*, because the message God \add has given us\add* very powerfully penetrates our thinking more than a two-edged sword \add penetrates flesh\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. It penetrates \add deeply\add* into our souls and spirits, as \add a sharp sword can penetrate\add* into our joints and marrow. That \add is, by it God\add* \f + \ft personification \f* discerns all that we think about, and he discerns all that we desire \add to do\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* \f + \ft Or: \add His message\add* exposes\add to us\add* all our thoughts and all our desires \f*.
\v 13 God knows everything about everyone. Everything is completely exposed \f + \ft doublet \f* to him, \add and he is\add* the one \f + \ft synecdoche \f* who will say whether he approves of what we have done.

<usfm>
\v 12 God's words are alive and powerfully penetrate our human minds and diviide our thoughts from God's thoughts, like a sharp, two-edged sword pentrates a body and divides flesh from bones. God's words expose what is our hearts, what is right and what is wrong in our thinking and motives
\v 13 God knows everything about everyone. Nothing is hidden from him. Everything is completely exposed to him and he is the one to whom we will ultimately explain our lives and choices.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword.  And it pierces even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and is able to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart.
\v 13 No creature is hidden from God's  sight. But everything is naked and laid open before his eyes, to whom we are accountable.
