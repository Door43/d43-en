====== Hebrews 04:12-13 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 \add Beware of being insincere about doing this\add*, because the message God \add has given us\add* very powerfully penetrates our thinking more than a two-edged sword \add penetrates flesh\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. It penetrates \add deeply\add* into our souls and spirits, as \add a sharp sword can penetrate\add* into our joints and marrow. That \add is, by it God\add* \f + \ft personification \f* discerns all that we think about, and he discerns all that we desire \add to do\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* \f + \ft Or: \add His message\add* exposes\add to us\add* all our thoughts and all our desires \f*.
\v 13 God knows everything about everyone. Everything is completely exposed \f + \ft doublet \f* to him, \add and he is\add* the one \f + \ft synecdoche \f* who will say whether he approves of what we have done.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 God's words are alive and powerfully penetrate our human minds and divide what makes us alive from the part of us that reaches out to God. It is like a sword that cuts away our joints from the inside of our bones. God's words expose what is in our hearts, what is right and what is wrong in our thinking and motives.
\v 13 God knows everything about everyone. Nothing is hidden from him. Everything is completely exposed to him and he is the one to whom we will ultimately defend how we have lived.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword. It pierces even to the division of soul from spirit, and joints from marrow. It is able to know the heart's thoughts and intentions.
\v 13 Nothing created is hidden before God. Instead, everything is bare and open to the eyes of the one to whom we must give account.

  * **sharper than any two-edged sword** - A two-edged sword can easily cut through a person's flesh. God's word is very effective in showing what is in a person's heart and thoughts. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **two-edged sword** - the blade of a sword that is sharp on both edges
  * **know the heart's thoughts and intentions** - The word of God exposes even our secret thoughts. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])

  * **bare and open** - These two words mean basically the same thing and emphasize that nothing is hidden from God. (See:[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]], [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
