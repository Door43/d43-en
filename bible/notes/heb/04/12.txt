\v 12 \add Beware of being insincere about doing this\add*, because the message God \add has given us\add* very powerfully penetrates our thinking more than a two-edged sword \add penetrates flesh\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. It penetrates \add deeply\add* into our souls and spirits, as \add a sharp sword can penetrate\add* into our joints and marrow. That \add is, by it God\add* \f + \ft personification \f* discerns all that we think about, and he discerns all that we desire \add to do\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* \f + \ft Or: \add His message\add* exposes\add to us\add* all our thoughts and all our desires \f*.
\v 13 God knows everything about everyone. Everything is completely exposed \f + \ft doublet \f* to him, \add and he is\add* the one \f + \ft synecdoche \f* who will say whether he approves of what we have done.

\v 12 God's words are alive and powerful, and they are able to cut like a sharp sword—cutting so deep that it can separate out the difference between our soul and our spirit. God's words are just like a sword that cuts deeply, down so deep they can cut into us like a sharp sword cuts through the joints of an animal. Those words cut even into the hardest places in us, like a sword that can cut down into the marrow within the bones. God's words are like a judge, deciding what thoughts are good or what thoughts are bad, and his words test the motives hidden deep within each of our hearts.
\v 13 God knows everything about everyone. Nothing is hidden from him. Everything is completely open to him and he sees everything we do. We must all appear before God and we must tell him how we have lived our lives.

<usfm>
\v 12 For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword. It pierces even to the division of soul from spirit, and joints from marrow. It is able to know the heart's thoughts and intentions.
\v 13 Nothing created is hidden before God. Instead, everything is bare and open to the eyes of the one to whom we must give account.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the word of God is living** - Here "word of God" refers to anything that God has communicated to humanity whether through speech or through written messages. AT: "the words of God are living" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **living and active** - This speaks about God's word as if it were alive. It means when God speaks, it is powerful and effective. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **sharper than any two-edged sword** - A two-edged sword can easily cut through a person's flesh. God's word is very effective in showing what is in a person's heart and thoughts. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **two-edged sword** - the blade of a sword that is sharp on both edges
  * **It pierces even to the division of soul from spirit, and joints from marrow** - This continues speaking about God's word as if it were a sword. Here the sword is so sharp that it can cut through and divide parts of the human that are very difficult or even impossible to divide. This means that there is nothing inside of us that we can hide from God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **soul from spirit** - These are two different but closely related nonphysical parts of a human. The "soul" is what causes a person to be alive. The "spirit" is the part of a person that causes him to be able to know and believe in God.
  * **joints from marrow** - The "joint" is what holds two bones together. The "marrow" is the center part of the bone.
  * **It is able to know** - This speaks about God's word as if it were a person who could know something. AT: "God's word exposes" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **the heart's thoughts and intentions** - This speaks about the heart as if it were the center of thought and emotion within a person. AT: "what a person is thinking and intends to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Nothing created is hidden before God** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Nothing that God has created can hide from him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **everything is bare and open** - This speaks about all things as if they were a person standing bare, or a box that is open. AT: "everything is completely exposed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **bare and open** - These two words mean basically the same thing and emphasize that nothing is hidden from God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **to the eyes of the one to whom we must give account** - God is spoken of as if he had eyes. AT: "to God, who will judge how we have lived" (See: [[::en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
