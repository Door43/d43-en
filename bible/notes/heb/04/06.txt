\v 6 Some people still enter God's rest. But the Israelites who first heard God promise that they would rest—they did not enter that place of resting, because they refused to believe God.
\v 7 But God set another time when we may enter that place of resting. That time is now! We know that is true because much later than when the Israelites rebelled against God in the desert, he caused King David to write what I have already quoted,
\q "Right now, when you understand what God is saying to you, do not stubbornly disobey him."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 6 Therefore, because it is still reserved for some to enter his rest, and since many Israelites who heard the good news did not enter it because of disobedience, 
\v 7 God has again set a certain day called, "Today." After many days, he spoke through David, as it was earlier said,
\q "Today if you hear his voice,
\q do not harden your hearts."

  * **it is still reserved for some to enter his rest** - The peace and security provided by God are spoken of as if they were rest that he can give, and as if they were a place to which people could go. This can be stated in active form. AT: "God still allows some people to enter his place of rest" or "God still allows some people to experience his blessings of rest" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]], [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Today if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:heb:03:07|3:7-8]].
