\v 6 Some people still enter God's rest. But the Israelites who first heard God promise that they would rest—they did not enter that place of resting, because they refused to believe God.
\v 7 But God set another time when we may enter that place of resting. That time is now! We know that is true because much later than when the Israelites rebelled against God in the desert, he caused King David to write what I have already quoted,
\q "Right now, when you understand what God is saying to you, do not stubbornly disobey him."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 6 Therefore, since God's rest is still reserved for some to enter, and since many Israelites who heard the good news did not enter it because of disobedience, 
\v 7 God has again set a certain day, called "Today." After a long time, he spoke through David, as it was earlier said,
\q "Today if you will listen to his voice,
\q do not harden your hearts."
