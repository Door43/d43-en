<usfm>
\v 8 If Joshua had led the Israelites to enter the place of resting, God would not have spoken later about another \add time when we could rest\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add So we know God was speaking about another time when some people would enter that place of resting eternally\add*.
\v 9 So, just like \add God rested on\add* the seventh day \add after he finished making everything\add*, there remains a time when God's people will rest eternally.
\v 10 Specifically, whoever enters God's place of resting has ceased doing things\add to gain God's favor\add*, just like God ceased doing his work \add of creating everything\add*.


\p
\v 11 God severely punished the \add Israelites because they disbelieved his message\add*. So we must strive to experience entering that\add place of\add* resting \add eternally\add*, in order that he will not severely punish any of us for not believing \add his message\add*.

\v 8 If Joshua had led the Israelites to enter the place of resting, God would not have spoken later about another time when we could rest. So we know God was speaking about another time when some people would enter that place of resting eternally.
\v 9 So, just as God rested on the seventh day after he finished creating everything, there remains a time when God's people will rest eternally.
\v 10 Whoever enters God's place of resting has ceased from his work, just as God finished doing his work of creating everything.


\p
\v 11 So we eagerly enter into the rest of God by following Christ, so that the example of those who disobey will not influence us and ruin us too.

\p
\v 8 For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken about another day.
\v 9 Therefore there is still a Sabbath rest reserved for God's people.
\v 10 For he who enters God's rest has himself also rested from his deeds, as God did from his.
\v 11 Therefore let us be eager to enter that rest, so that no one will fall in the kind of disobedience that they did.
