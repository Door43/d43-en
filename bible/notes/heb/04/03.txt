====== Hebrews 04:3-5 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 We who have believed\add in Christ\add* are able to enter the place of resting \add eternally. We know there is a place where we will rest eternally\add* because God said,
\q Because I was angry with them, I solemnly declared, "They will not enter \add the land where\add* I would let them rest."
\p \add God said that\add* even though he ceased his work\add of creating things\add* after he created the world.
\v 4 What someone wrote somewhere \add in the Scriptures\add* about the seventh day\add after he had spent six days creating the world\add*, supports that,
\q Then, on the seventh day, God rested from his work \add of creating everything\add*.
\p
\v 5 But note again what God said about the Israelites\add in the\add* passage that I quoted previously,
\q They will not enter\add the land where\add* I would let them rest.

\v 3 We who have believed in Christ are able to enter the place of rest because God said,
\q "Because I was angry with the people of Israel, I solemnly declared, 'They will not enter the land where I would let them rest.' "
\p God said this even though his plans had been finished from the time he created the world.
\v 4 What was written in the Scriptures about the seventh day after he had spent six days creating the world, shows that this is true:
\q "Then, on the seventh day, God rested from his work of creating everything."
\p
\v 5 But note again what God said about the Israelites in the passage that I quoted previously:
\q "They will not enter the land where I would let them rest."

\v 3 For we, the ones who have believedâ€”we are the ones who will enter that rest, just as it says:
\q "As I swore in my wrath,
\q They will not enter my rest."
\p He said this, even though his created works had been finished from the beginning of the world.
\v 4 For he has said somewhere concerning the seventh day, 
\q "God rested on the seventh day from all his deeds."
\v 5 Again he has said,
\q "They will not enter my rest."
