\v 1 \add The Israelites did not enter the place where they would rest\add*. But \add God\add* has still promised us that we can enter the place of resting \add in heaven eternally\add*. So we must beware \add of the possibility\add* that \add God\add* may consider that some of you have failed to enter the \add place of\add* resting \add eternally as the Israelites did not enter the place where they would rest\add*.
\v 2 We have heard the message\add about Christ\add*, just like \add the Israelites\add* heard \add what God promised\add*. But \add just like\add* the message did not benefit \add most of\add* those who heard it because they did not believe it as \add Joshua and Caleb did, it\add* will not\add benefit us eternally if we do not keep believing it\add*.

\p
\v 1 Let us fear therefore, unless anyone of you should fall short of the promise of entering into his rest.  .
\v 2 For indeed we have had the good news preached to us, even as they also did. But they did not profit from it when they heard it because of their lack of faith.
