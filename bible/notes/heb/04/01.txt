====== Hebrews 04:1-2 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 \add The Israelites did not enter the place where they would rest\add*. But \add God\add* has still promised us that we can enter the place of resting \add in heaven eternally\add*. So we must beware \add of the possibility\add* that \add God\add* may consider that some of you have failed to enter the \add place of\add* resting \add eternally as the Israelites did not enter the place where they would rest\add*.
\v 2 We have heard the message\add about Christ\add*, just like \add the Israelites\add* heard \add what God promised\add*. But \add just like\add* the message did not benefit \add most of\add* those who heard it because they did not believe it as \add Joshua and Caleb did, it\add* will not\add benefit us eternally if we do not keep believing it\add*.

\v 1 God has promised that we would rest, but we must be careful, because we can miss God's place of rest.
\v 2 We have heard the good news about how Jesus gives us God's rest, just as the Israelites heard God promise that they would rest in Canaan. But just as that message did not help many Israelites because they did not trust God as Joshua and Caleb did, the good news about Christ will not help us if we do not trust God.

\c 4
\p
\v 1 Therefore, let us be very careful so that none of you might seem to have failed to reach the promise left behind for you to enter God's rest.
\v 2 For we were told the good news just as they were. But that message did not benefit those who did not unite in faith with those who obeyed.
\f + \ft Other versions read, \fqa But that message did not benefit those who heard it without joining faith to it. \fqb \f*

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Chapter 4 continues the warning to believers starting in [[:en:bible:notes:heb:03:07|3:7]]. God, through the writer, gives believers a rest of which God's rest in the creation of the world is a picture.

  * **Therefore** - "Since God will certainly punish those who do not obey" ([[:en:bible:notes:heb:03:16|3:19]])
  * **none of you might seem to have failed to reach the promise left behind for you to enter God's rest** - God's promise is spoken of as if it were a gift that God left behind when he visited the people. AT: "none of you fail to enter into God's rest, which he promised to us" or "God will allow you all to enter into his rest as he promised us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to enter God's rest** - The peace and security provided by God are spoken of as if they were rest that he can give, and as if they were a place to which people could go. AT: "to enter the place of rest" or "to experience God's blessings of rest" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For we were told the good news just as they were** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "For we heard the good news just as they did" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **as they were** - Here "they" refers to the Hebrews' ancestors who were alive during the time of Moses.
  * **But that message did not benefit those who did not unite in faith with those who obeyed** - "But that message did not benefit those who did not join with the people who believed and obeyed." The author is talking about two groups of people, those who received God's covenant with faith, and those who heard it but did not believe. This can be stated in positive form. AT: "But that message benefited only those who believed and obeyed it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
