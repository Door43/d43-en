<usfm>
\v 1 \add The Israelites did not enter the place where they would rest\add*. But \add God\add* has still promised us that we can enter the place of resting \add in heaven eternally\add*. So we must beware \add of the possibility\add* that \add God\add* may consider that some of you have failed to enter the \add place of\add* resting \add eternally as the Israelites did not enter the place where they would rest\add*.
\v 2 We have heard the message\add about Christ\add*, just like \add the Israelites\add* heard \add what God promised\add*. But \add just like\add* the message did not benefit \add most of\add* those who heard it because they did not believe it as \add Joshua and Caleb did, it\add* will not\add benefit us eternally if we do not keep believing it\add*.

\v 1 God has promised that we would rest, but we must be careful, because we can miss God's place of rest.
\v 2 We have heard the good news about how Jesus gives us God's rest, just as the Israelites heard God promise that they would rest in Canaan. But just as that message did not help many Israelites because they did not trust God as Joshua and Caleb did, the good news about Christ will not help us if we do not trust God.

\v 1 Therefore, we must be very careful so that none of you might seem to have failed to reach the continuing promise to enter God's rest.
\v 2 For we have had the good news about God's rest proclaimed to us just as the Israelites had, but that message did not benefit those who heard it without joining faith to it.
