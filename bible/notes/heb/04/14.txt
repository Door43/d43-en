\v 14 So we have a great high priest who ascended through the heavens when he returned to God's presence. He is Jesus, God's Son. So let us courageously say openly that we trust Jesus Christ.
\v 15 Our high priest can indeed have mercy on us and encourage us, we who tend to sin easily, because Satan also tempted him to sin in every way that he tempts us to sin—but he did not sin.
\v 16 So let us come boldly to Christ, who rules from heaven and does for us what we do not deserve, so that he might kindly help us and have mercy on us when we need him to do so.

\v 14 Having then a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us firmly hold to our beliefs.
\v 15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot feel sympathy for our weaknesses, but one who has in all ways been tempted as we are, except that he is without sin.
\v 16 Let us then come up with confidence to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **Jesus the Son of God, let us firmly hold to our beliefs** - Believers must "firmly hold" to "Jesus the Son of God," the most important belief in the Bible. The words "Son of God" must be translated clearly and as literally as possible. Believers have trusted their lives and eternities to the Son of God for over 2000 years.
    * **we do not have a high priest who cannot feel sympathy** - "we have a high priest who can feel sympathy" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
    * ** he is without sin** - AT: "he did not sin"
    * **the throne of grace** - AT: "God's throne, where there is grace" or "where God, who is gracious, is sitting on his throne" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
