\v 14 We have a great high priest who ascended through the heavens when he returned to God's presence. He is Jesus, God's Son. So let us courageously say openly that we trust Jesus Christ.
\v 15 Our high priest can indeed  compassionately deal with us who tend to sin easily, because he also was tempted to sin in every way that we are tempted to sin, but he did not sin.
\v 16 So, let us come boldly to Christ who rules from heaven and does for us what we do not deserve, so we might experience his kind help and merciful acts that will help us when we need it.

\p
\v 14 Having then a great high priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly our confession (that we trust in Christ).
\v 15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our weaknesses, but one who has been in all points tempted as we are, but without sin.
\v 16 Let us therefore come near with confidence to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
