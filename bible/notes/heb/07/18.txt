\v 19 Remember that no one was able to become all that God intended \add by obeying\add* the laws \add that God gave Moses\add*. On the other hand, \add God caused that we could\add* confidently expect better things \add than we could expect by obeying God's laws\add*. \add He did that by his establishing Christ as priest\add*. Now by means of \add Christ sacrificing himself for us\add* we can come near to God.

\v 18 For there is a setting aside of the foregoing commandment because of its weakness and lack of effectiveness.
\v 19 (for the law made nothing perfect), and yet it introduced a better hope, through which we draw near to God.
