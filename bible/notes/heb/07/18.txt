===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 On the one hand, God canceled what he commanded previously \add concerning the priests\add* because it failed in every way to enable anyone \add to become all that God intended\add*.
\v 19 Remember that no one was able to become all that God intended \add by obeying\add* the laws \add that God gave Moses\add*. On the other hand, \add God caused that we could\add* confidently expect better things \add than we could expect by obeying God's laws\add*. \add He did that by his establishing Christ as priest\add*. Now by means of \add Christ sacrificing himself for us\add* we can come near to God.
