====== Hebrews 07:18-19 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 On the one hand, God canceled what he commanded previously \add concerning the priests\add* because it failed in every way to enable anyone \add to become all that God intended\add*.
\v 19 Remember that no one was able to become all that God intended \add by obeying\add* the laws \add that God gave Moses\add*. On the other hand, \add God caused that we could\add* confidently expect better things \add than we could expect by obeying God's laws\add*. \add He did that by his establishing Christ as priest\add*. Now by means of \add Christ sacrificing himself for us\add* we can come near to God.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 God withdrew what he had first commanded about the priests because those priests are unable to make sinful people holy.
\v 19 No one was able to become good by obeying the laws that God gave Moses. On the other hand, God gave us a better reason to have confidence in him, because he makes it possible for us to come near to him.

\v 18 For there was a cancellation of the former commandment because it was weak and useless.
\v 19 For the law made nothing perfect. However, there is the introduction of a better confidence for the future through which we approach God.
