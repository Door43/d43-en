\v 1 \add Now I will say more about\add* this \add man\add* Melchizedek. He was the king of Salem \add city and was\add* a priest of God, the one who is greater \add than anyone else\add*. He met Abraham who was returning \add home\add* after \add he and his men\add* had defeated the \add armies of four\add* kings \f + \ft synecdoche \f*. Melchizedek \add asked God to\add* bless Abraham.
\v 2 Then Abraham gave to him one tenth of all \add the spoils he\add* took after winning\add the battle. Melchizedek's name\add* means firstly 'king \add who rules\add* righteously,' and since Salem means 'peace', he was the 'king \add who rules\add* peacefully.'
\v 3 \add In the Scriptures there is\add* no \add record of who his\add* father \add was\add*, nor \add is there any record of who his\add* mother \add was\add*, nor \add is there any record of who his\add* ancestors \add were\add*. There is no \add record of when he was\add* born, nor \add is there any record of when he\add* died. \add For these reasons\add*, \add it is as though\add* he continues to be a priest forever, and for this reason he is like God's Son.

\v 1 Now I will say more about this man Melchizedek. He was the king of the city of  Salem and was also a priest of God, who rules the universe. He met Abraham and his men who were returning home from defeating the armies of the four kings. Melchizedek blessed Abraham.
\v 2 Then Abraham gave to him one tenth of all the things he took after winning the battle. Now Melchizedek's name means first, "king who rules righteously," and, since Salem means "peace," his name also means "the king who rules peacefully."
\v 3 The Scriptures provide us with no record of Melchizedek's father, mother, or ancestors; nor do the Scriptures tell us when he was born or when he died. It is as if he continues to be a priest forever. In this way, he is a little like the Son of God.

\v 1 It was this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him.
\v 2 Abraham gave him a tenth of everything he had captured. His name "Melchizedek" means "king of righteousness," and also "king of Salem," that is, "king of peace." 
\v 3 He was without father, without mother, without ancestors, without any beginning of days nor end of life. Instead, he remains a priest forever, like the Son of God.
