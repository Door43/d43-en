\v 11 \add God\add* gave his laws to his people at the same time he gave regulations about the priests. So, if what the priests who were descended from Levi did could have provided a way for God to completely \add forgive\add* people \add for disobeying those laws\add*, certainly no other priest like Melchizedek would have been necessary.\f + \ft Or: why would another priest like Melchizedek have been necessary? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* Instead, priests who were descended from Aaron, \add Levi's descendant, would have been adequate\add*.
\v 12 \add But we know they were not adequate, because a new type of priest like Melchizedek has come\add*. And since \add God\add* has appointed a new type of priest, he also had to change the regulations \add concerning how priests were appointed\add* \f + \ft Or:\add he appointed priests\add* \f*.

\v 11 God gave the Law to his people at the same time he gave regulations about the priests. So if the priests who were descended from Aaron and his ancestor Levi could have provided a way for God to forgive people for disobeying those laws, those priests would have been adequate. In that case, no other priest like Melchizedek would have been necessary.
\v 12 But we know those priests were not adequate, because a new type of priest like Melchizedek has come. And since God has appointed a new type of priest, he also had to change the Law.

\p
\v 11 Now if perfection were possible through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the Law), what further need was there for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be named after the order of Aaron?
\v 12 For when the priesthood is changed, the law must also be changed.
