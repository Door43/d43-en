\v 12 \add But we know they were not adequate, because a new type of priest like Melchizedek has come\add*.

\v 11 God gave the Law to his people at the same time he gave regulations about the priests. So, if what the priests who were descended from Levi could have provided a way for God to eternally forgive people for disobeying those laws, certainly no other priest like Melchizedek would have been necessary. Instead, priests who were descended from Aaron, Levi's descendant, would have been adequate.
\v 12 But we know they were not adequate, because a new type of priest like Melchizedek has come. And since God has appointed a new type of priest, he also had to change the laws concerning how priests were appointed .

\p
\v 11 Now if perfection was possible through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people have received the Law), what further need was there that another priest should arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be named after the order of Aaron?
\v 12 For when the priesthood is changed, there is made of necessity a change of the law also.
