====== Hebrews 07:13-14 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 \add Jesus\add*, the one about whom I am saying these things, is a descendant of someone else, \add not a descendant of Levi\add*. None of the men from whom Jesus descended ever served as priests \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 14 \add We know that\add* since it is obvious that it is from \add the tribe of\add* Judah that our Lord was descended. Moses never said that any of Judah's descendants would \add become\add* priests.
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 Jesus, the one about whom I am saying these things, is not a descendant of Levi. Instead, he came from the tribe of Judah, which never gave any person who served as priest.
\v 14 The scriptures clearly state this. And in fact, Moses never said that any of Judah's descendants would become priests.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 For the one about whom these things are said belongs to another tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar.
\v 14 Now clearly, it is from Judah that our Lord was born, a tribe that Moses never mentioned concerning priests.
