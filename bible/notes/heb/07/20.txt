\v 20 Furthermore, when God appointed Christ as a priest, he solemnly declared it. When God appointed former priests, he did not do this.
\v 21 But when he appointed Christ to be a priest, it was by these words that the Psalmist wrote in scripture:
\q "The Lord has solemnly declared
\q —and he will not change his mind:
\q 'You will be a priest forever!'"

\v 20 And this did not happen without the taking of an oath. Those others become priests without any oath.
\v 21 But this one, Jesus, became a priest with an oath sworn by the one who said to him,

\q "The Lord swore and will not change his mind:
\q 'You are a priest forever.'"
