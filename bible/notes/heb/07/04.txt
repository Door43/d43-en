\v 5 According to the laws \add God gave Moses\add*, the descendants of \add Abraham's great-grandson\add* Levi, who were priests, should take tithes from \add God's\add* people who were their relatives, even though those people also were Abraham's descendants.
\v 6 But this man \add Melchizedek\add*, who was not among the descendants \add of Levi\add*, took tithes from Abraham. He also \add asked God to\add* bless Abraham, the man to whom \add God\add* promised \add many descendants\add*.

\v 4 You can realize how great this man Melchizedek was from the fact that Abraham, our famous ancestor, gave him a tenth of the best things he took from the battle with the kings.
\v 5 According to the laws God gave Moses, the descendants of Abraham's great-grandson Levi, who were priests, should take tithes from God's people who were their relatives, even though those people also were fellow descendants of Abraham.
\v 6 But this man Melchizedek, who was not among the descendants of Levi, received a tenth of everything from Abraham. He also blessed Abraham, the man to whom God promised many descendants.

\p
\v 4 Now consider how great this man was. Our ancestor Abraham gave a tenth of the best things that he had taken in battle.
\v 5 And indeed, Levi's descendants who receive the priest's office have a command from the law to collect  tithes from the people, that is, from their fellow Israelites, even though they, too, are descended from Abraham.
\v 6 But Melchizedek, who was not a descendant from Levi, received tithes from Abraham, and blessed him, the one who had the promises.
