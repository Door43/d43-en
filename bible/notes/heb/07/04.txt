\v 4 You can realize how great this man Melchizedek was from the fact that Abraham, our famous ancestor, gave him a tenth of the best things he took from the battle with the kings.
\v 5 According to the laws God gave Moses, the descendants of Abraham's great-grandson Levi, who were priests, should take tithes from God's people who were their relatives, even though those people also were fellow descendants of Abraham.
\v 6 But this man Melchizedek, who was not among the descendants of Levi, received a tenth of everything from Abraham. He also blessed Abraham, the man to whom God promised many descendants.

\v 4 See how great this man was. Our ancestor Abraham gave a tenth of the things that he had taken in battle.
\v 5 On one hand, those of Levi's sons who receive the priest's office have a command from the law to collect tithes from the people, that is, from their brothers, even though they, too, have come from Abraham's body.
\v 6 But on the other hand, Melchizedek, whose desendance was not traced from them, received tithes from Abraham, and blessed him, the one who had the promises.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The writer states that the priesthood of Melchizedek is better than Aaron's priesthood and then reminds them that the priesthood of Aaron did not make anything perfect.

  * **Levi's descendants who receive the priest's office** - The author says this because not all of Levi's descendants became priests. AT: "the descendants of Levi who became priests."
