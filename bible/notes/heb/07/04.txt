\p
\v 4 Now consider how great this man was. Our ancestor Abraham gave a tenth of the best things that he had taken in battle.
\v 5 And indeed, Levi's descendants who receive the priest’s office have a command from the Law to collect  tithes from the people, that is, from their fellow Israelites, even though they, too, are descended from Abraham.
\v 6 But Melchizedek, who was not a descendant from Levi, received tithes from Abraham, and blessed him, the one who had the promises.
