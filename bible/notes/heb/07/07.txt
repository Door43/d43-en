\v 7 We know for certain that it is the more \add important people\add* who \add ask God to\add* bless the less important people. \add And Melchizedek blessed Abraham. So we conclude that Melchizedek was greater than Abraham\add*.
\v 8 In the case of \add the priests who are descendants of Levi\add*, men who some day will die receive tithes. But in the case of \add Melchizedek it is as if God\add* testifies that he was still living, \add since there is no record in Scriptures about his death\add*.
\v 9 And it was as though Levi himself, and \add all the priests descended from him\add*—who received tithes \add from the people\add*—paid tithes \add to Melchizedek\add*. And when Abraham paid tithes, it \add was as though Levi and all the priests descended from him acknowledged that the work Melchizedek did as a priest was greater than the work Levi did\add*,
\v 10 since \add the sperm from which all those priests were eventually born\add* was still in Abraham's body \f + \ft euphemism \f* when Melchizedek met Abraham.

\v 7 But without any dispute the less is blessed of the better.
\v 8 And here men that die receive tithes; but there one, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.
\v 9 And, so to say, through Abraham even Levi, who receiveth tithes, has paid tithes;
\v 10 for he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchizedek met him.
