\v 15 Furthermore, \add we know that the priests who were descended from Levi were inadequate, since\add* it is even more obvious that another priest has appeared who is like Melchizedek.
\v 16 Jesus became a priest, but not because \add he fulfilled\add* what \add God's\add* law required \add about being a descendant of Levi\add*. Instead, he has the kind of power that \add came from a\add* life that nothing can destroy \f + \ft Or: \add enabled him to\add* live \add again after he was\add* killed \f*.
\v 17 \add We know this\add* since \add God\add* confirmed it in \add the Scripture passage in which he said to his Son\add*,
\q You\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* are a priest eternally just like Melchizedek was a priest.

\v 15 And what we say is even clearer yet if another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek, 

\v 16 who has not become a priest on the basis of the law of human descent, but instead according to the power of an indestructible life:
\v 17 for Scripture witnesses about  him,
\q "You are a priest forever
\q After the order of Melchizedek."
