\v 15 Furthermore, \add we know that the priests who were descended from Levi were inadequate, since\add* it is even more obvious that another priest has appeared who is like Melchizedek.
\v 16 Jesus became a priest, but not because \add he fulfilled\add* what \add God's\add* law required \add about being a descendant of Levi\add*. Instead, he has the kind of power that \add came from a\add* life that nothing can destroy \f + \ft Or: \add enabled him to\add* live \add again after he was\add* killed \f*.
\v 17 \add We know this\add* since \add God\add* confirmed it in \add the Scripture passage in which he said to his Son\add*,
\q You\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* are a priest eternally just like Melchizedek was a priest.

\v 15 Furthermore, we know that the priests descended from Levi were inadequate, since it is even more obvious that another priest has appeared who is like Melchizedek.
\v 16 This priest is Jesus; he became a priest, but not because he fulfilled what God's law required about being a descendant of Levi. Instead, he has the kind of power that came from a life that nothing can destroy.
\v 17 We know this since God confirmed it in the scripture passage in which he said to his Son,
\q "You are a priest eternally, just as Melchizedek was a priest."

\v 15 And what we say is clearer yet if another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek.
\v 16 It was not on the basis of the law of fleshly descent that he became a priest, but instead on the basis of the power of an indestructible life.
\v 17 For scripture witnesses about him:
\q "You are a priest forever
\q after the manner of Melchizedek."
