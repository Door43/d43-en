<usfm>
\v 22 Because of that, Jesus guarantees that \add the new\add* covenant will be better \add than the old one\add*.
\p
\v 23 And formerly, the priests could not keep serving \add as priests\add*, because they all died \f + \ft personification \f*. So there were many priests \add to take the place of the ones who died\add*.
\v 24 But because \add Jesus\add* lives eternally, he will continue to be a high priest forever.

\v 22 Because of that, Jesus himself guarantees that the new covenant will be better than the old one.
\p
\v 23 And formerly, priests could not keep serving as priests because they would always die. So there were many priests to take the place of the ones who died.
\v 24 But because Jesus lives eternally, he will continue to be a high priest forever.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 22 By this also Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.
\v 23 On one hand, many become priests because by death they are kept from continuing on.
\v 24 But on the other hand, because Jesus remains forever, he has a permanent priesthood.
