<usfm>
\v 3 Remember to help those who are in prison because they are believers, as though you were in prison with them and were suffering physically as they are doing.

\v 3 Remember those who are in prison, as if you were there with them, and as if your bodies were being mistreated like theirs.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **as if you were with them...as if your bodies were being mistreated like theirs**  - Both these phrases encourage believers to think about other people's suffering as they would think about their own suffering. AT: "as if you were in prison with them and being mistreated" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **marriage bed** - the sexual relationship between a husband and wife (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]], [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
