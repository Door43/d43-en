<usfm>
\v 15 Because Jesus has died for us, we must continually praise God no matter what happens. That will be something we can sacrifice to him instead of animals. We must be ready to openly say to others that we trust in Christ.


\p
\v 16 Always be doing good deeds for others and sharing the things you have, because doing things like that will be as though you are offering sacrifices that will please God.


\p
\v 17 Obey your leaders and do what they tell you, since they are the ones who are guarding your welfare. Some day they will have to stand before God so that he can say if he approves of what they have done. Obey them in order that they can do the work of guarding you joyfully and not have to do it sadly, because if you cause them to do it sadly, that will certainly not help you at all.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 Through him, then, let us always offer up sacrifices of praise to God, praise that is the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name.
\v 16 And let us not forget doing good and helping one another, for it is with such sacrifices that God is very pleased.
\v 17 Obey and submit to your leaders, for they keep watch over your souls, as those who will give account. Obey so that your leaders will do this with joy, and not with groaning, which would be useless to you.
