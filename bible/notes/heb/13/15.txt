\v 15 Through him then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips which honors his name.
\v 16 But do not forget to do good and to share with others for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
\v 17 Obey and submit to your leaders for they watch over you in behalf of your souls, as those who will give account.  Let them do this with joy, and not with grief: for this would not be helpful to you.
