\v 12 Similarly, Jesus suffered \add and died\add* outside the gate \add of Jerusalem\add* in order that he might make \add us\add*, his people, holy by \add offering\add* his own blood \add as a sacrifice to atone for our sins\add*.
\p
\v 13 So, we must abandon \add performing Jewish\add* sacrifices and rituals \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add in order to be saved\add*, and let us go to Jesus \add to be saved\add*. As we do that, we must \add be willing to\add* let others reproach us just like people reproached him.
\v 14 Here on earth, we believers do not have a city \add such as Jerusalem where we must\add* continually \add offer sacrifices\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Instead, we are waiting for a future \add heavenly\add* city \add that will last forever\add*.

\v 12 Similarly, Jesus suffered and died outside the gates of Jerusalem in order that he might make us, his people, special for God. He did this by offering his own blood as a sacrifice for our sins.
\p
\v 13 So we must go to Jesus to be saved; we must allow others to insult us just like people insulted him.
\v 14 Here on earth, we believers do not have a city such as Jerusalem. Instead, we are waiting for the heavenly city that will last forever.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 Therefore Jesus also suffered outside the city gate, in order to sanctify the people through his own blood.
\v 13 Let us therefore go to him outside the camp, bearing his disgrace.
\v 14 For we do not have any permanent city here. Instead we seek the city that is to come.

===== Translation Notes: =====

The comparison between Jesus' sacrifice and Temple sacrifices continues here.

    * **Therefore** - "In the same way" (see UDB) or "Because the bodies of the sacrifices were burned outside the camp" ([[:en:bible:notes:heb:13:09|13:11]])
    * **Let us therefore go** - "Because Jesus is outside the city gate"
    * **outside the camp** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:heb:13:09|13:11]].
