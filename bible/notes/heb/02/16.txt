\v 16 Because \add Jesus became a human being\add*, it is not angels that he wants to help. No, it is we who trust God as Abraham did whom he wants to help.
\v 17 So, \add since he came to help humans, not angels\add*, he had to be made exactly like \add us whom he calls\add* his own brothers \add and sisters\add*. He wants to be a high priest who \add acts\add* mercifully \add to all people\add* and who acts faithfully in God's matters, so that people who had sinned would no longer be guilty.
\v 18 \add Specifically\add*, he is able to help those\f + \ft Or: us \f* who are tempted\add to sin\add*. He can do that because he suffered, and he was also tempted \add to sin like we are tempted to sin\add*.

\v 16 Because Jesus became a human being, it is not angels that he has come to help. No, it is us who trust God as Abraham did whom he wants to help.
\v 17 So God had to make Jesus to be exactly like us, like his human "brothers." He became a high priest who acts mercifully to all people and who acts faithfully for God, so he could die for the people's sins and make a way for God to forgive them.
\v 18 Jesus is able to help those who are tempted to sin because he himself suffered and was tempted to sin, just as we are tempted to sin.

\v 16 For surely it is not the angels that he is helping; instead, he is helping Abraham's descendants.
\v 17 Therefore it was necessary for him to become like his brothers in all ways, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest over God's things, and so that he might achieve forgiveness for the people's sins.
\v 18 Because Jesus himself has suffered, having been tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.
