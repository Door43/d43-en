\v 2 When the angels spoke God's Law to the people of Israel, what they said was valid. God justly punished all who disobeyed him and violated his Law.
\v 3 Since this is true, we will certainly not escape God; he will certainly judge us if we ignore the good news about how he saves us. It was the Lord Jesus who first told us about this, and the disciples who heard him have assured us that he did so.
\v 4 God also confirmed to us that this message was true by giving believers power to do mighty deeds that prove these things are true. And the Holy Spirit also gives many gifts to the believers, just as he desires to distribute them.

\v 2 For if the message that was spoken through the angels is valid, and every transgression and disobedience receives just punishment.
\v 3 How then can we escape if we neglect so great a salvation?—salvation that was first announced by the Lord and confirmed to us by those who heard it.
\v 4 God also testified to it by signs, wonders, and by various powerful deeds, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit which he distributed according to his own will.
