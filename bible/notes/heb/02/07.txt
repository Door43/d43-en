====== Hebrews 02:7-8 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 \add So it is surprising that\add* you have caused people to be for a little while inferior in rank to angels.
\q You have greatly honored \f + \ft doublet \f* them \f + \ft metaphor \f*, as \add kings are honored with\add* a crown.
\q
\v 8 You have put everything under their control \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\p God has determined that people will rule over everything \f + \ft litotes \f*. That \add means that nothing will be omitted from their control\add*. But now, at this present time, we perceive that people do not yet have authority over everything.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 You created humans a little lower than the angels, 
\q Yet you have greatly honored them, as people honor kings.
\f + \ft 
Some manuscripts add:
"...and you have put him in charge of the things you have made."
\f*
\q
\v 8 You have put everything under their control."
\p God has determined that mankind will rule over everything. That means that nothing will be left out from him ruling it. But now, at this present time, we do not see mankind ruling over everything.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 7 You made man a little lower than the angels;
\q you crowned him with glory and honor.
\f + \ft 
Some manuscripts add:
"...and you have put him over the works of your hands."
\f*
\q
\v 8 You put everything in subjection under his feet."
\p For God has subjected everything to mankind. He did not leave anything not subject to him. But now we do not yet see everything subjected to him.
