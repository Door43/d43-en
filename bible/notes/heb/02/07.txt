\q
\v 8 You have put everything under their control \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\p God has determined that people will rule over everything \f + \ft litotes \f*. That \add means that nothing will be omitted from their control\add*. But now, at this present time, we perceive that people do not yet have authority over everything.
