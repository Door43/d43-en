\v 11 Jesus, the one who sets his people apart for God, and those same people whom God declares as good before him, are all from the same source, God himself. So Jesus is not embarrassed to proclaim them to be his own brothers and sisters.
\v 12 The Psalmist wrote that Christ said to God,
\q "I will proclaim to my brothers how awesome you are.
\q I will sing praise to you in the middle of the assembly of believers!"
