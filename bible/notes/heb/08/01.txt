====== Hebrews 08:1-2 ======

<usfm>
\v 1 The main point of \add all\add* that \add I\add* have written is that we have a high priest like that. He has sat down to rule \f + \ft metonymy \f* with God \f + \ft euphemism \f* at the place of greatest honor in heaven.
\v 2 He ministers in the Most Holy Place, that is, in the true place \add of worship in heaven\add*. That is a place that \add Moses'\add* tent \add represented\add*. The Lord set up the true place of worship. No human \add set it up\add*.

<usfm>
\v 1 The most important part of everything that I have written is that we have a high priest who has sat down to rule in the place of greatest honor in heaven, beside God himself.
\v 2 He serves in the sanctuary, that is, in the true place of worship in heaven. That is the true Sacred Tent, for the Lord set it up, not Moses.

\v 1 Now the point of what we are saying is this: We have a high priest who has sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens.
\v 2 He is a servant in the holy place, the true tabernacle that the Lord, not a man, set up.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The writer, having shown that Christ's priesthood is better than the earthly priesthood, shows that the earthly priesthood was a pattern of heavenly things. Christ has a superior ministry, a superior covenant.

  * **Now** - This does not mean "at this moment," but is used to draw attention to the important point that follows.
  * **we are saying** - Even though the author uses the plural pronoun "we," he is most likely referring only to himself. AT: "I am saying" or "I am writing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]])
  * **sat down at the right hand** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:heb:01:01|1:3]].
  * **of the throne of the Majesty** - Here "Majesty" refers to God, and "throne" refers to God's rule as king. AT: "of God, who is our majestic king" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the true tabernacle that the Lord, not a man, set up** - People built the earthly tabernacle out of animal skins fastened to a wooden framework, and they set it up in the manner of a tent. Here "true tabernacle" means the heavenly tabernacle that God created.
