\v 1 The main point of \add all\add* that \add I\add* have written is that we have a high priest like that. He has sat down to rule \f + \ft metonymy \f* with God \f + \ft euphemism \f* at the place of greatest honor in heaven.
\v 2 He ministers in the Most Holy Place, that is, in the true place \add of worship in heaven\add*. That is a place that \add Moses'\add* tent \add represented\add*. The Lord set up the true place of worship. No human \add set it up\add*.

\v 1 The most important part of everything that I have written is that we have a high priest who has sat down to rule in the place of greatest honor in heaven, beside God himself.
\v 2 He serves in the sanctuary, that is, in the true place of worship in heaven. That is the true Sacred Tent, for the Lord set it up, not Moses.

\v 1 Now the point of what we are saying is this: we have a high priest who has sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens.
\v 2 He is a servant in the holy sanctuary, the true tabernacle that the Lord set up, not any mortal person.
