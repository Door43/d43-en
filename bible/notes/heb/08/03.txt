\v 3 Every high priest was appointed \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* appointed every high priest \f* to offer \add to God\add* gifts and sacrifices \add for people who sinned\add*. So, since \add Christ became a high priest\add*, he also had to offer something.
\v 4 Since there are already \add Jewish\add* priests who offer gifts as God's laws \add require\add*, if Christ were \add now living\add* on the earth, he would not be a high priest.
\v 5 The \add Jewish\add* priests perform rituals which are only a model \f + \ft doublet \f* of \add what Christ would do in heaven\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. What \add God\add* told Moses when Moses was about to set up the tent \add for worshipping him supports the idea that those rituals were only a model. God said\add*, "Be sure that you \add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* make everything according to the model that I showed you on Sinai Mountain!"

\v 3 God appoints every high priest to offer gifts and sacrifices for the people's sins. So since Christ became a high priest, he also had to offer something.
\v 4 Since there are already priests who offer gifts as God's Law requires, if Christ were now living on the earth, he would not be a high priest at all.
\v 5 The priests in Jerusalem perform rituals that are only a copy of what Christ does in heaven. This is because when Moses was about to set up the Sacred Tent, God told him, “Be sure that you make everything according to what I showed you on Mount Sinai!"

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; therefore it is necessary to have something to offer.
\v 4 Now if Christ were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are already those who offer the gifts according to the Law.
\v 5 They serve something that is a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned by God when he was about to construct the tabernacle: "See," God said, "that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain."
