\v 3 Every high priest was appointed \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* appointed every high priest \f* to offer \add to God\add* gifts and sacrifices \add for people who sinned\add*. So, since \add Christ became a high priest\add*, he also had to offer something.
\v 4 Since there are already \add Jewish\add* priests who offer gifts as God's laws \add require\add*, if Christ were \add now living\add* on the earth, he would not be a high priest.
\v 5 The \add Jewish\add* priests perform rituals which are only a model \f + \ft doublet \f* of \add what Christ would do in heaven\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. What \add God\add* told Moses when Moses was about to set up the tent \add for worshipping him supports the idea that those rituals were only a model. God said\add*, "Be sure that you \add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* make everything according to the model that I showed you on Sinai Mountain!"

\v 3 Every high priest was appointed to offer to God gifts and sacrifices for the sins of the people. So, since Christ became a high priest, he also had to offer something.
\v 4 Since there are already Jewish priests who offer gifts as God's laws require, if Christ were now living on the earth, he would not be a high priest.
\v 5 The Jewish priests perform rituals which are only a model of what Christ would do in heaven, because God told Moses when Moses was about to set up the Sacred Tent for worshipping him, “Be sure that you make everything according to the model that I showed you on Sinai Mountain!"

\v 3 For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices, therefore it is necessary that to have something to offer.
\v 4 Now if Christ was on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since  there are already those who offer the gifts according to the Law.
\v 5 They serve that which is a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned by God when he was about to make the tabernacle, "See", he says, "That you make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain."
