\v 3 Every high priest was appointed \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* appointed every high priest \f* to offer \add to God\add* gifts and sacrifices \add for people who sinned\add*. So, since \add Christ became a high priest\add*, he also had to offer something.
\v 4 Since there are already \add Jewish\add* priests who offer gifts as God's laws \add require\add*, if Christ were \add now living\add* on the earth, he would not be a high priest.
\v 5 The \add Jewish\add* priests perform rituals which are only a model \f + \ft doublet \f* of \add what Christ would do in heaven\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. What \add God\add* told Moses when Moses was about to set up the tent \add for worshipping him supports the idea that those rituals were only a model. God said\add*, "Be sure that you \add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* make everything according to the model that I showed you on Sinai Mountain!"

\v 3 For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is necessary that this high priest also have somewhat to offer.
\v 4 Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are those who offer the gifts according to the law;
\v 5 who serve that which is a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses is warned of God when he is about to make the tabernacle: for, See, says he, that you make all things according to the pattern that was showed you in the mount.
