\v 8 Because God declared that the Israelites were guilty of not obeying the first covenant, he wanted a new covenant. This is what a prophet wrote about that:
\q "The Lord says, 'Listen! There will soon be a time
\q when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and the people of Judah.
\q
\v 9 That covenant will not be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors
\q when I led them out of Egypt like a father leads his young child.
\q They did not continue to obey my covenant,
\q so I let them alone,' says the Lord.

\v 8 For when God found fault with the people, he said,
\q "See, the days are coming—says the Lord—
\q when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.
\q
\v 9 It will not be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors
\q on the day that I took them by their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt.
\q For they did not continue in my covenant,
\q and I disregarded them—says the Lord.
