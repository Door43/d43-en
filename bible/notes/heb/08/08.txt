\v 8 For finding fault with them, he says,
\q "Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord,
\q That I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;
\q
\v 9 Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers
\q In the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt;
\q For they did not continue in my covenant,
\q And I did not  regard them, says the Lord.
