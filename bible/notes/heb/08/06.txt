\v 6 But now Christ serves in a much better way than the Jewish priests do. In the same way, the new covenant that he established between God and people is better than the old one. When he established the new covenant, he promised us better things than the laws that God gave Moses.


\p
\v 7 God needed to make this new covenant, because the first covenant had not done everything well.

\v 6 But now Christ has received a superior ministry because he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which has been established on better promises.
\v 7 For if that first covenant had been faultless, then there would have  been no need to seek a second covenant.
