\v 7 If that first covenant had been perfectly adequate \f + \ft litotes \f*, God would not have thought that he needed another \add covenant to replace it\add*. But \add it was not adequate, so he needed a new one\add*.

\v 6 But now Christ serves in a much better way than the Jewish priests do. In the same way, the new covenant that he established between God and people is better than the old one. When he established the new covenant, he promised us better things than the laws that God gave Moses.


\p
\v 7 God needed to make this new covenant, because the first covenant had not done everything well.

<usfm>
\v 6 But now Christ has received a much better ministry. It is just as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which is based on better promises.
\v 7 For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need for a second covenant.
