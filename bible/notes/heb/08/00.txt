====== Hebrews 08 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 8:8-12, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

The author is still speaking about Jesus' role as the ultimate high priest. He also begins to speak about how the [[:en:obe:kt:newcovenant|new covenant]] is superior to the covenant God made with Moses.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== New covenant ==
The author mentions the [[:en:obe:kt:newcovenant|new covenant]] and discusses Jesus' relationship to it. Israel's relationship to the New Covenant is unclear and the subject of much debate.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== We ==
The author begins to speak using the pronoun "we." It is uncertain who the other people he is referencing are.
