====== Introduction to Hebrews ======

===== Part 1: General Introduction =====

=== Outline of the Book of Hebrews ===

  - Jesus is superior to God's prophets and angels (1:1-4:13)
  - Jesus is superior to the priests who serve in the temple in Jerusalem (4:14-7:28)
  - Jesus' ministry is superior to the old covenant that God made with his people (8:1-10:39)
  - What faith is like (11:1-40)
  - Encouragement to be faithful to God (12:1-29)
  - Concluding encouragements and greetings (13:1-25)

=== What is the Book of Hebrews about? ===

In the Book of Hebrews, the author wanted to show that Jesus fulfilled several Old Testament prophecies. Jesus' role as the perfect High Priest is explained; the author did this in order to encourage the Jewish Christians and to explain that Jesus is better than anything that the old covenant had to offer. Hebrews shows how Jesus completed the law of Moses, so that animal sacrifices would from then on be useless. Jesus was the sacrifice for all sins, once and for all time. He is therefore the one to truly trust for access to God the Father.

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "Hebrews." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as "The Letter to the Hebrews," or "A Letter to the Jewish Christians." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])

=== Who wrote the Book of Hebrews? ===

No one knows who wrote Hebrews, but scholars have made suggestions such as the apostle Paul, Luke, or Barnabas. The date of writing is also not known, but most believe it was written not more than seventy years after the birth of Christ. Jerusalem was destroyed in A.D. 70, but the writer of this letter talks about Jerusalem as if it had not yet been destroyed. 

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== Can readers understand this book without knowing about the sacrifices and the work of the priests required in the Old Testament? ===

It would be very difficult for readers to understand this book without understanding these matters. Translators might consider giving some explanations to this effect in notes or in an introduction to this book.

=== How is the idea of blood used in the Book of Hebrews? ===

Beginning in [[:en:bible:notes:heb:09:06|9:7]], the idea of blood is often used as metonymy to stand for the death of any animal that was sacrificed to meet the requirements of God's covenant with Israel. The author also uses blood to stand for the death of Jesus Christ, who became the perfect sacrifice for the entire world's sins. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

Beginning in [[:en:bible:notes:heb:09:06|9:19]], the author uses the idea of sprinkling as a symaction. It was by sprinkling blood that the priests applied the benefit of the animals' death to the Israelites and to objects that had to be made acceptable to God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]]) 

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== How are the ideas of "holy" and "sanctify" represented in Hebrews ULB? ===

The scriptures use such words to indicate any one of various ideas. For this reason, it is often difficult for translators to represent them well in their versions. In translating into English, Hebrews ULB uses the following principles:
  * Sometimes the context mainly indicates a simple reference to Christians without implying any particular role filled by them. In these cases, the ULB uses "believer" or "believers." (See: 6:10; 13:24)
  * Sometimes the context mainly implies the idea of someone or something set apart for God alone. In these cases, the ULB uses "set apart," "dedicated to," or "reserved for." (See: 2:11: 9:13; 10:10, 14, 29; 13:12)

As translators think about how to represent these ideas in their own versions, they will often be helped by the choices made in the ULB.

=== What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Hebrews? ===

The following are the most significant textual issues in the Book of Hebrews:

  * "and you have put him over the works of your hands." (2:7) The ULB, UDB, and most modern versions do not have this reading. Some older versions do.
  * "those who did not unite in faith with those who obeyed" (4:2). The ULB, UDB, and some other versions have this reading. Other versions read, "those who heard it without joining faith to it." If there are other versions in the region, translators might consider following their reading.
  * "Christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come." (9:11) The ULB, UDB, and most other modern versions have this reading. Some other versions have, "Christ came as a high priest of the good things that are to come." If there are other versions in the region, translators might consider following their reading.
  * "on those who were prisoners" (10:34). The ULB, UDB, and most other modern versions have this reading. Some older versions read, "of me in my chains."
  * "They were stoned. They were sawn in two. They were killed with the sword." (11:37) The ULB, UDB, and most other modern versions have this reading. Some older versions have, "They were stoned. They were sawn in two. They were tempted. They were killed with the sword."
  * "If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned." (12:20) The ULB, UDB, and most other modern versions have this reading. Some older versions have, "If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned or shot with an arrow."
