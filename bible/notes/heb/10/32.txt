\v 32 But remember the former days, after you were enlightened—how you endured a great agony of suffering.
\v 33 You were exposed to public ridicule by insults and persecution, and you were participants with those who went through such suffering.
\v 34 For you had compassion on those who were prisoners, and you accepted with joy the seizure of your possessions, knowing that you yourselves had a better and everlasting possession.
