\v 32 Remember the earlier times when you first understood the truth about Christ. You endured much hardship, and when you suffered, you continued to trust God.
\v 33 At times people insulted you in public; at other times they made you suffer. At other times you suffered with other believers in their hardships.
\v 34 You not only were kind to those who were in prison because they believed in Christ, but you also accepted it joyfully when unbelievers took away your possessions. You accepted it because you yourselves knew very well that you had possessions in heaven forever, possessions that are much better than those that they took from you!

\p
\v 32 But remember the former days, after you were enlightened—how you endured a great agony of suffering.
\v 33 You were exposed to public ridicule by insults and persecution, and you were participants with those who went through such suffering.
\v 34 For you had compassion on those who were prisoners, and you accepted with joy the seizure of your possessions, knowing that you yourselves had a better and everlasting possession.
