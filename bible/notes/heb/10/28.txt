====== Hebrews 10:28-29 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 Everyone who rejected the laws \add that God gave\add* Moses was mercilessly killed when \add at least\add* two or three people testified that they had done that.
\v 29 \add That was severe punishment\add*. But \add Christ\add* is God's Son\f + \ft Or: the man who is also God \f*. His blood, by means of which \add he put into effect\add* the new covenant, is sacred. Because of \add Christ's\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* blood \add flowing for us when he died\add*, \add God\add* freed us from our guilt. So, you can be sure \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* that anyone who shows contempt for \add those truths\add* and who insults the Spirit of God, the one who acts with kindness toward us in a way we do not deserve, deserves to be punished even worse than that \f + \ft metaphor \f*!

<usfm>
\v 28 Everyone who rejected the laws that God gave Moses had to die without mercy when at least two or three people testified against him.
\v 29 That was severe punishment. But Christ is God's Son, and he is also God. If anyone rejects the covenant that he has made and despises the blood that flowed from him—if that person rejects the blood in exchange for which God forgave him—if that person rejects the Spirit of God, who acted so kindly toward him—then God will punish him very, very severely.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 Anyone who has rejected the Law of Moses dies without mercy at the testimony of two or three witnesses.
\v 29 How much more punishment do you think anyone deserves who has trampled on the Son of God, anyone who has treated the blood of the covenant as something unholy, the blood by which he was sanctified—anyone who has insulted the Spirit of grace?
