\v 11 And every priest indeed stands day by day ministering and offering the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.
\v 12 But he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God,
\v 13 waiting until his enemies are humbled and made a footstool for his feet.
\v 14 For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are sanctified.
