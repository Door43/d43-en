\v 11 As every priest stands daily in front of the altar, he performs rituals and offers the same kind of sacrifices that could never remove the guilt for anyone's sins.
\v 12 But Christ offered a sacrifice that will be enough forever, and he offered it only one time! After that, he sat down to rule beside God in the place of highest honor.
\v 13 From now on, he is waiting for God to completely defeat all his enemies.
\v 14 By offering himself once as the sacrifice for sin, he perfected forever those in whom God has worked his cleansing and purity.

\v 11 Indeed, every priest stands day by day serving, offering the same sacrifices, which, however, can never take away sins.
\v 12 But after Christ offered one sacrifice for sins forever, he sat down at the right side of God,
\v 13 waiting until his enemies were humbled and made a stool for his feet.
\v 14 For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are sanctified.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Indeed** - This connects [[:en:bible:notes:heb:10:01|10:1-4]] with the words that follow.
  * **his enemies were humbled and made a stool for his feet** - "God humbled and completely shamed Christ's enemies." It was a great shame for people to be put under other people's feet. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **those who are sanctified** - AT: "those whom God sanctified" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
