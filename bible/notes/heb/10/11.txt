\v 11 As every priest stands daily in front of the altar, he performs rituals and offers the same kind of sacrifices that could never remove the guilt for anyone's sins.
\v 12 But Christ offered a sacrifice that will be enough forever, and he offered it only one time! After that, he sat down to rule beside God in the place of highest honor.
\v 13 From now on, he is waiting for God to completely defeat all his enemies.
\v 14 By offering himself once as the sacrifice for sin, he perfected forever those in whom God has worked his cleansing and purity.

\v 11 On the one hand, every priest stands day by day to serve God. He is always offering the same sacrifices, although they can never take away sins.
\v 12 On the other hand, Christ offered one sacrifice for sins forever, he sat down at the right hand of God.
\v 13 He is waiting until his enemies are made a stool for his feet.
\v 14 For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **On the one hand ... On the other hand** - These phrases are used to compares two things. Your language may have a way to emphasize that the author is making a comparison. Or you could leave out "On the one hand" and translate "On the other hand" simply as "But."
  * **day by day** - "day after day" or "everyday"
  * **can never take away sins** - This speaks of "sins" as if they are an object that a person can take away. AT: "can never cause God to forgive sins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he sat down at the right hand of God** - Here "right hand" refers to a place of honor. AT: "he sat down in the place of honor next to God." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:heb:01:01|1:3]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **until his enemies are made a stool for his feet** - The humiliation of Christ's enemies is spoken of as if they were made a place for him to rest his feet. This can be stated in active form. AT: "until God humiliates Christ's enemies and they become like a stool for his feet" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **those who are dedicated to God** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "those whom God has dedicated to himself" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
