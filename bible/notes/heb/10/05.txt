\v 6 Animals that are completely burned up as sacrifices have not pleased you,

\v 5 That is why, as Christ was coming into the world, he said to his Father,
\q "It is not sacrifices and offerings that you have wanted,
\q but you have prepared for me a body to offer.
\q
\v 6 Animals that completely burn up when people offer them to you, these animals have not pleased you,
\q and neither do other sacrifices please you.
\q
\v 7 Do because of this, I said, 'My God, listen!
\q I have come here in order to do what you want me to do,
\q just like has they have written about me in the Scriptures.' "
