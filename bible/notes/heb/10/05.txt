\v 5 So, as \add Christ\add* was coming into the world, he said \add to his Father about offering himself as a sacrifice for people's sin, in words that the Psalmist wrote\add*,
\q It is not sacrifices and offerings that you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* have wanted,
\q but you have prepared for me a body \add to serve you\add*.
\q
\v 6 Animals that are completely burned up as sacrifices have not pleased you,
\q and \add other sacrifices that atone\add* for those who have sinned have not pleased you.
\q
\v 7 Then \add because of this\add*, I said, "My God, listen!\f + \ft Or: here I am! \f*
\q I have come \add here\add* in order to do what you want me \add to do\add*,
\q \add just like\add* has been written \f + \ft Or:as they have written \f* about me in the Scriptures."

\v 5 That is why, as Christ was coming into the world, he said to his Father,
\q "It is not sacrifices and offerings that you have wanted,
\q but you have prepared for me a body to offer.
\q
\v 6 Animals that completely burn up when people offer them to you, these animals have not pleased you,
\q and neither do other sacrifices please you.
\q
\v 7 Because of this, I said, 'My God, listen!
\q I have come here in order to do what you want me to do,
\q just as they have written about me in the scriptures.'"

\v 5 When Christ came into the world, he said,
\q "It was neither sacrifices nor offerings that you desired.
\q Instead, it is a body that you have prepared for me.
\q
\v 6 In neither whole burnt offerings nor sacrifices for sin did you take pleasure.
\q
\v 7 Then I said, 'See, here I am, as it is written about me in the scroll, to do your will.'"
