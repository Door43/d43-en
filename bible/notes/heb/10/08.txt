\v 9 Then, \add concerning his offering himself as a sacrifice to atone for people's sin\add*, he said, "Listen!

\v 10 Because of Jesus Christ doing what God wanted him to do, we have been set apart for God by his offering his own body only once as a sacrifice, a sacrifice that will never need to be repeated.

\v 8 First he stated, "You did not desire sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings for sin nor take pleasure in them,"  which are offered according to the law.
\v 9 Then he has said, "Behold, I am here to do your will." He sets aside  the first practice in order that he may establish the second,
\v 10 in which by God's will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
