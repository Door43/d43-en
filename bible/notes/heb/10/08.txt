\v 8 First he said, "It is not sacrifices and offerings and animals that \add the priests\add* have completely burned up and other \add offerings to atone for\add* those who have sinned that you have really wanted. They have not pleased you." \add He said that even though\add* those things were offered \f + \ft Or:they offered all those things \f* according to the laws \add God gave Moses!\add*
\v 9 Then, \add concerning his offering himself as a sacrifice to atone for people's sin\add*, he said, "Listen! I have come \add here\add* to do what you want me \add to do!\add*" Thus Christ got rid of the first \add way of atoning for sin\add*, in order to establish the second \add way of atoning for\add* sin.
\v 10 Because of Jesus Christ \add doing what God\add* wanted him to do, we have been set apart \f + \ft Or:\add he\add* has set us apart \f* for God by his offering his own body only once \add as a sacrifice, a sacrifice that will not need to be repeated\add*.

\v 8 First Christ said, "It is not sacrifices and offerings and animals that the priests have completely burned up and other offerings to atone for those who have sinned that you have really wanted. They have not pleased you." He said that even though those things were offered according to the laws that God gave Moses!
\v 9 Then, concerning his offering himself as a sacrifice to atone for people's sin, he said, "Listen! I have come here to do what you want me to do!" Thus Christ got rid of the first way of atoning for sin, in order to establish the second way of atoning for sin.
\v 10 Because Jesus Christ did what God wanted him to do, God set us apart for himself. This happen when Jesus Christ offered his own body once as a sacrifice, a sacrifice that he will never need to repeat.

\v 8 As he said what we presented above: "You did not desire sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings for sin, nor did you take pleasure in them"—sacrifices that are offered according to the Law.
\v 9 Then he said, "See, I am here to do your will." He sets aside the first practice in order to establish the second.
\v 10 In the second practice, we have been sanctified by God's will through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
