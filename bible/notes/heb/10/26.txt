\v 26 If we deliberately and habitually sin after we have known the true message about Christ, no other sacrifice will help us.

===== ULB: =====

\v 26 For if we deliberately go on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, a sacrifice for sins no longer exists.
\v 27 Instead, there is only a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierce fire that will consume God's enemies.
