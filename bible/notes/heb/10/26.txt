====== Hebrews 10:26-27 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 26 \add We\f + \ft inclusive \f* must do those things\add*, because if we deliberately and habitually sin after we have known the true \add message about Christ\add*, no other sacrifice will remove our guilt for having sinned in this way.
\v 27 Instead, we must fearfully expect that \add God will\add* judge us, and then he will angrily \add punish\add* his enemies in a furious fire \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 26 If we deliberately and habitually sin after we have known the true message about Christ, no other sacrifice will help us.
\v 27 Instead, we must fearfully expect that God will judge us, and then he will righteously punish all his enemies in a furious fire.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 26 For if we deliberately go on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, a sacrifice for sins no longer exists.
\v 27 Instead, there is only a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierce fire that will consume God's enemies.
</usfm>
