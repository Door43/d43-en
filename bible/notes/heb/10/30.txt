<usfm>
\v 30 \add We can be sure of that\add* (OR\add , need to think about that carefully\add*) since we know that God said, "I myself will get revenge on those who sinned, and I will give them the punishment that they deserve \f + \ft doublet \f*." And \add Moses wrote\add*, "The Lord will judge his people."
\v 31 It will be a terrible thing if the all-powerful God \f + \ft metonymy \f* seizes and punishes you \f + \ft idiom \f*!

\v 30 We can be sure of this, since we know that God said, "The right and power to give people what they deserve for having sinned belongs to me. I will punish them as they deserve." And Moses wrote, "The Lord will judge his people."
\v 31 It will be a terrible thing if the all-powerful God who really lives seizes and punishes you!

<usfm>
\v 30 For we know the one who said, "Vengeance belongs to me; I will pay back." And again, "The Lord will judge his people."
\v 31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God!
