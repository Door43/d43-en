====== Hebrews 10:38-39 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 38 But those whom I have summoned, who \add act\add* righteously, must continually live trusting in me,
\q because if they, in a cowardly manner, cease \add to trust in me\add*, I
\q will not be pleased\f + \ft Or: will be angry \f* with them.
\p
\v 39 But we are not ones who in a cowardly manner cease \add to trust in God\add*, with the result that God will severely punish us. Instead, we are ones who trust in him, with the result that \add God\add* will save us \f + \ft synecdoche \f* eternally.

<usfm>
\v 38 But those who belong to me, who act righteously, will continue to live trusting in me.
\q If they are cowards and stop trusting in me,
\q I will not be pleased with them.
\p
\v 39 But we are not people who are cowards and cause God to destroy us. Instead, we are people who trust in him, so that he will save us forever.
