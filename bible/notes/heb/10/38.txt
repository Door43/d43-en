\v 38 But those whom I have summoned, who \add act\add* righteously, must continually live trusting in me,

\q will not be pleased\f + \ft Or: will be angry \f* with them.
\p
\v 39 But we are not ones who in a cowardly manner cease \add to trust in God\add*, with the result that God will severely punish us. Instead, we are ones who trust in him, with the result that \add God\add* will save us \f + \ft synecdoche \f* eternally.
