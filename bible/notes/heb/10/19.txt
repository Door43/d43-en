\v 19 So, my fellow believers, because we \add trust in what Jesus accomplished when\add* his own blood \add flowed for us\add*, we can confidently go into \add God's very presence\add* that was \add symbolized\add* by the very holy place \add in the tent\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 20 He enabled us to go into \add God's presence\add* by making a new and effective way. \add Specifically\add*, he \add offered\add* his body \add as a sacrifice\add* for us \add in order that nothing would stop us\add* from entering \add God's presence, just like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* the curtain \add of the very holy place prevented people from entering God's presence\add*.
\v 21 Christ is a great priest \add who rules over us, who are\add* God's people \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 22 \add Just like the priests\add* were sprinkled \f + \ft Or:\add as Moses\add* sprinkled \add the priests\add* \f* \add with blood\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* to symbolize that they were no longer guilty for having sinned, we also no longer are \add guilty for having done\add* evil. \add Just like the priests ceremonially\add* washed their bodies with pure water \add to prepare themselves to serve God\add*, we are allowing \add God\add* to continually make us pure. So, we\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* must approach \add God\add* sincerely by confidently trusting \add in him\add*.

\v 19 So, my fellow believers, because we trust in what Jesus accomplished when his own blood flowed for us, we can confidently go into God's very presence that was symbolized by the very holy place in the sacred tent.
\v 20 He has enabled us to go into God's presence by making a new way in which we can live forever. This new way is Jesus, who died for us.
\v 21 Christ is a great priest who rules over us, we who are God's people.
\v 22 So we must approach God sincerely by confidently trusting in Jesus. It is he who has made our hearts pure from having sinned. It is as if he sprinkled his own blood over our hearts, and as if he had washed our bodies in pure water.

\v 19 Therefore, brothers, we have confidence to enter into the most holy place by the blood of Jesus.
\v 20 That is the new and living way that he has opened for us through the curtain, that is, by means of his flesh.
\v 21 Because we have a great priest over the house of God,
\v 22 let us approach with true hearts in the full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Having made it clear that there is only one sacrifice for sin, the writer continues with the picture of the most holy place in the temple, where only the high priest could enter each year with the blood of the sacrifice for sins. He reminds the believers that they now worship God in his presence as if they were standing in the most holy place.

  * **brothers** - Here this means all believers in Christ whether male or female. AT: "brothers and sisters" or "fellow believers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_gendernotations]])
  * **the most holy place** - This means the presence of God, not the most holy place in the old tabernacle. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **by the blood of Jesus** - Here "blood of Jesus" refers to the death of Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **living way** - Possible meanings are 1) this new way to God that Jesus has provided results in believers living forever or 2) Jesus is alive, and he is the way believers enter into the presence of God.
  * **through the curtain** - The curtain in the earthly temple represents the separation between people and God's true presence. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **by means of his flesh** - Here "flesh" stands for the body of Jesus, and his body stands for his sacrificial death. AT: "by means of his death" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **we have a great priest over the house of God** - This must be translated in such a way as to make it clear that Jesus is this "great priest."
  * **over the house** - "in charge of the house"
  * **the house of God** - This speaks about God's people as if they were a literal house. AT: "all the people of God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **let us approach** - Here "approach" stands for worshiping God, as a priest would go up to God's altar to sacrifice animals to him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **true hearts** - "faithful hearts" or "honest hearts." Here "hearts" stands for the genuine will and motivation of the believers. AT: "sincerely" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **in the full assurance of faith** - "with a confident faith" or "trusting completely in Jesus"
  * **having our hearts sprinkled clean** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "as if he made our hearts clean with his blood" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **hearts sprinkled clean** - Here "hearts" stands for the conscience, the awareness of right and wrong. Being made clean stands for being forgiven and being given the status of righteousness. Hearts are spoken of as if they could be cleansed by blood. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) 
  * **sprinkled** - Sprinkling was a symbolic action done by the priests by which they applied the benefits of the covenant to people and to objects. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:heb:09:18|9:19]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **having our bodies washed with pure water** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "as if he had washed our bodies in pure water" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) 
  * **our bodies washed with pure water** - If the translator understands this phrase as referring to Christian baptism, then "water" is literal, not figurative. But if water is taken as literal, then "pure" is figurative, standing for the spiritual purity that baptism is said here to accomplish. The "washing" stands for the believer being made acceptable to God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
