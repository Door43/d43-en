\v 23 We must unwaveringly keep stating what we believe. Since God faithfully does all he promised to do, we must confidently expect him to do these things.
\v 24 And let us think how each of us can best encourage each other to love one another and to do good deeds.
\v 25 We must not cease assembling ourselves to worship the Lord, as some people have done. Instead, each one of us must encourage the others. Let us do that all the more since we know that the time that the Lord will return is near.

\v 23 Let us also hold tightly to the confession of our hope without wavering, because God, who has promised, is faithful.
\v 24 Let us consider how to motivate one another to love and good deeds.
\v 25 Let us not stop meeting together, as some have done. Instead, encourage one another more and more, and all the more as you see the day coming closer.
