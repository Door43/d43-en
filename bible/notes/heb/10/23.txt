\v 23 Let us also hold fast the confession of our hope that it  does not waver; for he is faithful that promised:
\v 24 and let us consider how to provoke one another to love and good works;
\v 25 not forsaking our own assembling together, as the custom of some is, but encouraging one another; and even more so, as you see the day drawing near.
