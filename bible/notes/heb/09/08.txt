\v 8 By those things the Holy Spirit indicated that \add just like God\add* did not reveal the way \add for ordinary people\add* to enter into the inner room while the outer room still existed \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add similarly he did not reveal the way for ordinary people to enter the presence of God while the Jewish system of offering sacrifices was in effect\add*.
\v 9 \add The things that the priests did inside the outer room\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* symbolized \add what was true\add* during the time \add when the first covenant was in effect\add*. According to \add the first covenant\add* (OR\add , In that outer room\add*), \add priests\add* offered gifts and other sacrifices to God. But \add by offering them\add*, the people who brought them were unable to make themselves feel that they were no longer guilty for having sinned.
\v 10 \add They brought those gifts and made those sacrifices\add* according to \add regulations concerning\add* things to eat and drink, and \add according to rules that required people to\add* wash various things. \add God\add* declared that those regulations about our bodies were to be in effect until \add he put into effect the new covenant\add*; that was a better system.

\v 8 By those things the Holy Spirit indicated that God did not reveal the way for ordinary people to enter into the inner room, the very holy place, while the outer room still existed. In a similar way, he did not reveal the way for ordinary people to enter the presence of God while the Jews offered sacrifices in the old way.
\v 9 This was a symbol for the time in which we are now living. The gifts and sacrifices offered in the sacred tent cannot make a person always know right from wrong or always do right from our hearts and in a way that he pleases God.
\v 10 Those rules about what to eat and drink, and about what to washâ€”all those rules are no longer any good because God has made a new covenant with us. This new covenant is a much better system.

\v 8 The Holy Spirit showed that the way into the most holy place had not yet appeared as long as the first tabernacle was still standing.
\v 9 This was an illustration for the present time. Both the gifts and sacrifices that are now being offered are not able to perfect the worshiper's conscience.
\v 10 They are only concerned with food and drink and various ceremonial washings, regulations for the body until the time of the new order.
