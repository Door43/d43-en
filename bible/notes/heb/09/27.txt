\v 27 All people must die once, and after that God will judge them for their sins.
\v 28 Likewise, when Christ died, God offered him once to be a sacrifice, to punish him in the place of the many people who had sinned. He will come to earth a second time, not in order to sacrifice himself again for those who have sinned, but in order to save us who wait for him and expect him to come.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 27 Every person is destined to die once, and after that comes judgment.
\v 28 In the same way, Chris also, who was offered once to take away the sins of many, will appear a second time. He will appear, not for the purpose of dealing with sin, but for the salvation of those who are waiting patiently for him.
