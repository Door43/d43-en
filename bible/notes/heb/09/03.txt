\v 3 Behind the curtain inside \add the holy place\add* there was \add another\add* room. That was called 'the very holy place.'
\v 4 It had an altar, \add made from\add* gold, \add for burning\add* incense. \add It also had the chest which they called\add* the chest of the covenant. All its sides were covered with gold. In it was the golden pot which contained \add pieces of the food they called\add* manna. \add That was the food with which God miraculously fed the people before they entered the promised land\add*. In the chest there was also Aaron's walking stick that budded \add to prove that he was God's true priest\add*. In the chest were also the stone tablets \add on which God had written\add* the Ten Commandments.
\v 5 On top of \add the chest\add* were \add figures of\add* winged creatures \add that symbolized God's\add* glory. Their \add wings\add* overshadowed the chest's lid where \add the high priest sprinkled the blood\add* to \add atone for\f + \ft Or: to forgive\add* \f* \add those who had sinned. I\add* do not \add need\add* to write about these things in detail now.

\v 3 Behind the curtain on one side of the holy place there was another room. That was called the very holy place.
\v 4 It had an altar covered with gold for burning incense. It also had the sacred chest. All its sides were covered with gold. In it was the golden pot which contained pieces of the food they called manna. In the chest there was also Aaron's walking stick that had budded to prove that he was God's true priest. In the chest were also the stone tablets on which God had written the Ten Commandments.
\v 5 On top of the chest were figures of winged creatures that symbolized God's glory. Their wings overshadowed the sacred chest's lid where the high priest sprinkled the blood to atone for the sins of the people. I cannot now write about these things in detail.

\v 3 And behind the second curtain was another room, called the most holy place.
\v 4 It had a golden altar for incense. It also had the ark of the covenant, which was completely overlaid with gold. Inside it was a golden jar holding the manna, Aaronâ€™s rod that budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant.
\v 5 Above the ark of the covenant figures of glorious cherubim hovered over the atonement lid, which we cannot now describe in detail.
