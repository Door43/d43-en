\v 18 And so God put the first covenant into effect only by means of animals' blood that flowed when the priests sacrificed them.
\v 19 After Moses had declared to all the Israelites everything that God commanded in the laws that God gave him, he took calves' and goats' blood mixed with water. He dipped into this blood scarlet wool that he tied around a sprig of hyssop. Then he sprinkled with some of the blood the scroll itself containing God's laws. Then he sprinkled more of that blood on all the people.
\v 20 He said to them, "This is the blood that brings into effect the covenant that God commanded that you obey."

\v 18 Therefore even the first covenant was not established without blood.
\v 19 For when Moses had told every command in the Law to all the people, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and red wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the scroll itself and all the people;
\v 20 he said, "This is the blood of the covenant from which God has given commandments to you."
