====== Hebrews 09:25-26 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 25 The \add Jewish\add* high priest enters the very holy place once every year, taking blood that is not his own, \add to offer it as a sacrifice\add*. But when Christ entered heaven, it was not in order to offer himself repeatedly like that.
\v 26 \add If that were so\add*, he would have needed to suffer \add and shed his blood\add* repeatedly since \add the time when God\add* created the world. But instead, in this final age, \add Christ\add* has appeared once in order that by sacrificing himself he could cause \add that people\add* no longer will be \add punished for their\add* sins.

\v 26 If that were so, he would have needed to suffer and shed his blood repeatedly since the time when God created the world. But instead, in this final age, Christ has appeared once so that by sacrificing himself, God will forgive all our sins and will not condemn us any more because we have sinned.

\v 25 He did not go there in order to offer himself many times, as does the high priest, who enters the most holy place year by year with the blood of another.
\v 26 If that had been the case, then it would have been necessary for him to suffer many times since the world's foundation. But now it is just one time at the end of the ages that he has been revealed to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.

  * **If that had been the case** - "If he had had to offer himself often"
  * **since the world's foundation** - The creation of the world is spoken of as if the world were a building and the foundation was the first part to be constructed. AT: "since God began to create the world" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **he has been revealed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God has revealed him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself** - This speaks about sin as if it were an object that a person could put away. Putting sin away represents forgiving it.
