\v 23 It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in heaven should be cleansed with these animal sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves must be cleansed with much better sacrifices than these.
\v 24 For Christ did not enter into the very holy place made with hands, which is a copy of the true one, but instead  he entered into heaven itself where he now appears before the face of God for us.
