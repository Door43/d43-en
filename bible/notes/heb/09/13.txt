====== Hebrews 09:13-15 ======

<usfm>
\v 13 The priests sprinkle on people goats' blood and bulls' blood and \add the water that has been filtered through\add* the ashes of a \add red\add* heifer that has been\add completely burned. By performing that ritual, they can ritually\add* cleanse the bodies of those who are \add ceremonially\add* unclean. Furthermore, performing those rituals enabled people to have fellowship with God again.
\v 14 \add So, because we know what\add* Christ \add accomplished when\add* his blood flowed \add when he died for us\add* \f + \ft personification, metonymy \f*, we will be very certain that we are not guilty \add for having\add* done those things \add that those who are spiritually\add* dead do. \add As a result\add*, we can serve the all-powerful God. \add The priests always offer to God animals\add* with no defects. Similarly, when Christ offered himself \add as a sacrifice\add* to God, he was sinless \f + \ft metaphor \f*. He did that as a result of \add God's\add* eternal Spirit \add helping him\add*.


\p
\v 15 \add By\add* dying \add for us\add*, \add Christ\add* \add redeemed\f + \ft Or: \add*set free from the penalty for their sins \f* even those who disobeyed the \add conditions of\add* \f + \ft Or: \add during the time of\add* \f* the first covenant. So, \add because\add* no \add one could be made perfect by obeying the old covenant\add*, now Christ establishes \add between God and people\add* a new covenant. He does that in order that those whom God has chosen may eternally have \add the blessings that God\add* has promised them.

\v 13 The priests sprinkle on people goats' blood and bulls' blood and the water that has been filtered through the ashes of a red heifer that they have completely burned. By performing that ritual, they then say that God will now accept that the people should worship him.
\v 14 If all that is true, then it became even more true when Christ, who had never sinned, sacrificed himself to Godâ€”he did this by the power of God's eternal Spirit. Because he sacrificed himself, God now forgives us for having sinned, for having done things that would have made us die forever. Now it is as though we had never sinned; now we can worship the true God. 


\p
\v 15 By dying for us, Christ made for God a new covenant with us. We were trying to please God by means of the first covenant, but we were still guilty of having sinned. When he died, he freed us from having to die for our own sins. As a result, all of us whom God has called to know him will receive what he has promised to give us forever.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 For if the blood of goats and bulls and the sprinkling of a heifer's ashes on those who are ritually unclean purifies them and makes their body clean,
\v 14 how much more will Christ's blood, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse our conscience from dead deeds to serve the living God?
\v 15 For this reason, Christ is the mediator of a new covenant. This is because a death has taken place to free those under the first covenant from the penalty of their sins, so that those called by God might receive the promise of their eternal inheritance.
