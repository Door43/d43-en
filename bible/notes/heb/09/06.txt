<usfm>
\v 6 After they have arranged all these things in this way, the Jewish priests habitually go into the outer room of the tent to do their tasks.
\v 7 But into the inner room only the high priest goes once a year. He always takes the blood of animals that they have slaughtered. He offers the blood to God for his own sins and for the sins that the other israelites have committed. This includes  the sins that they do not realize they have done.

\v 6 After these things have been prepared, the priests regularly enter the outer room of the tabernacle to perform their services.
\v 7 But the high priest enters the second room alone once each year, and not without offering a blood sacrifice for himself and for the people's unintentional offenses.
