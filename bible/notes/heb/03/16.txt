\v 16 Remember who it was who rebelled against God, even though they heard him speak to them. It was all of God's people who Moses led out of Egypt.
\v 17 And remember who it was with whom  God was disgusted for forty years. It was God's people who sinned, and their dead bodies lay there in the desert.
\v 18 And remember about whom God solemnly declared, "They will not enter the land where I would let them rest." It was those Israelites who disobeyed God.
\v 19 So, from that example we know that it was because they did not keep trusting in God that they were unable to enter the land where God would allow them to rest.

\p
\v 16 Who was it who heard God and rebelled? Was it not all those whom Moses had led out of Egypt?
\v 17 And with whom was God angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose dead bodies lay in the wilderness?
\v 18 To whom did God swear that they would not enter his rest, if it was not to those who were disobeying him?
\v 19 We see that they were not able to enter his rest because of unbelief.
