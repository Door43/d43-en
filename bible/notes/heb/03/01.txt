\c 3
\p
\v 1 Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, even Jesus;
\v 2 who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house.
\v 3 For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by so much as he that built the house has more honor than the house.
\v 4 For every house is builded by some one; but he that built all things is God.
