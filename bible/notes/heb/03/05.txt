<usfm>
\v 5 Moses very faithfully served God as he helped all of God's people, just as a servant faithfully serves his master. So Moses testified about what Jesus would say later.
\v 6 But Christ is the Son who rules over God's people, and we are the people he rules if we continue to courageously believe in Christ and confidently expect God to do all that he has promised to do for us.

<usfm>
\v 5 On one hand, Moses was faithful as a servant in God's entire house. He was a testimony about the things that were to be spoken of in the future.
\v 6 But Christ is the Son in charge of God's house. We are his house if we hold fast to our courage and to our proud confidence.
