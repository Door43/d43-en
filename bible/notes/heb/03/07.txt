\v 8 do not stubbornly \add disobey\f + \ft Or: refuse to\add* obey \add him\add* \f* \f + \ft idiom \f*, \add as the your ancestors stubbornly disobeyed him\add* when they rebelled against \add him\add* in the desert.

\v 7 The Holy Spirit caused the Psalmist to write these words in the scriptures to the Israelites:
\q "Now, when you hear God speak to you,
\v 8 do not refuse to obey him, and do not let your desires be more important that what God says, for if you do, you would be just like your ancestors long ago, when they turned away from God and did not obey him.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 Therefore, it is just as the Holy Spirit says:
\q "Today, if you hear his voice,
\q
\v 8 do not harden your hearts
\q as in the rebellion,
\q in the time of testing in the wilderness.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The warning here is a reminder that the Israelites' unbelief kept almost all of them from entering into the land that God had promised them. Their unbelief was well illustrated in Exodus [[:en:bible:notes:exo:17:01|17:1-7]], when they complained against Moses and doubted that God was with them.
  * **General Information:** - This quotation comes from  the Old Testament in the book of Psalms.

  * **if you hear his voice** - God's commands to Israel are spoken of as if he had given them in an audible voice. AT: "if you hear God speaking"  "(See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **do not harden your hearts** - Stubbornness is spoken of as if it were a heart that had been physically hardened. AT: "do not be stubborn" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **as in the rebellion, in the time of testing in the wilderness** - Here "rebellion" and "tested" can be stated as verbs. AT: "like when your ancestors rebelled against God and tested him in the wilderness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
