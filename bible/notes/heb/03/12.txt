====== Hebrews 03:12-13 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 In accordance with that, my fellow believers, beware that none of you wickedly stops trusting \add in Christ\add*. That would cause you to reject the all-powerful God.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 So, fellow believers, be careful that none of you stops trusting in Christ because of evil in your heart, which would cause you to reject the only God who actually lives.
\v 13 Instead, each of you must encourage each other every day, while you still have the opportunity. If you are stubborn, others will deceive you and lead you to sin.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 12 Be careful, brothers, so that among you there will not be anyone with an evil heart of unbelief, a heart that turns away from the living God.
\v 13 Instead, encourage one another daily, as long as it is called "today," so that no one among you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **brothers** - Here this refers to fellow Christians including males and females. AT: "brothers and sisters" or "fellow believers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_gendernotations]])
  * **there will not be anyone with an evil heart of unbelief, a heart that turns away from the living God** - Here "heart" is a metonym that represents a person's mind or will. Refusing to believe and obey God is spoken of as if the heart did not believe and it physically turned away from God. AT: "there will not be any of you who refuse to believe the truth and who stop obeying the living God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **the living God** - "the true God who is really alive" 
  * **as long as it is called "today,"** - "while there is still opportunity,"
  * **no one among you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the deceitfulness of sin will not harden any of you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **no one among you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin** - Being stubborn is spoken of as being hard or having a hard heart. The hardness is a result of being deceived by sin. This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "deceitfulness" is expressed as the verb "deceive." AT: "no one among you will be deceived by sin and become stubborn" or "you do not sin, deceiving yourselves so that you become stubborn" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
