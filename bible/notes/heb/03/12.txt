===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 So, fellow believers, be careful that none of you stops trusting in Christ because of evil in your heart, which would cause you to reject the only God who actually lives.
\v 13 Instead, each of you must encourage each other every day, while you still have the opportunity. If you are stubborn, others will deceive you and lead you to sin.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 12 Be careful, brothers, so that there may not be an evil heart of unbelief in any of you, a heart that will turn away from the living God.
\v 13 Instead, encourage one another daily, so long as it is called today, so that no one among you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
