===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 So, fellow believers, be careful that none of you stops trusting in Christ because of evil in your heart, which would cause you to reject the only God who actually lives.
\v 13 Instead, each of you must encourage each other every day, while you still have the opportunity. If you are stubborn, others will deceive you and lead you to sin.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 12 Be careful, brothers, so that among you there will not be anyone with an evil heart of unbelief, a heart that turns away from the living God.
\v 13 Instead, encourage one another daily, as long as it is called "today," so that no one among you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **brothers** - Here this refers to fellow Christians including males and females. AT: "brothers and sisters" or "fellow believers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_gendernotations]])
  * **there will not be anyone with an evil heart of unbelief** - The heart is spoken of here as if it were a person's mind, the center of a person's will and motivation. AT: "none of you stop believing in God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a heart that turns away from the living God** - The heart of a person is spoken of as if it were the entire person, who could abandon the right path to follow. AT: "and you stop obeying the living God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the living God** - "the true God who is really alive" 
  * **as long as it is called "today"** - "while there is still opportunity"
  * **no one among you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the deceitfulness of sin does not harden any of you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **no one among you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin** - Being stubborn is spoken of as being hard or having a hard heart. The hardness is a result of being deceived by sin. This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "deceitfulness" is expressed as the verb "deceive." AT: "no one among you will be deceived by sin and become stubborn" or "you do not sin, deceiving yourselves so that you become stubborn" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
