====== Hebrews 03:9-11 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 Your ancestors repeatedly tested \add whether I would be patient with them, even though\add* for forty years they saw all the amazing things I did.
\p
\v 10 So, I became disgusted with the people who saw those things, and I said \add about them\add*, 'They are constantly disloyal to me, and they do not understand how I \add wanted them\add* to conduct their lives.'
\p
\v 11 As a result, because I was angry with them, I solemnly declared, 'They will not enter \add the land of Canaan\add* where I would let them rest \f + \ft metonymy \f*!'

\v 10 So I became disgusted with those people, and I said about them, 'They are never faithful to me, and they do not understand how I wanted them to conduct their lives.'
\p
\v 11 I was angry with them and solemnly declared, 'They will not enter the land of Canaan where I would let them rest!'"

\q
\v 9 This was when your ancestors rebelled by testing me,
\q and when, during forty years, they saw my deeds.
\q
\v 10 Therefore I was displeased with that generation.
\q I said, 'They are always going astray in their hearts,
\q and they do not know my ways.
\q
\v 11 It is as I swore in my anger:
\q they will not enter my rest.'"
