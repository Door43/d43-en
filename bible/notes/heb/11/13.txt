It was as though they had admitted that they did not belong to this earth, but that they were only here temporarily.

\v 13 These all died in faith without receiving the promises. Instead, having seen and welcomed them from far off, they admitted that they were strangers and aliens on the earth.
\v 14 For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a homeland of their own.
