\v 17 Because Abraham trusted God, he was ready to kill his son Isaac as a sacrifice when God tested him. Abraham, to whom God promised to give a son, was going to sacrifice the very son whom he had given him, the only son whom his own wife had borne!
\v 18 It was about this son that God had said, "It is only from Isaac that I will consider your family to descend."
\v 19 Abraham considered that to fulfill that promise, God could make Isaac live again even if he died after Abraham had sacrificed him! The result was that when Abraham did receive Isaac back after God told him not to harm Isaac, it was as though he received him back even after he died.

\v 17It was by faith that Abraham, after being tested, offered up Isaac. Yes, he who had gladly received the promises was offering up his only son,
\v 18 about whom it was said, "From Isaac will your descendants be called."
\v 19 Abraham considered that God was able to raise up Isaac from the dead. Figuratively speaking, he did receive him back.
