====== Hebrews 11 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Many people refer to this chapter as the "Hall of Fame of faith." This is because it chronicles the people with the greatest [[:en:obe:kt:faith|faith]] in God in the history of the world. 

Having contrasted Christianity with Judaism, the author now begins to show the continuity between the two. It is faith, which God has always required, no matter what the covenantal arrangement guiding the actions of his children. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Faith ==
This chapter gives a definition of the biblical concept of faith. The translator's language may not have a word that directly corresponds to this definition. It is common for a language to lack a word that directly corresponds to a biblical word or concept.
