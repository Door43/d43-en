\v 2 It was because our ancestors trusted in God that \add he\add* commended them.
\v 3 It is because we trust in God that we understand that God formed the universe by commanding \add that it exist\add*. The result is that the things that we see were not made from things that already existed.

\v 1 Now faith is the assurance one has when he is confidently expecting something. It is the certainty about what is still not seen.
\v 2 For by this our ancestors were approved for their faith. 
\v 3 By faith we understand that the universe was created by God's command, so that what is visible was not made out of things that were visible.
