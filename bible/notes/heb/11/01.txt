\v 1 It is because people trust \add God\add* that they are sure that they will receive the things that they confidently expect \add God to give them\add*. They are also certain \add that they will see those things happen\add*, though no one sees them yet.
\v 2 It was because our ancestors trusted in God that \add he\add* commended them.
\v 3 It is because we trust in God that we understand that God formed the universe by commanding \add that it exist\add*. The result is that the things that we see were not made from things that already existed.

\v 2 It was because our ancestors trusted in God that he commended them.
\v 3 Because we trust in God we understand that God formed the universe by commanding that it exist. So the things that we see were not made from things that already existed.

\v 1 Now trusting God is the assurance of confidently expecting things, a certainty of things not seen.
\v 2 For by this the ancestors were commended for their faith. 
\v 3 By faith we understand that the universe has been created by the word of God, so that what is seen has not been made out of things which are visible.
