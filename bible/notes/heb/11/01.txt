\v 1 It is because people trust \add God\add* that they are sure that they will receive the things that they confidently expect \add God to give them\add*. They are also certain \add that they will see those things happen\add*, though no one sees them yet.
\v 2 It was because our ancestors trusted in God that \add he\add* commended them.
\v 3 It is because we trust in God that we understand that God formed the universe by commanding \add that it exist\add*. The result is that the things that we see were not made from things that already existed.

\v 1 It is because people trust God that they are sure they will receive the things they confidently expect him to give them. They are also certain they will see those things happen, though no one sees them yet.
\v 2 Because our ancestors trusted in God, he approved of them.
\v 3 Because we trust in God, we understand that God formed the universe by commanding that it exist. So the things we see were not made from things that already existed.

\v 1 Now faith is the assurance about the things we hoped for, being convinced of things we do not see.
\v 2 For because of this the ancestors were approved for their faith.
\v 3 By faith we understand that the universe was created by God's command, so that what is visible was not made out of things that were visible.
