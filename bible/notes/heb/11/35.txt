\v 35 Some women who trusted God received their relatives back again when God made them live again after they had died. But others who trusted God were tortured until they died. They were tortured because they refused to agree when their enemies said, "We will release you if you deny that you believe in God." They refused to do that, because they wanted to live with God forever, which is better than continuing to live on earth.
\v 36 Other people who trusted God were mocked. Some had their backs cut open by being struck with whips. Some were chained and put in prison.
\v 37 Some of those believers were stoned to death. Others were sawn completely in two. Others were killed with swords. Others of these people who trusted God wandered around the land wearing garments made only of skins from sheep and goats. They did not have any money. People constantly oppressed them and harmed them.
\v 38 The people on earth who caused those who trusted in God to suffer like this were so bad that they did not deserve to live with people like those who trusted God. Some who trusted God wandered in deserts and mountains. Some lived in caves and in other large holes in the ground.

\v 35 Women received back their dead by resurrection. Others were tortured, not accepting their release so that they might experience a better resurrection.
\v 36 Others suffered mocking and whippings, yes, even chains and imprisonment.
\v 37 They were stoned. They were sawn in two. They were slain with the sword. They went about in sheepskins and  goatskins being destitute, afflicted, and ill-treated
\v 38 (of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in wildernesses, mountains, caves, and in the holes in the ground.
