\v 35 Women received their dead by a resurrection: and others were tortured, not accepting their release so that they might obtain a better resurrection;
\v 36 and others had trials of mockings and whippings, yes, even chains and imprisonment;
\v 37 they were stoned, they were sawed in two, they were tempted, they were slain with the sword: they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated
\v 38 (of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves, and the holes of the earth.
