\v 8 By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going.
\v 9 By faith he became a traveller in the land of promise. It was not his own land, dwelling in tents, with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise;
\v 10 for he looked for the city which has the foundations, whose builder and maker is God.
