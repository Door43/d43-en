\v 5 It was because Enoch believed \add God that God\add* took him \add up to heaven\add*. The result was that he did not die. No one found him, because he was taken up \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* had removed him \f* from the earth \add to heaven\add*. Before \add God\add* took him away, \add he\add* testified that Enoch pleased him well.
\v 6 It is possible for people to please God only if they trust God, because anyone who wants to come to God must first believe that God exists and that he rewards those who seek \add to know\add* him.

\v 5 Because Enoch believed God, God took him up to heaven. Enoch did not die, but no one could find him. Before God took him away, he testified that Enoch pleased him well.
\v 6 Now it is possible for people to please God only if they trust him, because anyone who wants to come to God must first believe that God exists and that he rewards those who try to know him.

\v 5 It was by faith that Enoch was taken up and did not see death. "He was not found, because God took him." For it was said of him that he had pleased God before he was taken up.
\v 6 Without faith it is impossible to please God, for the one who comes to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.
