\v 27 Because he trusted God, Moses left Egypt. He was not afraid that the king would be angry because he left. He kept going because it was as though he kept seeing God, whom no one can see.
\v 28 Because Moses believed God would save his own people, he obeyed God's commands about Passover, which became a yearly festival. He commanded the people to kill lambs and sprinkle their blood on their doorposts so that the angel who causes people to die would not kill the oldest male Israelites with the oldest sons in each Egyptian family.

\v 27 It was by faith that Moses left Egypt. He did not fear the king's anger, for he endured as if he were seeing
the one who is invisible.
\v 28 It was by faith that he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch the Israelites' firstborn sons.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **he endured as if he were seeing the one who is invisible** - Moses is spoken of as if he saw God, who is invisible. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **the one who is invisible** - "the one no one can see"
  * **he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood** - This was the first Passover. Moses kept it by obeying God's commands concerning the Passover and by commanding the people to obey them every year. AT: "he commanded the people to obey God's commands concerning the Passover and to sprinkle blood on their doors" or "he established the Passover and the sprinkling of blood"
  * **the sprinkling of the blood** - This refers to God's command to the Israelites to kill a lamb and spread its blood on the doorposts of every house where Israelites lived. This would prevent the destroyer from harming their firstborn sons. This was one of the Passover commands. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **should not touch** - Here "touch" refers to harming or to killing someone. AT: "would not harm" or "would not kill" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
