\v 27 Because he trusted God, Moses left Egypt. He was not afraid that the king would be angry because he left. He kept going because it was as though he kept seeing God, whom no one can see.
\v 28 Because Moses believed God would save his own people, he obeyed God's commands about Passover, which became a yearly festival. He commanded the people to  kill lambs and sprinkle their blood on their doorposts so that the angel who causes people to die would not kill the oldest male Israelites with the oldest sons in each Egyptian family.

\v 27 It was by faith that Moses left Egypt. He did not fear the king's anger, for he endured by looking to the one who is invisible.
\v 28 It was by faith that he observed the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch the Isrealites's firstborn sons.
