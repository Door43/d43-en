\v 32 I do not know what more I should say \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add about others who trusted in God\add*. It would take too much time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the \add other\add* prophets.
\v 33 It was because they trusted God that some of them \add did great deeds for him\add*. Some conquered lands ruled by powerful men. Some ruled \add Israel\add* and justly \add punished those men and nations who rebelled against God\add*. Some obtained \add from God\add* the things that he promised to give them \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 34 Some forced lions to keep their mouths shut. Some escaped from being destroyed by fire. Some of those people escaped from \add being killed with\add* a sword \f + \ft metonymy \f*. Some of those \add people who trusted God\add* were made strong \f + \ft Or:became mighty \f* again after they had once been weak. Some became powerful when they fought wars.

\v 33 Because they trusted God, some of them did great deeds for him. Some conquered lands ruled by powerful men. Some ruled Israel and justly treated men and nations. Some received from God the things that he promised to give them. Some forced lions to keep their mouths shut.
\v 34 Some escaped from burning up in fire. Some escaped from others who tried to kill them with swords. Some became well again after being sick. Some became powerful when they fought wars. Some caused armies that came from foreign lands to run away from them.

\v 32 And what more can I say? For the time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and of the prophets.
\v 33 It was through faith that they conquered kingdoms, worked justice, and received  promises. They stopped lions' mouths,
\v 34 quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, were healed from illnesses, became mighty in war, and defeated foreign armies.
