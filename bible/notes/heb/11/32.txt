\v 33 It was because they trusted God that some of them \add did great deeds for him\add*. Some conquered lands ruled by powerful men.

\v 34 Some escaped from burning up in fire. Some escaped from others who tried to kill them with swords. Some became well again after being sick. Some became powerful when they fought wars. Some caused armies that came from foreign lands to run away from them.

\v 32 And what more can I say? For the time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and of the prophets,
\v 33 who through faith conquered kingdoms, worked justice, and received  promises. They stopped lions' mouths,
\v 34 quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, were healed from illnesses, became mighty in war, and caused foreign armies to flee.
