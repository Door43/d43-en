\v 23 It was because Moses' father and mother trusted God that they hid \add their son\add* for three months shortly after he was born, because they saw that the child was beautiful. They were not afraid of \add disobeying\add* what the king of Egypt had commanded, \add namely, that all the Jewish male babies must be killed\add*.
\v 24 The daughter of the \add king, whom they called\add* Pharaoh, \add raised\add* Moses, but when he had grown up it was because he trusted God that he refused to \add accept the privileges that would have been his if people\add* considered that he was the son of the king's daughter\f + \ft Or: the king's own grandson \f*.
\v 25 He decided that it was better for others to mistreat him for a time along with the Israelite people, than to temporarily enjoy living sinfully \add in the King's palace\add*.
\v 26 This is because he decided that if he suffered for the Messiah, it would be worth far more \add in God's sight\add* than his owning all the treasures of Egypt \add that he would receive as Pharaoh's heir. He decided that\add* because he looked forward to the time when \add God would give him\add* an \add eternal\add* reward.

\v 23 Because Moses' father and mother trusted God, they hid their son for three months shortly after he was born, because they saw that the child was beautiful. They were not afraid of disobeying what the king of Egypt had commanded, that all the Jewish male babies must die.
\v 24 The daughter of the king, whom they called Pharaoh, raised Moses, but when Moses had grown up, because he trusted God, he refused to accept the royal privileges that would have been his if people considered him as "the son of Pharaoh's daughter."
\v 25 He decided that it was better for others to mistreat him for a time along with God's people, than to temporarily enjoy living sinfully in the King's palace.
\v 26 He decided that if he suffered for Christ, it would be worth far more in God's sight than owning the treasures of Egypt that he would receive as one of Pharaoh's family. He looked forward to the time when God would give him an eternal reward.

\v 23 It was by faith that Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents because they saw he was a beautiful infant, and they were not afraid of the king’s command.
\v 24 It was by faith that Moses, after he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter.
\v 25 Instead, he chose to share mistreatment with God's people, rather than enjoy the pleasures of sin for a while.
\v 26 He considered the disgrace of following Christ as greater riches than the treasures of Egypt, for he was fixing his eyes on his future reward.
