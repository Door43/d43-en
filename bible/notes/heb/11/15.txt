\v 15 If they had been thinking that their true native land was the place from which they had come, they could have simply returned there.
\v 16 But, instead, they desired a better place in which to live. They desired a home in heaven. So God has prepared a city for them to live with him, and he is pleased for them to say that he is their God.

\v 15 If they had been thinking of the country from which they gone out, they would have had opportunity to return.
\v 16 But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, since he has prepared a city for them.
