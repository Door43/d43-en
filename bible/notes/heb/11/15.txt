\v 15 If they had been thinking that their true native land was the place from which they had come, they could have simply returned  there.
\v 16 But, instead, they desired a better place in which to live. They desired a home in heaven. So God has prepared a city for them to live with him, and he is pleased for them to say that he is their God.
