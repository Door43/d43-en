\v 7 God warned Noah that he would send a flood, and Noah believed him. He honored God by building a ship to save his family. In this way he showed that the rest of the people deserved for God to punish them. So Noah became a person whom God made right with himself, because Noah trusted him.

\v 7 It was by faith that Noah, being warned by God concerning things not yet seen, with godly reverence built a ship to save his family. By doing this, he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes through faith.
