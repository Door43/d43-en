===== Translation Notes: =====

The author of Hebrews has just written about many tortured believers.

    * **Although all these people were approved by God because of their faith, they did not receive what he promised** - AT: "God honored all these because of their faith, but they did not themselves receive what God had promised" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
