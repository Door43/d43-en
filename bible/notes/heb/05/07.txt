===== translationNotes: =====

  * **During the days of his flesh** - Here "the days" stands for a period of time. And, "flesh" stand for Jesus's earthly life. AT: "While he lived on earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **prayers and requests** - Both of these words mean basically the same thing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **to save him from death** - Death is spoken of as it if were place that Christ could be kept from being forced to enter, or as a place from which he could be rescued. Either meaning fits here. The UDB chooses the first meaning. If possible, translate so as to allow both interpretations. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he was heard** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God heard him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **a son** - This is an important title for Jesus, the Son of God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
