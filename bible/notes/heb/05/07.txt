===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the time of his flesh** - "His flesh" stands for Jesus's earthly life. AT: "While he lived on earth." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **save him from death** - Death is spoken of as it if were place that Christ could be kept from being forced to enter, or as a place from which he could be rescued. Either meaning fits here. The UDB chooses the first meaning. If possible, translate so as to allow both interpretations. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a son** - The author wishes to imply here, "Even though he was God's Son." (See: [[:en:phase1:team-info:training:topics:discourse:implicitexplicit]])
