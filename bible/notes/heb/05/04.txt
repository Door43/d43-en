\v 4 Furthermore, no one honors himself \add by appointing himself to become a high priest\add*. Instead, God chose each man \add to become a high priest\add*, as he chose Aaron \add to be the first high priest\add*.
\v 5 Similarly, Christ also did not honor himself by appointing himself to become a high priest. Instead, God \add appointed him by\add* saying to \add him what he never said to any other priest, what the\add* Psalmist wrote in the Scriptures,
\q You\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* are my Son! Today I have declared that I am your Father!

\q "You are my Son! Today I have declared that I am your Father!" God not only chose Jesus as our perfect High Priest, but he sent Jesus as his only Son, the Son of God.

\v 4 And no man takes this honor to himself, but instead he must be called by God, just as Aaron was.
\v 5 So Christ also did not glorify himself to become high priest, but God spoke to him,
\q "You are my Son,
\q Today I have become your Father."
