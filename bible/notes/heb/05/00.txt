====== Hebrews 05 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 5:5-6, which are quotations from the Old Testament.

This chapter is a continuation of the teaching of the previous chapter. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== High priest ==
Jesus needed to be a high priest to offer his life as a sacrifice for sin. The high priest was normally from the tribe of Levi, but Jesus was from the ruling tribe, Judah. His right to be a priest came from the tradition of Melchizedek, who was a priest before the Levites came into existence. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Milk and solid food ==
This is an image used to describe maturity in Christ. It compares the immature Christian to a baby who is only able to drink milk. They are not mature enough to handle solid food, which is the more complex teachings about Jesus. Instead, they have chosen not to grown and remain like a baby who only drinks milk, the simpler and more basic teachings about Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
