\v 1 Every \add Jewish\add* high priest was chosen by \add God\add* \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* chose every \add Jewish\add* high priest \f* from among\add ordinary\add* men. They were appointed \f + \ft Or:\add He\add* appointed them \f* in order that they would come before him on behalf of the people. \add Specifically, God appointed them\add* in order that they would bring gifts \add to him on behalf of the people\add*, and in order to sacrifice \add animals to him\add* for people who sinned.
\v 2 The high priests could deal gently with those who ignorantly sinned, since they themselves tended to sin easily.
\v 3 As a result, they had to offer something to God for themselves for their own sins, just like \add they had to offer something to God\add* for \add God's\add* people who sinned.

<usfm>
\v 1 When God chooses a high priest, he selects a man from the people. This man must serve God for the people; he must give God and sacrifice animals to him for the people's sins.
\v 2 A high priest can be gentle with those who know little about God and with those who sin against him. This is because the high priest himself is weak with sin.
\v 3 As a result, he also must sacrifice animals, because he sins just like the people do.

\v 1 For every high priest, chosen from among men, is appointed to act on behalf of people in things pertaining to God, so that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.
\v 2 He can deal gently with the ignorant and the wayward since he himself also is burdened with weakness.
\v 3  Because of this, he also is obligated to present sacrifices for his sins just as he does for the people's sins.
