\v 1 For every high priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:
\v 2 who can bear gently with the ignorant and erring, for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity;
\v 3 and by reason thereof is bound, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.
