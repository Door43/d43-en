\v 1 Every Jewish high priest was chosen by God so that they would come before him on behalf of the people. God appointed the high priest to bring gifts to him for the people, and to sacrifice animals to him for their sins.
\v 2 The high priests could deal gently with those whom others deceived and led them to  ignorantly sin, since the priests themselves also had weakness to sin.
\v 3 As a result, they had to offer something to God for themselves for their own sins, just like they had to offer something to God for God's people who sinned.

\v 1 For every high priest, chosen from among men, is appointed to act on behalf of men in things pertaining to God, so that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for their sins.
\v 2 He can deal gently with the ignorant and the wayward since he himself also is burdened with weakness.
\v 3  Therefore, because of his weaknesses, he too is obligated to offer sacrifices for his sins just as he does for the people's sins.
