You need \add those elementary truths\add* like babies need milk \f + \ft metaphor \f*. You are not \add ready for advanced teaching, which is like\add* the solid food \add which mature people need\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 13 Remember that those \add who are still learning these elementary truths\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* have not become familiar with \add what God\add* says concerning becoming\f + \ft Or: being \f* righteous. They are \add just like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* babies \add who need\add* milk!
\v 14 But \add the more advanced spiritual truth\add* is for people who are \add spiritually\add* mature, just like \f + \ft metaphor \f* solid food is for \add people who are physically\add* mature. They can tell the difference between what is good and what is evil, because they have trained themselves \add to keep doing that\add*.

\v 12 You became Christians long ago. So by now you should be teaching God's truths to others. But you still need someone to teach you again the elementary truths of the words of God from the scriptures, starting from the beginning. You need those basic truths like babies need milk. You are not ready to learn more difficult things, things that are like the solid food that mature people need.
\v 13 Remember that those who are still learning these elementary truths do not understand what God says about becoming righteous. Neither do they yet know right from wrong. They are just like babies who need milk!
\v 14 But the more difficult spiritual truth is for people who know God better, just like solid food is for people who are adults. They can tell the difference between what is good and what is evil, because they have trained themselves by learning what is right and what is wrong.

\v 12 For though by this time you should be teachers, you still have need for someone to teach you the basic principles of God's messages. You need milk, not solid food!
\v 13 For anyone who only takes milk is inexperienced with the message of righteousness, because he is still a little child.
\v 14 But solid food is for adults. These are those who because of their maturity have their understanding trained for distinguishing good from evil.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **basic principles** - Here "principles" means a guideline or standard for making decisions. AT: "basic truths"
  * **You need milk** - Teaching about God that is easy to understand is spoken of as if it were milk, the only food that infants can take. AT: "You have become like babies and can drink only milk" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **milk, not solid food** - Teaching about God that is difficult to understand is spoken of as if it were solid food, suitable for adults. AT: "milk instead of solid food that adults can eat" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **takes milk** - Here "takes" stands for "drinks." AT: "drinks milk" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **because he is still a little child** - Spiritual maturity is compared with the kind of food that a growing child eats. Solid food is not for a tiny baby, and that is a figure describing a young Christian who only learns simple truths; but later, more solid food is given to the little child, just as when a person matures he can learn about matters that are more difficult. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **who because of their maturity have their understanding trained for distinguishing good from evil** - People trained to understand something are spoken of as if their ability to understand had been trained. AT: "who are mature and can distinguish between good and evil" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
