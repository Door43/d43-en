\v 12 \add You became Christians long ago. So\add* by now you should be teaching \add spiritual truths to others\add*. But you still need someone to teach you again the truths that God has revealed. \add I am talking about\add* the truths that we teach people \add when they\add* first \add believe in Christ\add*. You need \add those elementary truths\add* like babies need milk \f + \ft metaphor \f*. You are not \add ready for advanced teaching, which is like\add* the solid food \add which mature people need\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 13 Remember that those \add who are still learning these elementary truths\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* have not become familiar with \add what God\add* says concerning becoming\f + \ft Or: being \f* righteous. They are \add just like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* babies \add who need\add* milk!
\v 14 But \add the more advanced spiritual truth\add* is for people who are \add spiritually\add* mature, just like \f + \ft metaphor \f* solid food is for \add people who are physically\add* mature. They can tell the difference between what is good and what is evil, because they have trained themselves \add to keep doing that\add*.

\v 12 You became Christians long ago. So by now you should be teaching God's truths to others. But you still need someone to teach you again the elementary truths of the words of God from the Scriptures, starting from the beginning. You need those basic truths like babies need milk. You are not ready to learn more difficult things, things that are like the solid food that mature people need.
\v 13 Remember that those who are still learning these elementary truths do not understand what God says about becoming righteous. Neither do they yet know right from wrong. They are just like babies who need milk!
\v 14 But the more difficult spiritual truth is for people who know God better, just like solid food is for people who are adults. They can tell the difference between what is good and what is evil, because they have trained themselves by learning what is right and what is wrong.

\v 12 For though by this time you ought to be teachers, it is still necessary that someone teach you the basic principles of God's words. You are in need of milk, not solid food.
\v 13 For anyone who can only drink milk is inexperienced in the message of righteousness, for he is still a baby.
\v 14 On the other hand, solid food is for full-grown adults, the ones who because of their experience in distinguishing right from wrong have been trained to discern both good and evil.
