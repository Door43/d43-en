====== Hebrews 01:4-5 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 By doing that he \add showed that he\add* was very much greater than the angels, to the extent that his relationship \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add to God, as his Son\add*, is more excellent than the relationship the angels \add have to God\add*.
\v 5 \add We know that\add* because \add in the Scriptures\add* no one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* ever reported that God said to any angel \add what he said to his Son\add*,
\q You\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* are my Son!
\q Today I have declared to all that I am your Father \f + \ft doublet \f*!
\q And he said in another Scripture passage,
\q I will be his Father,
\q and he will be my Son \f + \ft doublet \f*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 God has made his Son to be far greater than the angels, just as his name and authority are far greater than theirs.
\v 5 In the Scriptures no one ever reported that God said to any angel what he said to his Son:
\q "You are my Son!
\q Today I have declared to all that I am your Father!"
\p And he said in another Scripture passage,
\q "I will be his Father,
\q and he will be my Son."


\p

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 He has become just as superior to the angels, as the name he has inherited is more excellent than their name.
\v 5 For to which of the angels did he ever say,
\q "You are my son;
\q today I have become your father"?
\p And again,
\q "I will be a father to him,
\q and he will be a son to me"?
</usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **He has become** - "Jesus has become"
  * **For to which of the angels did he ever say...father"?** - The question emphasizes that of course God does not call any angel his Son. "For God never said to any of the angels...father'." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **did he ever say** - "did God, the Father, ever say"
  * **You are my son...I have become your father...I will be a father to him...he will be a son to me** - The special relationship God the Father has with God the Son is described in the Old Testament hundreds of years before Jesus was born.
  * **And again...? - Again, the question emphasizes that of course God does not call any angel his Son. "And he says in another place it says that God never said the following to any angel:" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **I...me** - This refers to God the Father.
