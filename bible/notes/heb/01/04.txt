<usfm>
\v 4 By doing that he \add showed that he\add* was very much greater than the angels, to the extent that his relationship \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add to God, as his Son\add*, is more excellent than the relationship the angels \add have to God\add*.
\v 5 \add We know that\add* because \add in the Scriptures\add* no one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* ever reported that God said to any angel \add what he said to his Son\add*,
\q You\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* are my Son!
\q Today I have declared to all that I am your Father \f + \ft doublet \f*!
\q And he said in another Scripture passage,
\q I will be his Father,
\q and he will be my Son \f + \ft doublet \f*.

<usfm>
\v 4 God has made his Son to be far greater than the angels, just as his name and authority are far greater than theirs.
\v 5 In the Scriptures no one ever reported that God said to any angel what he said to his Son:
\q "You are my Son!
\q Today I have declared to all that I am your Father!"
And he said in another Scripture passage,
\q "I will be his Father,
\q and he will be my Son."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 He has become as superior to the angels, as the name that he has inherited is more excellent than their name.
\v 5 For to which of the angels did he ever say,
\q "You are my Son;
\q today I have become your father"?
\p And again,
\q "I will be a Father to him,
\q and he will be a Son to me?"
</usfm>
