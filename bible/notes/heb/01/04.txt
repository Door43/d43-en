====== Hebrews 01:4-5 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 By doing that he \add showed that he\add* was very much greater than the angels, to the extent that his relationship \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add to God, as his Son\add*, is more excellent than the relationship the angels \add have to God\add*.
\v 5 \add We know that\add* because \add in the Scriptures\add* no one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* ever reported that God said to any angel \add what he said to his Son\add*,
\q You\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* are my Son!
\q Today I have declared to all that I am your Father \f + \ft doublet \f*!
\q And he said in another Scripture passage,
\q I will be his Father,
\q and he will be my Son \f + \ft doublet \f*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 God has made his Son to be so much more important than the angels, that he has far more honor and authority than they do.
\v 5 In the scriptures no one ever reported that God said to any angel what he said to his Son:
\q "You are my Son!
\q Today I have declared to all that I am your Father!"
\p And he said in another scripture passage,
\q "I will be his Father,
\q and he will be my Son."


\p

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 He has become just as superior to the angels, as the name he has inherited is more excellent than their name.
\v 5 For to which of the angels did God ever say,
\q "You are my son,
\q today I have become your father"?
\p And again,
\q "I will be a father to him,
\q and he will be a son to me"?
</usfm>

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The first prophetic quotation (You are my son) comes from the Psalms. The prophet Samuel wrote the second one (I will be a father to him). All occurrences of "he" refer to Jesus, the Son. The word "You" refers to Jesus, and the words "I" and "me" refer to God the Father.

  * **He has become** - "The Son has become"
  * **as the name he has inherited is more excellent than their name** - Here "name" refers to honor and authority. AT: "as the honor and authority he has inherited is superior to their honor and authority" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **he has inherited** - The author speaks of receiving honor and authority as if he were inheriting wealth and property from his father. AT: "he has received" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For to which of the angels did God ever say ... father"?** - The question emphasizes that, of course, God does not call any angel his Son. AT: "For God never said to any of the angels ... father.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **And again ... to me"?** - Again, the question emphasizes that, of course, God does not call any angel his Son. AT: "And, again, God did not say to any angel ... me.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
