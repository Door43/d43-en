    * **about the Son he says** - "about the son God says"
    * **scepter** - a special rod held by a king or queen to show authority
    * **anointed you with the oil of joy more** - "given you more joy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **oil of joy** - Possible meanings: 1) the perfumed oil people wore for celebrations (see UDB) or 2) the oil with which men were anointed when they became king, in which case the "joy" comes from the honor God gives.
