===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 1 Long ago God communicated frequently to our ancestors in various ways by what the prophets said and wrote. \v 2 But now when this final age is beginning, God has communicated to us by his own Son. God has chosen him to possess all things. By him God also created the universe. \v 3 God's Son is the light of God's powerful brilliance. He shows exactly what God is truly like. All things that exist—he keeps them existing by giving powerful commands. After he had achieved that all sin should be forgiven, he rose into heaven and sat down at the highest place of honor, at the right side of God the Father, where he rules with him.

After he had achieved cleansing for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high. </usfm>
