<usfm>
\v 13 God has never said to any angel what he said to his Son:
\q "Sit in the most important place next to me and rule with me 
\q while I defeat all of your enemies for you to rule over them!"
\p
\v 14 The angels are only spirits whom God has sent out to serve and care for believers whom God will soon save completely, as he has promised to do for them.

\p
\v 13 But to which of the angels has God said at any time,
\q "Sit at my right hand
\q until I make your enemies a stool for your feet"?
\p
\v 14 Are not all angels spirits sent out to worship me and to care for those who are about to inherit salvation?
