===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Blows that make a wound ... and beatings make** - These two phrases basically mean the same thing and are repeated for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **cleanse away evil ... make the innermost parts clean** - This speaks of a person becoming less evil as if the evil were dirt that was cleaned off of him. AT: "make a person less evil ... make a person better in his innermost parts" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
