===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **The purposes in a human heart are like deep water** - How difficult it is to guess the reasons for someone's actions is compared to how hard it is to see the bottem of a deep lake or river. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **will draw them out** - AT: "will cause the purposes to be known" or "will figure it out"
  * **loyal** - "faithful" or "trustworthy"
  * **but who can find one who is faithful?** - The implicit answer is "few can find someone like that" AT: "but few men can find a person who is faithful" or "but it is hard to find a person who really is faithful" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
