===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The purpose in a human heart is like deep water** - This speaks of how difficult it is to understand the reasons for a person's actions by comparing it to the difficulty of reaching the water in a deep well. AT: "It is as difficult to understand the purpose in the human heart as it is to reach the water in a deep well" or "The purpose of in the human heart is very difficult to understand" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **someone with understanding** - "a person who has understanding" 
  * **will draw it out** - This speaks of figuring out the purpose of the human heart as if it was water being drawn from a deep well. AT: "will cause the purpose to be known" or "will figure it out" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **loyal** - "faithful" or "trustworthy"
  * **but who can find one who is faithful?** - The implicit answer is "few can find someone like that." This rhetorical question can be written as a statement. AT: "but few men can find a person who is faithful!" or "but it is hard to find a person who really is faithful!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
