===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **a youth is known by his actions** - AT: "people know a young man by his actions" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) 
  * **his conduct** - "his deeds" AT: "what he does"
  * **pure and upright** - These two words basically mean the same thing and emphasize how good this young person is. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Ears that hear and eyes that see** - The same thought is repeated to emphasize that Yahweh made all our senses. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
