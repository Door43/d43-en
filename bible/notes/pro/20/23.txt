    * **A person's steps are directed by Yahweh** - AT: "Yahweh direct a person's steps" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
    * **how then can he understand his way?** - The implicit answer is that he cannot. AT: "therefore, a person cannot understand his way" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
