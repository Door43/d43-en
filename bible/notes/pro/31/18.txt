===== translationNotes: =====


  * **perceives** - sees by looking carefully
  * **all night long her lamp is not extinguished** - This is probably an exaggeration: she works late into the night, but not from dusk to dawn. AT: "She burns a lamp through the night as she works" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **spindle** - a thin rod or stick with pointed ends that is used in making thread
