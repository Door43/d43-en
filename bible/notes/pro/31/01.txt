===== translationNotes: =====

  * **King Lemuel** - This is the name of a king. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **oracle** - message from God. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:pro:30:01|30:1]].
  * **What, my son? And what, son of my womb? And what, son of my vows?** - Possible meanings of the rhetorical question "what" are 1) "what are you doing?" or "you should not be doing what you are doing"  or 2) "what shall I tell you?" or "listen to what I am telling you" or 3) "do not do the things I am about to warn you against."
  * **my son ... son of my womb ... son of my vows** - The speaker wants the hearer to notice carefully and to respect the one who is talking to him.
  * **son of my womb** - The womb is a synecdoche for the person. It is best to use a polite term for the body part in which babies grow before they are born.
  * **son of my vows** - The "vows" could be 1) the mother's marriage vows or 2) a vow after she married that if God allowed her to have a child she would dedicate him to God.
  * **Do not give your strength to women** - "Do not work hard trying to have sex with women," either outside of marriage or with concubines.
  * **or your ways to those who destroy kings** - "or allow those who destroy kings to advise you"
  * **your ways** - Possible meanings are 1) "the way you live your life" or 2) "the work you do"
  * **those who destroy kings** - probably the immoral "women" to whom he is not to give his strength
