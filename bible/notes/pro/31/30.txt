===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 30 Elegance can deceive 
\q2 and make you think more highly of a person than you should; 
\q2 and beauty has no lasting value. 
\q2 But a woman who honors Yahweh will be praised for the person she is.
\v 31 Give her what she has earned, 
\q2 and her works will praise her among the leaders of the town.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 30 Elegance is deceptive, beauty is vain,
\q but a woman who fears Yahweh, she will be praised.
\q
\v 31 Give her the fruit of her hands,
\q and let her works praise her in the gates.
</usfm>
