====== Proverbs 31:30-31 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 30 Some women who are attractive\f + \ft Or: charming \f* \add are not really good women\add*,
\q2 \add but\add* they can deceive us \add regarding what they are really like\add*.
\q1 Furthermore, women's beauty does not last;
\q2 but women who have an awesome respect\f + \ft Or: reverence \f* for Yahweh should be honored.
\q1
\v 31 Reward women who are like that,
\q2 and praise them in public \f + \ft metonymy \f* for what they have done.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 30 Elegance can deceive
\q2 and make you think more highly of a person than you should;
\q2 and beauty has no lasting value.
\q2 But a woman who honors Yahweh will be praised for the person she is.
\v 31 Give her what she has earned,
\q2 and her works will praise her among the leaders of the town.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 30 Elegance is deceptive, beauty is vain,
\q but a woman who fears Yahweh, she will be praised.
\q
\v 31 Give her the fruit of her hands
\q and let her works praise her in the gates.
</usfm>

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Elegance is deceptive** - The abstract noun "elegance" can be translated as an adjective. AT: "A gracious woman can deceive people" or "A woman with good manners could really be evil" See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:pro:11:15|11:16]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **beauty is vain** - The abstract noun "beauty" can be translated as an adjective. AT: "a woman who is beautiful now will not always be beautiful" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **she will be praised** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "people will praise her" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the fruit of her hands** - The money she has earned from the work she did with wool and flax ([[:en:bible:notes:pro:31:13|31:13]]) is spoken of as if it were fruit growing off a tree. The hands are a synecdoche for the person. AT: "the money she has earned" See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:pro:31:16|31:16]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **let her works praise her in the gates** - She will be praised for her works, not by her works. Those "in the gates" are the important people of the city who conduct business and legal affairs near the gates of the city. AT: "may the important people of the city praise her because of the works she has done" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
