===== translationWords: =====

  * [[:en:obe:other:honor]]
 

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **linen** - cloth made from flax yarn
  * **sashes** - long pieces of cloth worn around the waist or over one shoulder
  * **She is clothed with strength and honor** - This can be translated in active form. The abstract nouns "strength" and "honor" can be translated by an adjective and a verb, respectively. AT: "Everyone can see that she is strong, and so they honor her" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **laughs at the time to come** - This is probably an exaggeration to show that she is not afraid. AT: "is not afraid of what will happen in the future" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
