====== Proverbs 31:4-5 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 Lemuel, kings should not be constantly drinking wine
\q2 or greatly desire \add to drink other\add* strong\f + \ft Or: alcoholic \f* drinks.
\q1
\v 5 If they do that, they forget the laws \add that they have made\add*,
\q2 and they do no not do what is right for poor\f + \ft Or: afflicted \f* people.
\q1
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 Lemuel, kings should be careful about drinking wine;
\q2 and a king should never ask, "Where is the strong drink?"
\q1
\v 5 They could drink but then they might forget that they made a decree of the king,
\q2 and tear down the rights of those who have been taken advantage of.

\q1
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 4 It is not for kings, Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine,
\q or for rulers to crave strong drink,
\q
\v 5 because when they drink they forget what has been decreed,
\q and pervert the rights of all the afflicted.
</usfm>
