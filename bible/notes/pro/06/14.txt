    * **He plots evil** - "He plans evil" AT: "He prepares to do evil deeds"
    * **he always stirs up discord** - "he always causes discord" AT: "he is constantly looking for conflict and escalating it"
    * **Therefore** - "For that reason"
    * **his disaster** - That is the disaster that will happen to him, but also the disaster that he himself caused.
    * **overtake** - That implies that the disaster is chasing him like a person or an animal, and that it will catch him soon. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
    * **in an instant, in a moment** - Both mean the same thing, and one or both of them can be replaced by "suddenly" or "very quickly".
