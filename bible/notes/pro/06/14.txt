  * **Therefore** - "For that reason"
  * **his disaster** - That is the disaster that will happen to him, but also the disaster that he himself caused.
  * **overtake** - That implies that the disaster is chasing him like a person or an animal, and that it will catch him soon. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **in an instant; in a moment** - Both mean the same thing, and one or both of them can be replaced by "suddenly" or "very quickly".
