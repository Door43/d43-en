\v 1 My son, if someone has borrowed money from a friend or a stranger,
\q2 and if you have promised that you will pay the money back if that person is unable to pay back the money he borrowed,
\q1
\v 2 you may be trapped by what you have agreed to do,
\q2 \add because if the one who borrowed the money is not able to pay it back, you will have to pay it\add*.
\q2 What you have said that you will do will be like a snare to you.

\v 2 you laid a trap for yourself by making the promise, 
\q2 and you have been caught by agreeing to a contract for someone you did not know.
