===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **How long will you sleep ... When will you rise from your sleep?** - The teacher uses these questions to scold the lazy person for sleeping too much. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **A little more sleep ... of the hands to rest** - These are the kinds of things that lazy people say. 
    * **A little more sleep, a little more slumber** - AT: "I'll just sleep a little more. Let me sleep lightly a little" 
    * **folding of the hands to rest** - AT:  "I'll just cross my arms comfortably and rest a little" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
    * **and your poverty will come** - The fact that this is a result of being lazy can be made clear. AT: "If you continue to be lazy, your poverty will come" or "While you sleep, poverty will come" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
    * **your poverty will come to you like a robber** - The sudden way a lazy person becomes poor is like the sudden way a robber comes and steals things. AT: "you will suddenly become poor, just as if a robber came and stole everything you have" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
