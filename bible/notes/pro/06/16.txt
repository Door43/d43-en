  * [[:En:obe:kt:yahweh]] 

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **six things that Yahweh hates, seven that**  - "six things that Yahwah hates; seven things that" This whole verse is a parallelism that emphasizes that God hates several things and not just one. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]])
  * **that are disgusting to him**  - AT: "that make him feel disgust" or "that make you disgusting according to him"
