===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **A worthless person—a wicked man**  - These two words have the same meaning and emphasize how bad this person is. AT: "A person with no value–an evil man"
  * **lives by the crookedness of his speech**  - AT: "constantly tells lies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
  * **winking his eyes**  - If someone winks, he closes one eye very briefly as a secret signal to another person. This might be a sign of trust, of approval, or of something else. AT: "trying to gain your trust by a certain way of looking"
  * **winking his eyes, making signals with his feet, and pointing with his fingers**  - All three of these phrases describe a way in which the evil person communicates secretly to deceive other people.
