====== Proverbs 06 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Chapter 6 continues a collection of proverbs that ends in chapter nine. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== My Son ==

Occasionally, the author addresses a proverb to "my son." This is not intended to restrict the words of that proverb to only males. Instead, it is simply a form used to pass on advice as a father does to his son. 

== Adulteress ==

The latter part of this chapter comes back to the theme about the adulteress and warns the young man to avoid her. An adulteress is a woman who commits adultery. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:adultery]])

== Numbers ==

Occasionally, the author will mention a list of six things, or seven things, that Yahweh hates. These numbers are used to draw attention to the list of things. It is not important whether there are six or seven things in the list. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical questions ==

The author will use rhetorical questions to draw the reader's attention to important points. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Animals used as types ==

The gazelle and the ant have certain characteristics which the author uses to give wisdom. If your language does not recognize these characteristics in those animals, you could add a footnote to explain or possibly substitute another animal from your culture that would help explain the same concept. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:wise]])
