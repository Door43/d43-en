===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 You must learn not to be offended by the one you love,
\q2 but if you bring up something to your friend that hurt you, and you do it over and over,
\q2 that will pull the best of friends apart.
\b
\q1
\v 10 A rebuke to someone with understanding goes deeper into him
\q2 than trying to teach a fool by hitting him a hundred times with a stick.
