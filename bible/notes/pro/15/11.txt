  * **how much more the hearts of the descendants of mankind** - This is a rhetorical question, to which the implicit answer is "he certainly knows that too". AT: "so he certainly knows the thoughts and motives of people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **resents** - AT: "dislikes" or "feels insulted by"
  * **he will not go to the wise** - AT: "he will not go to the wise to become wise" or "he will refuse to learn anything from the wise" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
