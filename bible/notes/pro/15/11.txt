===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Sheol and destruction are open before Yahweh** - The word "destruction" refers to the place of destruction and means basically the same thing as "Sheol." AT: "Yahweh knows everything about the places where dead people are" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **how much more the hearts of the descendants of mankind**  - This is a rhetorical question, to which the implicit answer is "he certainly knows that too". AT: "so he certainly knows the thoughts and motives of people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **resents**  - AT: "dislikes" or "feels insulted by"
  * **he will not go to the wise**  - AT: "he will not go to the wise to become wise" or "he will refuse to learn anything from the wise" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Explicit and Implicit]])
