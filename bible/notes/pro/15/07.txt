===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The lips of wise people scatter knowledge about** - The word "lips" represents what wise people say. The writer speaks of knowledge as if it were seeds that wise people scatter around when they speak. AT: "The speech of wise people spread knowledge" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **not so the hearts of fools** - Possible meanings are 1) the word "hearts" is synecdoche for the fools themselves and means that they do not scatter knowledge like wise people do. AT: "but fools do not scatter knowledge about" or 2) fools do not have knowledge in their hearts, with "hearts" being a metonym for the thoughts. AT: "but fools do not understand knowledge" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **upright people** - "people who live rightly."
  * **is his delight** - "pleases him"
