===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The heart of the righteous person ponders before it answers** - Here the word "heart" a metonym for the mind and thoughts. This represents the person who thinks. AT: "The person who does right ponders what to say before he answers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **the mouth of wicked people pours out all its evil** - The writer speaks of wicked people's mouths as if they were containers and of evil as if it were the liquid that filled them. When wicked people speak, their mouths pour out the liquid. The word "mouths" represents those who speak. AT: "wicked people are always saying evil things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
