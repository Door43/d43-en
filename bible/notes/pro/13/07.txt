===== translationWords: =====


  * [[:en:obe:kt:amen]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:ransom]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:life]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:possess]] 

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **who enriches himself** - "who makes himself rich"
  * **will not listen to rebuke** - The words here are the same as in [[:en:bible:notes:pro:13:01|13:1]], but here possible meanings of these words are 1) no one will steal from him because he has nothing anyone would want to steal, "will not hear a threat" (see UDB), or 2) he will not listen when people correct him because he has nothing to lose if they punish him.
