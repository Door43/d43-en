    * **the lamp of the wicked will be put out** - The lamp of the wicked stands for the wicked person himself. The lamp being put out means that something bad will happen to him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **Pride only breeds conflict**  - "Pride always causes conflict"
    * **listen to** - AT: "heed" or "follow"
