<usfm> \v 9 When a drunk man picks up a bush full of thorns \q2 and starts to swing it around at people, \q2 that is as helpful as a fool reciting proverbs, \q2 people stand back and try to get away from him. \q1 \v 10 An archer who aims and shoots arrows at people standing around him, \q2 is as dangerous as one who hires a fool \q2 or he takes so little care that he hires the next person who comes along.

\q1 </usfm>
