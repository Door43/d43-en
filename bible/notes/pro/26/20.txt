\b
\q1

</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 The fire goes out when there is no more wood to burn; 
\q2 and so arguments stop when no one is gossipping.

\q1
\v 21 As charcoal can ignite into burning coal and a log of wood into a fire;
\q2 so the one who argues sets anger ablaze. 


\q1

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 20 For lack of wood, the fire goes out. 
\q and where there is no gossiper, quarreling ceases. 
\q
\v 21 As charcoal is to burning coals and wood is to fire, 
\q so is a quarrelsome person for kindling strife.
