\q2 but just like the madman's arrows,
\q2 what he said has set everything on fire.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * ****Like a madman ... is the one who deceives ... telling a joke?"** - Both the madman and the deceiver hurt people but do not take responsibility for it.
  * **Was I not telling a joke?** - The deceiver uses this question to imply that since he his joke was only for fun, he should not be blamed for any harm he has caused. AT: "I was only telling a joke" or "Do not blame me. I was only telling a joke" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
