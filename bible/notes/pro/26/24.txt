====== Proverbs 26:24-26 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 24 Those who hate someone and are saying \f + \ft metonymy \f* something very different from what they are thinking are hypocrites;
\q2 in their inner beings they are planning \add to harm that person\add*.
\q1
\v 25 When they say nice things, do not believe them,
\q2 because in their inner beings are many things that \add Yahweh\add* hates.
\q1
\v 26 They try to deceive people to cause them to think that they do not hate that person,
\q2 but in a public meeting, the people will find out the evil things \add that they have done\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 24 The one who is filled with hate, by the words he speaks, he hides his true feelings;
\q2 and he stores up more and more lies within himself.
\q1
\v 25 He may speak kind words, but you should not believe them,
\q2 because deep within him is everything that Yahweh despises.
\q1
\v 26 Even though he covers up his hatred by his lies, 
\q2 everyone will realize how wicked he is.


\q1

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 24 One who hates others disguises his feelings with his lips,
\q and he lays up deceit within himself.
\q
\v 25 He will speak graciously, but do not believe him,
\q for there are seven abominations in his heart.
\q
\v 26 Though his hatred is covered with deception, 
\q his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.
</usfm>
