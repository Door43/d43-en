===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 The lazy person has many reasons for not working—
\q2 you might hear him say, "But there is a lion in the street!"
\q2 or "Oh, there is a lion in the market!"
\q1
\v 14 When you see a door swing back and forth on it hinges,
\q2 that is just like one who is lazy, when he is lying on his bed, turning back and forth.

\q1
