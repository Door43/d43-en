<usfm>
\v 13 The lazy person has many reasons for not working— 
\q2 you might hear him say, "But there is a lion in the street!" 
\q2 or "Oh, there is a lion in the market!"
\q1
\v 14 When you see a door swing back and forth on it hinges, 
\q2 that is just like one who is lazy, when he is lying on his bed, turning back and forth.

  * **hinges** - metal pieces that attach a door to something and allows it to open and close
  * **As the door turns on its hinges, so is the lazy person upon his bed** - The lazy person turning back and forth on his bed is compared to a door turning on its hinges. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
