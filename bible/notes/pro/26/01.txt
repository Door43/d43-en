====== Proverbs 26:1-2 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Just like \f + \ft simile \f* it is not appropriate for snow to fall in summer time, or rain to fall at harvest time,
\q2 it is not appropriate to praise\f + \ft Or: honor \f* foolish people.
\b
\q1
\v 2 Like \f + \ft simile \f* birds that fly by and do not alight\f + \ft Or: land \f* on anything,
\q2 if someone curses you, it cannot hurt you if you do not deserve them\f + \ft Or: have not done to him what is wrong \f*.
\b
\q1
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 When it snows in the summer, or when it rains in the harvest, 
\q2 that is what is it like when a fool gets honor—
\q2 honor for him comes at the wrong time, and the wrong place. 
\q1
\v 2 A sparrow flies here and there flittering around, and a swallow darts back and forth when it flies, 
\q2 that is like someone speaking a curse against you—but it cannot land on you.


\q1
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\c 26
\q
\v 1 Like snow in summer or rain in harvest,
\q so a fool does not deserve honor.
\q
\v 2 As the sparrow flitters and the swallow darts when they fly,
\q so an undeserved curse does not alight.
</usfm>
