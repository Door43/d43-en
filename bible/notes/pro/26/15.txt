===== translationNotes: =====

  * **puts his hand into the dish** - "puts his hand into the dish to get food" or "reaches for food"
  * **he has no strength to lift it up to his mouth** - This is an exaggeration for doing necessary work that would clearly do him good. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **The lazy person is wiser in his own eyes than seven men with discernment** - The phrase "his own eyes" represents his thoughts. AT: "The lazy person thinks he is wiser than seven men who can respond sensibly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
