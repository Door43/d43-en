===== translationNotes: =====

  * **A man of violence lies to his neighbor** - It is implied that this man lies to his neighbor in order to get his neighbor to join him in violent actions. AT: "A man of violence entices his neighbor" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **A man of violence** - "A violent man" or "A man who practices violence"
  * **leads him down a path that is not good** - The writer speaks of a person's actions as if they were a road on which the person walks. AT: "gets him to do things that are not good" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a path that is not good** - The writer uses an understatement to emphasize how bad this path is. AT: "a very bad path" or "a terrible path" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **The one who winks the eye ... those who purse the lips** - Both of these are facial gestures which people might use to signal their plans to others. See how you translated "winks the eye" in [[:en:bible:notes:pro:10:10|10:10]].
  * **will bring evil to pass** - "will do evil things"
