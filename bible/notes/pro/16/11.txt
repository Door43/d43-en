===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Honest scales come from Yahweh**  - Yahweh requires justice and fairness when doing business. Dishonest people used heavier or lighter weights in their scales in order to gain more when buying or selling. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **a throne**  - the government of a king or the decisions made by a king from the throne (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
