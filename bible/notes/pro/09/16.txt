\q1

\q2 and food that you eat by yourself tastes the best,
\q1 \add if you have sex secretly with someone to whom you are not married, you will enjoy it very much\add*."
\q1
\v 18 But men who go to those women's houses do not know that those who have gone there are now dead;
\q2 they have descended down into the deepest parts of the place where dead people are.
