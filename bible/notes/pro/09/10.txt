===== translationNotes: =====


  * **The fear of Yahweh** - See how you translated this phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:pro:01:07|1:7]].
  * **through me your days will be multiplied** - "I will multiply your days" or "I will cause you to live many more days" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **through me** - "through wisdom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **your days will be multiplied, and years added to your life** - These two phrases basically mean the same thing and are used to emphasize the great benefits wisdom has. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **years added to your life** - Wisdom speaks of years of life as if they were physical objects. This can be stated in active form. AT: "I will add years to your life" or "I will enable you to live longer" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **If you are wise ... but if you mock** - These two statements are presented as opposite situations. People are either wise, or are mockers.
