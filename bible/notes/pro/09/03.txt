===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **She has sent out**  - The word "she" refers to Wisdom, which is compared to a woman from [[:en:bible:notes:pro:09:01|9:1]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification|Personification]])
  * **invitations**  - These invitations were either verbal messages that the maids were supposed to recite, or they were written letters addressed to the people wisdom wanted to invite.
  * **her maids**  - Young women or girls, in the service of a respectable, adult woman, like wisdom.
  * **she calls out**  - "she proclaims" or "she summons" AT: "she loudly recites her invitation"
  * **those who are unaught … those who do not have good judgment**  - These two phrases describe the same group of people, namely people who need more wisdom in their lives.
  * **who are not taught**  - This does not mean people who did not go to school, but people who do not yet know how to live. "who are young and naïve"
  * **come in here**  - AT: "come into my house" or "are welcome in my house"
  * **do not have good judgement**  - AT: "lacks wisdom" or "do not have common sense" (UDB)
