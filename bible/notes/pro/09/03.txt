  * **She has sent out** - The word "she" refers to Wisdom, which is compared to a woman from [[:en:bible:notes:pro:09:01|9:1]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **invitations** - These invitations were either verbal messages that the maids were supposed to recite, or they were written letters addressed to the people wisdom wanted to invite.
  * **her maids** - Young women or girls, in the service of a respectable, adult woman, like wisdom.
  * **she calls out** - "she proclaims" or "she summons" AT: "she loudly recites her invitation"
  * **those who are untaught ... those who have no sense** - These two phrases describe the same group of people, namely people who need more wisdom in their lives.
  * **who are untaught** - This does not mean people who did not go to school, but people who do not yet know how to live. "who are young and naïve"
