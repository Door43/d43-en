\q2 and if he rebukes you, do not resent it.
\q1
\v 12 \add I say that\add* because it is the people whom Yahweh loves that he corrects\f + \ft Or: reproves \f*,
\q2 just like parents correct\f + \ft Or: reprove \f* their sons whom they love.
\b
\q1
\v 13 \add Yahweh\add* is pleased with those who get wisdom and good understanding.

\q1 and with wisdom they also get understanding.

<usfm>
\q
\v 11 My child, do not despise Yahweh's discipline
\q and do not hate his rebuke,
\q
\v 12 for Yahweh disciplines those he loves,
\q as a father deals with a child who pleases him. 
\q
\v 13 The one who finds wisdom is happy,
\q he also gets understanding.
\q
\v 14 What you gain from wisdom is better than what silver will give in return
\q and its profit is better than gold.
