====== Proverbs 30:32-33 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 32 If you have acted foolishly, exalting yourself,
\q2 or if you been planning to do something evil,
\q1 stop it immediately [IDI]!
\q1
\v 33 If you churn milk, it produces butter\f + \ft Or: curds \f*,
\q2 and if you hit \add someone hard on his\add* nose, \add his nose\add* bleeds;
\q2 similarly, if you do something to cause people to become angry, strife always results.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 32 If you have acted foolishly, exalting yourself,
\q2 or if you been planning to do something evil,
\q1 put your hand over your mouth! Stop it!
\q1
\v 33 Just as when you churn milk, and it produces butter,
\q2 even so, if you hit someone hard on his nose, the result is that his nose will bleed;
\q2 and, in the same way, when people are angry, they will argue and fight.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 32 If you have been foolish, exalting yourself,
\q or if you have been devising evil—
\q put your hand over your mouth.
\q
\v 33 As churning milk makes butter
\q and as one's nose will produce blood if it is twisted,
\q so deeds done in anger produce conflict.
</usfm>
