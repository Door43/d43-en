===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 There are leeches that suck blood, imagine they had two daughters;
\q2 they say, "Give to us! Give to us!
\q1 There are four things that are never satisfied—
\q2 they always want more :
\q1
\v 16 The grave, the place of the dead;
\q1 the womb of a woman that never conceived a child;
\q1 soil that badly needs to be watered;
\q1 and a fire that burns hot and it never says, "The fire is hot enough!"
\b
\q1
\v 17 The one who dishonors his father,
\q2 and who disrespects and disobeys his mother.
\q1 such a person would be killed and have his eyes pecked out by crows,
\q2 and would be devoured by the vultures.


\q1

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 15 The leech has two daughters: "Give and give" they cry.
\q There are three things that are never satisfied,
\q four that never say, "Enough":
\q
\v 16 Sheol; the barren womb;
\q land that is never satisfied with water;
\q and the fire that never says, "Enough!"
\q
\v 17 The eye that mocks a father
\q and scorns obedience to a mother,
\q his eyes will be pecked out by the ravens of the valley,
\q and he will be eaten by the vultures.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The leech has two daughters** - This is an example of something that always wants more. AT: "Greed has two daughters" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **leech** - a type of worm that attaches itself to the skin and sucks blood
  * **"Give and give" they cry** - Another possible meaning is "and they are both named Give Me." 
  * **There are three things that are never satisfied, four that never say, "Enough"** - This use of the numbers "three" and "four" together here is likely a poetic device. AT: "There are four things that are never satisfied, who never say, 'Enough'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]])
  * **are never satisfied** - This can be stated positively. AT: "always want more" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **land that is never satisfied with water** - Land that is no longer producing food because there has been no rain is spoken of as if it were a person who does not have enough water to drink. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **scorns obedience to a mother** - The word "obedience"—an abstract noun that can be translated as a verb—is a metonym for the mother herself. AT: "considers his mother worthless and will not obey her" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **his eyes ... the vultures** - The writer says that the person will die by giving two pictures of what happens to people who die away from where people live.
  * **his eyes will be pecked out by the ravens of the valley** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "the ravens of the valley will peck out his eyes"(See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **ravens** - large, shiny, black birds that eat plants and dead animals
  * **he will be eaten by the vultures** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "the vultures will eat him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
