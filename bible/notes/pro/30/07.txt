====== Proverbs 30:7-9 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 God, I ask you to do two things for me;
\q2 please do them before I die:
\q1
\v 8 Prevent me from lying or deceiving people
\q2 and do not cause me to become poor or to become rich.
\q2 Just give me the food that I need;
\q1
\v 9 because if I become rich,
\q2 I might say that I do not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* know you and that I do not need you;
\q1 and if I become poor,
\q2 I might dishonor you by stealing things.

\b
\q1

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 I ask Yahweh for two things, 
\q2 and that he give them to me before I die. 
\q1
\v 8 Put vain pride and lies far away from me;
\q2 and let me neither have poverty or riches, 
\q2 just give me the food I need every day.
\v 9 For if I have too much money, 
\q2 I will deny my God, and say, "Who is Yahweh?"
\q2 Or I become so poor that I steal from others, 
\q2 and bring disgrace on the name of my God.


\q1
