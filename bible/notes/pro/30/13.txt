  * **eyes are raised up ... their eyelids lifted up** - These two metonyms refer to people who think that they are better than other people. Their eyes show that they are proud, and the way they look at others shows that they think they are better than those other people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **jawbones** - the bones of the face where teeth grow
