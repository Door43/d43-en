===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **There are three things that are ... four which are stately in their gait:** - The use of the numbers 'three' and 'four' here is likely a poetic device. AT: "There are some things that walk stately. Four of these are:" 
    * **stately** - "majestic" or "dignified"
    * **strutting rooster**  -  an adult male chicken that walks proudly
