===== translationNotes: =====

  * **There are three things that are ... four that are stately in how they walk** - The use of the numbers "three" and "four" here is likely a poetic device. AT: "There are some things that walk stately. Four of these are:" 
  * **stately** - majestic or dignified
  * **strutting rooster** - an adult male chicken that walks proudly
