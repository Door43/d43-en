<usfm>
\q
\v 18 There are three things that are too wonderful for me,
\q four that I do not understand:
\q
\v 19 the way of an eagle in the sky;
\q the way of a snake on a rock;
\q the way of a ship in the heart of the sea;
\q and the way of a man with a young woman.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **There are three things that are ... four that I do not understand:** -  The use of the numbers 'three' and 'four' here is likely a poetic device. AT: "There are some things that are too wonderful for me that I do not understand--four of them are:"
    * **in the heart of the sea** - The "heart" refers to the middle. AT: "in the middle of the sea" or "on the open sea" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
