====== Proverbs 30 General Notes ======

=== Structure and formatting ===

Chapter 30 is a chapter in Proverbs attributed to Agur, who is a person otherwise unknown. 


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===
== Agur ==

His full title is Agur, Son of Jakeh. Agur comes from a Hebrew word that means "gatherer" and so some scholars believe this is not a real name, but possibly a way of referring to Solomon as a gatherer of proverbs. However, it is still prudent to simply use this as a name. 

== Three things and four ==

From verses 15 through 32, the author uses a specific technique to explain some things. He says there are three things and even four and lists items that exemplify a feature like "small and yet wise." The numbering is not meant to be so literal, but as a memory device that introduces the items. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:wise]])

== Themes ==
There are individual proverbs that run along common themes, often including contrasting elements: wise/foolish, money, lazy/diligent, truth telling, wicked/righteous, sluggard, pride/humility, integrity/crookedness. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:foolish]], [[:en:obe:kt:evil]] and [[:en:obe:kt:righteous]])
