===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Under three things the earth trembles, and the fourth it cannot endure:** - The use of the numbers 'three' and 'four' here is likely a poetic device. AT: "There are some things that make the earth tremble, that it cannot endure. Four of there are:" 
    * **a fool when he is filled with food**  - AT: "a fool when he fills himself with food" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
