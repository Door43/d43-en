===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Under three things the earth trembles and the fourth it cannot endure** - The use of the numbers "three" and "fourth" here is likely a poetic device. "There are some things that make the earth tremble, that it cannot endure. Four of these are" 
  * **a fool when he is filled with food** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "a fool who has had enough to eat" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **a hated woman when she marries** - That is, people rightly hated her before she married; once she marries, she will be worse than she was before she married. This can be translated in active form. AT: "a woman whom good people have hated when she marries" or "an outcast woman when she marries" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **takes the place of her mistress** - rules the household
