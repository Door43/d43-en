===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 If you help relatives, they will \add protect you\add* like \f + \ft simile \f* a strong wall \add protects a city\add*,
\q2 but if you quarrel with them, \add that will separate you from them\add* like bars on a city gate \add separate the city from those who want to enter it\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\b
\q1
\v 20 People are happy when they hear others say \f + \ft metonymy \f* something that is good,
\q2 like they are happy when they eat food that is good \f + \ft metaphor \f*.

</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 If you offend your brother, finding a way to have peace with him again
\q2 may be harder than waging a battle to win a city.
\q2 and having an argument is more difficult to overcome
\q2 than breaking down the bars of a castle.
\q1
\v 20 The words a person speaks can bring satisfaction to himself,
\q2 like the food he eats satisfies his stomach.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 19 An offended brother is harder to be won than a strong city,
\q and quarreling is like the bars of a castle.
\q
\v 20 From the fruit of his mouth one's stomach is filled;
\q with the harvest of his lips he is satisfied.
