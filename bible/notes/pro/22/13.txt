===== translationNotes: =====


  * **The lazy person says** - The quote that follows is a lie and an excuse for not working. If your language introduces false statements in a special way, you can use that here.
  * **The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit** - The word "mouth" is a metonym for the words that come out of the mouth. The writer speaks of a person being unable to escape having people punish him for evil deeds as if that person had fallen into a hole someone had dug in the ground from which he could not escape. AT: "The words spoken by an adulteress will draw you in, and it will be as if you have fallen into a deep and dangerous pit" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **an adulteress** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:pro:05:03|5:3]].
  * **Yahweh's anger is stirred up** - Here "stirred up" means that his anger increased. AT: "Yahweh is angry" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **falls into it** - Adultery is spoken of as if it is something that a person can fall into. AT: "sins because of the adulteress" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
