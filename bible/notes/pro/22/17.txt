===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Verse 17 begins the introduction to a new section of the Book of Proverbs.

  * **Incline your ear and listen** - Possible meanings are 1) "Pay attention so you can understand" or 2) this is a doublet that can be translated "Listen carefully to." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Incline your ear** - Here the word "ear" represents the person who is listening. The writer speaks of listening attentively to someone as if it were leaning forward so that the ear is closer to the one speaking. AT: "listen attentively" or  "lean forward and turn your head so you can hear well" Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:pro:04:20|4:20]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the words of the wise** - "what wise people say"
  * **apply your heart to** - "do your best to understand and remember" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **my knowledge** - "the knowledge I have, which I am sharing with you" or "what I know." The person speaking is probably the same as the father from [[:en:bible:notes:pro:01:07|1:8]]. He may be speaking of "the words of the wise" as "my knowledge." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **all of them are ready on your lips** - The person being ready to speak is spoken of as if it were the words that were ready. AT: "you are able to speak of them at any time" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **today—even to you** - "today. Yes, I am teaching you," The speaker is emphasizing that it is the hearer, not someone else whom he is teaching, and he is teaching the hearer because the hearer needs to learn. If it is awkward in your language to emphasize in this way, you can emphasize in another way or the words "even to you" can be left untranslated.
