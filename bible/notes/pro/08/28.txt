===== Translation Notes: =====

Wisdom continues to speak. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification|Personification]])

  * **established**  - brought into being on a stable basis
  * **the skies above**  - As the UDB shows, this could be translated as either "skies above" or "clouds above."
  * **when he made the fountains of the deep **- "when he made the water from the springs under the deep oceans to flow up strongly"
  * **when he made limits for the sea**  - "when he created the shorelines for the oceans"
  * **when he ordered where the foundations of the earth should be placed**  - The "foundations of the earth" and the "limits for the sea" divided the oceans from "the land." The Hebrew word for "earth" also often means "land."
