===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **And now**  - This is to focus the attention of the students to the conclusion of this lesson.
  * **my sons**  - AT: "my children" or "my students"
  * **listen to me**  - This is still wisdom talking about herself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification|Personification]])
  * **those who keep my ways**  - AT: "those who do what I teach" or "the people who follow my example"
  * **neglect**  - "disregard" AT: "pay no attention to" or "do not follow"
  * **The one who**  - "The person who" or "He who"
  * **watching every day at my gates; waiting for me beside the doors of my home**  - These two phrases basically mean the same thing. Wisdom is described as having a home; possible meanings of "watching" are 1) a wise person waits for wisdom to come home to learn more 2) a wise person is at wisdom's house to be close to her and learn all the time. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]])
