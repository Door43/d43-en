===== translationWords: =====

  * [[:en:obe:kt:wise]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:gate]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **And now** - This is to focus the attention of the children to the conclusion of this lesson.
  * **listen to me** - This is still wisdom talking about herself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **those who keep my ways** - AT: "those who do what I teach" or "the people who follow my example"
  * **do not neglect** - "do not disregard" AT: "be sure to pay attention to" or "be sure to follow" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **The one who** - "The person who" or "He who"
  * **watching every day at my doors, waiting beside the posts of my doors** - These two phrases basically mean the same thing. Wisdom is described as having a home; possible meanings of "watching" are 1) a wise person waits outside wisdom's home in the morning in order to serve her, or 2) a wise person waits outside wisdom's house for her to come and teach him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
