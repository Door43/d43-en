\q1
\v 34 soon you will become poor;
\q2 \add it will be as though\add* \f + \ft personification, simile \f* a bandit who had a weapon in his hand \add attacked you and stole all that you had\add*.

<usfm>
\v 32 When I saw that, I thought about it, and I learned this:
\q1
\v 33 A little sleep, a little nap, a little folding of the hands to rest—and while you rest,
\q1
\v 34 poverty will come to you like a thief who steals from you,
\q2 and poverty will come like an armed soldier who attacks you.

\q
\v 32 Then I saw and considered it; 
\q I looked and received instruction.
\q
\v 33 A little sleep, a little slumber,
\q a little folding of the hands to rest—
\q
\v 34 and poverty comes upon you like a robber,
\q and your needs will come to you like an armed soldier.
