===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 Rescue the ones who are being carried away to the slaughter;
\q2 they stagger and fall—hold them back from the one who would kill them.
\q1
\v 12 If you say, "I did not know that those people needed any help," then think about this:
\q2 God knows why we do everything, so he also knows why you said those people needed no help.
\q2 God sees everything you do in this life, so he certainly understands why you said that about those people.
\q2 He will certainly pay you back—and everyone else, too—for the harm they have done.


\q1

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 11 Rescue those who are being taken away to death,
\q and hold back those who are staggering to the slaughter.
\q
\v 12 If you say, "There! We knew nothing about this."
\q Does not the One who weighs the heart understand what you are saying?
\q And the One who guards your life, does he not know it?
\q And will God not give to each one what he deserves?
