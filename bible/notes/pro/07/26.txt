===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **brought down** - On the one hand it is an idiom for "ruined" (UDB) or "destroyed", but it also begins the metaphor of entering Sheol which is always described as down. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Her house** - AT: "She" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Her house is on the road to Sheol, it goes** - AT: "Her destination is Sheol, she goes"
  * **is on the road to Sheol, it goes down to the chambers of death** - These two phrases basically mean the same thing and are repeated to emphasize the deadly end of following the adulteress. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
