\q
\v 10 And there a woman met him, 
\q dressed like a prostitute, and she guarded in her heart. 
\q
\v 11 She is loud and rebellious,
\q her feet do not stay at home;
\q
\v 12 now in the streets, now in the market,
\q at every corner she lies in wait. 
\q
\v 13 So she takes hold of him and kisses him,
\q and with a bold face she says to him,
\q
\v 14 "I have offered my peace offerings  
\q I have paid my vows; 
\q
\v 15 so came I out  to meet you,
\q to eagerly seek your face, and I have found you.
