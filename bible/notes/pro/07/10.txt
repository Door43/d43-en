===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 That was where the woman who was seeking an affair, met the young man, and she greeted him.
\q2 She was dressed as prostitutes dress, with seductive and enticing clothes, and she knew why she was there. 
\q1
\v 11 She was loud and wayward, attracting attention, 
\q2 she does not stay in her own home—
\q1
\v 12 she searches for a man as she walks along the streets one day; other day she stands to find a man in the market;
\q2 at every street corner she waits to trap a man.


\q1
\v 13 When she sees the  young man, she takes hold of him, and then she kisses him.
\q2 and without any shame and with great boldness, she says, 
\q1
\v 14 "Today I have made my offering to Yahweh, the offering of peace in the temple, 
\q2 I given my offering and kept my vows to God, 
\q1
\v 15 and now I have come out here to meet you,
\q2 I was searching for you and now I have found you!
