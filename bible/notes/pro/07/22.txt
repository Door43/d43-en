===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He went after her suddenly** - This seems to imply that the young man took very little time to think about what he should do. AT: "He quickly decided to go after her" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **like an ox going ... into a snare** - The naive and unsuspecting way the young man follows the adulteress is compared to the way three animals are unaware of the danger they are in. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **slaughter** - This refers to killing an animal in order to eat its meat.
  * **deer** - See how you translated this word in [[:en:bible:notes:pro:05:18|5:19]].
  * **until an arrow pierces through its liver** - This passage implies that a hunter has trapped the deer in order to shoot it with arrows. AT: "until a hunter shoots it in its most important part" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **liver** - Here this organ represents a very important part of the deer's body.
  * **it would cost his life** - This is a way of saying that this person will die as a result. AT: "it would kill him" or "he would die soon" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
