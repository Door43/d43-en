\q2
\v 23 where it will remain\f + \ft Or: stay \f* until someone shoots an arrow into its liver \add and kills it\add*.

<usfm>
\v 22 He follows her inside—
\q2 like an ox going to the place where its owner will slaughter it,
\q2 or like a deer
\q2
\v 23 caught in a trap, where the hunter kills it by shooting an arrow into its inner parts.
\q1 He is like a bird that flies into a trap
\q2 without knowing that it will die as a result.

\q or like bird rushing into a snare,
\q not knowing it will cost him his life.

===== Translation Notes: =====

   * **like an ox going ... into a snare** - The naive and unsuspecting way the young man follows the adulteress is compared to the way three animals are unaware of the danger they are in. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
   * **deer** - See how you translated this animal in [[:en:bible:notes:pro:05:18|5:19]].
   * **it will cost him his life** - AT: "it will kill him" or "that he will die soon" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
