===== translationNotes: =====

  * **flatters his neighbor** - knowingly tells his neighbor things that are not true so that the neighbor will do what the speaker wants him to do
  * **spreading a net for his feet** - spreading a net that will catch the neighbor's feet so that the neighbor cannot escape
  * **In the sin of an evil person is a trap** - When an evil person sins, it is as if he is stepping into a trap. He desires to do evil to other people, but God will use what he does to punish him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
