===== Translation Notes: =====
Both verse 17 and verse 18 are a parallelism. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **becomes ransom for ... is ransom for** - To be or become the ransom for someone else means that you have to pay their financial debt or their moral penalty. AT: "will pay the debt of ... pays the debt of" or "will be punished instead of ... is punished instead of"
  * **the treacherous** - someone who cannot be trusted
  * **the upright** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:pro:03:31|3:32]].
