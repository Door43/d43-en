===== translationNotes: =====

  * **a corner of the roof** - Houses in those days had flat roofs. Ancient Israelites spent much time on their roofs, where it was often cooler than inside the house, and sometimes people would build a shelter large enough for a person to sleep in on one corner of the roof. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **quarrelsome** - a person who often argues or complains
  * **The appetite of the wicked craves evil** - The writer speaks of a person's appetite, the physical desire for food and drink, as if it were a person who could desire something. The phrase "the evil" is a nominal adjective that refers to evil people; the other instance of "evil" is a metonym for evil deeds. AT: "Evil people desire to do evil deeds just as they desire to eat and drink" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **craves** - "strongly desires"
  * **no kindness in his eyes** - The abstract noun "kindness" can be translated as an adjective. The litotes "no kindness" can be translated positively. The phrase "his eyes" is a metonym for the person. AT: "that he is not kind" or "that he is very mean" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
