===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **by a lying tongue **- by making false speech, "tongue" belongs to the evil speaker. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]; [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **a fleeting vapor that seeks death **- such gain is like a mist that quickly goes away, so those who gain quick riches are likewise seeking death. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
