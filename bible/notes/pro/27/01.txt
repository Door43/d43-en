(See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **your own mouth ... your own lips** - These two phrases refer to the "mouth" and "lips" as speaking because that is the part of the body you speak with. AT: See UDB. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
