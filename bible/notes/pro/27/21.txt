\b
\q1
\v 22 Even if you beat\f + \ft Or: crush \f* a fool severely like \f + \ft metaphor \f* you pulverize grain with a pestle,

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 21 Silver is refined in a crucible, and gold is put into a furnace to be made pure;
\q2 and how a person responds to the praise given to them
\q2 will tell you what kind of person he is.
\q1
\v 22 Though you grind a fool as if you were grinding up grain,
\q2 you will not be able to take his foolishness out of him.


\q1

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **A crucible is for silver and a furnace is for gold** - This refers to how gold and silver are refined. A metal is refined by heating it to a high temperature so that it melts and the impurities may be removed. See how you translated the very similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:pro:17:03|17:3]]. AT: "A crucible is used to refine silver and a furnace is used to refine gold" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **crucible** - a container used for heating substances to very high temperatures (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **furnace** - an oven that can be made extremely hot (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **a person is tested when he is praised** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "when one praises a person, they are also testing that person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Even if you crush a fool ... yet his foolishness will not leave him** - This means that even if a fool is made to suffer hardship or pain (being crushed is often a metaphor for suffering in Hebrew), he will remain foolish. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **pestle** - a hard tool with a rounded end, used for crushing things in a bowl (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
