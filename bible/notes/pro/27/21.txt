===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 21 Silver is refined in a crucible, and gold is put into a furnace to be made pure;
\q2 and how a person responds to the praise given to them 
\q2 will tell you what kind of person he is. 
\q1
\v 22 Though you grind a fool as if you were grinding up grain,
\q2 you will not be able to take his foolishness out of him.
