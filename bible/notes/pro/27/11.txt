<usfm>

\q2 in order that I will know how to reply to those who would criticize me \add about your behavior\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 12 Those who have good sense will realize that there is something dangerous ahead, and they will hide;
\q2 those who do not have good sense just keep going, and later they will suffer because of doing that.

\q2 but those who have no experience or knowledge rush ahead into danger.
