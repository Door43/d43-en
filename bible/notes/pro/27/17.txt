===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Iron sharpens iron; in the same way, a man sharpens his friend.** - These two phrases are comparing how iron and a man can be improved. AT: "As iron becomes better when it is sharpened by another piece of iron, so a man becomes better when he is made better by his friend" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
