===== translationNotes: =====

  * **A person who has eaten to the full** - "A person who is satisfied" or "A person who has eaten enough to be full"
  * **rejects even a honeycomb** - A honeycomb would normally be desirable, but not to the person who has already eaten enough to be satisfied.
  * **every bitter thing is sweet** - "everything that is bitter tastes sweet"
  * **Like a bird that wanders from its nest is a man who strays from where he lives** - The words "wanders" and "strays" mean the same thing in this verse. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
