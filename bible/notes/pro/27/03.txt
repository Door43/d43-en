\b
\q1
\v 4 It is cruel to be angry with others, and our being angry sometimes destroys others,
\q2 but being jealous of someone is \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* often more cruel than that.

\q1
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 If you think about how heavy a stone can be, or how much sand can weigh—
\q2 then you will understand that the trouble a fool causes is harder to carry than both of those things.
\q1
\v 4 If you think about how cruel can be people who rage at others, and how angry people can attack others like a flood of water,
\q2 then think about how jealous people are even worse;
\q2 no one can resist being harmed by a jealous person.

\q1
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 3 Consider the heaviness of a stone and the weight of sand—
\q the provocation of a fool is heavier than both.
\q
\v 4 There is the cruelty of rage and the flood of anger,
\q but who is able to stand before jealousy?
</usfm>
