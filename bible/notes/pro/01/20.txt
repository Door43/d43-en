===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Wisdom cries aloud** - If your language does not allow you to treat wisdom as a woman shouting to the people in the city, you might try something like "Grandmother Wisdom" or "Honored Miss Wisdom" or "wisdom is like a woman" (see UDB). (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **raises her voice** - "speaks with a loud voice"
  * **head of the noisy streets** - "place where busy streets meet"
  * **How long...will you...?** - AT: "You have...too long!" or "You should no longer...!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
