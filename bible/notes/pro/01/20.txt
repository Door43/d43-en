===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Wisdom cries aloud** - If your language does not allow you to treat wisdom as a woman shouting to the people in the city, you might try something like "Grandmother Wisdom" or "Honored Miss Wisdom" or "wisdom is like a woman." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **raises her voice** - Here "wisdom" is personified as a woman. AT: "speaks with a loud voice" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]]) 
  * **head of the noisy streets** - "place where busy streets meet"
  * **How long ... will you ... understand?** - This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "You have been without wisdom long enough!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
