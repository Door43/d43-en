<usfm>
\q
\v 28 Then they will call upon me, and I will not answer;
\q they will desperately call for me, but they will not find me.

\q and did not choose the fear of Yahweh,

===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **Then they will call upon me** - "Then the sinners will cry out to me, wisdom, for help" 
  * **call upon me** - This means to ask God for help.
  * **desperately** - with much worry and little hope
  * **Because they hate knowledge...they despised all my reproof** - Possible meanings: 1) This is why they will "eat the fruit of their ways" ([[:en:bible:notes:pro:01:31|1:31]]) (see UDB) or 2) this is why wisdom "will not answer" (1:28) or 3) 1:29 gives the reason for 1:30.
  * **despised** - Translate as you did in [[en/bible/notes/pro/01/07|1:7]]
