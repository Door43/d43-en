<usfm>
\v 18 But these wicked people are not like the birds
\q1 \add because they do not realize that\add*
\q2 when they prepare to ambush someone to kill him,
\q1 they will be killed themselves!
\q1
\v 19 That is what happens to people who eagerly try to get things \add by violently attacking others\add*.
\q2 They will only destroy themselves!

\q2 the things they stole destroy the lives of the thieves who cling to them.
