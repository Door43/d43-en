===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 We will kill them \f + \ft hyperbole \f* and get rid of them completely,
\q2 just like \add people who are buried in\add* graves are gone forever.
\q1 While they are in good health, we will send them to the place where dead people are.
\q1
\v 13 And we will seize all the things that they own.
\q2 We will fill our houses with these things!
\q1
\v 14 So, come with us!
\q1 Join our group!
\q2 We will share with you the things that we steal."

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 Like the grave has power to take even a healthy person and drag them to the place of the dead, we will take their life from them.
\q2 We will make them like those who fall into the place where there is no hope of escape.
\q1
\v 13 We will find many valuable and expensive items,
\q2 and we will fill our houses with what we stole from them!
\q1
\v 14 So, come, be part of our team!
\q2 We will split into equal shares, and give to each member of our team, from all the things we stole."

\q
\v 12 Let us swallow them up alive, like Sheol takes away those who are healthy
\q and make them like those who fall into the pit.
\q
\v 13 We shall find all kinds of valuable things;
\q we will fill our houses with what we steal from others.
\q
\v 14 Throw in your lot with us,
\q we will all have one purse together."
