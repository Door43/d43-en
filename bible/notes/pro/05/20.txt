===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **For why should you ... the breasts of a strange woman?** - "My son, do not be captivated by an adulteress! Do not embrace the breasts of a strange woman!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **why should you, my son, be captivated by an adulteress** - AT: "why should an adulteress captivate you, my son" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
    * **adulteress** - See how you translated this word in [[:en:bible:notes:pro:05:03|5:3]].
    * **a stranger** - "a strange woman" AT: "a woman who is not your wife"
    * **... sees everything ... watches all the paths ...** - These two phrases mean the same thing and are repeated to emphasize how carefully God pays attention to you. Therefore you can also translate in second person: "Yahweh sees everything you do and watches all the paths you take" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **all the paths he takes** - AT: "everwhere he goes" or "everything he does"
