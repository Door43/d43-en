===== translationNotes: =====

  * **And now** - Here the teacher shifts from warning about the adulteress to giving advice.
  * **listen to me ... do not turn away from listening** - These two phrases express the same idea to make the student pay attention. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **do not turn away from listening** - The writer speaks of stopping an action as if the person physically turned away from it. AT: "do not stop listening" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the words of my mouth** - Here the word "mouth" represents the person who is speaking. AT: "my words" or "what I am saying" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Keep your path far away from her** - Here the word "path" represents the person's daily conduct and circumstances. AT: "Keep yourself far away from her" or "Stay away from her" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **do not come near the door of her house** - Here "the door of her house" represents the house itself. It may be more appropriate to use the word "go" instead of "come" since the latter might imply that the speaker is at the door of her house. AT: "do not go near the door of her house" or "do not even go near her house" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_go]])
