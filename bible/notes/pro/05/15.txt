===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **water from your own cistern ... running water from your own well ...** - These two phrases basically mean the same thing and are meant to emphasize the importance of staying faithful. (See [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **cistern** - "well" A cistern is a man-made place to store water.
    * **running water** - "flowing water" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
    * **Should your springs ... flow in the public squares?** - Possible meanings are 1) a euphemism for immoral sexual behavior and/or 2) a metaphor for illegitimate children. At the same time it is also a hyperbole, since it exaggerates the number of people you have sex with and/or the amount of illegitimate children you have. And it is also a rhetorical question that needs to be answered with "no". AT: "So do not go out and have sex with everyone you meet, and do not fill the streets with your illegitimate children" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]], [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **public squares** - Open areas in a city or town where two or more streets meet. A common place for people to meet each other and talk. 
    * **Let them be** - The word "them" refers to the "springs" and "streams of water" and what they stand for.
    * **not for strangers with you** - AT: "not for both strangers and you" or "exclusively for you; not for strangers too" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
