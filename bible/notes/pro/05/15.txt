\v 15 The saying is, 'Drink water from your own cistern,' like being faithful to your own wife— 
\q2 like taking water to drink from your own well.
\q1
\v 16 So, you would 'not waste good water by pouring it into the street,
\q2 or pour out your waters into the street'; so you must give your love only to your wife, and to no other. 
\q1
\v 17 Let the waters and your wife, be for you alone to enjoy,
\q2 and not for others to share with you.
