\q2 or pour out your waters into the street'; so you must give your love only to your wife, and to no other.

    * **Should your springs overflow everywhere, your streams of water flow in the public squares?**  - The phrases "your springs overflow everywhere" and "your stream of water flow in the public squares" are euphemisms for sexual promiscuity and possibly the illegitimate children resulting from such promiscuity.

    * **public square**  - The term "public square" refers to an open area in city or town where two or more streets meet.
