===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **lips of an adulteress drop with honey ... her mouth is smoother than oil** - These two phrases repeat the same idea to emphasize the danger. Possible meanings are 1) she will say what you want to hear 2) kissing her feels good in the beginning. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **an adulteress** - This is not one particular woman in history, but she stands for any kind of sexual temptation. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **but in the end she is bitter as wormwood** - AT: "but in the end she will taste really bad" or "but later she will say very mean things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
    * **wormwood** - A plant that tastes bitter.
    * **cutting like a sharp sword** - AT: "speaking very hurtful words" or "causing a lot of pain" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
