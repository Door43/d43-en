===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **Her feet go down to death ... her steps go all the way to Sheol** - These two phrases repeat the same idea to emphasize how dangerous she is. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **Her feet go ... her steps go ... her footsteps wander** - AT: "She goes ... she goes ... she wanders" This is the adulteress from [[:en:bible:notes:pro:05:03|5:3]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **Sheol** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:pro:01:12|1:12]].
    * **She gives no thought to** - "She does not follow" or "She does not care about"
    * **Her footsteps wander** - AT: "She walks around randomly" or "She walks without a sense of direction"
