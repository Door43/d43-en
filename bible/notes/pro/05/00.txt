====== Proverbs 05 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Chapter 5 continues a collection of proverbs that ends in chapter nine. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== My Son ==
Occasionally, the author addresses a proverb to "my son." This is not intended to restrict the words of that proverb to only males. Instead, it is simply a form used to pass on advice as a father does to his son.

== Adulteress ==

This chapter is unusual because it holds a theme about the adulteress and warns the young man to avoid her. An adulteress is a woman who commits adultery. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:adultery]])
