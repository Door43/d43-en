  * **General Information:** - A father teaches his child using poetry. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **if you receive my words** - Here "words" represents a teaching. AT: "if you listen to what I am teaching you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **if you receive** - This begins a series of conditional statements that concludes in 2:5. If it is more natural for your language, you can translate these conditional statements as commands as in the UDB.
  * **treasure up my commandments with you** - Valuing what is commanded is spoken of as if the commandments were a treasure and the person were a safe place to store the treasure. AT: "consider my commands to be as valuable as a treasure" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **make your ears pay attention to wisdom and incline your heart to understanding** - If you translated 2:1 as a command, you can translate 2:2 as a command, as in the UDB. Or, if you translated 2:1 as a conditional statement, you could translate 2:2 as a conditional statement also.
