===== translationNotes: =====


  * **Like cold waters to one who is thirsty, so is good news from a far country** - Cold water is compared to good news that are both refreshing and delightful (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Like a fouled spring or a ruined fountain is a righteous person tottering before wicked people** - One expects a spring or fountain to have clear water, just as one expects a righteous man to stand for what he believes. A polluted spring or fountain is compared to a righteous man who falls. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **tottering before wicked people** - Tottering is a metaphor for either 1) refusing to fight wicked people or 2) joining in their wickedness. AT: "who allows wicked people to do wickedness" or "who starts to do what wicked people do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **tottering** - This is a metaphor for being unable to continue to do good. AT: "unable to stand" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **before wicked people** - Possible meanings are "when wicked people attack him" or "when wicked people urge him to do evil." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
