===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Like cold waters to one who is thirsty,
so is good news from a far country**  - Cold water is compared to good news that are both refreshing and delightful (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
    * **Like a fouled spring or a ruined fountain is a good man who totters before the wicked**  - One expects a spring or fountain to have clear water, just as one expects a righteous man to stand for what he believes. A polluted spring or fountain is compared to a righteous man who falls. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
