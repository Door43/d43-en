===== translationNotes: =====


  * **It is not good to eat too much honey; that is like searching for honor after honor.** - Both wanting others to honor you and eating honey are good, but you can eat too much honey, and you can try too hard to have people honor you. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **It is not good** - This can be stated positively. AT:  "It is a bad thing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **that is like searching for honor after honor** - Possible meanings are 1) "that is like always thinking about how others should honor you" or 2) "you should not give out too many compliments to people."
  * **A person without self-control is like a city breached and without walls.** - Both a person without self-control and a city without walls are weak and vulnerable. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **breached and without walls** - "whose walls an army has knocked down and destroyed"
