===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 It is better if someone tells you to sit closer to the king,
\q2 than for them to tell you, while one of the king's nobles is listening, that you should sit further away in order that someone who is more important may sit there.
\q When you witness something that gives you concern,
\q1
\v 8 you should not quickly bring the matter to trial, 
\q2 unless you are very sure about it. 
\q2 because your neighbor may have a good explanation for what you saw.

\q For what will you do in the end, 
\q when your neighbor puts you to shame?
