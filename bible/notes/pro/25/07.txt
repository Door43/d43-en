====== Proverbs 25:7-8 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 it is better if someone tells you to sit closer \add to the king\add*
\q2 than for \add someone to tell you\add*, while the king is listening, to sit further away in order that someone who is more important \add may sit closer to the king\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 8 Do not quickly go to a court \add to tell the judge about\add* something that you have seen,
\q2 because another witness may later \add say something that proves that you are wrong, and as a result\add* you will be disgraced\f + \ft Or: ashamed \f*.
\q2 If that happens, what will you do?\f + \ft Or: you will not know what to do. \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 It is better if someone important invites you, saying, "Come up and sit closer to the king,"
\q2 than to embarrass you in front of an important nobleman by making you move so that you now sit far away from the king. 
\q When you witness something that gives you concern,
\q1
\v 8 you should not quickly bring the matter to trial,
\q2 unless you are very sure about it.
\q2 because your neighbor may have a good explanation for what you saw.

\q1
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 7 It is better for him to say to you, "Come up here,"
\q than for him to humiliate you before a nobleman.
\q What you have witnessed,
\q
\v 8 do not bring quickly to trial.
\q For what will you do in the end
\q when your neighbor puts you to shame?
</usfm>

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **It is better for him to say to you, "Come up here," than** - Here "up" means to move to a place at the table that is closer to the king. It is a great honor for a person to sit closer to the king. AT: "It is better for someone to invite you to sit closer to the king than" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **before a nobleman** - "in front of a nobleman"
  * **For what will you do in the end when your neighbor puts you to shame?** - This question is asked to make the reader consider the possibility that he may have misunderstood the situation. The way in which the neighbor might put the reader to shame can be stated plainly. AT: "For you will not know what to do in the end when your neighbor puts you to shame." or "For if your neighbor has an explanation, he will put you to shame, and you will have nothing to say to defend yourself." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
