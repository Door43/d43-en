  * **someone who tells secrets** - Some versions read, "Someone who is angry."

  * **a corner of the roof** - Houses in those days had flat roofs. Ancient Israelites spent much time on their roofs, where it was often cooler than inside the house, and sometimes people would build a shelter large enough for a person to sleep in on one corner of the roof. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **quarreling** - to often argue or complains
