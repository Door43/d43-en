===== translationNotes: =====


  * **Like the cold of snow at harvest time ... is a faithful messenger** - Here a faithful messenger is being compared to the cold of snow, because both are pleasant. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **the cold of snow** - Snow only fell on the tops of mountains, and the harvest took place in hot weather, so this is probably a metaphor for cool, fresh water from a clean stream. If your language has no word for snow, consider "cool, fresh, clean water." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **snow** - white flakes of ice that fall from the sky like rain
  * **brings back the life of his masters** - makes his masters, who are weak and tired, to be strong and rested again
  * **Clouds and wind without rain is the one who boasts ... not give** - Most translations translate this metaphor as a simile and change the order of the phrases. Rain was important to the Israelites because only small amounts of it fell, so a cloud without rain was useless and brought disappointment to the Israelites. AT: "The one who boasts ... not give is like clouds and wind without rain" or "The one who boasts ... not give is useless and a disappointment, like clouds and wind without rain" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
