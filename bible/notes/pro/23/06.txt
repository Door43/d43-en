===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 If someone who is stingy \add invites you to a meal\add*,
\q1 do not eat a lot of his fine food,
\q2
\v 7 because he will be thinking about how much \add the food cost that you are eating\add*.
\q1 He will say to you, "Eat and drink all that you want!", but that is not what he will really be thinking.
\q1
\v 8 \add When you realize what he is really thinking, it will cause you to want to\add* vomit what you have eaten;
\q2 and your kind words \add telling him that you are enjoying the meal\add* will be wasted.

\q1

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 Do not eat with an evil man—he will gaze at your food for a long time—
\q2 do not desire his fine food,
\q1
\v 7 because he will be thinking about how much your food cost him,
\q2 and he will say to you, "Eat and drink,"
\q2 but that is not what he will really be thinking.
\q1
\v 8 When you realize what he is really thinking, you will want to vomit what you have eaten;
\q2 and you will have wasted all the compliments you gave about the fine meal he prepared.

\q1

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 6 Do not eat the food of one with an evil eye—
\q and do not crave his delicacies,
\q
\v 7 for he is the kind of man who counts the price of the food.
\q "Eat and drink!" he says to you,
\q but his heart is not with you.
\q
\v 8 You will vomit up the little you have eaten
\q and you will have wasted your compliments.
