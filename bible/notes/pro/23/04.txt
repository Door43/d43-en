\q2 it will disappear as if it suddenly grew wings \f + \ft simile \f*
\q2 and flew up into the sky like an eagle.

<usfm>
\v 4 Do not work so much that you are always tired, so you can become rich;
\q2 be wise and know when you should stop and rest.
\q1
\v 5 As soon as you look at the money, it will be gone;
\q2 it will be as if it suddenly took up wings
\q2 and flew up like an eagle, up into the sky.

\q for it will surely take up wings like an eagle
\q and fly off to the sky.
