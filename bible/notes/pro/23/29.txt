===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has fights? Who has complaining? Who has wounds for no reason? Who has bloodshot eyes?** - The writer uses these questions to prepare the reader for the point he is about to make about a particular type of person. He does not expect an answer to each question (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **bloodshot eyes** - "eyes red, like the color of blood"
    * **Those who linger over wine, those who try the mixed wine** - This describe people who drink too much wine and answer the questions in verse 29. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
