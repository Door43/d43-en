\q2 and do not take for yourself the land that belongs to orphans,

<usfm>
\v 9 Do not waste time talking to a fool;

\q1
\v 10 Again, do not remove the ancient boundary stone. It is a marker for the property lines;
\q2 and do not claim land that is set apart for orphans to work,

\q2 and he will plead their case against you.
