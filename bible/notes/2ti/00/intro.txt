====== Introduction to 2 Timothy ======

===== Part 1: General Introduction =====

=== Outline of the Book of 2 Timothy ===

  - Paul gives general instructions to Timothy (2:14–26).

=== What is the Book of 2 Timothy about? ===

Paul, an older minister, gives the younger minister, Timothy, various instructions in this letter. The topics he addresses include: warnings about false teachers and warnings about difficulties ahead. During the time that 2 Timothy was written, Christians in the Roman Empire were being persecuted.  This was probably the reason that Paul was in jail and was instructing Timothy to endure hardship. This letter also reflects how Paul was training Timothy to be a leader among the churches.  2 Timothy contains many principles that can help church leaders in our day to manage the ministry of the local church.

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “2 Timothy” or "Second Timothy." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul's Second Letter to Timothy,” or “The Second Letter to Timothy.” (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])

=== Who wrote the Book of 2 Timothy? ===

This book is the second letter Paul wrote to his disciple and close friend Timothy, probably near the end of his life. Paul was also known as “Saul” when he was a Pharisee and a persecutor of the church before his conversion to faith in Christ. He was a scholar in the Jewish law, but he became a Christian and an apostle of Jesus Christ.

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====
=== What is discipleship? ===

The term [[:en:obe:kt:disciple|disciple]] refers to a person who spends time with a teacher, learning from that teacher's character and teaching. Discipleship is the process of making disciples (sometimes called mentoring outside of Scripture). This letter gives many instructions about how a leader disciples a less mature Christian. The goal of discipleship is to encourage other Christians to grown in likeness to Christ. It is common for Paul to those he disciples as spiritual "sons."

=== What is the soldier imagery in 2 Timothy? ===
As Paul awaits his imminent death, he writes these words to Timothy and often uses the imagery of being a soldier of Jesus Christ. Christians are ultimately responsible for answering to Jesus. As a soldier of Christ, christians are to be obedient to his commands, even to the point of death. This imagery does not imply that christians are to physically fight for Christ with guns or bombs. 

=== What does it mean that God inspired Scripture? ===

The doctrine of Scripture is a very important one. The teaching of this books helps the reader to understand that while each writer of Scripture has their own distinct way of writing, God is the true author of Scripture. This is why it is also referred to as God's word. This doctrine has many implications. For example, the Bible is trustworthy and does not lie or mislead people. It is also free from error.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== What are the major issues in the text of the Book of 2 Timothy? ===

The following are the most significant textual issues in the Book of Romans:\\

  * "And teacher" (1:11). Some older versions read, "and teacher of the Gentiles" 

Translators are advised not to translate this last passage. However, if older Bible versions exist in their region that have it, it is not wrong to translate it. If it is translated, it should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that it is probably not original to the Book of 2 Timothy.
