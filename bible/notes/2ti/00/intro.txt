=== What is the Book of 2 Timothy about? ===

This is one of four letters from Paul that are addressed to a person instead of a church. The other three such letters are 1 Timothy, Titus, and Philemon.  During the time that 2 Timothy was written, Christians in the Roman Empire were being persecuted.  This was probably the reason that Paul was in jail and was instructing Timothy to endure hardship.  As in 1 Timothy, Paul gives Timothy many warnings about false teachers (1 Tim 1:16-18).  He also tells Timothy that there will be difficult times ahead (3:1).

=== Who wrote the Book of 2 Timothy? ===

The book of 2 Timothy is the second letter from the Apostle Paul to his disciple Timothy.  2 Timothy was written near the end of Paul’s life.  He was imprisoned in Rome during this time (1:16).  Paul had a close relationship with Timothy and often referred to him as a son (Phil. 2:22, 1 Tim 1:2, 1:18).
