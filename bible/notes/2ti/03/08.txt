====== 2 Timothy 03:8-9 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Just like Jannes and Jambres \add long ago\add* very much opposed Moses, so also some \add people\add* now oppose the true \add message. Those\add* people think only what is evil. God rejects them \add because they do not\add* believe \add what is true\add*.
\v 9 Nevertheless, they will not continue to succeed, because most \f + \ft hyperbole \f* people will understand clearly that such people are foolish, just like people also realized \add clearly that Jannes and Jambres were foolish\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 In the same way that Jannes and Jambres tried to stop Moses, so do these men now try to stop people from obeying the truth. These men are ruined in how they think. They are frauds in matters of the faith.
\v 9 Nevertheless, they will not succeed very much in what they do, because most others will clearly see that these people understand nothing. It is just like how the people of Israel saw that Jannes and Jambres were foolish.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 In the same way that Jannes and Jambres stood against Moses, these false teachers also stand against the truth. They are men destroyed in mind, unapproved regarding the faith.
\v 9 But they will not advance very far. For their foolishness will be obvious to all, just like that of those men.
