====== 2 Timothy 03:8-9 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Just like Jannes and Jambres \add long ago\add* very much opposed Moses, so also some \add people\add* now oppose the true \add message. Those\add* people think only what is evil. God rejects them \add because they do not\add* believe \add what is true\add*.
\v 9 Nevertheless, they will not continue to succeed, because most \f + \ft hyperbole \f* people will understand clearly that such people are foolish, just like people also realized \add clearly that Jannes and Jambres were foolish\add*.

\v 8 In the same way that Jannes and Jambres tried to stop Moses, so do these men now try to stop people from obeying the truth. These men are ruined in how they think. They are frauds in matters of the faith.
\v 9 Nevertheless, they will not succeed very much in what they do, because most others will clearly see that these people understand nothing. It is just like how the people of Israel saw that Jannes and Jambres were foolish.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 In the same way that Jannes and Jambres stood against Moses, so these false teachers also stand against the truth. They are corrupted in mind and they are unauthenticated concerning the faith.
\v 9 But they will not advance very far, for their foolishness will be obvious to all, just like the foolishness of those two men.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **stood against**  - "opposed"
  * **so**  - "in the same way"
  * **the truth**  - "the gospel of Jesus"
  * **They are corrupted in mind**  - "They are no longer able to think rightly"
  * **unauthenticated concerning the faith**  - Someone has shown that what the false teachers teach about believing in Jesus is false, so the teachers "have no value" or "are worthless" or "are disqualified."
  * **advance** - “go forward”​
  * **foolishness** - “lack of understanding" or "folly”​
  * **obvious** - “easily seen” or “easily recognized”
