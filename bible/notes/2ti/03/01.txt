\v 1 I want you to know this: in the final period of time before the Lord returns, it will be very dangerous.
\v 2 People will love themselves more than anyone else. They will love money. They will boast about themselves. They will be proud. They will insult others. They will not obey their parents. They will not thank anyone for anything. They will not honor God.
\v 3 They will not love even their own families. They will refuse to be at peace with anyone. They will slander others. They will not control themselves. They will be brutal toward others. They will not love what is good.
\v 4 They will betray the ones they should protect. They will do dangerous things without thinking. They will be proud, and they will do what pleases them instead of loving God.

\v 1 But know this: In the last days there will be difficult times.
\v 2 For people will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, and unholy.
\v 3 They will be without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, without self-control, violent, not lovers of good.
\v 4 They will be betrayers, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God.
