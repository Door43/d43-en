\v 5 They will seem to honor God, but they will refuse to accept the power that God truly wants to give them. Stay away from people like this.
\v 6 These men persuade foolish women to let them come into their houses. Then they deceive those women so that they control what they think. These are women who sin all the time, so they follow these evil men into doing all sorts of bad things that they enjoy doing.
\v 7 Even though these women are always wanting to learn new things, they are never able to learn what is actually true.

\v 7 These women are always trying to learn new  things, yet they are never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
