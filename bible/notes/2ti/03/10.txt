\v 11 \add You know how I endured many times when people\add* harmed me\add . They\add* caused me to suffer at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra \add cities\add*. \add But although they caused me to suffer\add*, I endured it; and every time \add they\add* did those things to me, the Lord rescued me.
\v 12 Indeed\f + \ft Or: You know that \f*, for us\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* who want to live in a \add godly manner\f + \ft Or: \add*in a \add manner that pleases God\add* \f*, we will always be persecuted \f + \ft Or:there will always be people who will cause us to suffer \f* because we \add have a close relationship with\add* Christ Jesus.
\v 13 Evil people \f + \ft Or: And those \f* who deceive other people will get worse\f + \ft Or: teach things that are more and more wrong \f*. \add Specifically, they will\add* deceive other people, and \add those who hear them will\add* deceive others.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 Timothy, you have followed what I taught you. You have seen my way of living. You have seen how I want to serve God. You have seen how I trust in him. You have seen how I have peace even when I am suffering. You have seen how I love God and the believers. You have seen how I keep on serving God even when it is very hard to do so.
\v 11 You have seen how people persecuted me. You have seen every way in which I suffered when I was in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I suffered very much in those places, but the Lord has taken me out of all that suffering.
\v 12 Indeed, they will make suffer every one who wants to live in a way that he honors Christ Jesus.
\v 13 Evil men and frauds will continue to become more evil. They will lead people away from what is true, and they will allow others to lead themselves away also.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 But you have followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience,
\v 11 persecutions, sufferings, and what happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra. I endured such persecutions, and out of them all, the Lord rescued me.
\v 12 All those who want to live in a godly manner in Christ Jesus will be persecuted. 
\v 13 Evil people and impostors will become even worse, while they lead others astray and are themselves being led astray.
