===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 Alexander, the man who makes things from metal, did many evil\f + \ft Or: harmful \f* things to me. The Lord will punish him for what he did.
\v 15 So you, too, must beware of him. \add He will try to destroy your work if he can\add*, because he very much opposes the message that we \add proclaim\add*.


\p
\v 16 When I first defended myself\add in court here\add*, no one came along \add to help defend\add* me. Instead, they all left me. \add I pray\add* that it will not be counted against \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* will forgive \f* them \f + \ft litotes \f* \add for leaving me\add*.

\v 14 Alexander the metalworker acted very badly toward me. The Lord will punish him for what he has done.
\v 15 You also should be on guard against him because he did everything possible to stop our preaching.
\p
\v 16 The first time I stood in court and explained my work, no believers stood by my side to encourage me. They all stayed away. May God not hold them responsible for this.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 Alexander the coppersmith displayed much ill will toward me. The Lord will repay to him according to his works.
\v 15 You also should watch him, because he greatly stood against our words.
\v 16 At my first defense, no one stood with me, but everyone left me. May it not be counted against them.
