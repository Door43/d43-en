<usfm>
\v 1 When Christ Jesus comes soon to rule, he will judge those who still live and those who died. And now he and God are watching me as I command you
\v 2 to proclaim the message about Christ. Be ready to do this when it is easy to do so and also when it is not easy. Convince people about what is right when they have done wrong. Warn them not to sin. Encourage them to follow Christ. Do these things as you teach them, and always be willing to wait for them to do better.
