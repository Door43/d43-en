====== 2 Timothy 04:3-5 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 \add Do these things\add* because there will be a time when people will not listen to good teaching. Instead, they will bring in many teachers for themselves who will tell them just what they want to hear \f + \ft idiom \f*. \add The reason that they will bring in such teachers is\add* that they want to do the evil things that they desire.
\v 4 That is, they will not listen to \f + \ft metonymy \f* what is true, but will listen instead to \add strange\add* stories from our ancestors.
\v 5 \add Furthermore, I command that\add* you always control what you think and do. \add Be willing\add* to endure hardships\f + \ft Or: suffering \f*. Your work should be telling people the message \add about Christ Jesus\add*. As you serve \add the Lord\add*, do everything that \add God has told\add* you to do.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 I tell you these things, because the time will come when people among us will not follow what God truly teaches. Instead, they will find many men who will teach that it is good to do anything they wish to do. In this way, they will always be looking for something new and different to learn.
\v 4 They will stop listening to the truth, and they will pay attention to foolish stories.
\v 5 But as for you, Timothy, control yourself no matter what happens. Be willing to endure difficult things. Do the work of preaching the Gospel. Complete the work you must do to serve the Lord.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 For the time will come when people will not endure the sound teaching. Instead, they will surround themselves with teachers who teach what agrees with their own lusts. In this way they will have their ears tickled.
\v 4 They will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to myths.
\v 5 But you, be sober-minded in all things; suffer hardship; do the work of an evangelist; fulfill your ministry.

  * **the sound teaching** - the teaching that the whole church considered true and correct
  * **surround themselves with teachers who teach what agrees with their own lusts. In this way they will have their ears tickled.**  - Possible meanings are 1) "because of their personal desires, they will gather teachers who will say what they want to hear" or 2) "they will gather teachers that agree with their personal desires so that those teachers who will say what they want to hear" or 3) "follow their desires; they will gather teachers who will say what they want to hear."
  * **their own lusts**  - "their personal desires"
