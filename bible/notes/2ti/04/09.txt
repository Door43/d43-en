===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul talks of specific people and how they behaved, God's work for and to him, and then closes with greetings to and from certain people.

  * **quickly** - "as soon as possible"
  * **Demas...Crescens...Titus** - These are names of men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **this present world** - Here "world" refers to worldly things as opposed to the things of God.  Possible meanings are 1) he loves the temporary comforts of this world or 2) he is afraid he will die if he remains with Paul. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Crescens went...and Titus went** - These two men had left Paul, but Paul is not saying that they also "love this present world" like Demas.
  * **Dalmatia** - This is the name of a land region. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
