===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 \add Timothy, I say these things to\add* you because as for me, \add it is as though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add they are now about to kill me. It is as though my blood will\add* be poured out \f + \ft Or:they will kill me \f* \add as a sacrifice on the altar\add*; that is, \add I know\add* that it is the time for me to die \f + \ft euphemism \f*.
\v 7 \add And as to telling people the\add* good \add message and defending it\add*, I have exerted myself thoroughly\f + \ft Or: done it with all my energy \f* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add like a boxer does. As to doing\add* the work that God gave me to do, I have completed it, \add like a runner who finishes\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* the race. \add As to\add* what we believe, I have been loyal to it\f + \ft Or: continue to believe it \f*.
\v 8 \add So, like people award\add* a prize \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add to the winner of a race\add*, the Lord, who judges rightly, will give me a reward \add because I have lived\add* righteously. He will give me that reward when \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add he judges people\add*. And not only \add will he reward\add* me, but he will also reward all those who very much want him to come back.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 I tell you these things, because soon I will die and leave this world. I will be like the cup of wine that they pour out on the altar and sacrifice to God.
\v 7 I am like an athlete who has done his best in a contest. I am like a runner who has finished his race. I have done my best to obey God.
\v 8 Now a prize is waiting for me because I have lived in the right way for God. The Lord will judge me in the right way. He will give that prize to me when he comes again. And he will give it also to everyone who waits eagerly for him to come again.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 For I am already being poured out as an offering. The time of my departure has come.
\v 7 I have competed in the good contest; I have finished the race; I have kept the faith.
\v 8 The crown of righteousness has been reserved for me—the crown that the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day—and not to me only, but also for all those who have come to love his appearing.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The time of my departure has come**  - "soon I will die and leave this world" (UDB). Paul realizes that he will not live much longer.
  * **I have competed in the good contest**  - This is a sports metaphor of fighting, wrestling, or boxing. Paul has done his best. This can also be translated as "I have done my best" or "I gave my best." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **I have finished the race **- This metaphor pictures finishing life as reaching the finish line of a footrace. AT: "I have completed what I needed to do." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **I have kept the faith**  - Possible meanings are 1) "I have kept the teachings about what we believe from any error" or 2) "I have been faithful in doing my ministry" (UDB).
  * **The crown of righteousness has been reserved for me**  - AT: "the crown of righteousness will be given to me"
  * **crown of righteousness**  - Possible meanings are 1) the crown is the prize that God gives to people who have lived the right way (UDB) or 2) the crown is a metaphor for righteousness. Just as the judge of a race gives a crown to the winner, when Paul finishes his life, God will declare that Paul is righteous. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **crown**  - a wreath made of laurel tree leaves that was given to winners of athletic contests
  * **on that day**  - "on the day when the Lord comes again" or "on the day when God judges people"
