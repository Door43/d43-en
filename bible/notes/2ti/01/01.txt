\v 1 Dear Timothy,
This is Paul writing to you. The Messiah Jesus sent me as an apostle to tell everyone that if they are united with him, God promises to make them live both now and forever.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Paul **- "From Paul" or "I, Paul write this letter"
  * **through the will of God**  - "because of God's will" or "because God wanted it to be this way." Paul became an apostle because God wanted Paul to be an apostle, and not because a human being chose him.
  * **according to**  - Possible meanings: 1) "in keeping with," meaning that just as God promises that Jesus gives life, he has made Paul an apostle; 2) "for the purpose of," meaning that God appointed Paul to tell others about God's promise of life in Jesus.
  * **the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus**  - "God has promised to make those who are in Christ Jesus alive"
  * **beloved child**  - "dear child" or "child who is loved" or "child whom I love." Timothy was converted to Christ by Paul, and Paul considered him like his own child for this reason.
  * **Grace, mercy, and peace from**  - "May grace, mercy and peace be yours from" or "May you experience kindness, mercy and peace within from"
  * **God the Father** - "God who is our Father"
  * **and Christ Jesus our Lord**  - "and Christ Jesus who is our Lord"
