===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **This is the reason **- "For this reason" or "Because of your sincere faith in Jesus" or "Since you have a sincere faith in Jesus"
  * **I remind you **- "I am reminding you" or "I am telling you again"
  * **rekindle the gift of God in you through the laying on of my hands**  - Paul had laid hands on Timothy conferring the Holy Spirit and a spiritual ability or gift upon him. Paul is telling Timothy to "relight" or "rekindle" that spiritual ability in his work for Christ. The picture of blowing on or fanning a bed of coals is a metaphor for spiritual abilities and gifts that Timothy had been neglecting or not using.
  * **For God **- "Because God" or "Since God"
  * **God did not give us a spirit of fear**  - Paul had received the Spirit from God. When he laid his hands on Timothy, the same Spirit had come upon Timothy. This Spirit did not cause them to be afraid of God or of other people.
  * **spirit of ... discipline**  - Possible meanings are "God's Spirit enables us to control ourselves" (see UDB) or 2) "God's Spirit enables us to correct others who go wrong."
