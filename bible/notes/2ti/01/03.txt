  * **in a pure conscience**  - "with a clean conscience." He is not bothered by thoughts of wrongdoing because he has always tried to do what was right.
  * **as I constantly remember you **- "when I remember you continuously" or 'while I remember you all the time" or "that I constantly remember you"
  * **night and day **- This can modify the following: 1) prayers - "my prayers night and day" 2) remember - "I constantly remember you night and day 3) longing - 'longing to see you night and day."
  * **longing to see you**  - "wanting very much to see you"
