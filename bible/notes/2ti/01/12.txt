\v 12 For this cause I suffer also these things: but I am not ashamed; for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have entrusted to him until that day.
\v 13 Keep to the pattern of healthy words which you  heard from me, in the faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
\v 14 That good thing which God committed to you, guard it through the Holy Spirit, who lives in us.
