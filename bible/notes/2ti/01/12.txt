\v 12 In these tasks I suffer, but I am not ashamed, because I know and have trusted Jesus Christ, and I am convinced that he is able to protect my faith in him until the final day. 
\p
\v 13 As you trust in Jesus Christ and love him, follow the meaning of true words, which you heard from me.
\v 14 God is relying on you, that you will preach the good message that he gave to you. Protect that message by relying on the Holy Spirit who lives in us.

<usfm>
\v 12 For this cause I suffer also these things: but I am not ashamed; for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have entrusted to him until that day.
\v 13 Keep to the pattern of faithful instruction which you heard from me, with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
\v 14 That good thing which God committed to you, guard it through the Holy Spirit, who lives in us.
