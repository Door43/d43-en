\v 15 You know that almost all the believers in Asia have turned away from me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.
\v 16 But I pray that the Lord will be kind to the family of Onesiphorus. Often he helped me, and he was not ashamed that I am in prison.
\v 17 On the contrary, when he came here to Rome, he kept searching for me until he found me.
\v 18 May the Lord be kind to Onesiphorus on the final day. You know all the ways that he helped me in Ephesus.

\p
\v 15 This you know, that all who live in Asia turned away from me; in this group are Phygelus and Hermogenes.
\v 16 May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus: for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain;
\v 17 but, when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me—
\v 18 the Lord grant to him to find mercy from him in that day—and all the ways he helped me in Ephesus, you know very well.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **turned away from me**  - They abandoned him because he had been arrested and thrown into prison.
  * **was not ashamed of my chain**  - Onesiphorus was not ashamed of Paul because he was in prison but came to visit him frequently. //Chain//  is a metonym for being in prison. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
  * **grant to him to find mercy … in that day**  - Paul is wishing that Onesiphorus receives mercy and not punishment on either 1) the day the Lord comes again or 2) the day when God will judge people.
