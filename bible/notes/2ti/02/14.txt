\v 14 Those whom you appointed to teach others God's truth, keep reminding them about these things that I have told you. Warn them before God not to fight over foolish words, because doing so does not help anything and can ruin those who listen.
\p
\v 15 Do your best to cause God to approve you as a worker who has no need to be ashamed, who teaches the word of God correctly, for everyone can depend on the fact that it tells the truth.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The word "them" may refer to "the teachers" or "the people of the church"

  * **before God** - Paul speaks of God's awareness of Paul as if he is in God's physical presence. This implies that God will be Timothy's witness. AT: "in God's presence" or "with God as your witness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **not to quarrel about words** - "not to argue over what words mean" or "not to argue about foolish things that people say"
  * **Because of this there is nothing useful** - "This does not benefit anyone"
  * **Because of this there is destruction for those who listen** - The image is of the destruction of a building. Those who hear the quarreling stop respecting the Christian message. Their faith is destroyed. AT: "This only destroys the faith of those who listen" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no reason to be ashamed** - "to present yourself to God as a person who has proven to be worthy and with no cause for shame"
  * **a worker** - Paul presents the idea of Timothy correctly explaining God's word as if he were a skilled workman. AT: "like a workman" or "like a worker" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **accurately teaches the word of truth** - Here "word" means a message. AT: "explaining the true message correctly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
