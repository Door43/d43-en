===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Flee...pursue** - These metaphors mean running as fast as you can. To flee is to run from something that will harm you; to pursue is to run toward something that will do you good. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]].)
  * **Flee youthful lusts** - "Run away from lusts that tempt young people" the way a person flees an attacking animal or murderer.

  * **pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace** - "chase after righteousness, faith, love, and peace." If your language cannot make "righteousness," "faith," love," and "peace" nouns, "do everything you can to do what is right,"
  * **with** - Possible meanings are 1) "in the company of," meaning "join with other Christians in pursuing righteousness" or 2) "as you relate with" meaning "do everything you can to...be at peace with other Christians."
