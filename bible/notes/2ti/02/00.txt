====== 2 Timothy 02 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

The ULB has chosen to indent the lines of 2:11-13 to set it apart from the rest of the text as the "trustworthy saying." It is not necessary for translators to do this in their own versions, but they may find it helpful to do so.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== We will reign with him ==
The faithful Christians are said to reign with Christ in the future. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:faithful]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Analogies ==
Paul draws on several analogies in this chapter to present his teaching about living as a Christian. First he uses the analogy of a soldier, then an athlete, and then of a farmer. A little further on in the chapter,  he also uses the analogy of different kinds of containers in a house, some for ordinary, everyday use, and others reserved for use on special occasions.
