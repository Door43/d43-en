===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Suffer hardship with me** - Possible meanings are 1) "endure suffering as I do" or 2) "share in my suffering"
  * **as a good soldier of Christ Jesus** - Paul compares suffering  for Christ Jesus to the suffering that a good soldier endures. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **No soldier serves while entangled in the affairs of this life** - "No soldier serves when he is involved in the everyday business of this life" or "When soldiers are serving, they do not get distracted by the ordinary things that people do." Christ's servants should not allow everyday life to keep them from working for Christ. 
  * **while entangled** - Paul speaks of this distraction as if it were a net that tripped people up as they were walking. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **his superior officer** - "the one who enlisted him as a soldier" or "the one who commands him"
  * **as an athlete, he is not crowned unless he competes by the rules** - Paul is implicitly speaking of Christ's servants as if they were athletes. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he is not crowned unless he competes by the rules** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "they will crown him as winner only if he competes by the rules" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) 
  * **he is not crowned** - "he does not win the prize." Athletes in Paul's time were crowned with wreaths made from the leaves of plants when they won competitions.
  * **competes by the rules** - "competes according to the rules" or "strictly obeys the rules"
