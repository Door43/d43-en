===== Translation Notes: =====

In verses 4, 5, and 6, Paul uses several metaphors to tell how a servant of Christ should live. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])

  * **Suffer hardship with me**  - Possible meanings are 1) "endure suffering as I do" (UDB) or 2) "share in my suffering"
  * **No soldier serves while entangled in the affairs of this life**  - "No soldier serves when he is involved in the everyday business of this life" or "When soldiers are serving, they do not get distracted by the ordinary things that people do." Christ's servants should not allow everyday life to keep them from working for Christ. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **entangled**  - Being prevented from serving because of doing other things is referred to as being caught in a net.
  * **superior officer**  - "the one who enlisted him as a soldier"
  * **an athlete … is not crowned unless he competes by the rules**  - Christ's servants need to do what Christ says to do. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **he is not crowned**  - "he does not win the prize"
  * **competes by the rules**  - "strictly obeys the rules" or "strictly competes according to the rules"
