===== Translation Notes: =====

  * In verses 4, 5, and 6, Paul uses three metaphors to tell how a servant of Christ should live. (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **Suffer hardship with me**  - Possible meanings are 1) "endure suffering as I do." (see UDB) or 2) "share in my suffering."
  * **No soldier serves while entangled in the affairs of this life** - “No soldier serves when he is involved in the everyday business of this life” or “When soldiers are serving, they do not get distracted by the ordinary things that people have to do.” This is the first of the three metaphors. The reader should understand that Christ's servants should not allow everyday life to keep them away from working for Christ. 
  * **entangled**  - Being prevented from serving because of doing other things is spoken of as being caught in a net.
  * **superior officer**  - "the one who enlisted him as a soldier"
  * **an athlete … is not crowned unless he competes by the rules** - This is the second metaphor that Paul gives Timothy. The reader should understand that Christ's servants need to do what Christ says to do.
  * **he is not crowned**  - "he does not win the prize"
  * **competes by the rules**  - "strictly obeys the rules" or "strictly competes according to the rules"
