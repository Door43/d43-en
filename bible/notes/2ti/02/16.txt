===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 Stay away from people who talk in ways that insult God, because this kind of talk dishonors God more and more.
\v 17 This kind of words will spread like an infectious disease. Hymenaeus and Philetus are two examples of men who talk like this.
\v 18 These men have wandered away from the truth, saying the resurrection of the dead  has already happened. In this way they upset the faith of some believers.
</usfm>

\v 16 Avoid profane talk, which leads to more and more godlessness.
\v 17 Their word will spread like gangrene, among whom are Hymenaeus and Philetus, 
\v 18 men who have wandered from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already happened, and upsetting the faith of some.
