===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 Stay away from people who talk in ways that insult God, because this kind of talk dishonors God more and more.
\v 17 This kind of words will spread like an infectious disease. Hymenaeus and Philetus are two examples of men who talk like this.
\v 18 These men have stopped believing. They say that the resurrection of the dead has already happened. In this way they convince some Christians to stop trusting in Christ.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 Avoid profane talk, which leads to more and more godlessness.
\v 17 Their talk will spread like gangrene. Among whom are Hymenaeus and Philetus.
\v 18 These are men who have missed the truth. They say that the resurrection has already happened. They overturn the faith of some.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **which leads to more and more godlessness** - Paul speaks of this kind of talk as if it were something that could physically move to another location, and he speaks of godlessness as if it were that new location. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **Their talk will spread like gangrene** - "What they say will spread like an infectious disease." Just as gangrene quickly spreads in a person's body and destroys it, what those people were saying would spread from person to person and harm the faith of those who heard it. AT: "Their talk will spread quickly and cause destruction like gangrene" or "People will quickly hear what they say and be harmed by it." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **gangrene** - "dying, rotting flesh." The only way to keep gangrene from spreading and killing the ill person is to cut off the affected area.
  * **missed the truth** - Paul speaks of faith in Christ as if it were a target to aim at. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the resurrection...has already happened** - "God has already raised dead believers to eternal life"
  * **overturn the faith of some** - Paul speaks the destruction of people's faith as if their faith were physically overturned. AT: "destroy the faith of some" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
