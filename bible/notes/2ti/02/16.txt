===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 Stay away from people who talk in ways that insult God, because this kind of talk dishonors God more and more.
\v 17 This kind of words will spread like an infectious disease. Hymenaeus and Philetus are two examples of men who talk like this.
\v 18 These men have stopped believing. They say that the resurrection of the dead has already happened. In this way they convince some Christians to stop trusting in Christ.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 Avoid profane talk, which leads to more and more godlessness.
\v 17 Their talk will spread like cancer. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,
\v 18 who have gone astray from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already happened, and they destroy the faith of some.
