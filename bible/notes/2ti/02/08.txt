\v 8 \add Endure everything by\add* remembering how Jesus Christ \add endured it when he suffered\add*. Remember that he was raised \f + \ft Or:God raised him \f* from the dead and \add God affirmed, Or: declared him to be king as\add* his ancestor \add King\add* David was. Those are things that I tell to people when I tell them the message \add about Christ\add*.
\v 9 I am suffering \add here in prison\add* because \add some people oppose\add* the good message \add that I tell\add*. They have even put me in chains as if I were a criminal. Nevertheless, the message from God is not chained \f + \ft Or:nothing is preventing ( metaphor ) \add others from proclaiming\add* the message from God \f*.
\v 10 Therefore I \add willingly\add* endure all \add that I am suffering\add* for the sake of those \add whom God has\add* chosen. \add I do this\add* in order that Christ Jesus will save them, too, and that they will be forever with \add him in the\add* glorious \add place where he is\add*.

\v 8 As you suffer hardships, remember Jesus Christ, a descendant of King David. God raised him from the dead, as I also preach in the gospel message.
\v 9 For this gospel I suffer to the point of being imprisoned as a criminal. But the word of God is not in prison.
\v 10 Therefore I willingly endure all that I am suffering for the sake of those whom God has chosen. I do this in order that Christ Jesus will save them, too, and that they will be forever with him in the glorious place where he is.

\v 8 Remember Jesus Christ, from David's seed, who was raised from the dead ones. This is according to my gospel message,
\v 9 for which I am suffering to the point of being chained as a criminal. But the word of God is not chained.
\v 10 Therefore I endure all things for those who are chosen, so that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.
