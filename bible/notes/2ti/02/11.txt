\v 11 \add Endure everything as you remember\add* that these words \add that we all say\f + \ft Or: sing \f*\add* \f + \ft Or: \add that we teach people\add* \f* \add are trustworthy\add*,
\q1 Since we have stopped behaving as we did in the past,
\q1 as though we died when he died,
\q1 we shall also live with him.
\q1
\v 12 Since we are also patiently enduring what we suffer,
\q1 we shall also rule with him.
\q1 But if we say that we do not know him,
\q1 he also will say that he does not know us.
\q1
\v 13 If we are unfaithful\f + \ft Or: stop doing what he tells us to do \f*,
\q1 he will treat us just like he promised to do,
\q1 because he can never be untrue to himself\f + \ft Or: always does what he says that he will do \f*.

<usfm>
\v 11 You can depend on the words that we sometimes say:
 \q "If we have died with Jesus, we will also live with him.
 \q
\v 12 If we endure, we will also reign with him.
\q But if we deny him, he also will deny us.
\q
\v 13 If we are unfaithful to Jesus, he continues to be faithful;
\m
for he cannot deny himself."

\v 11 This is a trustworthy saying: 
\q "If we have died with him, we will also live with him.
\q
\v 12 If we endure, we will also reign with him.
\q If we deny him, he also will deny us.
\q
\v 13 if we are unfaithful, he remains faithful,
\q
for he cannot deny himself."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **This is a trustworthy saying** - "These are words you can trust"
  * **If we have died with him ... he cannot deny himself** - This is most likely a song or poem that Paul is quoting. If your language has a way of indicating that this is poetry you could use it here. If not, you could translate this as regular prose rather than poetry. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]])
  * **died with him** - Paul uses this expression to mean that people share in Christ's death when they trust in him, deny their own wants, and obey him. 
  * **if we are unfaithful** - "even if we fail God" or "even if we do not do what we believe God wants us to do"
  * **he cannot deny himself** - "he must always act according to his character" or "he cannot act in ways that are the opposite of his real character"
