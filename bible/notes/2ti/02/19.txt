\v 19 However, the truth about God still exists. It is like a firm foundation of a building, on which someone has written these words: "The Lord knows those who belong to him," and, "Everyone who says he belongs to the Lord must stop doing wicked deeds."
\p
\v 20 In a wealthy person's house there are not only utensils made of gold and of silver, but also utensils made of wood and of clay. The gold and silver utensils are used on special occasions. But the wood and clay utensils are used in ordinary times.
\v 21 Therefore, those who rid themselves of what is evil in their lives will be able to work well for the Lord. They will be like utensils ready to do any kind of good work. They will become very useful to the Master to do special work for him, every good deed, in fact.

\v 19 However, the firm foundation of God stands. It has this inscription: "The Lord knows those who are his" and "Everyone who names the name of the Lord must depart from unrighteousness."
\v 20 In a wealthy home, there are not only containers of gold and silver. There are also containers of wood and clay. Some of these are for honorable use, and some for dishonorable. 
\v 21 If someone cleans himself from dishonorable use, he is an honorable container. He is set apart, useful to the Master, and prepared for every good work.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Just as precious and common containers can be used for honorable ways in a wealthy house, any person who turns to God can be used by God in honorable ways in doing good works. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **the firm foundation of God stands** - Possible meanings are 1) "God's truth is like a firm foundation" or 2) "God has established his people like a building on a firm foundation" or 3) "God's faithfulness is like a firm foundation." In any case, Paul speaks of this idea as if it were a building's foundation laid in the ground. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **who names the name of the Lord** - "who calls on the name of the Lord." Here "name of the Lord" refers to the Lord himself. AT: "who calls on the Lord" or "who says he is a believer in Christ" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **depart from unrighteousness** - Paul speaks of unrighteousness as if it were a place from which one could leave. AT: "stop being evil" or "stop doing wrong things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **containers of gold and silver ... containers of wood and clay** - Here "container" is a general word for bowls, plates, and pots, which people put food or drink into or on. If your language does not have a general word, use the word for "bowl" or "pot." Paul is using this as a metaphor to describe different types of people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **honorable use ... dishonorable use** - Possible meanings are 1) "special occasions ... ordinary times" or 2) "the kinds of activities people do in public ... the kinds of activities people do in private."
  * **cleans himself from dishonorable use** - Possible meanings are 1) "separates himself from dishonorable people" or 2) "makes himself pure." In any case, Paul speaks of this process as if it were a person washing himself.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he is an honorable container** - Paul speaks about this person as if he were an honorable container. AT: "he is like the container that is useful for special occasions" or "he is like the container that is useful for activities good people do in public" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **He is set apart, useful to the Master, and prepared for every good work** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "The Master sets him apart, and he is ready for the Master to use him for every good work" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **He is set apart** - He is not set apart physically or in the sense of location, but instead to fulfill a purpose. Some versions translate this "sanctified," but the text signals the essential idea of being set apart. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
