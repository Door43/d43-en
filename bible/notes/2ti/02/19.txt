\v 19 However, the truth about God still exists. It is like a firm foundation of a building, on which someone has written these words: "The Lord knows those who belong to him," and, "Everyone who says he belongs to the Lord must stop doing wicked deeds."
\p
\v 20 In a wealthy person's house there are not only utensils made of gold and of silver, but also utensils made of wood and of clay. The gold and silver utensils are used on special occasions. But the wood and clay utensils are used in ordinary times.
\v 21 Therefore, those who rid themselves of what is evil in their lives will be able to work well for the Lord. They will be like utensils ready to do any kind of good work. They will become very useful to the Master to do special work for him, every good deed, in fact.

\v 19 However, the firm foundation of God stands, having this inscription, "The Lord knows those who are his," and, "Everyone who names the name of the Lord must depart from unrighteousness."
\v 20 In a wealthy home are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay; some for honorable use and some for dishonorable.   
\v 21 If someone cleans himself from dishonorable use, he is an honorable vessel, consecrated, useful to the Master, and prepared for every good work.
