\v 24 But those who serve the Lord must not quarrel. Instead, they should be kind to all people, they should be able to teach God's truth well, and they should be patient with people.
\v 25 That is, they should gently instruct the people who argue against them. Perhaps God may give them the opportunity to repent and come to know the truth.
\v 26 In that way they may get free from what is like a trap set by the devil. The devil has deceived them in order that they might do what he wants them to do.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 24 The Lord’s servant must not quarrel, but instead he must be gentle toward all, able to teach,  patient,
\v 25 in meekness educating those who oppose him. God may perhaps give them repentance for the knowledge of the truth,
\v 26 and they may regain their senses out of the trap of the devil, having been captured by him for his will.
