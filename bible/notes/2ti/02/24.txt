\v 24 But those who serve the Lord must not quarrel. Instead, they should be kind to all people, they should be able to teach \add God's truth well\f + \ft Or: \add*good teachers \f*, and they should be patient \add with people\add*.
\v 25 \add That is, they should\add* gently instruct\f + \ft Or: teach \f* people who oppose \add the true message. They should do that\add* in order that perhaps God will cause others to completely change what they think, so that they may acknowledge\f + \ft Or: believe \f* the true \add message\add*.
\v 26 In that way they may get free from \add what is like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a trap \add set by\add* the devil. The devil has deceived them in order that \add they might do\add* what he wants \add them to do\add*.

\v 24 But those who serve the Lord must not quarrel. Instead, they should be kind to all people, they should be able to teach God's truth well, and they should be patient with people.
\v 25 That is, they should gently instruct the people who argue against them. Perhaps God may give them the opportunity to repent and come to know the truth.
\v 26 In that way they may think correctly and be like people who have escaped from a trap set by the devil. It is the devil who has deceived them in order to get them to do what he wishes them to do.

\v 24 The Lord's servant must not quarrel. Instead he must be gentle toward all, able to teach, and patient.
\v 25 He must in meekness educate those who oppose him. God may perhaps give them repentance for the knowledge of the truth.
\v 26 They may become sober again and leave the devil's trap, after they have been captured by him for his will.
