===== translationNotes: =====

  * **It is necessary that the hardworking farmer receive his share of the crops first** - This is the third metaphor Paul gives Timothy about working. The reader should understand that Christ's servants need to work hard. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Think about what I am saying** - Paul gave Timothy word pictures, but he did not completely explain their meanings. He expected Timothy to figure out what he was saying about Christ's servants.
  * **in everything** - "about everything"
