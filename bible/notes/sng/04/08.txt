===== Translation Notes: =====

The lover continues to speak to the woman.

  * **Come with me...dens of leopards** - The lover wants his bride to come with him away from a wild and dangerous place. This is a metaphor and the couple is not really on these mountains or by these dens. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **from Lebanon** - "away from Lebanon"
  * **Amana** - the name of a mountain near Damascus (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Senir** - the name of a mountain near Amana and Hermon. Some people think that this refers to the same mountain as Hermon. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **dens** - places where lions and leopards live, like caves or holes in the ground
