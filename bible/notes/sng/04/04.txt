===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The man continues to praise the woman.

  * **Your neck is like the tower of David built** - No one knows if this was a real tower. A tower is a tall, slender building, and saying that David built it implies that it was beautiful. The man considered the woman's neck long and slender and so beautiful. AT: "Your neck is long and beautiful" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **of David** - "that David built"
  * **built in rows of stone** - Women had necklaces that covered their entire necks with rows of decorations. The man compares these rows of decorations with the rows of stone on the tower. AT: "that has many rows of stone" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **with a thousand shields** - The man compares the decorations of the woman's necklace with shields hanging on the tower. The necklace probably went around her neck many times. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a thousand shields** - "1,000 shields." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **all the shields of soldiers** - "all of the shields belong to mighty warriors"
  * **two breasts** - If the word "two" seems unnecessary and so out of place, you could omit it.
  * **like two fawns, twins of a gazelle** - The man implies that the woman's breasts are matching, soft, and perhaps small. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **twins** - the babies of a mother who gave birth to two babies at one time
  * **gazelle** - an animal that looks like a deer and moves quickly. Translate as the singular of "gazelles" as in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:02:07|2:7]].
  * **grazing among the lilies** - "eating plants among the lilies." While it is clear that the man "grazing among the lilies" is a metaphor for making love ([[:en:bible:notes:sng:02:16|2:16]]), it is not clear what these words refer to. It is best to translate them literally.
  * **lilies** - sweet-smelling flowers that grow in places where there is much water. Translate as the plural of "lily" in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:02:01|2:1]].
