The lover continues to praise the woman.
  * **neck is like** - AT: "neck is long and beautiful like." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **of David** - "that David built"
  * **built in rows of stone** - Women had necklaces that covered their entire necks with rows of decorations. The lover compares these rows of decorations with the rows of stone on the tower. AT: "that has many rows of stone." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **with a thousand shields...** - The lover compares the decorations of the woman's necklace with shields hanging on the tower. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a thousand shields** - "1,000 shields." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **all the shields of soldiers** - "all of the shields belong to mighty warriors"
  * **like two fawns, twins of a gazelle** - The woman's breasts are beautiful, matching and soft like two baby deer or two baby gazelle. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **twins** - the babies of a mother who gave birth to two babies at one time
  * **gazelle** - See how you translated "gazelles" in [[en:bible:notes:sng:02:07|2:7]].
  * **grazing among the lilies** - "eating plants among the lilies." The beautiful fawns and baby gazelle are even more beautiful when lilies are surrounding them.
