  * [[:en:obe:other:heart]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:bride]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

The lover continues to speak to the woman.
  * **have stolen my heart** - He is saying his affection and love now belong to her. AT: "have captured my love." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **my sister** - The woman is as dear to the lover as his own sister. They are not actually brother and sister. AT: "my dear" or "my darling" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **with just one look at me, with just one jewel of your necklace** - Both the woman's eyes and her jewelry attract her lover to her.
