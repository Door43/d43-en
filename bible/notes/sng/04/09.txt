===== Translation Notes: =====

The lover continues to speak to the woman.
   * **have stolen my heart** - He is saying his affection and love now belong to her. AT: "have captured my love." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
   * **my sister** - The woman is as dear to the lover as his own sister. They are not actually brother and sister. AT: "my dear" or "my darling" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
   * **with one glance of your eyes, with one jewel of your necklace.** - Both the woman's eyes and her jewelry attract her lover to her.
