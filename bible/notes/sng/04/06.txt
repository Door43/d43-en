===== Translation Notes: =====

The lover continues to praise the woman.
  * **Until the dawn arrives and the shadows flee away** - See how you translated the line in [[en:bible:notes:sng:02:16|2:17]] where the wording is the same as this one.
  * **I will go to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense** - The lover expresses his desire to enjoy the woman' breast by comparing them with mountains or hills that he wants to go to. Her breasts are round and protrude like mountains or hills. They smell sweet like myrrh and frankincense. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will go to the mountain ... hill of frankincense.** - These lines repeat the thought in slightly differing ways to emphasize the idea. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **the mountain of myrrh** - "the mountain made of myrrh" or "the mountain that has myrrh on it"
  * **You are beautiful in every way** - "Every part of you is beautiful" or "All of you is beautiful"
  * **my love** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:sng:01:09|1:9]].
  * **there is no blemish in you** - "you have no blemish"
