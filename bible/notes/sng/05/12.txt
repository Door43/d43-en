===== Translation Notes: =====

The young woman continues to describe her beloved.
  * **His eyes are like doves** - See how you translated "your eyes are like doves" in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:01:15|1:15]].
  * **beside streams of water** - The woman might be using this image to say that her beloved's eyes are moist like the streams of water. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **washed in milk** - "washing themselves in milk." The doves represent the beloved's pupils. These are surrounded by the rest of his eyes, which are as white as milk. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **mounted like jewels** - His eyes are so beautiful that they look like jewels that a craftsman has carefully put in place. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
