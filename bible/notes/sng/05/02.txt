\v 2 I was asleep, but my heart was awake in a dream.
\q There is the sound of my beloved knocking and saying,

\q for my head is wet with dew,
\q my hair with the night's dampness."

===== Translation Notes: =====

Here begins Part Four of the book

The young woman uses euphemisms to describe her dream so that it can be interpreted in two different ways: 1) the woman describes a dream about a night when her lover came to visit her at her house; and 2) the woman describes a dream about starting to have sex with her lover. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **but my heart was awake** - AT: "but my mind was awake." AT: "but my feelings were active." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Open to me** -  This refers to opening a door but it can also be interpreted as a sexual request. AT: "Open the door for me" or "Open yourself to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
