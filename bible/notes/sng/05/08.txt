===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I want you to swear** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:02:07|2:7]].
  * **daughters of Jerusalem** - "young women of Jerusalem." These young women could not hear her and were not present, but the woman speaks as if they were present and could hear her. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:02:07|2:7]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
  * **beloved** - Some versions such as the UDB understand this word to refer to the one who loves the woman, but the ULB understands it to refer to the one whom the woman loves. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:01:12|1:13]].
  * **my beloved—What will you make known to him?—that I am** - The woman uses a question to introduce what she wants the daughters of Jerusalem to tell her beloved. AT: "my love, this is what I want you to say to him: tell him that" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **sick from love** - She loves the man so strongly that she feels sick. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
