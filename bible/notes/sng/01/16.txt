===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Listen** - "Listen carefully" or "What I am about to say is important." You could use a word in your language that tells the hearer to listen carefully.
  * **handsome** - Use the word in your language that describes a good-looking man.
  * **beloved** - Some versions such as the UDB understand this word to refer to the one who loves the woman, but the ULB understands it to refer to the one whom the woman loves. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:01:12|1:13]].
  * **The lush plants** - plants that are green, moist, and grow abundantly
  * **are our bed** - "are what we lie down on to sleep"
  * **The beams of our house are cedars; our rafters are firs** - The woman describes the forest as though it were a house in which they were lying down. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **beams ... rafters** - Possible meanings are 1) "beams" refers to large logs used to support everything above the walls and "rafters" refers to the large pieces of wood to which the roof is attached or 2) "beams" refers to the rafters and "rafters" refers to the strips attached to the beams, onto which the builders attached the roofing materials.
  * **cedars ... firs** - Cedars were large and strong trees. The word translated "firs" is a general term for trees like cedars but smaller. If cedar and fir trees are unknown in your area, you could use general terms for the tallest and strongest trees. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
