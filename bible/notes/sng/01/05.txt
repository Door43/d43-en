\q
\v 5 The woman speaking to the other women I am dark but lovely,
\q you daughters of Jerusalem's men—
\q dark like the tents of Kedar,
\q lovely like the curtains of Solomon.
\q
\v 6 Do not stare at me because I am dark,
\q because the sun has scorched me.
\q My mother’s sons were angry with me;
\q they made me keeper of the vineyards,
\q but my own vineyard I have not kept.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * ** I am dark but lovely** - "My skin is dark, but I am still beautiful"
  * **dark like the tents of Kedar** - The nomadic tribes in Kedar used black goat skins to build their homes. The woman is comparing her skin to these tents. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **lovely like the curtains of Solomon** - She compares her skin to the beautiful curtains Solomon produced either for his own palace or for the Temple. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **scorched** - "burned"
  * **My mother’s sons** - "My half-brothers." These brothers probably had the same mother as the woman but not the same father.
  * **keeper of the vineyards** - "the person who took care of the vineyards"
  * **but my own vineyard I have not kept** - The woman compares herself to a vineyard. AT: "but I have not been able to take care of myself." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
