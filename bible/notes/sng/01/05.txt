\q
\v 5 I am dark, but lovely,
\q Oh you daughters of Jerusalem,
\q Dark like the tents of Kedar,
\q Lovely like the curtains of Solomon.
\q
\v 6 Do not stare at me, because I am dark,
\q Because the sun has tanned me.
\q My mother’s sons were angry with me;
\q They made me keeper of the vineyards,
\q But my own vineyard I have not kept.
