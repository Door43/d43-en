  * **How beautiful your feet appear in your sandals** - It is implied by continuing from [[en:bible:notes:sng:06:13|6:13]] that the woman's lover is describing her as she dances. AT: "Your feet are so very beautiful in your sandals as you dance." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **prince's daughter** - Though the woman was not born into a royal family, the way she looks and acts cause her to seem to be the daughter of a prince. AT: "you who have a noble character" or "you who are elegant." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **The curves of your thighs are like jewels** - The shape of the woman's thighs are like a beautiful precious stone which a skilled workman carved into the perfect shape. AT: "The curves of your thighs are beautiful like the beautiful curves of jewel that a skill craftsman made." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **your thighs** - The word "thighs" refers to the hips of a woman and the part of her legs that is above her knee.
