===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The woman continues to speak to the man.

  * **mandrakes** - This is the name of plants that give off a strong but pleasant scent. The scent is slightly intoxicating and stimulating, which increases the desire to make love. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]]) 
  * **give off their fragrance** - "produce their scent" or "smell very nice"
  * **at the door** - The doors belong to their house. AT: "above the entrances of our house" or "by the doors of our house" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **are all sorts of choice fruits, new and old** - "is every kind of the best fruit, both old fruit and new fruit"
  * **stored up for you** - "saved so I can give to you"
  * **beloved** - Some versions such as the UDB understand this word to refer to the one who loves the woman, but the ULB understands it to refer to the one whom the woman loves. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:01:12|1:13]].
