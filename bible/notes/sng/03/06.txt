===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Here begins Part Three of the book. It begins with a description of sixty men carrying Solomon's bed up from the wilderness to Jerusalem.

  * **What is that coming up from the wilderness** - The group of people is traveling from the wilderness to Jerusalem. Because the wilderness is low in the Jordan valley and Jerusalem is high in the mountains, the people must go up in order to reach Jerusalem.
  * **What is that** - Many versions translate this "Who is that."
  * **like a column of smoke** - The dust looked like smoke from far away because the people raised much dust in the air as they traveled. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **perfumed with myrrh and frankincense** - "the sweet-smelling smoke of myrrh and frankincense"
  * **with all the powders sold by merchants** - You may need to supply the words omitted by the ellipsis. AT: "and the sweet-smelling smoke of all the powders that merchants sell" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **powders** - a fine dust made by crushing something solid
  * **Look** - "Listen carefully" or "What I am about to say is important." You could use a word in your language that tells the hearer to listen carefully. The speaker now discovers the answer to the question in verse 6.
  * **it is the bed** - This refers to a bed with a cover that can be carried from one place to another. 
  * **sixty warriors surround it, sixty soldiers of Israel** - These two phrases refer to the same sixty people. The second phrase clarifies that the "warriors" are "soldiers of Israel." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **warriors** - men who fight
