  * [[:en:obe:other:goat]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:gilead]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

The lover continues to praise the woman.
  * **overwhelm me** - "terrify me." The eyes of the woman are so beautiful that it makes the lover feel overwhelmed and afraid because he cannot resist their power.
  * **Your hair...from the slopes of Mount Gilead** - See how you translated "Your hair...from Mount Gilead" in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:04:01|4:1]].
