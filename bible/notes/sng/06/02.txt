===== translationNotes: =====

  * **My beloved has gone down to his garden** - The word "garden" is a metaphor for the woman. The man is finally able to fully enjoy the woman as they make love. See the explanation of this metaphor in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:05:01|5:1]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **beloved** - Some versions such as the UDB understand this word to refer to the one who loves the woman, but the ULB understands it to refer to the one whom the woman loves. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:01:12|1:13]].
  * **beds of spices** - gardens or parts of gardens where people grow spices. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:05:13|5:13]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to graze in the garden and to gather lilies** - These words are metaphors for the man enjoying her body. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **graze** - "feeds" or "eats grass." The woman speaks of the man as if he were "a gazelle or a young stag" ([[:en:bible:notes:sng:02:16|2:17]]) that eats plants among the lilies. Grazing is probably a metaphor for lovemaking ([[:en:bible:notes:sng:02:01|2:1-2]]). See how you translated "he grazes" in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:02:16|2:16]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to gather lilies** - "to pick lilies"
  * **lilies** - sweet-smelling flowers that grow in places where there is much water. Translate as the plural of "lily" in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:02:01|2:1]].
  * **I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine** - See how you translated the similar phrase "My beloved is mine, and I am his" in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:02:16|2:16]].
  * **he grazes among the lilies with pleasure** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:02:16|2:16]].
