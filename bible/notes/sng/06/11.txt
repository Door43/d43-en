===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 I went down to some walnut trees
\q2 to look at the new plants that were growing in the valley.
\q1 I wanted to see if the grapevines had budded
\q2 or if the pomegranate trees were blooming.
\q1
\v 12 But before I realized it,
\q2 my desire \add to make love caused me to be as excited as\add* a prince riding in a chariot.

\q
\v 11 I went down into the grove  of nut trees,
\q To see the young growth of the valley,
\q To see whether the vines had budded,
\q And the pomegranates were in bloom.
\q
\v 12 Before I knew it, my mind placed me
\q Among the chariots of my princely people.
