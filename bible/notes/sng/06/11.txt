====== Song of Solomon 06:11-12 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 I went down to some walnut trees
\q2 to look at the new plants that were growing in the valley.
\q1 I wanted to see if the grapevines had budded
\q2 or if the pomegranate trees were blooming.
\q1
\v 12 But before I realized it,
\q2 my desire \add to make love caused me to be as excited as\add* a prince riding in a chariot.

\q
\v 11 I went down into the grove of nut trees
\q to see the young growth in the valley,
\q to see whether the vines had budded,
\q and whether the pomegranates were in bloom.
\q
\v 12 I was so happy that I felt
\q I was riding in the chariot of a prince.
