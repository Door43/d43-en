===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 I went down to some walnut trees
\q2 to look at the new plants that were growing in the valley.
\q1 I wanted to see if the grapevines had budded
\q2 or if the pomegranate trees were blooming.
\q1
\v 12 But before I realized it,
\q2 my desire \add to make love caused me to be as excited as\add* a prince riding in a chariot.

\q I was riding in the chariot of a prince.
