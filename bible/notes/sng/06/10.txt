===== Translation Notes: =====
What the queens and the concubines said about the young woman. However, some versions think that the woman's lover is speaking in this verse also.

  * **Who is this who appears like the dawn** - They are using this question to say that they think the young woman is amazing. AT: "This is an amazing woman! She comes into view like the dawn." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **she appears like the dawn** - AT: "she comes into view like the dawn." The lover uses this image to say that the woman is as beautiful and as majestic as the dawn when it begins to shine. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **as awe-inspiring as an army with its banners** - The beauty of the woman is so powerful that it makes the other women feel helpless, as if an army were approaching them. See how you translated this expression in [[en:bible:notes:sng:06:04|6:4]].
