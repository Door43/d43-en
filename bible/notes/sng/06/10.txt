===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The ULB understands this to be what the queens and the concubines said about the  woman. However, some versions understand these to be the words of the man.

  * **Who is this who appears like the dawn ... banners?** - They are using this question to say that they think the young woman is amazing. AT: "This is an amazing woman! She comes into view like the dawn ... banners!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **who appears like the dawn** - The dawn is beautiful. The woman is beautiful. AT: "she comes into view like the dawn" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **as awe-inspiring as an army with its banners** - The beauty of the woman is so powerful that it makes the other women feel helpless, as if an army were approaching them. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:06:04|6:4]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
