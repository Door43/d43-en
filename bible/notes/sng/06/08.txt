===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **There are sixty queens, eighty concubines** - "There are 60 queens, 80 concubines." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **young women without number** - The words, "without number" means that no one can count them.  AT: "multitudes of young women" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **My dove, my undefiled** - See how you translated "my dove, my undefiled one" in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:05:02|5:2]].
  * **is the only one** - "is unique" or "is one of a kind." The lover is contrasting the woman with all the other women. Although there are very many excellent women, this woman stands out as unique among the rest.
  * **she is the special daughter of her mother** - "she is her mother's unique daughter" or "she is her mother's daughter that is one of a kind"
  * **the woman who bore her** - "the woman who gave birth to her." This phrase refers to her mother.
  * **and called her blessed** - "and declared that things had gone especially well for her" or "said that she was fortunate"
