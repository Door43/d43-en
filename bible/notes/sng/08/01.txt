===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I wish that you were my brother…despise me. **- In the culture where the lovers lived, it was acceptable for members of the same family to kiss each other outside of the home. Lovers were not permitted to show affection in public. The woman is wishing her lover were her brother so that she can show her affection for him in public without being judged harshly. AT: "If you were my brother, I could kiss you wherever we happen to meet and no one would say I did wrong."
