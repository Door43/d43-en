\v 6 Set me as a seal over your heart,
\q like a seal on your arm,
\q for love is as strong as death.
\q Passionate devotion is as unrelenting as Sheol;
\q its flames burst out; it is a blazing flame,
\q a flame hotter than any other fire.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The young woman continues to speak to the man.

  * **Set me as a seal over your heart, like a seal on your arm** - Possible meanings are 1) because seals were very important, people always kept them around their neck or on their hand. The woman wants to be with the man constantly like a seal, or 2) a seal shows who owns the thing that has the seal on it, and the woman wants herself as the seal on the man's heart and arm to show that all of his thoughts, emotions, and actions belong to her. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **for love is as strong as death** - Death is very strong because it overcomes even the most powerful people of the world. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **as unrelenting as Sheol** - "as tough as Sheol." Sheol never allows people to come back to life after they have already died. Love is as persistent as Sheol because it never changes. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **its flames burst out ... any other fire** - Love is very powerful like fire. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **burst out** - "burn suddenly"
