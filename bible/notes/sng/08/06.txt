===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Set me as a seal over your heart **- The woman is asking the man to use her as a seal over his heart for two reasons. One reason is to preserve their love. Secondly, the seal will prevent another person to enter the man's heart while she is there. (The use of "heart" here is the primary definition found on the Important Terms list: it is used figuratively to describe innermost emotions.) (See: Personification) (See Methaphor)
  * **like a seal on your arm**  - A seal would normally have the special symbol of the person who used the seal. The seal has the identification of the man and woman's love in plain sight on a bracelet where all can see. (See: Simile)
  * **for love is …any other fire **- AT: "Our love for each other is as powerful as death; it is as strong as the grave. It is as though our love for each other bursts into flames and burns like a hot fire." (UDB) (See: Simile) (See: Hyperbole)
