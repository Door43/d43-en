===== Translation Notes: =====

The young woman continues to speak to her lover.
  * **Surging waters cannot quench love** - Love is so strong that it is like a fire that is so hot that it cannot be put out even with an ocean full of water. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Surging waters** - "Oceans of water" or "Huge amounts of water"
  * **cannot quench** - "cannot extinguish" or "cannot put out"
  * **nor can floods sweep it away** - Love never changes and always stays the same so it is like something that not even a powerful flood can move. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **floods** - In Israel, water from the rain flows into deep and narrow valleys. This creates a flood of water so powerful that it can move huge boulders and trees. Even today, floods sometimes sweep away very strong bridges.
  * **sweep it away** - "carry it away" or "wash it away"
  * **If a man gave...the offer would utterly be despised** - "Even if a man...he would be utterly despised." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **all the possessions in his house** - "everything he owns"
  * **for love** - "in order to get love" or "in order to buy love" 
  * **the offer would utterly be despised** - "people would completely despise him" or "people would harshly ridicule him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
