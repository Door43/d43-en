===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The young woman continues to speak to the man.

  * **Surging waters cannot quench love** - Love is so strong that it is like a fire that is so hot that it cannot be put out even with an ocean full of water. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Surging waters** - "Oceans of water" or "Huge amounts of water"
  * **cannot quench** - "cannot extinguish" or "cannot put out"
  * **nor can floods sweep it away** - Love never changes and always stays the same so it is like something that not even a powerful flood can move. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **floods** - In Israel, water from the rain flows into deep and narrow valleys. This creates a flood of water so powerful that it can move huge boulders and trees.
  * **sweep it away** - "carry it away" or "wash it away"
  * **If a man gave ... the offer would utterly be despised** - "Even if a man ... he would be utterly despised." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
