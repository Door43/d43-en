===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **be like a gazelle or a young stag** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:02:16|2:17]].
  * **the mountains of spices** - "the mountains that have spices all over them." The woman uses this imagery to invite her lover to enjoy her. See how the lover uses the imagery of a mountain of myrrh and a hill of frankincense in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:04:06|4:6]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
