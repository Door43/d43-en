===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **​Who is this who is coming…leaning on her beloved?** - The women who are attending the bride are remembering the time when she was a child. Since the time from childhood to adulthood seems to pass quickly, the women are asking who this grown up person is.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **I awakened you under the apricot tree.**  - The woman is saying to the man that she remembers when they began to love each other. She aroused his feelings for her, and she responded to his love. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **​there your mother conceived you** - This was the same place her mother had made love. It seems the man has begun to speak part way through this verse.
  * **there she gave birth to you, she delivered you - **  The woman is emphasizing the wonderful result of beginning new life. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])​
