===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Possible interpretations: 1) The woman contrasts the way she wants to give herself to the man, who will give her his love, to the way Solomon leases out his vineyard to those who will give him money. 2) The man contrasts the woman, whom he will not give to another man, to Solomon's vineyard, which he gave to other men.

  * **Baal Hamon** - This is the name of a town in the northern part of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]). 
  * **gave the vineyard** - leased, agreed to let other people pay him so they could grow grapes in the vineyard
  * **to those who would maintain it** - "to people who would take care of it"
  * **Each one was to bring a thousand shekels of silver for its fruit** - It may be helpful to state that this payment was for the fruit of the vineyard. AT: "Each man was supposed to give Solomon a thousand shekels as payment for the fruit of the vineyard" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **to bring a thousand shekels of silver** - "to bring 1,000 shekels of silver." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bmoney]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **My vineyard, my very own** - The woman refers to herself as a vineyard, as in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:01:05|1:6]]. Here she emphasizes that she and no one else will decide what she dies with the "vineyard." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **is before me** - "is mine to do with as I desire" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **the thousand shekels are for you, Solomon** - The woman knows that Solomon has leased out the vineyard so he can get money, but she does not want money.
  * **shekels** - "coins"
  * **Solomon** - Some versions understand the woman to be speaking directly to Solomon. Others understand her to be speaking in an apostrophe to her friends, to the man, or to herself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
  * **the two hundred shekels** - The speaker has not mentioned these before, but the hearer would understand that she is speaking of the money that those who worked the vineyard would have left for their own after they paid Solomon.
