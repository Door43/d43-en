\v 2 No one would object if I led you to our mother's house,
\q2 to where our mother, who taught me so many things, lives.
\q1 I would like to take you to our mother's house so I could make love to you there.
\q1 That would be as delightful as juice squeezed from pomegranates, as wine mixed with spices.

\q1
\v 3 Oh yes! He will put his left arm under my head,
\q2 and he will hold me close with his right arm.
