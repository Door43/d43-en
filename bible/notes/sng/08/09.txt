===== Translation Notes: =====

The young woman's brothers continue to speak among themselves.
  * **If she is a wall...boards of cedar** - Because her breasts are small, she has a flat chest like a flat wall or a flat door. The brothers decide to give her decorations in order to help their sister look more beautiful. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **will adorn her** - "will decorate her"
