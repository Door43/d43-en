  * **I am just a flower of in a plain** - The woman compares herself with a flower in a plain in order to emphasize that she is a common and delicate girl from the countryside that does not deserve the enormous amount of attention that her lover is giving to her.

  * **a plain** - an area of land that is flat, has no trees, and grows many different kinds of grasses and flowers

  * **a valley** - This refers to a very large flat area between mountains.
  * **As a lily...my countrymen** - The man means that the woman is far more beautiful and precious than all the other young women, just as a lily is far more beautiful and precious than all of the thorn bushes that might surround it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
