  * **a plain** - an area of land that is flat, has no trees, and grows many different kinds of grasses and flowers

  * **a valley** - This refers to a very large flat area between mountains.
  * **As a lily...my countrymen** - The man means that the woman is far more beautiful and precious than all the other young women, just as a lily is far more beautiful and precious than all of the thorn bushes that might surround it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
