===== Translation Notes: =====

The woman's beloved is speaking.
    * **My dove** - The woman's beloved compares the woman with a dove because she has a beautiful face and a beautiful voice like a dove and because he was to be with her in a place that is far away from other people just as doves live in places far away from people.
    * **the clefts of the rock** - "the hiding places of the cliffs." Clefts are large cracks in the side of mountain rocks.
    * **in the secret clefts of the mountain crags** - "in the secret places on the steep mountain sides." This phrase describes the place where the beloved wants to see the face of the woman.
    * **your face** - "your appearance" or "your form" or "what you look like"
