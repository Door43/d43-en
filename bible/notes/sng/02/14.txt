===== Translation Notes: =====

The woman's beloved is speaking.

  * **the clefts of the rock** - "the hiding places of the cliffs." Clefts are large cracks in the side of mountain rocks.
  * **in the secret clefts of the mountain crags** - "in the secret places on the steep mountain sides." This phrase describes the place where the beloved wants to see the face of the woman.
