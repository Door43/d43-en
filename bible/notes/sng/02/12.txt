\v 12 The flowers have appeared in the land;
\q The time for pruning and the singing of birds has come,
\q And the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.

\v 13 The fig tree ripens her green figs,
\q And the vines are in blossom;
\q They give forth their fragrance.
\q Arise, my love, my beautiful one, and come away.
