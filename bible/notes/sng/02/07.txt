===== translationNotes: =====

  * **daughters of Jerusalem** - "young women of Jerusalem." These young women could not hear her and were not present, but the woman speaks as if they were present and could hear her. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
  * **by the gazelles and the does of the fields** - Although the daughters of Jerusalem could not hear her, the woman speaks to them as if they could hear saying that the gazelles and the does will punish them they break their promise. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
  * **the gazelles** - These are animals that look like deer and move quickly.
  * **does** - female deer
  * **of the fields** - "that live in the countryside." This was land that has not been farmed.
  * **will not awaken or arouse love until she pleases** - One possible meaning is that the abstract noun "love" is spoken of as a person who is asleep, and the daughters of Jerusalem are to allow her to sleep until she wants to awaken. This is a metaphor for the man and woman being ready to make love. Another possible meaning is "will not disturb us until we have finished making love." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **will not awaken or arouse** - If your language has only one word for waking people out of sleep, you could combine these words. AT: "will not awaken" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
