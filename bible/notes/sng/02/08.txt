===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Here begins Part Two of the book.

  * **General Information:** - It is not clear whether the woman is speaking to herself or to the daughters of Jerusalem.

  * **Listen** - Possible meanings are 1) "Listen carefully to what I am about to say." You could use a word in your language that tells the hearer to listen carefully, or 2) "Listen so you can hear him coming."
  * **beloved** - Some versions such as the UDB understand this word to refer to the one who loves the woman, but the ULB understands it to refer to the one whom the woman loves. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:01:12|1:13]].
  * **leaping ... jumping ... gazing ... peering** - The woman shows that she is excited to see the man come by using as few words as possible to describe what he is doing. Your language may have a different way of showing that the speaker is excited about what is happening.
  * **leaping over the mountains, jumping over the hills** - "leaping on the mountains, running quickly on the hills." The woman speaks of the man as if he were "a gazelle or a young stag" (verse 9) coming quickly toward her over rough ground. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **like a gazelle or a young stag** - Gazelles and young stags move quickly over rough ground. The woman imagines the man coming as fast as he can to be with her. You could translate using animals in your language that people think of as fast. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **a gazelle** - animals that look like deer and move quickly. Translate as the singular of "the gazelles" as in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:02:07|2:7]].
  * **a young stag** - "a young male deer" 
  * **look** - "listen carefully" or "what I am about to say is important" You could use a word in your language that tells the hearer to listen carefully.
  * **behind our wall** - "on the other side of our wall." The woman is in a house and the man is outside the house.
  * **our wall** - The word "our" refers to the woman and the other people in the house with her. If she is speaking to herself, it is inclusive, but if to the daughters of Jerusalem, whether she is referring to herself and her companions or to herself only, it is exclusive. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **gazing through the window** - "he stares in through the windows"
  * **peering through the lattice** - "he peeks through the lattice"
  * **lattice** - a cover for a window or some other entrance that someone has made by weaving long strips of wood together. Lattices have holes that people can look through.
