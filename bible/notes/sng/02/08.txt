Here begins Part Two of the book

  * **Oh, here he comes** - The word “Oh” here adds emphasis to what follows. AT: “Indeed”
  * **leaping over the mountains,
jumping over the hills** - "leaping on the mountains, running quickly on the hills." The beloved runs quickly and gracefully like a gazelle, even over the rough terrain of the mountains and the hills.
  * **like a gazelle or a young stag** - The woman compares her beloved with a gazelle and a young buck because he is fast, beautiful, and graceful like these animals. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **a gazelle** - See how you translated "the gazelles" in [[en:bible:notes:sng:08:02|2:9]].
  * **a young stag** - "a young buck" or "a young male deer" 
  * **look, he is standing** - The word “look” here shows that the woman saw something interesting.
  * **behind our wall** - "on the other side of our wall." The woman is in a house and her beloved is outside the house.
  * **our wall** - The word "our" refers to the woman and the other people in the house with her.
  * **gazing through the window** - "he stares in through the windows"
  * **peering through the lattice** - "he peeks through the lattice"
  * **lattice** - long strips of wood that someone has woven together in order to create a cover for a window or some other entrance
