\v 3 Among all the other men, this man is the one who loves me; he is like a tree that grows in the forest.
\q2 Under his shade I am safe from the sun.
\q1 When he is close to me, it is like eating sweet fruit.
\q1
\v 4 He led me to the room where I feasted on his love,
\q2 where he made love to him, as if he were covering me with his love.

\q
\v 3 As the apricot tree is among the trees of the forest,
\q so is my beloved among the young men.
\q I sit down under his shadow with great delight,
\q and his fruit is sweet to my taste.
\q
\v 4 He brought me to the banqueting hall,
\q and his banner over me was love.
