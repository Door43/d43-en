\v 15 The nations' idols are silver and gold,
\q the work of men's hands.
\q
\v 16 Those idols have mouths, but they do not speak;
\q they have eyes, but they do not see;
\q
\v 17 they have ears, but they do not hear,
\q nor is there breath in their mouths.
\q
\v 18 Those who make them are like them,
\q as is everyone who trusts in them.

===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **The nations' idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands** - The people who do not obey God make statues to worship out of gold or silver.
  * **those idols have mouths, but they do not speak**- while the physical representation of their idols have a mouth, the figure is unable to use that mouth because the false god they represent do not have any power 
  * **are like them**- AT: "are completely useless" or "are completely powerless" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
