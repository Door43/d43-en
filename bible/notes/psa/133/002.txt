\q2 that ran down from the high priest Aaron's head onto his beard when Moses anointed him,

\v 3 Gathering together in peace is as delightful as the dew that falls on Mount Hermon

\q
\v 2 It is like the precious oil on the head
\q that flowed down the beard,
\q Aaronâ€™s beard,
\q that flowed down his garments.
\q
\v 3 It like the dew of Hermon,
\q which comes down upon the mountains of Zion.
\q For there Yahweh decreed the blessing,
\q life forevermore.
