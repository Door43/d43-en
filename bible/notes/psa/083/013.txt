    * **like the fire that burns the forest, and like the flame that sets the mountain on fire.**  - Both statements compare God's enemies to things that can be burned away by forest fires and these combine for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **Chase them with your strong wind, and terrify them with your windstorm.** - Both statements ask God to destroy the enemies with storms and these combine for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
