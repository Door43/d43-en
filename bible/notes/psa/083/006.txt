===== Translation Notes: =====

The writer continues to list the people groups who want to destroy Israel.

  * **the tents of Edom** - Tents were their homes so this means the people who lived there. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Hagrites, Gebal** - See how you translate names: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]].)
