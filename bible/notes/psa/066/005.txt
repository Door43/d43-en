\q
\v 5 Come and see the works of God;
\q he is fearsome in his deeds toward the children of men.
\q
\v 6 He turned the sea into dry land;
\q they went through the river on foot;
\q there we rejoiced in him.
\q
\v 7 He rules forever by his might;
\q his eyes observe the nations;
\q let not the rebellious exalt themselves.
