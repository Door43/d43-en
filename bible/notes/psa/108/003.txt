===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For your covenant faithfulness is great ... your trustworthiness reaches to the skies** - These two phrases have similar meanings. They compare the greatness of Yahweh's covenant faithfulness and trustworthiness to the greatness of how high the heavens are above the earth. The abstract nouns "faithfulness" and "trustworthiness" can be translated as adjectives. AT: "For your covenant faithfulness and trustworthiness are greater than the distance between heaven and earth" or "For you are faithful to your covenant ... you are worthy of people trusting you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
