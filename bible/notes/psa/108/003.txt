===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For your covenant faithfulness is great ... your trustworthiness reaches to the skies** - These two phrases have similar meanings. They compare the greatness of Yahweh's covenant faithfulness and trustworthiness to the greatness of how high the heavens are above the earth. AT: "your covenant faithfulness and trustworthiness is as greater that the distance between heaven and earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
