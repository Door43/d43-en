  * **You do not go into battle with our army** - The psalmist speaks of God helping their army as if God were to go and fight with them. AT: "you do not help our army when we go into battle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **futile** - "worthless" 
  * **triumph** - "have victory"
  * **he will trample down our enemies** - The psalmist speaks of God helping their army defeat their enemies as if God were to trample down the enemies.
