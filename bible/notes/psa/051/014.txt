===== translationNotes: =====

  * **shedding blood** - This phrase refers to killing another person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will express your praise** - Here the person is represented by his "mouth." Being able to talk is spoken of as the lips being open. Here not being able to speak is a symbol of being guilty of sin and not being able to make a defense. AT: "Lord, make me able to speak, and I will praise you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **you do not delight in sacrifice ... you have no pleasure in burnt offerings** - This means that God wants something more important than these things. AT: "A sacrifice is not enough to please you ... you want something more than burn offerings" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
