===== translationNotes: =====

  * **At the time of your anger** - "When you appear in your anger"
  * **your anger ... You will destroy** - Possible meaning for all occurrences of "your" and "you" are 1) they refer to God or 2) they refer to the king.
  * **you will burn them up as in a fiery furnace** - Yahweh or the king destroying their enemies is spoken of as if their enemies are wood and Yahweh or the king will throw them into  furnace. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Yahweh will consume them in his wrath, and the fire will devour them** - Both clauses mean basically the same thing. Yahweh completely destroying his enemies is spoken of as if his wrath is a fire that completely burns up his enemies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **from the earth ... from among the human race** - Both phrases mean the same thing. They emphasize that absolutely none of their enemies will survive. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
