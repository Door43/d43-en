  * **through the covenant faithfulness of the Most High** - "because the Most High is faithful to his covenant"

  * **Your hand will seize** - Here "hand" stands for power. AT: "Your power will seize" or "You will powerfully seize" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Your hand ... hate you** - Possible meaning of all occurrences of "your" and "you" are 1) they refer to the king or 2) they refer to God. 
  * **your right hand will seize those who hate you** - This means the same thing as the first part of the sentence. It emphasizes that God will give the king the power to stop his enemies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
