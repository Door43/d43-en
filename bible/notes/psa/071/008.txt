===== translationNotes: =====

  * **My mouth will be filled with your praise ... with your honor** - The psalmist speaks of his desire to praise and honor Yahweh with the words he speaks as if his mouth were full of words the way it can be full of food. AT: "My mouth will be filled with words that praise you ... that honor you" or "I will always praise you ... will always honor you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **your praise** - "words that tell people how great you are" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **your honor** - "words that cause people to honor you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **all the day** - "all day long" or "at all times"
  * **Do not throw me away ... do not abandon me** - These two phrases have basically the same meaning and are used together for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Do not throw me away** - "Do not force me to go away from you." For God to reject him is spoken of as God forcing him to go away. AT: "do not reject me" See how this is translated in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:051:010|51:11]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **do not abandon me** - "do not leave me forever"
