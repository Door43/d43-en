===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **HETH: **  This is the eighth letter of the Hebrew alphabet. In the Hebrew language, each line of verses 57-64 begins with this letter.
  * **Yahweh is my portion **  - This means Yahweh is all he wants. This refers to the division of the land of Canaan. The Levites did not receive vast territories as the other tribes did. The Lord was their portion.
