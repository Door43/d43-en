  * **I will never forget** - This can be stated in positive form. AT: "I will always remember" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **for through them you have kept me alive** - It is implied that the writer obeys God's instructions. AT: "for you have kept me alive because I obey them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **for I seek your instructions** - Trying hard to obey God's instructions is spoken of as if instructions were an object for which a person must search. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
