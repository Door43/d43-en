  * **Do not take the word of truth from my mouth** - Here the writer is represented by his "mouth." AT: "Never prevent me from speaking your truth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **for I have waited for your righteous decrees** - "waiting" has the concept of trusting, having confidence that God will do as he decrees. 
  * **I will observe** - "I will obey"
