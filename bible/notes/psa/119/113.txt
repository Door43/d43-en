===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **SAMEKH:**  This is the fifteenth letter of the Hebrew alphabet. In the Hebrew language, each line of verses 113-120 begins with this letter.
  * **who have a double mind**  - These people are not sincere. They are not wholly committed to following God. AT: "who cannot make up their mind about following God" or "who are insincere" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **my hiding place**  - This means God is like a place where we can hide from our enemies, where we are safe and protected. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **my shield**  - AT: "my protector"
  * **your word**  - AT: "your instruction"
