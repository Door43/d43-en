===== Translation Notes: =====

Most of this psalm is addressed to God, and the words "you" and "your" almost always refer to him.

  * **they walk in his ways** - "they walk in Yahweh's ways." Their behavior is spoken of as walking, and the way God wants us to behave is spoken of as his ways. AT: "they behave as Yahweh wants them to" (UDB)
  * **keep your instructions**  - "obey all the things that you have declared that we should do"
