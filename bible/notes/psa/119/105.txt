===== translationNotes: =====

  * **NUN** - This is the name of the fourteenth letter of the Hebrew alphabet. In the Hebrew language, each line of verses 105-112 begins with this letter.
  * **Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path** - These two phrases have the same meaning. This speaks about God telling a person how to live as if the person were walking on a path and God's words were a light that helps the person see where to go. AT: "Your words tell me how to live my life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Your word** - Here "word" represents all that God communicates to people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
