  * **recede** - "retreat" or "move back"
  * **Your rebuke made the waters ... at the sound of your thunderous voice ...** - These two phrases have basically the same meaning and are used together to emphasize how God spoke and the waters went away. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
