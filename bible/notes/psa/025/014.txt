===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The friendship of Yahweh is for those** - "Yahweh is a friend to those." Some translate it as "Yahweh confides in those." His confiding in them shows the intimate friendship he has with them.
  * **My eyes are always on Yahweh** - Here "eyes" represents looking. Looking to Yahweh is a way of saying he is asking Yahweh for help. AT: "I always look to Yahweh" or "I always ask Yahweh to help me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **for he will free my feet from the net** - A net is a trap. A person who is in danger is spoken of as if their feet are tangled in a net. AT: He will rescue me from danger" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Turn toward me** - Yahweh paying attention to a person and considering him is spoken of as if Yahweh were physically turning towards the person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
