===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The friendship of Yahweh is for those** -  "Yahweh is a friend to those." Some translate it as "Yahweh confides in those." His confiding in them shows the intimate friendship he has with them.
  * **My eyes are always on Yahweh** - AT: "I always look to Yahweh." Looking to Yahweh implies asking him for help. (See: UDB and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **for he will free my feet from the net** - A net is a trap. Here it represents danger. AT: He will rescue me from danger" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
