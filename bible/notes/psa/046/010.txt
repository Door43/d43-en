===== Translation Notes: =====

   * **I will be exalted among the nations; I will be exalted on the earth** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and are used together to emphasize that God will be exalted everywhere. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
   * **God of Jacob is our refuge** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:psa:046:006|46:7]].
