===== translationNotes: =====

  * **set me free** - The writer speaks of Yahweh saving him from distress as if Yahweh had taken him from a place of confinement to a wide open space where he could move about freely. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **what can man do to me?** - The writer asks this rhetorical question to emphasize that there is nothing that man can do to hurt him since Yahweh is with him. AT: "people cannot do anything to harm me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Yahweh is on my side as my helper** - To be on one's side is an idiomatic expression that indicates that that person approves of and will help another. AT: "Yahweh approves of me and will help me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **I will look in triumph on those who hate me** - It is implied that Yahweh is the one who will defeat the writer's enemies, while the writer looks on. AT: "I will see Yahweh defeating all those who hate me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
