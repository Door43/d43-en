===== translationNotes: =====

  * **All the nations** - Here the word "nations" represents the armies of those nations. The writer uses hyperbole to emphasize the great number of armies that surrounded him. AT: "The armies of many nations" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **in Yahweh's name** - Here the word "name" represents Yahweh's power. AT: "by Yahweh's power" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I cut them off** - The writer speaks of defeating the enemy armies as if he were cutting them off like a person would cut a branch off of a plant. AT: "I defeated them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **They surrounded me like bees** - The writer compares the enemy armies to a swarm of bees. AT: "They surrounded me like a swarm of bees would surround a person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **they disappeared as quickly as fire among thorns** - Just like dry thorns burn out quickly, the attack of the enemy armies was quickly over. AT: "I defeated them quickly, as a fire that consumes thorns quickly dies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
