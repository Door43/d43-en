===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone** - This is likely a proverb that the writer has used as a metaphor to describe either the king or the nation of Israel. That which others have considered worthless, Yahweh has made to be the most important. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_proverbs]])
  * **it is marvelous in our eyes** - Possible meanings are 1) "it is a marvelous thing for us to see" or 2) "we consider it to be a marvelous thing." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
