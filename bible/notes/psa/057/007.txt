===== translationNotes: =====

  * **My heart is fixed, God, my heart is fixed** - Being confident is spoken of as one's heart being firm rather than shaken or easily moved. The phrase is repeated to show that he has complete confidence in God and will not change. AT: "I am completely confident in you, God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I will sing praises** - Who he will sing to can be stated clearly. AT: "I will sing praises to you, God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

  * **wake up, lute and harp** - It can be  stated clearly that the purpose of waking up is to sing praises to God.

  * **I will wake up the dawn** - The dawn is spoken of as if it were alive, and getting up before dawn happens is spoken of as waking it up. The purpose of getting up before dawn is to praise God.
