===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **My life is among lions** - Here "lions" refers to enemies who are as dangerous as lions. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **those who are ready to devour me** - Some versions understand the Hebrew text as, "fiery beasts." This still compares his enemies to wild beasts. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **whose teeth are spears and arrows, and whose tongues are sharp swords** - These two phrases have basically the same meaning and emphasize the destructive nature of what people say. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **whose teeth are spears and arrows** - AT: "whose words cut people like spears," or "who hurt people by what they say" (See:[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **spears and arrows** - Since both of these terms are weapons, if your culture knows only one, it is acceptable to use it alone. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **whose tongues are sharp swords** - AT: "who injure people by what they say" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
