\v 4 Sometimes I am surrounded by my enemies,  who are as ready to kill me as lions are to kill people;

\q2 they say false things about me.

\q
\v 4 My life is among lions;

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **those who are ready to devour me** - Some versions understand the Hebrew text as, "fiery beasts."
  * **whose teeth are spears and arrows, and whose tongues are sharp swords** - These two phrases have basically the same meaning and are used together for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **whose teeth are spears and arrows** - AT: "whose words cut people like spears," or "who hurt people by what they say" (See:[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **spears and arrows** - Since both of these terms are weapons, if only one is known in your culture it is acceptable to use it alone. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **whose tongues are sharp swords** - AT: "who injure people by what they say" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
