===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **For Yahweh will not forsake his people or abandon his inheritance.**  - Here "inheritance" refers to his people. AT: "Yahweh will not leave or forget his promise to his people." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **Who will rise up to defend me against the evildoers? Who will stand up for me against the wicked?** - These questions are used to express a need for help; they share similar meanings and are repeated for emphasis. AT: "No one will defend me against evil people. No one will help me fight against wicked people." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
