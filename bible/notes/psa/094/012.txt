===== Translation Notes: =====
Now the Psalmist again talks to Yahweh.

  * **Blessed is the one whom you instruct, Yahweh, the one whom you teach from your law** - These phrases share similar meanings and are combined for emphasis. AT: "Blessed is the person that you instruct and teach from your law, Yahweh." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **until a pit is dug for the wicked** - Here "pit" represents a trap for catching and punishing the wicked. AT: "until you destroy the wicked" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
