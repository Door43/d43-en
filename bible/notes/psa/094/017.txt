===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Unless Yahweh had been my help ... silence** - This is a hypothetical situation. Yahweh did help him, so he was not lying in the place of silence. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **Unless Yahweh had been my help** - The abstract noun "help" can be expressed as a verb. AT: "If Yahweh had not helped me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]]) 
  * **I would soon be lying down in the place of silence** - Here "would be lying down" refers to "death" and "in the place of silence" refers to the grave." AT: "in a short time, I would be dead, lying in a silent grave" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **Your covenant faithfulness, Yahweh, held me up** - The abstract noun "faithfulness" can be translated with an adjective. AT: "You, Yahweh, held me up because you are faithful to your covenant" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **When cares within me are many, your consolations make me happy** - The psalmist speaks of care as if he could count separate cares. The abstract noun "consolations" can be translated with the verb "console" or "comfort." AT: "When I have been worried about many things, you have comforted me and made me happy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
