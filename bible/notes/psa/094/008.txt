===== Translation Notes: =====
The Psalmist now instructs the wicked people.

    * **when will you ever learn?**  - This question stresses how important it is to understand and learn. AT: "stop your foolish ways" or "learn from your mistakes" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **He who made the ear, does he not hear? He who formed the eye, does he not see?**  - These questions are asked to emphasize a point. AT: "God made ears, so he hears everything. God made eyes, so he sees everything." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
