===== Translation Notes: =====
The Psalmist continues instructing the wicked people.

    * **does he not correct?**  - This question emphasizes a point, and it is implied that it refers to his people. AT: "he will correct his people" or "he will punish his people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
