===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Parallelism is common in Hebrew poetry. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **song of ascents** - Possible meanings are 1) "song people sang while going up to Jerusalem for a celebration" or 2) "song people sang while going up the steps into the temple" or 3) "song whose words are like steps." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:120:001|120:1]]
  * **If Yahweh had not been on our side ... then they would have swallowed us up alive** - This is a hypothetical statement that describes a result that did not happen, because Yahweh was actually on their side.  AT: "Yahweh was on our side ... so they were not able to swallow us up alive" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **If Yahweh had not been on our side ... if it had not been Yahweh who was on our side** - These two phrases mean the same thing. AT: "Without Yahweh's help ... without Yahweh's help" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **swallowed us up alive** - This metaphor describes how the Israelites could have died to how a fierce animal would attack a smaller animal to eat. AT: "killed us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **their anger raged against us** - Here "their anger" refers to the enemies who were angry. AT: "they were very angry with us!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
