===== translationNotes: =====

  * **You formed my inner parts** - "Inner parts" refers to the interior organs of a person, but here the expression probably stands for the entire body. AT: "You made my entire body (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]]) 
  * **My soul knows this very well** - Here "soul" probably refers to the psalmist's innermost ability to be certain about God's love and guidance. The translator may, however, treat "soul" here as metonymy for the psalmist's mind and heart. AT: "I know this with all my heart" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
