===== translationNotes: =====

  * **If I fly away on the wings of the morning and go to live in the uttermost parts across the sea** - The author uses exaggeration to explain that wherever he is, God is there too. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **If I fly away on the wings of the morning** - In the ancient near east, the sun was often imagined as if it had wings which enabled it to fly across the sky. AT: "If the sun could carry me with itself across the sky" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in the uttermost parts across the sea** - "very far away to the west"
  * **will hold on to me** - "will help me"
