====== Psalms 139:15-16 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 When my body was being formed,
\q1 while it was being put together where no one else could see it,
\q2 you saw it!
\q1
\v 16 You saw me before I was born.
\q1 You wrote in your book the number of days that you had decided that I would live.
\q2 You did that before any of those days had even started!

\q
\v 15 My body was not hidden from you
\q when I was made in private,
\q when I was intricately made in the depths of the earth.
\q
\v 16 You saw me inside the womb;
\q all the days ordained for me were recorded
\q in your book even before the first one happened.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **intricately made** - AT: "made with great complexity"
  * **the depths of the earth** - likely a reference to the mother's womb (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **all the days ordained for me were recorded in your book before the first one happened** - AT: "the number of days of my life were known before I was born."
