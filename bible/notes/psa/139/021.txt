===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Do I not hate those, Yahweh, who hate you?** - AT: "I hate those who hate you" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Do I not hate those, Yahweh, who hate you? Do I not despise those who rise up against you?** - These two sentences have similar meanings. The second one strengthens the thought in the first. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **raise up** - (See: [[en:obe:kt:raise]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
