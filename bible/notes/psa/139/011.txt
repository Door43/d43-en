\q1 For you, the night is \add as bright\add* as the daytime is,

<usfm>
\q
\v 11 If I say, "Surely the darkness will hide me,
\q and the night will be my light;"
\q
\v 12 even the darkness will not hide from you.
\q The night shines like the day,
\q for the darkness and the light are both alike to you.
