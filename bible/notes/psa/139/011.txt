\v 11 I could request the darkness to hide me,
\q1 or I could request the light around me to become darkness,
\q1
\v 12 but even \add if that happened\add*, the darkness would not be darkness for you!
\q1 For you, the night is \add as bright\add* as the daytime is,
\q2 because for you, daylight and darkness are not different\f + \ft Or: the same \f*.

<usfm>
\q
\v 11 If I say, "Surely the darkness will hide me,
\q and the light will become night around me,"
\q
\v 12 even the darkness will not hide from you.
\q The night will shine like the day,
\q for the darkness and the light are both alike to you.
