===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Where can I go from your Spirit? ... Where can I flee from your presence?** - These two questions are in parallel. The psalmist says that he cannot go away from God's presence. AT: "I cannot escape from your Spirit." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and  [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **if I make my bed in sheol** - "Making one's bed" refers to staying somewhere. AT: "even if I stay in sheol" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
