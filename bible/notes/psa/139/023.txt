===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Examine me ** - This is a request. AT: "Please search me" or "I beg you to search me" 
  * **Examine me, God, and know my heart; test me and know my thoughts.** - These two sentences have similar meanings. The second one strengthens the thought in the first. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **the way everlasting** - AT: "God's way" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
