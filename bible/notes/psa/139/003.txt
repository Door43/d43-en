<usfm>
\q
\v 3 You observe my path and when I lie down;
\q you are familiar with all my ways.
\q
\v 4 For there is not a word I speak
\q that you do not know completely, Yahweh.
\q
\v 5 Behind and before you surround me
\q and rest your hand upon me.
\q
\v 6 Such knowledge is too much for me;
\q it is too high, and I cannot understand it.
