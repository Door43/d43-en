===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 3 You observe my path and my lying down;
\q you are familiar with all my ways.
\q
\v 4 For before there is a word on my tongue,
\q you know it completely, Yahweh.
\q
\v 5 Behind me and before me you surround me
\q and place your hand upon me. 
\q
\v 6 Such knowledge is too much for me;
\q it is too high, and I cannot reach it.
