===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Lift up your heads, you gates; be lifted up, everlasting doors** - The two phases are very similar in meaning. The words "gates" and "doors" refer to the gates of the temple. The writer is speaking to the gates as if they were a person. A gatekeeper would be the one to open the gates. AT: "Open up, you ancient gates" or "Open these ancient gates." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:024:007|24:7]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **Lift up your heads** - It is uncertain what specific part of the gate is the "head." But, it stands for the gate as a whole. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Selah** - This may be a musical term that tells people how to sing or play their instruments here. Some translations write the Hebrew word, and some translations do not include it. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:003:001|3:2]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_transliterate]])
