===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He will receive a blessing from Yahweh** - The word "he" does not refer to a specific person. It refers to the ones with pure hearts mentioned in previous verse. The abstract noun "blessing" can be stated as a verb. AT: "Yahweh will bless them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_genericnoun]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **and righteousness from the God of his salvation** - The abstract noun "righteousness" can be stated as "righteously." And, "salvation" can be stated as "save." AT: "and God will deal righteously with him and save him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Such is the generation of those who seek him** - Here "generation" represents people in general. AT: "The people who seek him are like this" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **those who seek him, those who seek the face of the God of Jacob** - Both statements mean the same thing. They both refer to those who go to the temple to worship God. AT: "the ones who approach God, they are the ones who may worship God, the one we Israelites worship" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **those who seek him** - Going to the temple to worship Yahweh is spoken of as if the person is literally seeking to find him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the face of the God of Jacob** - Here "face" stands for the whole person. AT: "the God of Jacob" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
