===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Lift up your heads, you gates; be lifted up, everlasting doors** - The two phases are very similar in meaning. The words "gates" and "doors" refer to the gates of the temple. AT: "Open up, you ancient gates"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
