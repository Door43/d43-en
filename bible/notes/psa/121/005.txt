===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Yahweh is the shade at your right hand** - Here "shade" refers to protection. AT: "God is beside you to protect you from things that would hurt you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **at your right hand** - Here this expression means to be beside or near to the writer. 
  * **The sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon by night** - The contrasting terms "day" and "night" refer to those extremes and everything in between. AT: "God protects you from the elements at all times" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **nor the moon by night** - It is implies that "will not harm you" is implied here. AT: "nor will the moon harm you by night" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
