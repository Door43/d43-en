===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **from all evil** - AT: "from all evil things" or "from being harmed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Yahweh will protect you from all harm, and he will protect your life** - These two clauses have similar meanings. The second one strengthens the thought in the first. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
