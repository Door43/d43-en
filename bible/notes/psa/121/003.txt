===== Translation Notes: =====


 The speaker now begins speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **He will not allow your foot to slip** - AT: "God will not allow you. Israel, to fail" or "God will protect you, Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he who protects you will not slumber. See, the guardian of Israel never slumbers or sleeps** - These two sentences have similar meanings. The second one strengthens the thought in the first. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) 
  * **he who protects you will not slumber** - AT: "God will always protect you" or "God will not stop protecting you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **See** - This word strengthens the following sentence. It does not mean to do anything with your eyes. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **the guardian of Israel** - This is another reference to God being the protector of Israel.
  * **slumbers or sleeps** - These two words mean the same thing and emphasize that Yahweh never stops protecting his people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
