  * **Let the peoples praise you ... let all the peoples praise you** - The second clause intensifies the meaning of the first to emphasize the importance of praising God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) 
  * **let the nations ... govern the nations** - Here "nations" represents the people who live in all the nations on the earth. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]]) 
  * **with justice** - "fairly" or "justly"
