===== translationWords: =====

  * [[:en:obe:kt:harvest]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:god]]
 
===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Let the peoples praise you ... let all the peoples praise you** - The second clause intensifies the meaning of the first to emphasize how important it is to praise God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) 
  * **The earth has yielded its harvest** - Here the writer speaks of "the earth" as if it has chosen to provide a harvest to the people. AT: "We have reaped a bountiful harvest from our crops" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
