===== translationNotes: =====

  * **my days pass away like smoke** - Here "my days" refers to the author's life and the idea of "smoke" is something that quickly disappears. AT: "my life passes away quickly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **my bones burn like fire** - Here the author refers to his "body" as his "bones." AT: "my body feels like it is burning" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **My heart is crushed** - Here the author refers to himself as his "heart." This can be stated in active form. AT: "I am in despair" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **I am like grass that has withered** - This is another way to describe his despair. AT: "I feel like I am drying up like withered grass" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
