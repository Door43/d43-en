<usfm>
\q
\v 25 In ancient times you set the earth in place;
\q the heavens are the work of your hands.
\q
\v 26 They will perish, but you will remain;
\q they will all grow old like a garment;
\q like clothing, you will remove them, and they will disappear.
\q
\v 27 But you are the same,
\q and your years will have no end.
