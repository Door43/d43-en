===== translationNotes: =====

  * **for my hopes are set on him** - "for I place my hope in him"
  * **He alone is my rock and my salvation; he is my high tower** - The writer speaks of God as if he were a rock and a high tower. Both of these metaphors show how God provides protection from one's enemies. Here "salvation" means that God rescues the writer. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:062:001|62:2]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will not be moved** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "nothing can move me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
