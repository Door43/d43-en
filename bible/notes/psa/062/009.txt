\q
\v 9 Surely men of low standing are vanity, and men of high standing are a lie;
\q In the balances they will be light;
\q Weighted together, they are lighter than nothing.
\q
\v 10 Do not trust in oppression or robbery;
\q And do not hope uselessly in riches,
\q For they will bear no fruit; do not fix your heart on them.
