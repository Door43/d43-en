<usfm>
\q
\v 9 Surely men of low standing are vanity, and men of high standing are a lie;
\q they will weigh lightly in the scales;
\q weighed together, they are lighter than nothing.
\q
\v 10 Do not trust in oppression or robbery;
\q and do not hope uselessly in riches,
\q for they will bear no fruit; do not fix your heart on them.

===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **men of low standing ... men of high standing ...** - This refers to men of all levels of wealth. The phrases "are vanity" and "are a lie" have the same meaning. AT: "men that are poor are vanity, and men that are rich are a lie" or "all men, both low and high, are a lie" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **... are vanity ... are a lie ...**- This means that you can not rely on them or put your trust in them. AT: "... are unreliable ... are untrustworthy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **oppression or robbery** - These two words have basically the same meaning. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **for they will ... on them** - The words "they" and "them" refer to "riches".
