===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **escape doing iniquity** - "escape with the wicked things they have done"
  * **Bring down** - "cast down" or "defeat"
  * **You number my wanderings** - This means God knows how often the psalm writer has walked in sadness and with no place to go for comfort.
  * **and put my tears into your bottle** - "and you keep all of my tears." This means that God knows how much the psalm writer has cried. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **are they not in your book?** - This question is not asked to receive an answer. AT: "my wanderings and tears are written in your book" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
