\v 7 All who hate me whisper together against me;
\q Against me they hope for my hurt.

\v 8 An evil disease, they say, holds tightly to him;
\q And now that he is lying down, he will rise up no more.
\q
\v 9 Yea, my own close friend, in whom I trusted,
\q Who ate my bread,
\q Has lifted up his heel against me.
