===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But you, Yahweh, have mercy on me and raise me up** - This is a request. AT: "Please, Yahweh, have mercy on me and raised me up"
  * **raise me up** - "make me well"
  * **so that I may pay them back** - "so that I may pay back my enemies" or "so that I may harm my enemies as they have harmed me"
  * **By this I know that you delight in me, for my enemy does not triumph over me** - "And because my enemy does not triumph over me, I know that you delight in me." This can also be translated in future tense, since has not yet been healed. AT: "If you enable me to do that, with the result that my enemies do not defeat me, I will know that you are pleased with me" (UDB)
  * **you delight in me** - "you are pleased with me" (UDB)
  * **you support me in my integrity** - "you support me because of my integrity"
  * **will keep me before your face** - Here "face" refers to God's presence. AT: "will let me be with you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
