===== translationNotes: =====

  * **his name perish** - If a person's name dies, it means that people forget that he had ever lived. AT: "when will his name perish" or "when will people forget about him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **If my enemy comes to see me** - The words "my enemy" refers to any enemy in general, and not to one specific enemy.
  * **he says worthless things** - Possible meanings are 1) "he says meaningless things" or 2) his enemies say things to make him think that they are his friends when they are not. AT: "he says deceitful things" or "they pretend to be concerned about me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **his heart gathers up my disaster for itself** - His enemies try to learn all of the bad things about him. Here the word "heart" refers the whole person. Bad circumstances are spoken of as if they were objects that can be gathered. AT: "he tries to learn about all of my disasters" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
