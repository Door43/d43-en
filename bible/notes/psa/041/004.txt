  * **his name perish**  - If a person's name dies, it means that people forget that he had ever lived. AT: "when will his name perish" or "when will people forget about him" (See [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis|Ellipsis]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom|Idiom]])
  * **he says worthless things**  - AT: "they pretend to be concerned about me" (UDB) Note that the ULB uses a singular pronoun meaning one enemy. The UDB uses a plural pronoun referring to any of his enemies.
  * **his heart gathers up my disaster for itself**  - AT: "he eagerly listens to all the bad news about me" (UDB)
