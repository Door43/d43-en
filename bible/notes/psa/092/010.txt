===== translationNotes: =====

  * **You have lifted up my horn like the horn of the wild ox** - The psalmist speaks God as if God had made him as strong as a wild animal. AT: "You have made me as strong as a wild ox" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **lifted up ... horn** - "made me strong." See how "lift up ... horn" is translated in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:075:004|75:4-6]].
  * **I am anointed with fresh oil** - Possible meanings are that the oil that God has put on the psalmist is a metaphor for God 1) making him happy "you have made me very happy" or 2) making him strong, "you have made me strong" or 3) enabling him to defeat his enemies, "you have enabled me to defeat my enemies." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **My eyes have seen the downfall of my enemies; my ears have heard of the doom of my evil foes** - The words "eyes" and "ears" are synecdoches for the person who sees and hears. The lines may be combined. AT: "I have seen and heard of the defeat of my evil enemies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
