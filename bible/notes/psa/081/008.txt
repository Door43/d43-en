===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh reminds the people what he said while they were in the desert.

  * **for I will warn you,** - "because I am giving you a warning,"
  * **Israel** - The name of the country represents the people (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]]). Yahweh talks to the nation as if it was a person (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **if you would only listen to me!** - "but you must start listening to me!"
  * **Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.** - AT: "Tell me what you want me to do for you and I will do it." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
