===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Now Yahweh tells what actually happened after he warned the people.

  * **to my words** - "to what I said" or "to me" 
  * **So I gave them over to their own stubborn way** - God allowing the people to remain stubborn is spoken of as if God were giving them over to an enemy to let the enemy harm them. AT: "Therefore, I let them be stubborn" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
