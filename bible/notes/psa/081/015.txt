  * **cringe in fear** - "bow down in fear" or "fall down in fear"

  * **I would feed Israel with the finest wheat** - God causing the best wheat to grow in Israel is spoken of as if he would literally feed the wheat to the people. AT: "I would allow the Israelites to eat the finest wheat" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **feed Israel ... satisfy you** - Both "Israel" and "you" refer to the Israelites.
