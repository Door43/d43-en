\v 5 So now I say to myself, "Why am I in a panic?
\q1 I confidently expect God to bless me,
\q2 and again I will praise him,
\q2 my God, the one who saves me."
\q1
\v 6 But now, Yahweh, I was panicking,
\q2 so I think about you.
\q1 You are there in Israel where the Jordan River rushes down from the bottom of the peaks of Mount Hermon and from Mount Mizar.

\v 5 Why are you bowed down, my soul?
\q Why are you upset within me?
\q Hope in God, for again I will praise him who is my salvation.

\q therefore I call you to mind from the land of the Jordan,
\q from the three peaks of Mount Hermon, and from the hill of Mizar.
