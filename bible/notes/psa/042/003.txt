====== Psalm 042:3-4 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Every day and every night I cry;
\q2 the only thing I have to drink is my tears;
\q1 and while I do that, my enemies are continually asking me,
\q2 "Why does your god not \add help you\add*?"
\q1
\v 4 I am very distressed [IDI] as I remember
\q2 when I went with the crowd of people to the temple \add in Jerusalem\add*,
\q2 leading them as we walked along;
\q1 we were all shouting joyfully and singing to thank God \add for what he had done\add*;
\q2 we were a large group who were celebrating.

\q
\v 3 My tears have been my food day and night,
\q while my enemies are always saying to me, "Where is your God?"
\q
\v 4 These things I call to mind as I pour out my soul:
\q how I went with the throng and led them to the house of God
\q with the voice of joy and praise, a multitude celebrating a festival.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **My tears have been my food** - The author refers to his tears as if they are food that he eats. This means that he is so sad that he cannot eat. AT: "My tears are like my food and I eat nothing else" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **day and night** - This phrase refers to the entire day by referring to both its beginning and end. AT: "all day long" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **my enemies are always saying to me** - This is an exaggeration. His enemies are not saying this constantly; they are saying it often. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **Where is your God?** - The author's enemies use this question to mock him and to express that they do not see his God helping him. AT: "Your God is not here to help you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **call to mind** - This is an idiom that means to remember or think about something. AT: "remember" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **I pour out my soul** - Here the word "soul" refers to the emotions. The author speaks of his soul as if it is a liquid that he pours out. The phrase means that he is expressing his emotional grief. AT: "I express my sorrow" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the throng** - "the crowd of people"
  * **joy and praise** - This phrase uses two different words to express one idea. AT: "joyful praise" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hendiadys]])
