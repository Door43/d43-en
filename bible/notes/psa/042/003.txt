===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Every day and every night I cry;
\q2 the only thing I have to drink is my tears;
\q1 and while I do that, my enemies are continually asking me,
\q2 "Why does your god not \add help you\add*?"
\q1
\v 4 I am very distressed [IDI] as I remember
\q2 when I went with the crowd of people to the temple \add in Jerusalem\add*,
\q2 leading them as we walked along;
\q1 we were all shouting joyfully and singing to thank God \add for what he had done\add*;
\q2 we were a large group who were celebrating.

\q
\v 3 My tears have been my food day and night,
\q While they always say to me, “Where is your God?”
\q
\v 4 These things I remember and pour out my soul within me,
\q How I went with the throng and led them to the house of God
\q With the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping holiday.
