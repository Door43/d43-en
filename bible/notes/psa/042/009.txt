===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I will say to God, my rock** - The author sees God as his protection and refers to him as a rock. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * ** Why do I go mourning** - To go mourning is to perform customs related to being very sad.  
  * **As with a sword in my bones** -  The author describes his adversaries' rebukes as receiving a fatal wound. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **they always say to me** - This is an exaggeration; his enemies are not saying this constantly but are saying it often. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **Where is your God?**  - The author's enemies use this question to express that they do not see God helping him. AT: "Your God is not here to help you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
