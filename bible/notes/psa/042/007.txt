===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Deep calls to deep** - The word "deep" refers to deep water and is a symbol of great misfortune and sadness. They "call" to another, in that they come quickly, one after another. AT: "I have continuous troubles" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **at the noise of your waterfalls** - "like the continuous noise of a waterfall" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **all your waves ... have gone over me **- The author uses the idea of being covered by waves to show that he is overwhelmed by his sadness and by everything that God is allowing to happen to him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **your waves and your billows**  - Both of these phrases refer different types of waves. AT: "your waves" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
