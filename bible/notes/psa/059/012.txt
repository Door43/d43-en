\v 12 Because what they say \f + \ft metonymy \f* is sinful,
\q2 allow them to be trapped for being proud.
\q1 Because they are always cursing and telling lies,
\q1
\v 13 because you are angry, get rid of them;
\q2 destroy them completely
\q2 in order that people will know that you rule over us, your Israelite people,
\q2 and that you rule over all the earth.
\qr (Think about that!)

    * **let them be captured in their pride** - AT: "let people capture them because of their pride" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
    * **that they express** - "that they say"
