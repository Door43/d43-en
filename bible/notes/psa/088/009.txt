===== translationNotes: =====

  * **My eyes grow weary from trouble** - Here "eyes" represents a person's ability to see. For his eyes to grow weary from trouble is a way of saying that he his troubles cause him to cry so much that it is hard for him to see. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **I spread out my hands to you** - "I lift up my hands to you." This is an action that shows that he totally depends on God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **Will you do wonders for the dead?** - The writer uses a question to emphasize that if God lets him die then God will no longer be able to do wonderful things for him. AT: "You do not do wonders for dead people." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Will those who have died rise and praise you?** - The writer uses a question to emphasize that if God lets him die then he will not be able to praise God any longer. AT: "You know that those who have died will not stand up and praise you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
