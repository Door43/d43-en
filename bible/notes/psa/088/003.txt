===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For I am filled with troubles** - The writer speaks of himself as if he were a container and troubles are the contents that fill the container. AT: "For I am very troubled" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **my life has reached Sheol** - Here "life" represents the writer. And "Sheol" represents death. The writer speaks about himself possibly dying soon as if Sheol were a place and he has arrived at that place. AT: "I am about to die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **People treat me like those who go down into the pit** - The word "pit" means the same as "Sheol." The phrase "go down into the pit" represents dying. AT: "people treat me like I have already died" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
