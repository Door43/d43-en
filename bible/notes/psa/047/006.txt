  * **Sing praises to God, sing praises; sing praises to our King, sing praises.** - The phrase "sing praises" is repeated for emphasis. You may omit the repetition if it is awkward in your language. Or, you may translate it as "Sing, sing praises to God; sing, sing praises to our King." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
