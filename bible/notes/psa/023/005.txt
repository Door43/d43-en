===== Translation Notes: =====

Now the psalm tells how God is like someone who welcomes a guest into his home.

  * **You prepare a table** - A table represents a feast because people would put all the food on a table. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **anointed my head with oil** - People sometimes put oil on their guest's heads in order to honor them.
  * **my cups runs over** - Here a cup of wine that overflows represents great blessings. "You fill my cup so much that it overflows" or "You give me many blessings" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
