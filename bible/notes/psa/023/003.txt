===== Translation Notes: =====

This psalm continues to tell about how God cares for us as a shepherd cares for his sheep. 

  * **he guides me along right paths** - The word "paths" represents how a person lives. AT: "he shows me how to live right" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **for his name's sake** - The phrase "his name" here refers to his reputation. AT: "for his reputation" or "so that people will honor him"
