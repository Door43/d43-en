  * **General Information:** - This psalm continues to tell about how God cares for us as a shepherd cares for his sheep. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **He brings back my life** - This means God makes a person who is weak and tired to be strong and rested again.
  * **he guides me along right paths** - Showing a person how to live in a way that pleases God is spoken of as if it were a shepherd showing a sheep the right path to take. AT: "He shows me how to live right" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **for his name's sake** - The phrase "his name" here refers to his reputation. AT: "for his reputation" or "so that people will honor him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
