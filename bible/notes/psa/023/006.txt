===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Surely goodness and covenant faithfulness will pursue me** - Yahweh being good and faithful to a person is spoken of as if goodness and covenant faithfulness are things that pursue after a person. The abstract nouns "goodness" and "faithfulness" can be translated as adjectives. AT: "Surely you will be good and faithful to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **all the days of my life** - The abstract noun "life" can be stated as a verb. AT: "as long as I live" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **the house of Yahweh** - Possible meanings are that 1) this refers to Yahweh's eternal home, or 2) this refers to Yahweh's temple in Jerusalem. If possible, translate it so that both meanings could be understood.
  * **for a very long time** - Possible meanings are 1) "forever" or 2) "as long as I live."
