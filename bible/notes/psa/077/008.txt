===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Because Asaph was not sure of the answer to these questions, they are probably literal questions and should be translated literally. 

  * **Was his covenant faithfulness gone forever?** - Asaph speaks of Yahweh no longer acting faithfully to his covenant as if Yahweh's covenant faithfulness had gone away. The abstract noun "faithfulness" can be translated with an adjective. AT: "Has he stopped being faithful to his covenant forever?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Had God forgotten to be gracious? Had his anger shut off his compassion?** - These are two expressions stating similar concept of God not showing compassion. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Had his anger shut off his compassion** - Asaph speaks of anger as if it were a person shutting a door to keep another person, compassion, from coming out, AT: "Had God stopped showing us compassion because he was angry with us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
