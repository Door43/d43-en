===== Translation Notes: =====

The writer continues to speak to Yahweh.

  * **what god compares to our great God?** - The writer uses a question to emphasize his praise of God. He means there is no one like God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **gave your people victory ... the descendants** - AT: "gave us, your people, victory ... us who are the descendants"
