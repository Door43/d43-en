===== translationNotes: =====

  * **thunderous voice** - This is personification, referring to the thunder as the voice of God. AT: "voice, which was as loud as thunder" or "very loud voice" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **lightning lit up the world** - This is an exaggeration to emphasize that the lightning lit up everything the writer could see. AT: "lightning lit up everything as far as you could see" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **Your path ... your way** - These two phrases have similar meanings and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **your footprints** - Asaph is speaking of Yahweh as if Yahweh was a person with feet. While this is personification, it should be translated literally, if possible. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **your footprints were not seen** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "no one saw your footprints" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **You led your people like a flock** - This simile compares God's people to a flock of animals. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **by the hand of** - The phrase "by the hand of" here means "by the action of" or "through the action of."
  * **hand** - Here "hand" is synechdoche for the whole person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
