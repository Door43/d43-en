===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I stretched my hands out** - "I prayed with my arms extended"
  * **My soul refused to be comforted** - The "soul" is a metonym for the person. This can be stated in active form. AT: "I would not allow anyone to try to comfort me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **I thought of God as I groaned; I thought about him as I grew faint** - These two phrases share similar meanings and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **as I grew faint** - "as my spirit grew faint" or "as my spirit was overwhelmed"
  * **Selah** - This may be a musical term that tells people how to sing or play their instruments here. Some translations write the Hebrew word, and some translations do not include it. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:003:001|3:2]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_transliterate]])
