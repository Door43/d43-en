===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **The king sent and released him; the ruler of the people set him free** -  These two phrases have basically the same meaning and are used together to emphasize that the king set Joseph free. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **Then Israel came into Egypt**  - Here "Israel" refers to Jacob. Jacob also brought his family with him. AT: "Then Israel and his family came into Egypt"
