  * **the covenant that he made with Abraham ... his oath to Isaac** - Both of these phrases "the covenant" and "the oath" refer to the same promise that Yahweh made to his people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **his oath to Isaac** - It may be helpful to add the missing words. AT: "his oath that he gave to Isaac" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
