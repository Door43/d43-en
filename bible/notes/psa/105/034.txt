===== translationNotes: =====

  * **so many locusts** - "there were so many locusts"
  * **The locusts ate up all of the vegetation ... They ate up all the crops of the ground** - These two phrase have basically the same meaning and are used together for emphasis. AT: "The insects ate all the plants and all the crops in the land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **He killed every first-born in their land, the firstfruits of all their strength** - Here the second phrase about the "firstfruits" is used to describe the "first-born" in the first phrase. AT: "He killed every first-born in their land, which were the firstfruits of all their strength" or "Then Yahweh killed the oldest son in every house of the people of Egypt" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
