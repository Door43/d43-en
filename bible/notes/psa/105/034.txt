===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **so many locusts** - "there were so many locusts"
    * **The locusts ate up all vegetation ... They ate up all the crops ...** -  These two phrase have basically the same meaning and are used together for emphasis. AT: "The insects ate all the plants and all the crops in the land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **He killed every firstborn in their land, the first fruits of all their strength** - Here the second phrase about the "first fruits" is used to describe the "firstborn" in the first phrase. AT: "He killed every firstborn in their land, which were the first fruits of all their strength"
