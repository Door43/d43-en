===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The psalmist is writing about Israel.

  * **when they were only few in number** - The word "they" refers to the Israelites. 
  * **were strangers in the land** - It is implied that "the land" refers to Canaan. AT: "were foreigners in the land of Canaan" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **They went from** - "They continued to wander" 
  * **from nation to nation and from one kingdom to another** - These two phrases have similar meanings and are used together for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
