===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **They performed his signs ... his wonders ...** - These two phrases have basically the same meaning and are used together for emphasis. AT: "Moses and Aaron performed God's miracles in Egypt among the descendants of Ham" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) 
    * **his wonders in the land of Ham** - "and they preformed his wonders in the land of Ham"
