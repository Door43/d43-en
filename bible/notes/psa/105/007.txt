    * **He keeps in mind ... the word that he commanded ...** - These two phrases share similar meanings and are used together for emphasis. The word "word" refers to the covenant. AT: "He remembers his covenant forever, the promise he made for 1,000 generations" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
    * **a thousand generation** - "1,000 generations" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
