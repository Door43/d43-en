====== Psalms 053:4-5 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 Will all these evil people never learn \add what God will do to them\add*?
\q1 They act violently toward Yahweh's people while eating the food that he provides),
\q2 and they never pray to Yahweh.
\q1
\v 5 But \add some day\add* those people will become very terrified,
\q2 like they have never been terrified before,
\q1 because God will cause those who are separated from God to die,
\q2 and he will scatter their bones.
\q1 They have rejected God,
\q2 so he will cause them to be \add defeated and\add* completely disgraced.

\q1

<usfm>
\v 4 Will all these evil people never learn what God will do to them?
\q1 They hurt Yahweh's people with terrible violence. They had no guilt in what they did. They had the same expression on their faces as people eating bread at dinner.
\q2 And what is worse is that they never prayed to Yahweh.
\q1
\v 5 But someday those people will become very terrified,
\q2 although they have nothing to fear.
\q1 For God will cause those who attack you to die,
\q2 and he will scatter their bones.
\q1 They have rejected God,
\q2 so he will cause them to be defeated and completely disgraced.
\b


\q1

<usfm>
\q
\v 4 Do those who commit iniquity have no understanding—
\q those who devour my people as if they were eating bread
\q and they do not call on God?
\q
\v 5 They were in great fear, although no reason to fear was there;
\q for God will scatter the bones of whoever will camp against you;
\q such people will be put to shame because God has rejected them.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Do those who commit iniquity have no understanding—those ... God?** - This question is used to show the shock that the writer feels because the people are so sinful. It can be written as two statements. "Those who commit iniquity act as though they do not know anything. They devour my people as if they were eating bread, and they do not call on God!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **those who devour my people as if they were eating bread** - Destroying people is spoken of as devouring them. Doing it as if they were eating bread implies that they did it very easily or without feeling guilty about it. AT: "those who destroy my people as freely as if they were eating bread" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **God will scatter the bones of whoever will camp against you** - Scattering people's bones represents killing them and allowing their bones to remain wherever they have died and not be buried properly. "God will completely destroy whoever will camp against you, and their bones will lie scattered on the ground" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **whoever will camp against you** - Camping against people represents attacking them. Enemy armies would travel and set up camps to live in temporarily near the people they wanted to attack. AT: "whoever will attack you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
