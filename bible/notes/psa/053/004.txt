\v 4 Do they not know anything, those who commit iniquity,
\q those who eat up my people as they eat bread
\q but who do not call on God?

\v 5 They were in great fear, although no reason to fear was there;
\q for God will scatter the bones of whoever will camp against you;
\q such people will be put to shame because God has rejected them.
