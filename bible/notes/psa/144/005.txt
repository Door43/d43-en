  * **Cause ... to sink ... come down ... touch ... make ... smoke .. Send ... scatter ... shoot ... send** - These are requests, not commands.
  * **Cause the sky to sink** - Possible meanings are 1) tear the sky open (see UDB), or 2) bend the heavens like a tree branch bends when someone walks on it or as one bends a bow before shooting arrows.
  * **in confusion** - "so they do not know what to think or what to do"
