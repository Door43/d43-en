===== translationNotes: =====

  * **our captors required songs from us** - Here "songs" represents acts of singing. AT: "Our captors required us to sing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **required us to be happy** - "made us pretend to be happy"
  * **one of the songs of Zion** - This probably refers to songs that the Israelites had used in worship at the temple in Jerusalem.
