===== translationNotes: =====


  * **General Information:** - See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]

  * **Not to us, Yahweh, not to us** - The writer repeats the phrase "Not to us" in order to emphasize that they are not worthy to receive the honor that is due only to Yahweh. If necessary, a verbal phrase may be supplied here. AT: "Do not bring honor to us, Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **to us** - The word "us" refers to the people of Israel.
  * **but to your name bring honor** - Here the word "name" represents Yahweh, himself. AT: "but bring honor to yourself" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **for your covenant faithfulness** - "because of your covenant faithfulness"
  * **Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?"** - This rhetorical question emphasizes that there should be no reason for the nations to say what they say. AT: "The people of the nations should not be able to say, 'Where is their God?'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Where is their God?** - The people of other nations use this question to mock the people of Israel and to express that they do not see Yahweh helping them. AT: "Your God is not here to help you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
