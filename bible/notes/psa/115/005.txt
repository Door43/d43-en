===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Those idols have mouths** - The idols do not have real mouths, eyes, ears, or noses. Rather, people made them with the likeness of mouths, eyes, ears, and noses. The writer is emphasizing that these idols are not really alive. AT: "People have given mouths to those idols" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
