===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The dead** - "People who are dead"
  * **who go down into silence** - AT: "who go into the grave." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]), [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **But we**  - The word "we" refers to the people of Israel, the descendants of Israel, and whoever reveres Yahweh.
  * **we will bless Yahweh** - See how you translated "I will bless Yahweh" in [[en:bible:notes:psa:032:001|32:1]], but notice that "we" and "I" are different.
