===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The dead** - The adjective "dead" may be translated with a noun phrase. AT: "People who are dead" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]])
  * **nor do any who go down into silence** -  The verb may be supplied from the previous phrase, with which this line is parallel. AT: "nor do any who go down into silence praise Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **nor do any who go down into silence** - The writer speaks of the grave or the place of the dead as a place of silence where no one can speak. This is a euphemism for death. AT: "nor do any who go to the place of the dead" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **But we** - The word "we" refers to the people of Israel who are still alive.
