===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **He gives the childless woman a home** - It is implied that Yahweh gives the woman a seat with princes. AT: "Yahweh gives the wife who was barren a seat with princes." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the childless woman a home** - "the barren woman of the house." This refers to a woman who is married but has not children. Because she is barren she feels ashamed and insecure.
  * **for her to be a joyful mother of children** - "as a happy mother of children" or "by making her a mother of children who is joyful." Yahweh raises up the barren woman to sit with princes by making her a happy mother of children.
