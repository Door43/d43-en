===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **He raises up the poor ... and lifts up the needy ...** - These two phrases have similar meaning and are used together to emphasize how poor people sit in lowly and dirty places. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **so that he may seat him with princes, with the princes ...** - Here the second phrase is used to describe the "princes" from the first phrase.
  * **his people** - The word "his" refers to Yahweh.
