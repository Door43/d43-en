===== translationNotes: =====

  * **From the rising of the sun to its setting** - This phrase refers to the directions east, where the sun rises, and west, where the sun sets. The writer uses these two extremes to represent everywhere on earth. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:050:001|50:1]]. AT: "Everywhere on earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **Yahweh's name should be praised** - Here the word "name" represents Yahweh, himself. This can be stated in active form. AT: "people should praise Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **his glory reaches above the skies** - The glory of God is spoken of as if it was very high. AT: "his glory is higher than the skies" or "his glory is enormously great" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
