===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Yahweh is my rock** - The word "rock" is a picture of a safe place. God is not an actual rock. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **my rock, my fortress** - Here the words "rock" and "fortress" share similar meanings and emphasize that Yahweh provides safety. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **my shield, the horn of my salvation, and my stronghold** - A similar idea is repeated three ways for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
