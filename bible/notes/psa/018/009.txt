===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **He opened....** - The word "He" refers Yahweh.
  * **thick darkness was under his feet** - Though Yahweh does not actually have feet, human characteristics are given to him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **wings of the wind** - Because this is Hebrew poetry there are many pictures. The wind does not actually have wings, but it gives us a picture of what the wind is doing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
