===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The writer continues to speak of Yaweh's great power.

  * **Then the water channels appeared; the foundations of the world were exposed** - These two clauses have similar meanings. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Then the water channels appeared and the bottom of the ocean became visible; you exposed the foundations of the world" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **at the blast of the breath of your nostrils** - Though God does not have human physical characteristics as described here, this pictures his mighty strength. The wind is spoken of here as if it came as a mighty blast from God's nostrils. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
