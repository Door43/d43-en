===== Translation Notes: =====

The Psalmist continues to speak of Yaweh's great power.

  * **Then the water channels appeared; the foundations of the world were exposed ** - "the bottom of the ocean was seen" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **the foundations of the world were exposed at your battle cry, Yahweh** - You, Yahweh, exposed the foundations of the world" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **blast of the breath of your nostrils** - AT: "air forced out with strength through the nose."  Though God does not have human physical characteristics, this pictures his mighty strength. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
