===== Translation Notes: =====

David continues to speak to God.

  * **Therefore my heart is glad … my honored heart exalts him**  - The speaker is saying that it brings him honor to be able to praise God. Both of these clauses express very similar meanings. AT: "Therefore I am glad; I am honored to praise him," (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet|Doublet]])
  * **my heart … my honored heart**  - Here the "heart" represents the speaker's thoughts and emotions. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
