===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He dispenses the hail like crumbs** - Yahweh scatters hail as easily as a person would scatter bread crumbs. AT: "He dispenses the hail easily, as if they were crumbs" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **He dispenses** - "He sends"
  * **hail** - small pieces of ice that fall from the sky like rain
  * **who can withstand the cold he sends?** - The writer uses this question to emphasize that it is difficult to endure the cold weather that Yahweh causes. AT: "no one can live in the cold he sends." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **He sends out his command and melts them** - The writer speaks of Yahweh's command as if it were his messenger. The word "command" can be translated with a verb. AT: "He commands the ice to melt" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
