===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Jerusalem...Zion** - AT: "people of Jerusalem...people of Zion" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
  * **He brings prosperity**- Possible meanings are 1) the people are wealthy because they have plenty of wheat to eat (see UDB) or 2) "He brings peace," the end of war and the chance to rebuild the city ([[:en:bible:notes:psa:147:002|147:2-3]]), and so the people have plenty of wheat.
