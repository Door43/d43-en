====== Psalms 002 General Notes ======


=== Kind of  psalm ===

Psalm 2 is usually considered a royal psalm because it is about the king. It was probably first sung when a new person became the king. It is often thought of as a psalm about the Messiah because of verse 6 and 7 where there is a reference to the Son of God. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

The main theme of this psalm is that God is protecting and empowering the king he has appointed and that it is useless for the foreign nations to appose God and his king.

"Today I have begotten you" is a metaphor meaning that God acknowledges the king as his special person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
