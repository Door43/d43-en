<usfm>
\v 12 Bow down humbly before his son!
\q2 If you do not do that, he will be angry,

\q2 But he is very pleased with all those who request him to protect them \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 Bow down humbly before his son!
\q2 If you do not do that, he will be angry,
\q2 and he will suddenly kill you.
\q1 Do not forget that he can, in one moment, show that he is very angry!
\q2 But how fortunate are all those who request him to protect them.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 12 Give true allegiance to his son so that he will not be angry with you, and so you will not die
