===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **all** - This is exaggeration. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]]) In some languages it is more  natural to say "many."
  * **you/your** - Many translations express this with "I/me/my" as the UDB does.
  * **he crowns you with covenant faithfulness and acts of tender mercy.** - AT: "he blesses you with his promised faithfulness and acts of mercy."
  * **your youth is renewed like the eagle** - AT: "you are made strong like an eagle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
