===== translationNotes: =====

  * **your ... you** - Many translations express this with "my, I, me" as the UDB does.
  * **He redeems your life from destruction** - This means that Yahweh keeps him alive. AT: "He saves me from dying" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he crowns you with covenant faithfulness and acts of tender mercy** - Here blessing someone and treating them with great honor is described as if it were placing a crown on that person's head. The abstract nouns "faithfulness" and "mercy" can be translated with adverbs. AT: "he blesses you by acting faithfully and mercifully towards you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **He satisfies your life with good things** - The phrase "your life" refers to "you," but it emphasizes that Yahweh gives blessings throughout life. AT: "He satisfies you with good things through your life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **your youth is renewed like the eagle** - Having your "youth renewed" means to feel young again. Here David compares this feeling of youth to the swiftness and strength of an eagle. AT: "you feel young and are strong like an eagle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **your youth** - The word "youth" refers to the strength one had as a young adult. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
