===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **For as the skies are high ... toward those who honor him.** - The simile compares the great distance between heaven and earth to the greatness of God's love for his people. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]]) 
  * **As far as the east  ...removed the guilt of our sins from us.** - The distance between east and west is so far that it cannot be measured. In this simile, that distance is being compared to how far God moves our guilt away from us. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])  
  * **As a father has compassion ... on those who honor him.** - Here the author compares a father's compassion for his children to Yahweh's compassion for those who honor him.
