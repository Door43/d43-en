  * **so great is his covenant faithfulness** - The abstract noun "faithfulness" can be translated with an adjective. AT: "so he is very faithful to his covenant" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **As far as the east ... removed the guilt of our sins from us** - The distance between east and west is so far that it cannot be measured. In this simile, that distance is being compared to how far God moves our guilt away from us. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
