\v 15 We humans do not live forever;
\q2 we are like grass, which withers and dies.
\q1 We are like wild flowers: They bloom for a short while,

\q
\v 14 For he knows how we are formed;
\q he knows that we are dust.

\v 15 As for man, his days are like grass;
\q he flourishes like a flower in a field.
\q
\v 16 The wind blows over it, and it disappears,
\q and no one can even tell where it once grew.
