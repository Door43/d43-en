<usfm>
\q
\v 3 The wicked are estranged from the womb;
\q They go astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies.
\q
\v 4 Their poison is like a snake’s poison;
\q They are like the deaf adder that stops up its ears,
\q
\v 5 That pays no attention to the voice of charmers,
\q No matter how skillful they are.
