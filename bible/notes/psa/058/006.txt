\q
\v 6 Break their teeth in their mouths, God;
\q break out the great teeth of the young lions, Yahweh.
\q
\v 7 Let them melt away as water that runs off;
\q when they shoot their arrows, let them be as though they had no points.
\q
\v 8 Let them be like a snail that melts and passes away,
\q like the untimely-born child of a woman that never sees the sunlight.
