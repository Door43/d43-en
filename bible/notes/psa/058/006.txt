<usfm>
\q
\v 6 Break their teeth in their mouths, God;
\q break out the great teeth of the young lions, Yahweh.
\q
\v 7 Let them melt away as water that runs off;
\q when they shoot their arrows, let them be as though they had no points.
\q
\v 8 Let them be like a snail that melts and passes away,
\q like the untimely-born child of a woman that never sees the sunlight.

  * **General Information:** - The author lists things that he would like God to do to wicked people.

  * **Break their teeth ... break out the great teeth of the young lions** - In both of these phrases, the wicked people are spoken of as if they were lions, and making them powerless to kill people is spoken of as breaking their teeth. AT: "Take away their power to kill. Make them powerless like young lions whose teeth have been broken and fallen out" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Let them melt away as water that runs off** - The wicked people are spoken of as if they were ice or water. No longer existing is spoken of as melting or draining away into the dry ground.

  * **let them be as though they had no points** - "let their arrows be as though they had no points"

  * **snail** - "slug"
  * **like the untimely-born child of a woman that never sees the sunlight** - Not existing is spoken of as being like a baby that is born dead. AT: "like a baby who is born too early too live and see the sunlight" or "like a baby that was born dead" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
