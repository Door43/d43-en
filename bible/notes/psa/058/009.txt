  * **your**  - David is speaking to God's people. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_youdual]])
  * **he will take them away**  - "God will take them away"
  * **The righteous will rejoice** - "The righteous person will rejoice"
  * **he sees God’s vengeance**  - The word "he" refers to "the righteous".
  * **he will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked** - AT: "the wicked will die and fall all around him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
