  * **he will take them away** - "God will take them away"
  * **The righteous will rejoice** - "The righteous person will rejoice"
  * **he sees God's vengeance** - The word "he" refers to "the righteous".
  * **he will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked** - "the wicked will die and fall all around him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
