===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Before your pots can feel the thorn's burning heat ... the green thorns and the burning thorns alike** - The wicked are spoken of as if they were thornbush branches, and God's swift punishment of them is spoken of as if he were to quickly blow them away or sweep them away. AT: "God will destroy wicked people faster than a whirlwind can blow away thornbush branches that have been put under a cooking pot and lit with fire" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **your** - David is speaking to God's people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **thorn** - "thornbush branches"
  * **The righteous will rejoice when he sees** - The phrase "the righteous" refers to righteous people in general. AT: "Righteous people will rejoice when they see" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_genericnoun]])
  * **he will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked** - Getting one's feet wet by walking on blood is spoken of as washing the feet in blood. AT: "the righteous will make their feet wet in the blood of the wicked" or "the righteous will march on the blood of the wicked" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked** - This exaggeration expresses that a great number of wicked people will die. AT: "so many wicked people will die that when the righteous march on their blood, it will seem as if they could wash their feet in it"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
