\v 5 Then I confessed my sins to you;
\q2 I stopped trying to hide them.

\q1 I said to myself,
\q2 "I will tell Yahweh the wrong things that I have done."
\q1 When I confessed them, you forgave me,
\q2 so now I am no longer guilty for my sins.
\b
\q1
\v 6 Therefore the people who honor you should pray to you

<usfm>
\q
\v 5 Then I acknowledged my sin to you,
\q and I no longer hid my iniquity.
\q I said, "I will confess my transgressions to Yahweh,"
\q and you forgave the guilt of my sin. 
\qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 6 Because of this, all who are godly should pray to you at a time of great distress.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Selah** - This may be a musical term that tells people how to sing or play their instruments here. Some translations write the Hebrew word, and some translations do not include it. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:003:001|3:2]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_transliterate]])  * **at a time of great distress** - "when they are in great trouble." Other translations may read "while you may be found."
  * **Then when the surging waters overflow, they will not reach those people** - Difficulties are spoken of as if they were a flood of water. AT: "Then when difficulties come like a flood of water, those people will be safe" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
