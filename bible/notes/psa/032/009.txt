===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Do not be like a horse ... no understanding** - The writer compares people with no understanding to horses and mules. Possible meanings are 1) the writer is speaking Yahweh's words to his readers, "You all must not be like a horse ... no understanding" or 2) Yahweh is speaking to the writer as though to a group of people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **bridle and bit** - Two tools that are used by people to guide horses and mules go where the rider wants them to go.
  * **where you want them to** - "where anyone wants them to go." The "you" here is singular and refers to no one in particular. 
  * **Yahweh's covenant faithfulness will surround the one who trusts in him** - Yahweh being faithful to a person and protecting that person is spoken of as if Yahweh's covenant faithfulness surrounded the person. The abstract noun "faithfulness" can be translated as an adjective. AT: "Because Yahweh is faithful to his covenant, he will protect the one who trusts in him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
