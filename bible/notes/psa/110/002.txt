===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to speak to the lord.
 
  * **on the day of your power ** - or "when you gather your army"
  * **on the holy mountains; in the womb of the dawn go out like the dew of your youth** - "the dew of your young people is dressed in the splendid cloths of holiness from the womb of the dawn." Yahweh compares the glory and the purity of the people of the army to the glory and purity of dew in the morning. AT: "The young people of your army are glorious and pure like the dew of the morning." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **on the holy mountains**  - This refers to the mountains of Zion. This phrase could also be translated as "dressed in marvelous and holy clothes." The people of the army, whom Yahweh compares with dew, are wearing holy cloths like the cloths that priests wear.
  * **in the womb of the dawn** - "from the womb of the dawn." Yahweh describes the dew as a baby to whom the dawn gives birth. AT: "at dawn." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **go out like the dew of your youth **- AT: "that is what your dew, which is your young people, is like"
