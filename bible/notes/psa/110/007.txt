===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **He will drink of the brook along the road** - The king only stops briefly for a drink and then he continues the pursuit of his enemies. AT: "As he pursues his enemies, he will only stop to drink quickly from a stream." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **He will drink** - The word "He" refers to the lord whom Yahweh has made king. 
  * **and then** - "and so" or "therefore" 
  * **he will lift his head** - Possible meanings are 1) the king lifts up his own head or 2) Yahweh lifts up the head of the king. (See: [[en:bible:notes:psa:003:003|3:3]])
  * **will lift his head up high after victory** - "will lift up his head." People raised their heads when they are victorious, confident, and joyful. AT: "will be victorious" or "will have victory." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
