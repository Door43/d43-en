===== translationNotes: =====

  * **my eyes are on you** - The eyes are a synecdoche for the whole person. AT: "I am looking to see what you will do" or "I expect you to help me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **in you I take refuge** - "I am asking you to protect me" See how "take refuge" is translated in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:118:008|118:9]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **my soul** - The soul is a metonym for the whole person. AT: "me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **the snares that they have laid for me** - The psalmist speaks of deceiving a good man so the good man will sin or so that the evil people can defeat him as if it were laying a trap for an animal. The word "snares" is a metonym for the people themselves. AT: "people who are looking for ways to harm me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **snares ... traps** - Bible experts disagree on the exact meanings of these words. It would be best either to translate one of them with the word for a net or cage that contains the prey and the other as a rope or vine that catches the prey by the leg or neck or to translate both with the general word for "traps." See how these words are translated in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:140:004|140:5]].
  * **from the traps of evildoers** - The verb may be supplied from the previous phrase. AT: "and protect me from the traps that those who do evil have set" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **Let the wicked fall into their own nets** - The psalmist speaks of evil people deceiving good people as if hunters were trapping animals. AT: "Let the wicked fall into the net traps they have made to trap other people" or "Let the bad things the wicked planned for the righteous happen to the wicked instead"
