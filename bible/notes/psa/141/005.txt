<usfm>
\q
\v 5 Let the righteous strike me, it will be a kindness;
\q Let him correct me, it is as oil for my head;
\q May my head not refuse it.
\q  My prayer is continually against their evil deeds.
\q
\v 6 Their leaders are thrown down the sides of the rock;
\q They will hear my words; for they are pleasant.
\q
\v 7 As when one plows and breaks up the ground,
\q So our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.
</usfm>
