<usfm>
\v 5 It is all right if righteous people strike me or rebuke me
\q2 because they are trying to act kindly toward me to teach me to do what is right;
\q1 if they do that, it will be as if someone honored me by anointing my head with olive oil;
\q2 but I am always praying that you will punish the wicked because of the wicked deeds that they do.
\q1
\v 6 When their rulers are thrown down from the top of rocky cliffs,
\q2 they will know that what I am saying here is good.
\q1
\v 7 They will know one day that their bodies will lie scattered on the ground in the place of the dead,
\q2 just as one scatters clods of earth when he plows a field.

<usfm>
\q
\v 5 Let a righteous man hit me; it will be a kindness to me.
\q Let him correct me; it will be like oil on my head;
\q may my head not refuse to accept it.
\q But my prayer is always against their wicked deeds.
\q
\v 6 Their leaders will be thrown down from the top of cliffs;
\q they will hear that my own words are pleasant.
\q
\v 7 They will have to say, "As when one plows and breaks up the ground,
\q so our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **hit me** - The psalmist speaks as if giving a rebuke were physically hitting someone. AT: "rebuke me" or "hit me so I will listen when he corrects me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **it will be a kindness to me** - The abstract noun "kindness" can be translated with an adverb. AT: "he will be acting kindly to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **it will be like oil on my head** - Possible meanings are that the psalmist speaks as if a person correcting him were putting oil on his head 1) to honor him. AT: "when he corrects me, I will know that the one who corrects me is doing a good deed to me" or 2) to make his head feel better. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **may my head not refuse to accept it** - The head is a synecdoche for the person. The litotes can be translated as a positive statement. AT: "may I accept it gladly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **my prayer is always against their wicked deeds** - The words "wicked deeds" are a metonym for the people who do the wicked deeds. AT: "I always pray that Yahweh will stop wicked people from doing evil deeds" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
