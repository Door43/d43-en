===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Oh come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before Yahweh** - Both of these phrases suggest the same worshipful position before God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **kneel** - put both knees on the ground
  * **the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize Yahweh's care for his people. AT: "his people for whom cares like a shepherd cares for his sheep" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **pasture** - a grassy area for feeding animals
  * **hand** - Here "hand" represents the provision of God (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
