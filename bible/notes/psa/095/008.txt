Now the Psalmist writes the words that Yahweh spoke.

  * **Meribah, Massah**  - Both words refer to a place in the dessert that Moses named because the Israelites rebelled against God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **challenged my authority and tried my patience**  - AT: "tested my authority and patience," (See:[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **my deeds**  - AT: "the amazing things I had done."
