\q2 while in their inner beings, they hate them.
\q1

\q2 punish them for their evil deeds \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\q1
\v 5 Yahweh, they do not pay attention to the \add wonderful\add* things that you have done and that you have created;

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 3 Do not drag me away with the wicked, those who do iniquity,
\q who speak peace with their neighbors but have evil in their hearts.
\q
\v 4 Give them what their deeds deserve and repay them what their wickedness demands;
\q repay them for the work of their hands; render to them their due.
\q
\v 5 Because they do not understand the ways of Yahweh or the work of his hands,
\q he will tear them down and never rebuild them.
\b

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Do not drag me away** - The implied destination could be either judgment or death. 
  * **Give them what their deeds deserve ... repay them what their wickedness demands** - These two phrases mean the same thing. They are used together to emphasize that they deserve to be punished. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **the work of their hands** - This refers to what they have done with their hands. AT: "the things they have done" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **render to them their due** - "give them what they deserve"
  * **Because they do not understand ... never rebuild them** - It is unclear if verse 5 is best understood as a statement (as in the ULB) or as a request (as in the UDB). 
  * **he will tear them down and never rebuild them** - The punishment of the wicked people is spoken of as if they were a building or a city that would be destroyed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
