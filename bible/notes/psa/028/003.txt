\q
\v 3 Do not drag me away with the wicked, those who do iniquity,
\q who speak peace with their neighbors but have evil in their hearts.
\q
\v 4 Give them what their deeds deserve and repay them what their wickedness demands;
\q repay them for the work of their hands; render to them their due.
\q
\v 5 Because they do not understand the ways of Yahweh or the work of his hands,
\q he will tear them down and never rebuild them.
\b
