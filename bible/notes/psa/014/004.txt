===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Will they not know anything...who do not call on Yahweh?** - The writer puts this verse in the form of a question to add emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **those who commit iniquity** - "those who behave in evil ways,"
  * **those who eat up my people** - Just as people "eat" bread, those who do evil things destroy God's people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
