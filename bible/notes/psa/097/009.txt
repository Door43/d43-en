===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **hand of the wicked** - AT: "control of the wicked" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]]) 
  * **Light is sown for ... and gladness for ...**  - These two phrases have similar meanings and are used together for emphasis. AT: "Yahweh sows light for those who do right and sows gladness for those with honest hearts."  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Light is sown for the righteous** - "Sown" is a metaphor for giving. "God gives light to the righteous" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
