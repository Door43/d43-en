===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The skies declare his justice** - Possible meanings are 1) the psalmist speaks as if the skies are Yahweh's messengers who declare that Yahweh is just. AT: "Everyone can see that God is just, the same way that everyone can see the skies" or 2) the skies refer to the beings that live in the heavens. AT: "All those who live in heaven declare that Yahweh is just" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **All those who worship carved figures will be shamed, those who boast in worthless idols** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "God will shame all those who boast in worthless idols and worship carved figures" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Zion heard ... the towns of Judah** - This refers to the people who live in these lands. AT: "The people of Zion heard ... the people of Judah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
