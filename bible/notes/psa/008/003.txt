===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 3 When I look up at your heavens, which your fingers have made,
\q the moon and the stars, which you have set in place,
\q
\v 4 Of what importance is the human race that you notice them,
\q or mankind that you pay attention to them?
\q
\v 5 Yet you have made them only a little lower than the heavenly beings
\q and have crowned them with glory and honor.

  * **Of what importance is the human race that you notice them, or mankind that you pay attention to them?** - These remarks have been expressed in the form of a question to add emphasis.
