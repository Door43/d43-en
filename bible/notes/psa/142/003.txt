\q
\v 3 When my spirit is weak within me,
\q you know my path.
\q In the way that I walk
\q they have hidden a trap for me.
\q
\v 4 I look to my right and and see
\q that there is no one who cares about me.
\q There is no escape for me;
\q no one cares about my life.
\q
\v 5 I called out to you, Yahweh;
\q I said, "You are my refuge,
\q my portion in the land of the living.
