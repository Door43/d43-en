===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Covenant faithfulness and trustworthiness have met together** - The abstract nouns "faithfulness" and "trustworthiness" are spoken of as if they were persons who meet together. Possible meanings are 1) God has been faithful because of his covenant and has done what he promised to do. AT: "God has been faithful to his covenant and has proven that he is worthy of people trusting him" or 2) God has been faithful because of his covenant and the people have responded by being faithful to him. AT: "God has been faithful to his covenant and people have responded by trusting him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **have met together ... have kissed each other** - Most likely the speaker is describing a time in the future when God causes the people to prosper again. AT: "will meet together ... will kiss each other"
  * **righteousness and peace have kissed each other** - Possible meanings are 1) the people will do what is right and God will cause the people to live in peace or 2) God will do what is right and will cause the people to live in peace. Either way righteousness and peace are abstract nouns and are spoken of as if they were persons who kiss each other. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **kissed each other** - This was a common way for friends to greet each other.
  * **Trustworthiness springs up from the ground** - The people on earth being faithful to God is spoken of as if trustworthiness were a plant growing out of the ground. The abstract noun "trustworthiness" can be stated as "loyal." AT: "Here on earth, we will be loyal to God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **righteousness looks down from the sky** - The word "righteousness" is an abstract noun, and it is spoken of as a person looking down as God does. AT: "God will look on us from heaven and will act justly towards us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
