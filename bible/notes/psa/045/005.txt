<usfm>
\q
\v 5 Your arrows are sharp;
\q the peoples fall under you;
\q your arrows are in the hearts of the king's enemies.
\q
\v 6 Your throne, God, is forever and ever;
\q a scepter of justice is the scepter of your kingdom.
\q
\v 7 You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness;
\q therefore God, your God, has anointed you
\q with the oil of gladness more than your companions.
