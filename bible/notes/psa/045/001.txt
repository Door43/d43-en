===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Parallelism is common in Hebrew poetry. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **For the chief musician** - "This is for the director of music to use in worship"
  * **set to Shoshannim** - This may refer to a style or the tune of the music. Sometimes it is translated as "set to the tune of 'Lilies.'"
  * **A psalm of the sons of Korah** - "This is a psalm that the sons of Korah wrote."
  * **A maschil** - This may refer to a style of music. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:032:001|32:1]].
  * **A song of loves** - "A love song"
  * **My heart overflows on a good subject** - The writer speaks of his heart as if it were a container that overflows with liquid. The word "heart" represents his emotions, which are excited by the song that he sings. AT: "My emotions are excited about a good subject" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **a good subject** - "a noble theme" or "a beautiful word." This refers to the song that he has written.
  * **composed** - to have written or created a song
  * **my tongue is the pen of a ready writer** - The writer speaks of his tongue as if it were a pen. He speaks words as skillfully as an experienced writer writes words. AT: "my tongue is like the pen of person who writes well" or "I speak words as skillfully as an experienced writer can write words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **You are fairer than the children of mankind** - This phrase is an exaggeration that emphasizes that the king is better looking than anyone else. The phrase "children of mankind" is an idiom and refers to all humans. AT: "You are more handsome than any other man" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **grace is poured onto your lips** - The writer speaks of grace as if it were oil that someone has used to anoint the king's lips. The word "lips" refers to the king's speech. The phrase means that the king speaks eloquently. AT: "it is as if someone has anointed your lips with oil" or "you speak eloquently" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
