===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The writer continues to address the king.

  * **In the place of your fathers will be your children** - This means that the king's sons will replace him as king, just as he replaced his ancestors as king.
  * **you will make princes in all the earth** - The phrase "in all the earth" is an exaggeration to emphasize that they will rule over many nations. AT: "you will make rulers over many nations" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **I will make your name to be remembered in all generations** - Here the word "I" refers to the writer. The word "name" refers to the king's character and reputation. This can be stated in active form. AT: "I will cause people in every generation to know about your greatness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
