===== Translation Notes:â€‹ =====

  * **Why are you bowed down, my soul?** - The author refers to himself as "my soul". The author speaks to himself as if he were speaking to another person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **disquieted** - "not at peace"
  * **my help and my God** - This is written as two phases so that it has a stronger meaning. If necessary they can be combined. AT: "my God helps me" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hendiadys]])
