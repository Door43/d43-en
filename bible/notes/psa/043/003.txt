===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **send out your light and your truth; let them lead me** - Yahweh's "truth" is like a "light" that shows the way to go. AT: "give me your truth to guide my life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **holy hill** - This refers to the hill in Jerusalem where the temple is located and thus to the temple itself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **exceeding joy** - "very great joy"
