\q
\v 14 They are appointed, like a flock, to go to sheol;
\q death will be their shepherd;
\q the upright will have power over them in the morning;
\q their beauty will be for sheol to consume
\q so that there be no habitation for it.
\q
\v 15 But God will redeem my soul from the power of sheol;
\q he will receive me.
