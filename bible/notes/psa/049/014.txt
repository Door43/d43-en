<usfm>
\q
\v 14 They are appointed like a flock to go to sheol;
\q death will be their shepherd;
\q the upright will have power over them in the morning;
\q sheol will consume their bodies
\q and there be no place for them to live.
\q
\v 15 But God will redeem my life from the power of sheol;
\q he will receive me.

===== Translation Notes: =====
The author continues to describe people who believe their wealth will save them.

  * **like a flock**- People are compared to a flock of sheep because they will follow their shepherd. (See [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **death will be their shepherd** - This phrase refers to death and the person who leads sheep.  This means the choices of the people will only result in their deaths. AT: "death will take them away as a shepherd leads away sheep to be slaughtered" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **in the morning**  - Night is associated with death so the morning refers to after they die. AT: "after they die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * ** sheol will consume their bodies** - The world of the dead, called sheol, is here spoken of as if it were a person or an animal. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **from the power of sheol** - AT: "and sheol will not have any power over me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]]}
