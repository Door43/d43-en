  * **they ignored your many acts of covenant faithfulness** - The abstract noun "faithfulness" can be translated with an adjective. AT: "they ignored the many things that you did because you are faithful to your covenant" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **at the sea ... the Sea of Reeds** - These two phrases refer to the same sea. The second is the name of the sea.
