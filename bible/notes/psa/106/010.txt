===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He saved them from the hand ... and he rescued them from the power** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and are used together to emphasize that Yahweh saved them from their enemies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) 
  * **the hand of those who hated them** - Here the enemies' "control" is spoken of as their "hand." AT: "the oppression of those who hated them" or "the control of those who hated them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **covered their adversaries** - This is a polite way to talk about them drowning. AT: "drowned their enemies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **Then they believed his words** - Here the word "they" refers to "their ancestors" and the word "his" refers to "Yahweh".
