  * **the hand of those who hated them** - AT: "the oppression of those who hated them" or "the control of those who hated them" 
  * **covered their adversaries** - AT: "drowned their enemies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **Then they believed his words** - Here the word "they" refers to "their ancestors" and the word "his" refers to "Yahweh".
