===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Here 106:48 is more than the end of this psalm. It is the closing statement for all of Book 4 of the Psalms, which starts at Psalm 90 and ends with Psalm 106. 

  * **May Yahweh, the God of Israel, be praised** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "May people praise Yahweh the God of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **to your holy name** - Here Yahweh is referred to by his "holy name." AT: "to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **from everlasting to everlasting** - This refers to two extremes and means for all time. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:041:013|41:13]]. AT: "for all eternity" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
