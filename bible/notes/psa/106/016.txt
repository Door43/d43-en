===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **In the camp** - AT: "In the camp in the wilderness"
  * **The earth opened and swallowed up** - Here how the ground opens up and buries the people is being compared to how a creature swallows something. AT: "The earth opened and buried" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **Dathan**  - This was an official who rebelled against Moses. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Abiram**  - This was an official who rebelled against Moses. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Fire broke out among them; the fire consumed the wicked** - These two phrases mean the same things and are written together to emphasize how the wicked people were killed by the fire. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
