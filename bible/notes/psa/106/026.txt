  * **raised his hand** - The Israelites often raised their hands when swearing an oath. 
  * **scatter their descendants among the nations, and scatter them in foreign lands.** - These two phrases have basically the same meaning and are used together for emphasis. AT: "and that he would make their descendants live in foreign lands" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **scatter** - This means to disperse or spread out something.
