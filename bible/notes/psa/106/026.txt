  * **raised his hand** - The word "his" refers to Yahweh. Also, it was custom to raise a hand when swearing an oath. 
  * **scatter their descendants among the nations ... scatter them in foreign lands** - These two phrases have basically the same meaning and are used together for emphasis. AT: "and that he would make their descendants live in foreign lands" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **scatter** - This means to disperse or spread out something.
