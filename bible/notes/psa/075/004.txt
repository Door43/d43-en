===== Important Terms: =====

  * [[:en:obe:other:arrogant|arrogant]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:evil|evil, wicked, wickedness]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:desert|desert, wilderness]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

God continues to speak in 75:4-5. The psalmist begins speaking in 75:6.

  * **and to the wicked** - "and I said to the wicked" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **Do not be confident ... Do not be so sure** - It would be better to use the same words twice than to make these two lines one. "Do not be confident" is parallel to "Do not be arrogant," and "Do not be so sure" is parallel to "do not speak."
  * **with your head held so high** - "arrogantly" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
