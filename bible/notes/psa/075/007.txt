===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Asaph speaks about God.

  * **he brings down and he lifts up** - The objects of the verbs can be stated clearly: "he brings some people down and he lifts other people up." The words "brings down" and "raises up" are metaphors for God making people powerful and taking away their power. AT: "he makes one man king in place of another man" or "he takes away one man's power and gives power to another man" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a cup of foaming wine ... mixed with spices** - When Yahweh punishes the people they will be like people who have drunk strong wine and become ill. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **foaming wine** - The foam is a metaphor for the power of the wine to make people drunk, AT: "strong wine" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **spices** - dried leaves or ground seeds
  * **pours it out** - pours it from a large container into the cups that the people will drink from
  * **drink it to the last drop** - "drink every drop of it"
