===== translationNotes: =====

  * **he is the ruler over the nations** - Here "nations" represents the people of the nations. AT: "he rules the people of the nations" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **will feast** - The people will eat together at the feast. AT: "will eat together" or "will eat a festive meal together"
  * **all those who are descending into the dust ... those who cannot preserve their own lives** - Both phrases refers to the same group. They both refer to all people because all people will die. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **those who are descending into the dust** - Here "dust" represents the grave. The phrase "descending into the dust" is a way of referring to someone dying. AT: "those who are dying" or "those who die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
