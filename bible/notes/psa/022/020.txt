===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Rescue my soul** - Here "soul" stands for the whole person. AT: "Rescue me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **the sword** - The sword is a common way of referring to a violent enemy. AT: "those who want to kill me" or "my enemies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **my only life** - "my precious life" or "the only life I have"
  * **claws of wild dogs ... lion's mouth ... horns of the wild oxen** - The writer speaks about his enemies as if they were dogs, lions, and wild oxen to emphasize how dangerous his enemies are. Also, the claws, mouth, and horns stand for the animals as a whole in a synecdoche. The writer emphasizes these parts of the animals because they are the parts that the animals would use to kill someone. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **wild dogs ... wild oxen** - The word "wild" here means that no one has captured and tamed the animal.
