<usfm>
\q
\v 14 I am being poured out like water,
\q And all my bones are dislocated.
\q My heart is like wax;
\q It melts away within my inner parts.
\q
\v 15 My strength has dried up like a piece of pottery;
\q My tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth.
\q You have laid me in the dust of death.
</usfm>
