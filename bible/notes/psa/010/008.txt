<usfm>
\q
\v 8 He waits in ambush near the villages;
\q in the secret places he murders the innocent;
\q his eyes look for some helpless victim.
\q
\v 9 He lurks in secret like a lion in the thicket;
\q he lies in wait to catch the oppressed.
\q He catches the oppressed when he pulls in his net.
\q
\v 10 His victims are crushed and beaten down;
\q they fall into his strong nets.
