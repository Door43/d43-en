\q
\v 8 He waits in ambush near the villages;
\q In the secret places he murders the innocent;
\q His eyes look for some helpless victim.
\q
\v 9 He lurks in secret like a lion in the thicket;
\q He lies in wait to catch the oppressed.
\q He catches the oppressed when he pulls  in his net.
\q
\v 10 His victims are crushed and beaten down,
\q They fall into his strong nets.
