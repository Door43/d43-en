\q2 they do not even think that God exists.
\q1
\v 5 But \add it seems that\add* they succeed in everything that they do.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 The wicked people are very proud.
\q2 So they do not ask God for help;
\q2 they do not even think about him.
\q1
\v 5 But it seems that they succeed in everything that they do.
\q2 The things that you have commanded are too difficult for him to understand;
\q2 they mock their enemies.


\q1

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 4 Because the wicked man is so proud, he does not seek God.
\q He never thinks about God because he does not care at all about him.
\q
\v 5 He is secure at all times,
\q but your righteous decrees are too high for him;
\q he snorts at all his enemies.
</usfm>
