  * **wicked and evil** - These words have the same meaning. You can use one word to express both concepts. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Make him account for his evil deeds** - Making someone account for his evil deeds represents punishing him. AT: "Punish him for the evil things he has done" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
