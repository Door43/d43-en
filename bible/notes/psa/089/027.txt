===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues speaking about David.

  * **I also will place him as my firstborn son** - Yahweh giving David special rank and privileges over all other people is spoken of as if David would be Yahweh's firstborn son. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will extend my covenant faithfulness to him forever** - Yahweh speaks of continuing to act faithfully towards David is spoken of as if Yahweh's covenant faithfulness were an object that he extends or makes longer. The abstract noun "faithfulness" can be translated with an adverb. AT: "I will continue to act faithfully towards him forever" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **his throne as enduring as the skies above** - Someone from David's family always ruling as king is spoken of as if his his throne would last as long as the sky will last. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **his throne** - Here "throne" represents the power to rule as king. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
