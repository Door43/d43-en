===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Will you hide yourself**  - "Hide yourself" means that Yahweh withholds his presence and help. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **anger burn like fire** - The writer compares extreme anger to a fire. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]]) 
  * **the sons of men**  - "people and their descendants" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Who can live and not die or rescue his own life from the power of sheol?** - The writer assumes the readers know that no one can do so. He asked this for emphasis. AT: "Who can live forever, or rescue his own soul from death?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
