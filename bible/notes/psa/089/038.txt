===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **You have renounced the covenant** - AT: "You have rejected the covenant"
  * **You have desecrated his crown on the ground.** - AT: "You have defiled his crown on the ground." To push down into the ground or dust is a sign of great humiliation. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
