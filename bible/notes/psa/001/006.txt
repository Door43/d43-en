===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For Yahweh approves of the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish** - These two clauses contrast what happens to righteous people with what happens to wicked people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **the way of the righteous** - How people live is spoken of as if it were a "way" or "road" that they are walking on. AT: "how the righteous live (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **the way of the wicked will perish** - Here "way" stands for the wicked, who are figuratively walking on the way. AT: "The wicked will perish because of their way" or "the wicked will die because of the way they live" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
