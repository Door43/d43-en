\q
\v 4 Yet their words go out over all the earth,
\q and their speech to the end of the world.
\q He has pitched a tent for the sun among them.
\q
\v 5 The sun is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber
\q and like a strong man who rejoices when he runs his race.
\q
\v 6 The sun rises from the one horizon
\q and crosses the sky to the other;
\q nothing escapes its heat.

===== Translation Notes: =====

David has just said that creation shows God's glory.

  * **their words ... their speech** - This refers to the unspoken "words" of creation that show God's glory.
  * **their words go out** - The metaphorical words are described as if they were people who go out with a message. AT: "the words that creation speaks are like people who go out" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification|Personification]])

  * **He has pitched a tent for the sun** - AT: "God has set up a tent for the sun." Pitching a tent is creating a place where the sun can live and rest. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **among them** - "in them." The word "them" probably refers to the heavens. AT: "in the heavens"
  * **The sun is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber** - This describes a part of the wedding ceremony in ancient Israel. AT: "walking joyfully toward his bride" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
  * **like a strong man who rejoices when he runs his race** - This compares the sun to an athlete to emphasize the strength of the sun. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])

  * **horizon** - the line where the earth and the sky meet
  * **to the other** - AT: "to the other horizon" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **nothing escapes its heat** - AT: "everything feels its heat" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
