\q
\v 4 Yet their words go out over all the earth
\q and their speech to the end of the world.
\q He has pitched a tent for the sun among them.

\v 5 The sun is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber
\q and like a strong man who rejoices when he runs his race.
\q
\v 6 The sun rises from the one horizon
\q and crosses the sky to the other;
\q nothing escapes its heat.

===== Translation Notes: =====

David has just said that creation shows God's glory.

  * **their words ... their speech** - This refers to the unspoken "words" of creation that show God's glory.
  * **their words go out** - The metaphorical words are described as if they were people who go out with a message. AT: "the words that creation speaks are like people who go out" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification|Personification]])
  * **their speech to the end of the world** - AT: "their speech goes out to the end of the world" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **He has pitched a tent for the sun** - AT: "God has set up a tent for the sun." The pitching of a tent is a metaphor for a place where the sun can "live". (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **among them** - "in them." The word "them" probably refers to the heavens.
  * **sun is like a bridegroom…strong man** - This is a word picture to emphasize the beauty and power of the sun. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
  * **from the one horizon** - The word "horizon" refers to the line where the earth and the sky meet.
  * **to the other** - AT: "to the other horizon"
