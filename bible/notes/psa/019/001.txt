===== Translation Notes: =====

(See: [[en:ta:workbench:translate:poetry]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

    * **A psalm of David** - This can also be written as a sentence. AT: "This is a psalm of David" or "This is a psalm that David wrote"
    * **The heavens declare** - The heavens are described as if they were a person. AT: "The heavens show" or "The heavens look like they declare"
    * **the skies make his handiwork known** - The skies are described as if they were a teacher. AT: "The skies seem to make God's handiwork known to us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
    * **his handiwork** - AT: "his creation" or "the world that he has made"
    * **speech pours out** - What is beautiful about creation is compared to speaking, as if creation is a person. Then those words are compared to water that flows everywhere. AT: "creation is like a person speaking to everyone" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **There is no speech or spoken words; their voice is not heard** - These phrases make explicit that the first two verses were a metaphor. AT: "There is no real speech or spoken words; no one hears an actual voice with their ears"
    * **their voice is not heard** - Other translations read "where their voice is not heard", emphasizing that creation's "speech" is available everywhere.
