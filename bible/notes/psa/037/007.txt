===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **makes his evil ways succeed...makes evil plots**  - AT: "what evil men do is successful... wicked things that they plan" This emphasizes that the peace the righteous have is not effected by works of evil men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
