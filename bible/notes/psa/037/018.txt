===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **their heritage will be forever**  - AT: "the things that Yahweh gives them will last forever" (UDB) The idea of heritage shows that the good things Yahweh gives are all part of his family life and not rewards for what people do.  
    * **They will not be ashamed when times are bad** - AT: "They will not disgrace me when calamities occur" (See:[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
