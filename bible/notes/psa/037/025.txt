<usfm>
\q
\v 25 I was young and now am old;
\q I have never seen the righteous person abandoned
\q or his children begging for bread.
\q
\v 26 All the day long he is gracious and lends,
\q and his children become a blessing.
\q
\v 27 Turn away from evil and do what is right;
\q  then you will be safe forever.
