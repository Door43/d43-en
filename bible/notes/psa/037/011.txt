    * **his day is coming**  - AT: "the day is coming when Yahweh will judge and punish the wicked people"
    * **gnashes his teeth against him** - This picture shows the hatred wicked people feel for righteous people so their teeth clench together. "Teeth" represents the person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
