===== translationNotes: =====

  * **You return man to dust** - This implies that just as God created the first man, Adam, from the soil, God will cause people's bodies to turn back into soil after they die. AT: "You return people to dust when they die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **return man** - Here "man" means people in general. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_gendernotations]])
  * **Return, you descendants** - The words "to dust" or "to soil" are understood. AT: "Return to dust, you descendants" or "Return to soil, you descendants" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **you descendants of mankind** - This is a way of referring to humans in general. AT: "you humans" or "you people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **For a thousand years in your sight are as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night** - The writer means that a long period of time seems like a short period of time to God. AT: "You consider a thousand years the same as one day in the past, or as a few short hours in the night" or "Even a thousand years is not a long time to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **a thousand years** - "1,000 years" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **in your sight** - Here sight represents judgment or evaluation. AT: "to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
