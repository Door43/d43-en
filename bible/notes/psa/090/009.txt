\v 9 Because you are angry with us, you cause our lives to end;

\v 10 People live for only 70 years;
\q2 but if they are strong, some of them live for 80 years.
\q1 But even during good years we have much pain and troubles;
\q2 our lives soon end, and we die \f + \ft euphemism \f*.

<usfm>
\q
\v 9 Our life passes away under your wrath;
\q our years quickly pass like a sigh.
\q
\v 10 Our years are seventy,
\q or even eighty if we are healthy;
\q but even our best years are marked by trouble and sorrow.
\q Yes, they pass quickly, and we fly away.
