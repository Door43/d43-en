===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **a weaned child with his mother**- The child is no longer demanding breast milk from his mother. Possible meanings are 1) "a child who no longer drinks milk but is happy with to be with his mother" (UDB) or 2) "a child who has finished drinking milk for a while and is resting with his mother." If your language has a word for child that does not specify male or female, you may use it here.
