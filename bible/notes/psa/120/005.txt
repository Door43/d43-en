===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I temporarily live in Meshech; I lived previously among the tents of Kedar** - These two places were far away from each other. The writer is likely using the names metaphorically to represent living among cruel and barbaric people. AT: "It is as if I live in Meshech or among the tents of Kedar" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the tents of Kedar** - This phrase represents the people of Kedar who live in those tents. AT: "the people who live in Kedar" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I am for peace** - "I want peace"
  * **they are for war** - "they want war"
