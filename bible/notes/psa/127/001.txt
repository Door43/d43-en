====== Psalms 127:1-2 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 If people are building a house without \add knowing whether\add* it is Yahweh's \add will to build it\add*,
\q2 they are building it in vain.
\q1 Similarly, if Yahweh does not protect a city,
\q2 it is useless for guards\f + \ft Or: sentries \f* to stay awake \add to tell people if their enemies come to attack it\add*.
\q1
\v 2 It is also useless to arise very early and go to sleep late at night
\q2 in order that you can work hard \add all day\add* to \add earn money to buy\add* food,
\q1 because Yahweh gives food to those whom he loves.
\b
\q1

\q1
\v 2 It is also useless to arise very early and go to sleep late at night
\q2 so that you can work hard all day to earn money to buy food

\d A song of ascents, of Solomon.
\b
\q
\v 1 Unless Yahweh builds the house,
\q they work uselessly, those who build it.
\q Unless Yahweh guards the city,
\q the watchman stands guard uselessly.
\q
\v 2 It is useless for you to rise up early,
\q to come home late,
\q or to eat the bread of hard work,
\q for Yahweh provides for his beloved as they sleep.
