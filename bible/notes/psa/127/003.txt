\q
\v 3 See, children are a heritage from Yahweh,
\q and the fruit of the womb is a reward from him.
\q
\v 4 Like arrows in the hand of a warrior,
\q so are the children of one's youth.
\q
\v 5 How blessed is the man that has his quiver full of them.
\q He will not be put to shame
\q when he confronts  his enemies in the gate.
