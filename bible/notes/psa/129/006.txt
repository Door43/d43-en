===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 I hope\f + \ft Or: wish \f* that they will be \add of no value\add*, like grass that grows on the roofs of houses
\q2 that dries up and does not grow tall;
\q1
\v 7 as a result no one \add cuts it and\add* puts it in bundles and carries it away \add to thatch a roof with it\add*.
\q1
\v 8 People who pass by \add and see men harvesting grain usually greet them by saying to them\add*,
\q2 "We wish\f + \ft Or: hope \f* that Yahweh will bless you!"
\q1 But this will not happen \add to those who hate Israel\add*
\q2 \add because they will not harvest any grain\add*.
\q1 We, acting as Yahweh's representatives, bless you \add Israelites\add*!
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 I hope that they may be of no value, like grass that grows on the roofs of houses,
\q2 that dries up and does not grow tall;
\q1
\v 7 no one wants to cut it and tie it up as bundles and carry it away.
\q1
\v 8 People who pass by and see men harvesting grain usually greet them by saying to them,
\q2 "We wish that Yahweh may bless you!"
\q1 But this will not happen to the enemies of Israel.
\q1 We, acting as Yahweh's representatives, bless you, our fellow  Israelites!
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 6 May they be like the grass on the housetops
\q that withers before it grows up,
\q
\v 7 that cannot fill the reaper's hand
\q or the chest of the one who binds sheaves.
\q
\v 8 May those who pass by not say,
\q "May the blessing of Yahweh be on you;
\q we bless you in the name of Yahweh."
</usfm>
