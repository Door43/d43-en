===== translationNotes: =====

  * **we heard about it ... we found it** - The word "it" probably refers to God's sacred chest. AT: "those of us people of Israel who were in Ephrathah heard about the sacred chest" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **fields of Jaar** - the fields where people's animals grazed near a town whose name means Forest (ULB) or city of Forests (UDB). It is probably another name for the city of Kiriath Jearim (see UDB). (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **we will worship at his footstool** - AT: "we will worship him as our king" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **your resting place** - the sacred tent where they worship God (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
