===== translationNotes: =====

  * **you agree with him** - Possible meanings are 1) that they approve of the thief's actions. AT: "you approve or him" or 2) that they join the thief in their actions. AT: "you join him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **You give your mouth to evil** - God speaks of a person speaking evil things as if that person's mouth is a messenger whom the person sends to do evil things. AT: "You are always saying evil things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **your tongue expresses deceit** - The word "tongue" represents the person who is speaking. AT: "you are always telling lies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **You sit and speak against your brother; you slander your own mother's son** - These two phrases have the same meaning but use different words. God accuses them of speaking falsely against members of their own family. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **You sit and speak** - To "sit and speak" against someone implies that this person deliberately thinks of bad things to say about someone. AT: "You always think of ways to speak" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
