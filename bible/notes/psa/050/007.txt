===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I will not reprove you for your sacrifices** - "I will reprove you, but not for your sacrifices." God explains that their sacrifices are not the reason that he is reproving them.
  * **reprove** - "rebuke" or "reprimand"
  * **your burnt offerings are always before me** - This explains why God is not rebuking them for their sacrifices. The phrase "are always before me" refers to being in God's presence and means that his people are always sacrificing their burnt offerings to him. AT: "you are always sacrificing burnt offerings to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
