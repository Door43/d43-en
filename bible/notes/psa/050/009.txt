===== translationNotes: =====

  * **folds** - "pens" or "fences"
  * **the cattle on a thousand hills** - The phrase "on a thousand hills" does not represent the total number of cattle that God owns. The number is an exaggeration that emphasizes that God owns all of the cattle in the world. The verb may be supplied from the previous phrase. AT: "all the cattle in the world are mine" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **thousand hills** - "1,000 hills" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **I know all the birds** - Here the word "know" implies ownership. AT: "I own all the birds" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
