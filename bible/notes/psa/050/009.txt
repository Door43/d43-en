  * **the cattle on a thousand hills** - God uses a great number of hills where cattle live to refer to all the cattle in the world. AT: "the cattle of every hilltop" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **thousand hills** - "1,000 hills" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
