====== Psalms 050:21-22 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 21 You did all those things, and I did not say anything to you,
\q2 so you thought that I was \add a sinner\add* just like you.
\q1 But now I rebuke you and accuse you, right in front of you.
\b
\q1
\v 22 So, all you who have ignored me, pay attention to this,
\q1 because if you do not, I will tear you to pieces,
\q2 and there will be no one to rescue you.

<usfm>
\q
\v 21 You have done these things, but I have kept silent,

\b
\q
\v 22 Now consider this, you who forget God;
\q otherwise I will tear you in pieces, and there will be no one to come to help you:
