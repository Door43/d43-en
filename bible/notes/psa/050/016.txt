===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **What have you to do with declaring my statutes...and throw my words away?** - This question can be turned into a statement."It does not make sense that you declare my statutes and my covenant, since you hate my instructions and throw away my words." or "It is not right for you to declare my statutes" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **have taken my covenant in your mouth** - "talk about my covenant" or "claim my covenant" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **throw my words away** - Here, rejecting what God says, is being compared to throwing away trash."reject what I say" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
