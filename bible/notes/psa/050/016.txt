===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **have taken my covenant in your mouth** - To speak about something is referred to as having it in the part of the body used to speak. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **What have you to do with declaring my statutes, that you have taken my covenant in your mouth, since you hate instruction and throw my words away?** - This question is asked to emphasize that if the people have rejected God's instruction they should not claim for themselves the promises of God to his people. AT: "You have rejected my commandments so you should not claim for yourselves what I have promised for my people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **since you hate instruction and throw my words away** - Both of these phrases are different ways to express the same thing.  They are used together for emphasis. AT: "since you reject instruction" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **throw my words away** - To reject God's command is compared to throwing the words of his command away like trash. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
