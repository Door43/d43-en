  * **his right hand and his holy arm** - These phrases mean basically the same thing and are used together for emphasis. Also, his "hand" and "arm" are used to refer to his power and strength. AT: "his mighty power and great strength," (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
