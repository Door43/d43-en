\q
\v 12 For innumerable troubles surround me;
\q my iniquities have caught up with me so that I am no longer able to see anything;

\v 13 Be pleased, Yahweh, to rescue me;
\q hurry to help me, Yahweh.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **innumerable troubles surround me** - Here troubles are spoken of as if they were objects that surround and trap the speaker. AT: "there are more troubles around me than I can count" or "more troubles come to me than I can count" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
    * **my iniquities** - AT: "the consequences of my iniquities" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **have caught up with me** - The consequences of his iniquities are now harming him. Here iniquities are spoken of as if they were his enemies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]]) 
    * **I am no longer able to see anything** - Versions differ in how to understand this difficult passage. It may mean that the speaker is crying so much that he cannot see anything because of his tears (see UDB).
    * **my heart has failed me**  - "I am very discouraged" (UDB)
