\v 5 O Yahweh, my God, you have done many wonderful things!
\q2 No one can list all the wonderful things that you have planned for us.
\q1 If I tried to tell \add others\add* about all those wonderful things,
\q1 I would not be able to,
\q2 because there would be too many for me to mention.
\b

\q1 \add Animals\add* burned \add on the altar\add* and other offerings
\q2 are not all that you require \add for sins to be forgiven\add*.

<usfm>
\q
\v 5 Many, Yahweh my God, are the wonderful deeds that you have done,
\q and your thoughts which are about us
\q cannot be numbered;
\q if I declared and spoke of them,
\q they would be more than could be counted.
\q
\v 6 You have no delight in sacrifice or offering,
\q but you have opened my ears;
\q you have not required burnt offerings or sin offerings.
</usfm>
