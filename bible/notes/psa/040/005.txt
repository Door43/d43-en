\v 5 O Yahweh, my God, you have done many wonderful things!

\q2 are not all that you require \add for sins to be forgiven\add*.

<usfm>
\q
\v 5 Many, O Yahweh my God, are the wonderful deeds that you have done,
\q And your thoughts which are about us;
\q They cannot be numbered;
\q If I declared and spoke of them,
\q They would be more than could be counted.
\q
\v 6 You have no delight in sacrifice or offering;
\q But you have opened my ears;
\q You have not required burnt offerings or sin offerings.
