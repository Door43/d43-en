===== translationNotes: =====

  * **They open their mouths wide against me** - The reason they open their mouths is to accuse the writer. AT: "They shout at me in order to accuse me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Aha, Aha** - This is an exclamation that is used when something is suddenly seen or understood. It emphasizes the statement that follows. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclamations]])
  * **our eyes have seen it** - Here "our eyes" refers to the enemies' eyes. It is implied that they are saying they saw the writer do something wrong. AT: "we have seen it" or "we saw the wrong things that you did" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **You have seen it** - Here "it" refers to the false accusations of the writer's enemies. AT: "You have seen how they falsely accused me"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **do not be silent** - "do not ignore what they did" This can be stated in positive form. AT: "judge them because of what they did" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **do not be far from me** - This can be stated in positive form. AT: "be very close to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **Arouse yourself and awake** - This does not mean that God is actually asleep. The writer wants God to intervene. Both words mean basically the same thing and emphasize the urgency of this request. AT: "I feel like you are sleeping! Wake up" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **to my defense** - This abstract noun can be stated in another form. AT: "to defend me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
