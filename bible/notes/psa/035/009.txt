  * **Yahweh, who is like you ... those who try to rob them?** - The implicit answer to this question is that no one is like Yahweh. AT: "Yahweh, there is no one like you ... those who try to rob them." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the poor and needy** - The words "poor" and "needy" mean basically the same thing and emphasize that Yahweh saves many who need his help. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
