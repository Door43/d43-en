===== translationNotes: =====

  * **How precious is your covenant faithfulness** - God's covenant faithfulness is spoken of as if it were rare and expensive jewels. AT: "Your covenant faithfulness is as valuable as rare jewels" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Humanity takes refuge** - "People will seek protection"
  * **Humanity takes refuge under the shadow of your wings** - God does not really have wings. This is a metaphor for God's protection. AT: "Humanity takes refuge with you like young birds seek protection under the wings of their mother" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **They will be abundantly satisfied** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "You will abundantly satisfy them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **with the richness of the food of your house** - This does not mean that God has a house with food. This is a metaphor for abundant provision. AT: "as if they were eating the rich food from your house" or "with your rich blessings" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you will let them drink from the river of your precious blessings** - There are two metaphors here. God's abundant blessings are spoken of as if they are the water in a flowing river. Also, those who receive those blessings are spoken of as if they are drinking them like water. AT: "your precious blessings are like a river from which you will let them drink" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **fountain of life** - "source of life"
  * **in your light we will see light** - Here "light" is a metaphor for true knowledge. AT: "when you enlighten us, we will know the truth" or "your light is what enables us to know the truth about you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
