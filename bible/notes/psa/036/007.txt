    * **with the richness of the food of your house** - This does not mean that God has a house with food. AT: "as if they were eating the rich food from your house" or "with your rich blessings" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **you will let them drink from the river of your precious blessings** - AT: "your precious blessings are like a river from which you will let them drink" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
