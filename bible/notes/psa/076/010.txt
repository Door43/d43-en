===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **You fully reveal your wrath** - Possible meanings are 1) even Yahweh's judgment that does not cause people to praise him will show that he is angry (see ULB) or 2) those people whom Yahweh does not punish will stop wanting to sin and become his people (see UDB).
