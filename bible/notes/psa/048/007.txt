===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **With the east wind you break the ships of Tarshish** - The author stops his description to address God and describe an example of his great power. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
  * **As we have heard** - This refers to the stories of Yahweh's power like the example used in the previous sentence. AT: "As we have heard about your great power" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **in the city of Yahweh of hosts, in the city of our God** - Both of these phrases describe Jerusalem. AT: "in the city of Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
