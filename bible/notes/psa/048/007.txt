===== translationNotes: =====

  * **With the east wind you break the ships of Tarshish** - Possible meanings are 1) that this is a metaphor in which the author describes the kings being afraid as if they were ships that shake because God destroys them with a strong wind or 2) this is an apostrophe in which the author describes God's great power. AT: "They shook with fear, as the ships of Tarshish shake when you break them with the east wind" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
  * **the east wind** - Possible meanings are 1) "a wind blowing from the east" or 2) "a strong wind."
  * **the ships of Tarshish** - Possible meanings are that this refers to 1) ships that sail to or are built in the city of Tarshish or 2) any large ocean-going ship.
  * **As we have heard** - It is implied that what they have heard is the great things that God has done in the past. AT: "As we have heard about the great things that God has done" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **so have we seen** - This means that they have seen the proof that the things that they have heard are true. AT: "so we have seen God do great things now" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **in the city of Yahweh of hosts, in the city of our God** - Both of these phrases refer to Jerusalem. AT: "in the city of our God, Yahweh of hosts" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **establish it** - "make it secure." Here the word "establish means to preserve and make something secure.
