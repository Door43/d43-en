===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **in the middle of your temple** - "while in the middle of your temple"
  * **As your name is ... so is your praise to the ends of the earth** - These phrases are connected to say God is both praised and known in every place on earth. AT: "People know your name and praise you in every place on earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **to the ends of the earth** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:psa:046:008|46:9]].
  * **your right hand is full of righteousness** - Since God's right hand is full with righteousness, it cannot hold anything unrighteous.  God's right hand refers to his actions. AT: "you only use your power to do righteous things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
