\q
\v 4 For, see, the kings assembled themselves;
\q they passed by together.

\q pain as when a woman is in labor.

  * **assembled themselves** - AT: "assembled their armies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **They saw it** - The word "it" refers to Jerusalem.
  * **then they were amazed** - AT: "the city amazed them"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **dismayed** - "greatly troubled"
  * **Trembling** - "shaking with fear"
  * **pain as when a woman is in labor** - The word "pain" describes the emotion of being in uncontrollable pain.  Like "trembling" in the previous phrase, "pain" is in control of them. It is compared to labor pain because it is severe. AT: "pain took hold of them, as when a woman is in labor" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
