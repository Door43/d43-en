===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **through you ... through your** - "by you" ... "by your"
  * **push down... tread them under... rise up** - These phrases use up and down to refer to fighting their enemies.  If they have been pushed down, they have been defeated.  If they rise up, they prepare to fight. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **tread them under** - "walk on top of them"
