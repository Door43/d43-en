===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **sell your people for nothing** - When Yahweh allows his people to be taken into slavery they compare it to being sold for no money. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **You make us a rebuke...a scoffing and a derision** - (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) - These two phrases are parallel emphasizing how they are mocked by the people they live among.
  * **a scoffing and a derision** - These two words have the same meaning. They are both nouns meaning something that is mocked or ridiculed. AT: "a mockery and an object of ridicule" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]]) 
  * **an insult among...a shaking of the head** - These phrases are parallel emphasizing how wide-spread their ridicule is among the nations. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
