  * **why do you sleep...hide your face** - These phrases are used to refer to the Lord not doing anything to help. People who sleep and hide are not working to help.

  * **throw us off** - Taking off a piece of clothing is used to describe how God has rejected the people of Israel. 
  * **Why do you hide your face**- The word "face" is used to refer to the Lord's attention since a person turns their face to what they would like to see. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])  AT: "You are not helping us" 
  * **our affliction and our oppression** - "we are oppressed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **forget our affliction and our oppression** - "even though our enemies oppress us." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
