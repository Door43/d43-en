<usfm>
\q
\v 18 Our heart has not turned back;
\q our steps have not gone from your way.
\q
\v 19 Yet you have severely broken us in the place of jackals
\q and covered us with the shadow of death.
\q
\v 20 If we have forgotten the name of our God
\q or spread out our hands to a strange god,
\q
\v 21 would not God search this out?
\q For he knows the secrets of the heart.
\q
\v 22 Indeed, for your sake we are being killed all day long;
\q we are considered to be sheep for the slaughter.
