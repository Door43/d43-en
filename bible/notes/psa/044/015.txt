<usfm>
\v 15 All day I feel disgraced;
\q2 from seeing my face, people know that I am ashamed.
\q
\v 16 I hear what those who sneer at me and revile me say;
\q2 I am ashamed in front of my enemies and those who want to harm me.
\b
\q1
\v 17 All these things have happened to us
\q2 even though we have not forgotten you,
\q2 and we are not the ones who disobeyed the agreement you made with \add our ancestors\add*.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 15 All the day long my dishonor is before me,
\q and the shame of my face has covered me
\q
\v 16 because of the voice of him who rebukes and insults,
\q because of the enemy and the avenger.
\q
\v 17 All this has come on us; yet we have not forgotten you
\q or dealt falsely with your covenant.
