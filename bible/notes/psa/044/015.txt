\v 15 All day I feel disgraced;

<usfm>
\q
\v 15 All the day long my dishonor is before me,
\q and the shame of my face has covered me
\q
\v 16 because of the voice of him who rebukes and insults,
\q because of the enemy and the avenger.
\q
\v 17 All this has come on us; yet we have not forgotten you
\q or dealt falsely with your covenant.
</usfm>
