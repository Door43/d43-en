===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **For we have melted away into the dust**  - When something melts it becomes smaller until it disappears. If what gives them life has become small and weak then they cannot take action to help themselves. Both fear and sadness can cause this feeling. AT: "We are so afraid it is like the part of us that helps us fight has melted away" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **bodies cling to the earth**  - This is another way to say they have no energy to fight any longer. Like they are so weak they have fallen and lift themselves off the ground.
  * **Rise up**- This is a command to stand. This phrase is used to refer to beginning to act on something.
