\q
\v 6 The words of Yahweh are pure words,
\q like silver purified in a furnace on the earth,
\q refined seven times.

\v 7 You are Yahweh! You keep them.
\q You preserve the godly people from this wicked generation and forever.
\q
\v 8 The wicked walk on every side
\q when evil is exalted among the sons of men.
