===== translationNotes: =====


  * **You have turned my mourning into dancing** - AT: "You have caused me to stop mourning and to dance instead." People would dance when they were very happy.
  * **you have removed my sackcloth** - AT: "You have caused me to take off the clothes that I wear when I mourn"
  * **clothed me with gladness** - Hebrew often speaks of emotions as if they were clothing. AT: "made me glad" or "caused me to put on clothes that show that I am very glad." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **So now my glory will sing praise to you** - Many versions, including the UDB, interpret "my glory" to mean the heart of the Psalmist, who is honored to be able to worship God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) AT: "So now I am honored to sing praise to you"
