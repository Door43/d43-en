  * **What advantage is there in my death ... the grave?** - The psalmist uses this question to emphasize that he would be of no value to God if he was dead. AT: "There is no advantage in my dying and going down to the grave" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Will the dust praise you? Will it declare your trustworthiness?** - The psalmist uses these questions to emphasize that his dead and decayed body cannot praise God. AT: "My dust will certainly not praise you or declare your trustworthiness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the dust** - This refers to the body of the psalmist which will decay and become dust when he is dead. AT: "my decayed body" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
