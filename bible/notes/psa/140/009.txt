<usfm>
\q
\v 9 Those who surround me raise their heads; 
\q let the mischief of their own lips cover them.

\v 10 Let burning coals fall on them;
\q throw them into the fire,
\q into bottomless pits, never more to rise.
\q
\v 11 May men of tongues not be made secure on the earth;
\q may evil hunt down the violent man to strike him dead.
