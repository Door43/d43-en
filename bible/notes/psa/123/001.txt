===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Parallelism is common in Hebrew poetry. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **song of ascents** - Possible meanings are 1) "song people sang while going up to Jerusalem for a celebration" or 2) "song people sang while going up the steps into the temple" or 3) "song whose words are like steps." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:120:001|120:1]]
  * **I lift up my eyes** - Here the author refers to his eyes because that is the part of the body used for seeing. AT: "I look to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **enthroned** - sitting on a throne and ruling as king
  * **as the eyes of servants ... as the eyes of a maid ... so our eyes look** - These three phrases have similar meanings. The third phrase, about the Israelites, is being compared to how the servants and maids look to their masters and mistresses for help. In each case "eyes" refers to the whole person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **master's hand ... mistress's hand** - Here "hand" refers to the provision for needs. AT: "master's provision ... mistress's provision" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **maid** - "servant girl"
  * **mistress** - the woman who has authority over the servant girls
  * **has mercy on us** - The abstract noun "mercy" can be stated as an action. AT: "act mercifully toward us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
