===== Translation Notes: =====

See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry|Translating Poetry]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]

  * **A song of ascents**  - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:120:001|120:1]]
  * **I lift up my eyes**  - Here the author refers to his eyes because that is the part of the body used for seeing. AT: "I look to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **enthroned**  - sitting on a throne and ruling as king
  * **as the eyes of servants … as the eyes of a maid … so our eyes look …**  - These three phrases have similar meanings. The third phrase, about the Israelites, is being compared to how the servants and maids look to their masters and mistresses for help. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **maids**  - "servant girls"
  * **mistress**  - the woman who has authority over the servant girls
