===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **A psalm of David**  - “This is a psalm that David wrote”
  * **earnestly** - "sincerely"
  * **weary** - "tiresome" or "thirsty"
  * **my soul thirsts for you, and my flesh longs for you**  - These two clauses have basically the same meaning and are used together for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
