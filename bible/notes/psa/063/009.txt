  * **they will be given over to those whose hands use the sword** - Here "the sword" represents death in battle, and "those whose hands use the sword" refers to enemies who kill them in battle. This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will cause them to die in battle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
