===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He has pity on the poor and needy** - "He wants to stop the poor and needy from suffering"
  * **the poor and needy** - Here the words "poor" and "needy" mean basically the same thing and emphasize that they are unable to help themselves. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **redeems their lives** - Here "lives" refers to the whole person. AT: "redeems them" or "saves them" or "rescues them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **oppression and violence** - These two words mean basically the same thing and emphasize how badly the needy suffer. AT: "those who oppress them and hurt them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **their blood is precious in his sight** - Here "their blood" is a metonym for their well-being. The sight of Yahweh represents his judgment or evaluation. AT: "their well-being is very important to him" or "he wants them to live well" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **in his sight** - See how this phrase is translated in ([[:en:bible:notes:psa:019:013|19:14]]).
