===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **he has pity on** - AT: "he feels very sad for"
  * **the poor and needy** - These two words refer to the same group and are used together to emphasize how good the king is. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **the lives of the needy** - AT: "needy people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **their souls** - AT: "them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **oppression and violence** - These two words mean essentially the same thing and are used together to emphasize how bad the needy suffer. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **their blood** - AT: "their lives" or "their suffering" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **precious in his sight** - AT: "precious to him." This does not mean he likes to see their blood, but that their suffering feels like a precious loss. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
