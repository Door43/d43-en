===== Translation Notes: =====

See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]

  * **A psalm of Solomon** - Some versions understand this psalm as having been written by David for the time when his son Solomon became king. Other versions, including the UDB, understand this psalm as having been written by Solomon for his son who became king after him. Still other versions say only that some king wrote it for his son in the style of Solomon. The Hebrew text is not clear on this matter. So translators can choose to translate in the following ways: “This is a psalm that David wrote for his son Solomon” or “This is a psalm that Solomon wrote for his son" or "This is a psalm in the style of Solomon that a king wrote for his son."
  * **May he judge** - AT: "May the king judge"
  * **your people** - AT: "God's people"
  * **and your poor** - AT: "and may the king judge God's poor people"
  * **May the mountains produce peace ... may the hills produce righteousness** - The mountains and the hills stand for the whole land of Israel, they are described as if they are a machine that can produce peace and righteousness. Peace and righteousness are described as if they are some sort of material you can hold in your hands. AT: "May there be peace in the land ... may everything in the land be done righteously" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
