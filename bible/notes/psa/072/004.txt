===== translationNotes: =====

  * **he ... he** - These refer to the one who will "judge" ([[:en:bible:notes:psa:072:001|72:2]]).
  * **break in pieces the oppressor** - The writer speaks of the king defeating or punishing people who oppress others as if those people were objects that the king would break into pieces. AT: "punish the person who oppresses others"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **while the sun endures, and as long as the moon lasts** - The sun and the moon are metonyms for the day and the night, which together are a merism for all time. AT: "forever, and without ending" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
