===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The writer describes what God did.

  * **swarms of flies** - so many flies that it looked like a cloud
  * **that devoured them** - The flies made the Egyptians almost as unhappy as they would have if they had eaten the Egyptians. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **gave their crops to the grasshopper and their labor to the locust** - "allowed the grasshoppers to eat all their crops and allowed the locusts to eat everything they had worked hard to produce"
  * **overran** - "went everywhere in"
  * **grasshopper** - a plant-eating insect with long legs used for jumping
  * **He gave their crops to the grasshopper** - Asaph speaks of the crops as a gift that God gave to the grasshoppers. AT: "He allowed the grasshopper to eat their crops" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **their labor to the locust** - "he gave their labor to the locust." Asaph speaks of the people's labor as if it were a gift that God gave to the grasshoppers. The word "labor" is a metonym for the crops that their labor had produced. AT: "he allowed the locusts to eat the crops they had worked so hard to produce" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
