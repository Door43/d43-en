===== translationNotes: =====


  * **He caused** - "God caused"
  * **He rained down meat on them like dust** - "He caused meat to fall from the sky like rain, and there was so much of it that it covered the ground like dust" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **meat** - birds
  * **like dust** - Dust is many small particles, and people cannot use it. There were more birds than the people could use. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **as numerous as the sands of the sea** - No one can count the grains of sand. There were more birds than anyone could count, but this is an exaggeration: there were probably not literally the same number of birds as grains of sand. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
