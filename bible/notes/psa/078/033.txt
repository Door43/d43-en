===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The writer continues telling of what God did to the Israelites.

  * **cut short their days** - "killed them while they were still young" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **their years were filled with terror** - Asaph speaks of years as if they were containers. AT: "year after year they were afraid all the time" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to seek him** - to ask him what they needed to do so he would protect them (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **afflicted them, they would ... they would return and look** - These are different people from those whose days God "cut short." When some of them died, others would "start to seek" God.
  * **would return** - "would repent" or "would be truly sorry for their sins"
  * **earnestly** - "urgently" or "as best they could"
