===== translationNotes: =====

  * **They spoke** - the Israelites spoke
  * **Can God really lay out a table for us in the wilderness?** - This can be translated as a statement. AT: "We do not believe that God can really lay out a table for us in the wilderness!" or "God, prove to us that you can really lay out a table for us in the wilderness!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **lay out a table** - The idiom "lay out a table" means to prepare a table for a meal. Here the word "table" is a metonym for the food on the table. AT: "provide us with food" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **waters gushed out** - much water came out quickly
  * **But can he give bread also? Will he provide meat for his people?** - The people are laughing at God to insult him with these questions. AT: "But we will not believe that he can give us bread also or provide meat for his people until we see him do it." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **bread ... meat** - food from plants or food from animals. Though this is a merism for all kinds of food, it is best to translate it literally if possible. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
