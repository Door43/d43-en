===== translationNotes: =====

  * **called to mind** - "remembered." See how "call to mind" is translated in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:020:003|20:3]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **they were made of flesh** - The word "flesh," which is weak and then dies, is a metonym for human weakness and death. AT: "the Israelites were weak and would someday die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the barren regions** - "places where nothing grows"
  * **they challenged God** - They wanted God to prove that he could do what he said he would do before they would believe him. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:078:017|78:18]].
