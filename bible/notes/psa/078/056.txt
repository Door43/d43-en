===== Translation Notes: =====

The writer continues to describe what God did for the people of Israel.

  * **challenged ... defied** - These words mean almost the same thing. The writer uses them both to strongly say that the Israelites did not want to believe that God would either provide for them or punish evil as he had said he would. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **challenged**- See how you translated this idea in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:078:017|78:18]].
  * **defied **- "refused to obey"
  * **were unfaithful ... acted treacherously**  - These words mean almost the same thing. The writer uses them both to strongly say that the Israelites did not do for God what they had said they would do. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
