\v 11 The Lord spoke this message,

\q2 They got statues of doves whose wings were covered with silver
\q2 and whose feathers were covered with pure yellow gold.

But some of the people stayed with the sheep and did not go to fight in the battle. Why did you not go?

===== Translation Notes: =====

David continues the story of the journey of the Israelites through the desert. In this part of the story, the Israelites are victorious in war over their enemies.

  * **those who announced them...army** - Many people heard and obeyed the Lord's commands. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Kings of armies...why did you do this?** - The information in [[en:bible:notes:psa:068:011|68:12-13]] has been rearranged so its meaning can be more easily understood. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_versebridge]])
  * **Kings of armies flee, they flee** - The enemies of God's people were defeated. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **plunder** - things that are taken from the defeated army and brought to the victorious army's home.
  * **doves covered with silver...gold** - This means that some of the plunder is very valuable because it is covered with precious metals. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **When some of you people stayed among the sheepfolds, why did you do this?** - "Those who stayed among the sheepfolds should not have stayed; they should have gone to the battle." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
