\v 11 The Lord spoke this message,

\q2 When our army brought back to their homes the things that they captured,
\q1 the women who were at home divided up those things among themselves and among their families.
\q2 They got statues of pigeons whose wings were covered with silver
\q2 and whose feathers were covered with pure yellow gold.

But some of the people stayed with the sheep and did not go to fight in the battle. Why did you not go?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - David continues the story of the journey of the Israelites through the desert. In this part of the story, the Israelites are victorious in war over their enemies.

  * **those who announced them ... army** - The large number of people told the Lord's message to others. They are spoken of as if there were a large army. Since this phrase is feminine, some versions translate it as, "the women who announced them ... army." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Kings of armies ... why did you do this?** - The information in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:068:011|68:12-13]] has been rearranged so its meaning can be more easily understood. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_versebridge]])
  * **Kings of armies flee, they flee** - The kings represent themselves and their entire armies. It is understood that they flee because they are defeated by Israel's army. AT: "Kings and their armies flee from us because they are defeated" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **plunder** - things that are taken from the defeated army and brought to the victorious army's home.
  * **doves covered with silver ... gold** - This means that some of the plunder is very valuable because it is covered with precious metals.
  * **When some of you people stayed among the sheepfolds, why did you do this?** - This question is used to rebuke the people who did not participate in the battle. AT: "Those who stayed among the sheepfolds should not have stayed; they should have gone to the battle." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
