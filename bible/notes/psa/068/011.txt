\v 11 The Lord spoke this message,
\q2 and many people took his message to other places.
\q1
\v 12-13 They proclaimed, "Many kings and their armies are running away from our army!"
\q2 When our army brought back to their homes the things that they captured,
\q1 the women who were at home divided up those things among themselves and among their families.
\q2 they got statues of doves whose wings were covered with silver
\q2 and whose feathers were covered with pure yellow gold.

But some of the people stayed with the sheep and did not go to fight in the battle. Why did you not go?



\q1

<usfm>
\q
\v 11 The Lord gave the orders,
\q And those who announced them were a great army.
\q
\v 12-13 Kings of armies flee, they flee,
\q And the women waiting at home divide the plunder:
\q Doves covered with silver,
\q With wings of yellow gold.
 
When some of you people stayed among the sheepfolds, why did you do this?
</usfm>
