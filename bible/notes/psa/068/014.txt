\q
\v 14 The Almighty scattered kings there,
\q It was as when it snowed on Mount Zalmon.
\q
\v 15 A mighty mountain is the hill country of Bashan;
\q A high mountain is the hill country of Bashan.
\q
\v 16 Why do you look in envy, you high hill country,
\q At the mountain which God has desired for his dwelling place?
\q Indeed, Yahweh will live in it forever.
