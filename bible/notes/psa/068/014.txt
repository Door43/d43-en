\v 14 When Almighty God scattered the enemy kings and their armies,
\q2 it reminded me of a snowstorm on Mount Zalmon!
\q1
\v 15 There is a very high mountain in the Bashan hills,
\q1 a mountain that has many peaks.
\q1
\v 16 But the people who live near that mountain should not envy those who live near Mount Zion,

<usfm>
\q
\v 14 The Almighty scattered kings there,
\q it was as when it snowed on Mount Zalmon.
\q
\v 15 A mighty mountain is the hill country of Bashan;
\q a high mountain is the hill country of Bashan.
\q
\v 16 Why do you look in envy, you high hill country,
\q at the mountain which God desires for the place he will live?
\q Indeed, Yahweh will live in it forever.
