\q
\v 17 The chariots of God are twenty thousand, thousands upon thousands;
\q the Lord is among them in the sanctuary, as at Sinai.
\q
\v 18 You have ascended on high; you have led away captives;
\q you have received gifts from among men,
\q even from those who fought against you,
\q so that you, Yahweh God, might live there.
\b
