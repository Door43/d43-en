===== translationNotes: =====

  * **in the day of trouble** - Here "day" represents a longer period of time. AT: "in the time of trouble" or "when I have troubles" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **he will hide me** - "he will protect me"
  * **his shelter ... his tent** - Both of these refer to the tabernacle where the writer is worshiping God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **in the cover of his tent** - The word "cover" represents something that hides and protects.
  * **He will lift me high on a rock** - God keeping the writer safe from his enemies is spoken of as if God were placing him on a high rock where his enemies cannot reach him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **my head will be lifted up above my enemies** - This represents the writer receiving pride or honor when he defeats his enemies. It can be stated in active form. AT: "people will honor me when I win the fight against my enemies" or "God will honor me by enabling me to defeat my enemies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
