===== translationNotes: =====

  * **What would have happened to me if ... living?** - Some kind of information like this is implied by the Hebrew text, but versions differ on what they supply. AT: "Something bad would have happened to me if ... living." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]], [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the goodness of Yahweh** - This can be stated as an action. AT: "the good things that Yahweh does" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **the land of the living** - This refers to being alive. AT: "while I am alive" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **let your heart be courageous** - Here "heart" refers to the person. AT: "be courageous" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Wait for Yahweh!** - This line is repeated at the end of the psalm as a way of closing the psalm.
