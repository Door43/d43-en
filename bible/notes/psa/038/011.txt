===== translationNotes: =====

  * **lay snares for me** - The plots of the writer's enemies are spoken of as if they were traps that they had set to catch him like an animal. AT: "set traps to catch me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **speak destructive words and say deceitful words** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize the hurtful nature of what these people say. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
