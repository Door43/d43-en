===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 My friends and neighbors stay away from me because of my sores;
\q2 even my own family stays far from me.
\q1
\v 12 And those who want to kill me set traps to catch me;
\q2 those who want to harm me discuss the ways that they can get rid of me;
\q2 they plot against me all day.
\b
\q1
