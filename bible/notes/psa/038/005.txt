===== Translation Notes: =====


David continues describing what his guilt and shame does to his body. He uses hyperbole to emphasize his lesson.

  * **My wounds are infected and smell** - "Wounds" here refer to the writer's guilt and shame that is the source of his sickness. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
