===== Translation Notes: =====

David continues describing what his guilt and shame does to his body. He uses hyperbole to emphasize his lesson.

  * **there is no health in my bones because of my sin**.- AT: " My whole body is diseased because of my sin." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **they are a burden too heavy for me**.- (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
