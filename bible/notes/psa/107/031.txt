  * **Oh that people would praise Yahweh for his covenant faithfulness** - Here the word "Oh" is used to convey a strong desire for people to praise Yahweh. The abstract noun "faithfulness" can be translated with an adjective. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:107:008|107:8]]. AT: "Let people praise Yahweh because he is faithful to his covenant" or "People should praise Yahweh because he is faithful to his covenant" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclamations]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **praise him in the council of the elders** - "when the elders sit together." The elders sat together to discuss issues in the community and to make decisions for the community.
