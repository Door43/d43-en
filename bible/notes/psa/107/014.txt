===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He brought them** - "Yahweh brought those in prison"
  * **darkness and gloom** - Both "darkness" and "gloom" have basically the same meaning and are used to emphasize how dark the prison was. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:107:008|107:10]]. AT: "complete darkness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Oh that people would praise Yahweh for his covenant faithfulness** - "Let people praise Yahweh because he faithfully loves them" or "People should praise Yahweh because of his faithful love." Here the word "Oh" is used to convey a strong desire for people to praise him. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:107:008|107:8]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclamations]])
  * **For he** - "because he"
  * **For he has broken the gates of bronze and cut through the bars of iron** - Both of these phrases describe Yahweh freeing his people from prison and are used to emphasize that Yahweh truly freed them. AT: "He freed his people from prison" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
