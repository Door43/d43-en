===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He sent his word and healed them** - Here David describes Yahweh speaking as sending his words as if they were a messenger. Possible meaning are `1) "He commanded for them to be healed and they were healed" or 2) "He encouraged them and healed them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **and healed them** - "in order to heal them." The word "them" refers to the people who had become foolish and were suffering.
  * **Oh that people ... for humanity** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:107:008|107:8]].
  * **of thanksgiving** - "that show that they are thankful"
  * **proclaim his deeds in singing** - "tell others about the things he has done by singing joyfully"
