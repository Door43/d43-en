===== translationNotes: =====

  * **This was because they had rebelled against God's word and rejected the instruction of the Most High** - These phrases have similar meanings and emphasize how much they had rebelled again God, which is why they had been imprisoned. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **He humbled their hearts through hardship** - The heart represents the will of a person. AT: "He used suffering to make them willing to listen to himself." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **hardship** - Possible meanings are 1) "trouble" or 2) "hard labor."
  * **they stumbled and there** - The word "stumbled" refers to times when these people got into very difficult situations and could not get themselves out of these situations. AT: "they were in trouble, but there."
  * **Then they called out ... their distress** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:107:004|107:6]], but notice that "rescued" and "brought" are different.
  * **he brought** - "he saved"
