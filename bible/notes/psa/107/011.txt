===== translationNotes: =====

  * **they had rebelled against God's word ... rejected the instruction of the Most High** - These phrases have similar meanings and emphasize how much they had rebelled again God, which is why they had been imprisoned. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **He humbled their hearts through hardship** - Here the heart represents a person, but specifically his will. AT: "He humbled them by allowing them to suffer hardship" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **hardship** - Possible meanings are 1) "trouble" or 2) "hard labor."
  * **they stumbled and there was no one to help them up** - The word "stumbled" refers to times when these people got into very difficult situations. AT: "they got into trouble and there was no one to help them out of it"
  * **Then they called out ... their distress** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:107:004|107:6]], but notice that "rescued" and "brought" are different.
  * **he brought** - Here David describes Yahweh saving them from their distress as if their distress were a physical place that he was bringing them out of. AT: "he saved" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
