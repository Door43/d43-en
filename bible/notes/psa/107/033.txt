===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He turns** - "Yahweh makes"
  * **because of the wickedness of its people** - "because the people that live there are wicked"
  * **He turns the wilderness into a pool of water and dry land into springs of water** - Both of these phrases have similar meaning and emphasize how Yahweh makes water appear in the wilderness. AT: "He make springs and lakes in land that used to be desert" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
