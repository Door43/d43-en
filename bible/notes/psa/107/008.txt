===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Oh that people would praise Yahweh for his covenant faithfulness** - Here the word "Oh" is used to convey a strong desire for people to praise Yahweh. The abstract noun "faithfulness" can be translated with an adjective. AT: "Let people praise Yahweh because he is faithful to his covenant" or "People should praise Yahweh because he is faithful to his covenant" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclamations]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **humanity** - "people" or "humans"
  * **For he satisfies the longings of those who are thirsty** - "For he gives water to those who desire itâ€”to those who are thirsty"
  * **the desires of those who are hungry he fills up with good things** - "to those who are very hungry and desire food, he give them good things to eat"
  * **for humanity** - "for all people" 
  * **Some sat** - It is implied that these are people that Yahweh has rescued. AT: "Yahweh also rescued people who sat" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **in darkness and in gloom** - Both "darkness" and "gloom" have basically the same meaning and are used to emphasize how dark the prison was. AT: "in complete darkness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
