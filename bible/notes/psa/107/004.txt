\v 4 They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way;
\q They found no city of habitation.
\q
\v 5 Hungry and thirsty,
\q Their soul fainted in them.
\q
\v 6 Then they cried to Jehovah in their trouble,
\q And he delivered them out of their distresses,
\q
\v 7 He led them also by a straight way,
\q That they might go to a city of habitation.
