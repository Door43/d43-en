===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Of Zion it will be said** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "People will say about Zion" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Each of these was born in her** - People from other nations that worship Yahweh are spoken of as if they were born in Jerusalem. AT: "It is as though all of these people were born in Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in her** - It was common to refer to cities as "her." AT: "in Jerusalem" or "in Zion"
  * **the Most High himself** - The writer uses the reflexive pronoun "himself" to emphasize that it is the Most High who is doing this. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_rpronouns]])
  * **will establish her** - "will make Jerusalem strong"
  * **Yahweh writes in the census book of the nations** - Yahweh acknowledging that the people from other nations belong to him is spoken of as if he were a king writing down the names of the people who live in his city. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **This one was born there** - "This one" refers to the people from the nations that the writer mentions. Although they were not physically born in Zion, those who follow God are natives of Jerusalem spiritually.
