  * **The Lord's city**  - This refers to Jerusalem.
  * **established**  - The Lord built this city on the holy mountain. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **gates of Zion **  - "city of Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **tents of Jacob.**  - The people lived in tents while they wandered in the desert. Now the writer uses that idea to describe where they live. AT: "dwelling places of the Israelites." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
