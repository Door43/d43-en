===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]

  * **song of ascents** - Possible meanings are 1) "song people sang while going up to Jerusalem for a celebration" or 2) "song people sang while going up the steps into the temple" or 3) "song whose words are like steps." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:120:001|120:1]]
  * **Blessed is everyone who honors Yahweh** - This phrase occurs in the passive voice to avoid implying that Yahweh is obligated to bless those who honor him. AT: "Yahweh will bless everyone who honors him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **What your hands provide** - A man can be referred to by his hands because that is the part of the body he works with. AT: "What you provide" or "What you work for" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **you will be blessed and prosper** - The words "be blessed" and "prosper" share similar meanings and emphasize God's favor. AT: "Yahweh will bless you and prosper you" or "Yahweh will make you blessed and prosperous" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
