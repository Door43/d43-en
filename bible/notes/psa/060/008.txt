===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Moab is my washbasin** - God speaks of Moab being unimportant as if Moab were a washbasin or a lowly servant. AT: "Moab is like a bowl that I use for washing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **over Edom I will throw my shoe** - One possible meaning is that God speaks of taking ownership of Edom as if he were symbolically throwing his show onto that land to show that he owns it. AT: "I take ownership of Edom" or "I throw my shoe onto the land of Edom to show that it is mine"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **over Edom I will throw my shoe** - Another possible meaning is that God speaks of Edom being unimportant as if Edom were his lowly servant who was responsible to carry or clean his master's shoes. AT: "Edom is like a lowly servant who carries my shoes" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
