  * **For the chief musician** - "This is for the director of music to use in worship" 
  * **set to Shushan Eduth** - This probably tells what tune or musical style to use when singing the psalm. AT: "sing this psalm using the tune of 'Shushan Eduth'" or "sing this using the Shushan Eduth style"
  * **Shushan Eduth** - This means "Lily of the Promise." Translators may either write the meaning or copy the Hebrew words. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_transliterate]])
  * **A michtam** - The meaning of the word "michtam" is uncertain. You may use the word "psalm" instead. This can be written as: "This is a psalm that David wrote." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:016:001|16:1]]. 
  * **Aram Naharaim ... Aram Zobah** - "Aram of the two rivers ... the Aramean nation of Zobah." These are places. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])

  * **you have broken through our defenses** - God's allowing Israel's enemies to break through their defenses is spoken of as God himself had done it. AT: "you have allowed our enemies to break through our defenses" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
