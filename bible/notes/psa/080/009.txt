===== Translation Notes: =====


The writer compares Israel as a vine.


  * **You cleared the land for it; **- "You cleared the land for the vine;" (See: Metaphor)
  * **and filled the land....to the Euphrates River.** - The writer describes the success of the nation of Israel in occupying the whole land by comparing to a vine that grows far beyond the normal. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **shoots** - These are the parts of new plants that are just starting to grow above the ground.
