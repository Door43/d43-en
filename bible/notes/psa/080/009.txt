\v 9 As people clear ground to plant a grapevine,
\q1 you cleared out the people who were living in this land for us to live in it.

\q2 you enabled our ancestors to prosper and start living in towns all over this land.
\q1
\v 10 As huge grapevines cover the hills with their shade
\q2 and as their branches are taller than big cedar trees,

===== Translation Notes: =====


The writer compares Israel as a vine.


  * **You cleared the land for it** - "You cleared the land for the vine" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and filled the land...to the Euphrates River.** - The writer describes the success of the nation of Israel in occupying the whole land by comparing to a vine that grows far beyond the normal. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **shoots** - These are the parts of new plants that are just starting to grow above the ground.
