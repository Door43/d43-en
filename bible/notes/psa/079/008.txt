===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **against us**  - The pronoun “us” refers to God's people, Israel.
  * **Help us, God of our salvation, for the sake of the glory of your name; save us and forgive our sins for your name’s sake**  - These two phrases share similar meanings and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **for your name's sake**  - God's name here represents his whole being and the honor that God deserves. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **God of our salvation**  - The word "salvation" can be translated with the verb "save": "God who saves us." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
