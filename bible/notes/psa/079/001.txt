  * **A psalm of Asaph** - This can also be written as a sentence. AT: “This is a psalm of Asaph or “This is a psalm that Asaph wrote”
  * **They have given the dead bodies of your servants as food to the birds of the skies, \q the bodies of your faithful people to the beasts of the earth**  - These two phrases share similar meanings and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
