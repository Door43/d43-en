\q2 "If their God \add is very powerful\add*, why does he not \add help them\add*?"
\q1 Allow us to see you punishing the people of other nations in return for their shedding our blood
\q1 and killing many of us, your people.

\q
\v 10 Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?"
\q May the blood of your servants that was shed
\q be avenged on the nations before our eyes.
\q
\v 11 May the groans of the prisoners come before you;
\q with the greatness of your power keep the children of death alive.
