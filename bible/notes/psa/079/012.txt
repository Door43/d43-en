===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Pay back ... the insults ... Lord** - Asaph speaks of the evil deeds that the neighboring countries did against Israel as "insults," and as if they were physical items. He asks the Lord to count those deeds, and for every one that the neighboring countries committed, he asks the Lord to have someone do seven evil deeds to the neighboring countries. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Pay back** - "Return" or "Give back"
  * **into the laps** - onto their knees and thighs as they are sitting. This is a metaphor for "directly and personally." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **we your people and sheep of your pasture will give you thanks** - The word "sheep" is a metaphor for helpless people whom a shepherd protects and leads. AT: "we who are your people, whom you protect and lead, will thank you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **tell your praises to all generations** - "make sure that all generations to come know all the good things you have done"
  * **your praises** - This is a metonymy for "the good things for which people will praise you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
