  * **Pay back** - AT: "Return" or "Retaliate"
  * **into the laps** - AT: "onto their knees and thighs as they are sitting." This means directly and personally. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **we your people and sheep of your pasture will give you thanks forever. We will tell your praises to all generations**  - These two phrases share similar meanings and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
