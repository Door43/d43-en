===== translationNotes: =====


  * **No king is saved by a vast army** - This could be stated in active form. AT: "A large army is not what saves a king" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **A horse is false security** - Here "a horse" represents the strongest part of the army. AT: "Having an army with strong horses does not provide security" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
