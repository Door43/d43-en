  * **they will be brought down** - The word "they" refers to the people who trust in chariots and horses.
  * **brought down and fall** - Both these verbs mean basically the same thing and are repeated to emphasize how sure their destruction will be. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **we will rise and stand upright** - "we will get up and stand up straight." These two words basically mean the same thing and are repeated to emphasize how strong they are. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
