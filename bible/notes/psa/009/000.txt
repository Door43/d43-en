God is a protector. He is all-powerful and his enemies cannot withstand him.

This psalm along with Psalm 10 form an acrostic. Which means that each unit begins with a successive letter of the Hebrew alphabet.

This psalm has a superscription but Psalm 10 doesn't. This fact and the acrostic nature of the two psalms has lead some scholars to believe these two psalms may have originally been written as one psalm.
