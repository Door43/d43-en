===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **he establishes his throne for justice** - The words "his throne" represent God's rule. AT: "He rules justly." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **He judges the world fairly ... He makes just decisions for the nations** - These two sentences express the same meaning. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **He judges the world fairly** - Here "the world" means all of the people. AT: "He judges everyone fairly." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
