  * **For he will rescue you from the snare of the hunter and from the deadly plague** - The words that have been left out can be put in. AT: "For God will rescue you from the snare of the hunter and he will rescue you from the plagues that can kill" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **the snare of the hunter** - "from the snare that the hunter has let to catch you"
