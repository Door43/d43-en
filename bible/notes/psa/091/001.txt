===== Translation Notes: =====

See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]

  * **lives in the shelter of the Most High** - AT: "is protected by the Most High" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will say of Yahweh** - "I will say about Yahweh"
  * **my shelter and my fortress** - The words "shelter" and "fortress" mean basically the same thing. The writer uses them to speak of Yahweh as a place of safety where enemies cannot attack. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **my God, in whom I trust** - AT: "my God, who I trust" or "my God; I will trust him"
