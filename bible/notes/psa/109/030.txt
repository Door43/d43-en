===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **he will stand at the right hand of the one who is needy** - AT: "Because Yahweh is close by to help the poor person." The poor were (and are) especially vulnerable to oppressors, those who are able to deprive them of their rights. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
