\v 14 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with Jehovah;
\q And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.

\v 15 Let them be before Jehovah continually,
\q That he may cut off the memory of them from the earth;
\q
\v 16 Because he remembered not to show kindness,
\q But persecuted the poor and needy man,
\q And the broken in heart, to kill them.
