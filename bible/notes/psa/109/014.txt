<usfm>
\q
\v 14 May his ancestors' sins be mentioned to Yahweh;
\q and may the sin of his mother not be forgotten.
\q
\v 15 May their guilt always be before Yahweh;
\q may Yahweh cut off their memory from the earth.
\q
\v 16 May Yahweh do this because this man never bothered to show any covenant faithfulness,
\q but instead harassed the oppressed, the needy,
\q and the disheartened to death.
