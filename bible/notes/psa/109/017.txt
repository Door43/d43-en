<usfm>
\v 17 He liked to curse people.
\q2 So those terrible things that he requested to happen to others—cause them to happen to him!
\q1 He did not want to bless others,
\q2 so make sure that no one blesses him!
\q1
\v 18 He often cursed other people, also;
\q2 cause the terrible things that he wanted to happen to others to happen to him and enter his body as water does,
\q2 as olive oil soaks into a person's bones when it is rubbed on his skin.


\q1
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 17 He loved cursing; may it come back upon him.
\q He hated blessing; may no blessing come to him.
\q
\v 18 He clothed himself with cursing as his garment,
\q and his curse came into his inner being like water,
\q like oil into his bones.
</usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **may it come back upon him** - "may his curses come upon him"
  * **He clothed himself...into his bones** - David uses these images to emphasize that curses filled every part of the man, even the innermost part of him."Curses became part of who he was and all he could do was curse other people." (See:5. Clothing is Moral Quality and 6. A Liquid is a Moral Quality in [[:en:ta:workbench:translate:biblicalimagery]] )
  * ** as his garment** - "as if they were his clothing." 
  * **came into his inner being** - "entered into his body" 
  * **like oil into his bones** - "curses went into his bones like oil goes into bones." The bones are the innermost part of a person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
