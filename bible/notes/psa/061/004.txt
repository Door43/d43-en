===== translationNotes: =====

  * **take refuge under the shelter of your wings** - Going to Yahweh for protection is spoken of as taking refuge in him. Here there is a second metaphor that speaks of Yahweh's protection as if he was a hen protecting her baby chicks under her wings. AT: "go to you for protection as a chick is safe under the wings of its mother" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you have given me the inheritance** - The writer speaks of God's blessings as if they were an inheritance that he has received. AT: "you have given to me the blessings" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **who honor your name** - Here "your name" means God himself. AT: "who honor you" or "who have an awesome respect for you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
