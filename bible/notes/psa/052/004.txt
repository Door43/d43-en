  * **take you up…pluck you…root you**  - All three of these phrases are different ways of saying "to remove". (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **you deceitful tongue**  - This refers to the person the author is speaking to. AT: "you speaker of deceit" or "you who speaks deceitful words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
