\v 1 You \add think that you\add* are strong
\q2 and brag about the sins that you have committed,
\q1 while you plan to harm godly people.

\v 2 All during the day you plan to get rid of others;
\q1 what you say \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add injures others\add* like a sharp razor \f + \ft simile \f*,
\q2 and you are always deceiving others.

\q1
\v 2 All during the day you plan to get rid of others;
\q1 what you say is like a sharp blade,
