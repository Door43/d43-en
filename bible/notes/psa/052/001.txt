  * **For the chief musician** - "This is for the director of music to use in worship."
  * **A maschil** - This may refer to a style of music. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:032:001|32:1]].
  * **Doeg ... Ahimelech** - These are the names of men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Why are you proud of making trouble, you mighty man?** - This question shows how angry David was at the one who made trouble. AT: "You should not be so proud of making trouble, you mighty man." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **you mighty man** - David may have been using irony when he called Doeg this. AT: "you, who think you are so mighty" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **The covenant faithfulness of God comes** - David speaks of God's covenant faithfulness as if it were something that could come. David was probably referring to God's promises to protect his people from wicked people. This can be stated clearly. AT: "God is faithful to keep the promises of his covenant" or "God faithfully protects his people from wicked people like you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **a sharp razor** - a sharp blade 
  * **Your tongue plans destruction like a sharp razor, working deceitfully** - Here the tongue is compared to a sharp razor which is capable of causing great harm. AT: "Your tongue harm people like a sharp razor does, when you plan destruction and deceive others" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Your tongue** - Here "your tongue" refers to the person David is speaking to. AT: "You" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
