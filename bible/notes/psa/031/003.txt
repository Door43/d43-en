===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **for your name's sake** - In this phrase "name" represents God. AT: "so that your name may be honored" or AT: "so that I may worship you"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **lead and guide me** - The words "lead" and "guide" mean basically the same thing and strengthen the request that Yahweh lead him. AT: "lead me where you want me to go and always be by my side" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **you are my refuge** - AT: "you always protect me" or "you give me constant protection" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
