===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Into your hands** - God is spirit, but he is here spoken of as if he has hands. Here "your hands" refers to Yahweh's care. AT: "Into your care" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I entrust my spirit** - Here "my spirit" refers to the writer. AT: "I place myself" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **God of trustworthiness** - "you are a God I can trust"
  * **I hate those who serve worthless idols** - Here the word "worthless" refers to all idols. This can be clarified in translation. AT: "Idols are worthless. I hate those who serve them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_distinguish]])
  * **I will be glad and rejoice in your covenant faithfulness** - The words "glad" and "rejoice" share similar meanings and emphasize the intensity of joy. The abstract noun "faithfulness" can be translated as an adjective. AT: "I will be very glad because you are faithful to your covenant" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]]) 
  * **you saw my affliction ... you knew the distress of my soul** - Both of these phrases express the idea that God knows about the writer's troubles. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **the distress of my soul** - Here "my soul" refers to the writer. AT: "my distress" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
