  * **I hate those who serve worthless idols** - "Idols are worthless. I hate those who serve them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_distinguish]])
  * **you saw my affliction ... you knew the distress of my soul** - Both of these phrases express the idea that God knows about the writer's troubles. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
