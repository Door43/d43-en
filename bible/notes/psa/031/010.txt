\v 10 For my life is weary with sorrow
\q and my years with groaning.
\q My strength fails because of my sin,
\q and my bones are wasting away.

\v 11 Because of all my enemies, people disdain me;
\q my neighbors are appalled at my situation,
\q and those who know me are horrified.
\q Those who see me in the street run from me.
