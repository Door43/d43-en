\q1
\v 15 But when they dig a deep pit to trap others,
\q2 they themselves will fall into it.
\q1
\v 16 They themselves will experience the trouble that they want to cause others to have;
\q2 they will hurt themselves by the violent things that they want to do to others.

\v 17 I praise Yahweh because he always acts righteously\f + \ft Or: justly \f*;
\q2 I sing to praise Yahweh, the one who is much greater than any other god.

<usfm>
\q
\v 14 Behold the one who is pregnant with wickedness,
\q who  conceives destructive plans, and gives birth to harmful lies.
\q
\v 15 He digs a pit and hollows it out
\q And then falls into the hole he has made.
\q
\v 16 His own destructive plans return to his own head,
\q for his violence comes down upon his own head.

 
\q
\v 17 I will give thanks to Yahweh for his justice,
\q And will sing praise to Yahweh Most High.
</usfm>
