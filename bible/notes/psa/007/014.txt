\v 14 Wicked people tell lies,

\q2 \add just as surely as\add* a pregnant woman \add knows that she is going to give birth to a child\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\q1
\v 15 But when they dig a deep pit to trap others,
\q2 they themselves will fall into it.
\q1
\v 16 They themselves will experience the trouble that they want to cause others to have;
\q2 they will hurt themselves by the violent things that they want to do to others.

\v 17 I praise Yahweh because he always acts righteously\f + \ft Or: justly \f*;
\q2 I sing to praise Yahweh, the one who is much greater than any other god.

<usfm>
\q
\v 14 Think about the one who is pregnant with wickedness,
\q who conceives destructive plans, who gives birth to harmful lies.
\q
\v 15 He digs a pit and hollows it out
\q and then falls into the hole he has made.
\q
\v 16 His own destructive plans return to his own head,
\q for his violence comes down on his own head.

 
\q
\v 17 I will give thanks to Yahweh for his justice;
\q I will sing praise to Yahweh Most High.
</usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **one who is pregnant with wickedness ... conceives destructive plans ... gives birth to harmful lies** - These three clauses use symbolic language to express very similar meanings. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
