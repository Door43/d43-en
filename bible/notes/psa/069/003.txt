====== Psalms 069:3-4 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 I am exhausted from calling out \add for help\add*;
\q2 my throat is very dry.
\q1 Because I have cried so much as I have waited for God \add to help me\add*,
\q2 my eyes are swollen.
\q1
\v 4 Those who hate me when there is no reason to hate me
\q2 are more than the number of hairs on my head \f + \ft hyperbole \f*!
\q1 Those who want to get rid of me are strong,
\q2 and they tell lies about me.
\q1 They demand that I return to them things that I did not steal!
\q1

\v 3 I am exhausted from calling out for help;
\q2 my throat is very dry.
\q1 Because I have cried so much as I have waited for God to help me,
\q2 my eyes are swollen from tears.
\q1
\v 4 Those who hate me when there is no reason to hate me
\q2 are more than the number of hairs on my head!
\q1 Those who want to get rid of me are strong,

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 3 I am weary with my crying; my throat is dry;
\q my eyes fail while I wait for my God.
\q
\v 4 Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs on my head;
\q those who would cut me off, being my enemies for wrong reasons, are mighty;
\q what I did not steal, I have to give back.
</usfm>
