===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **I have borne rebuke** - AT: "People have condemned me" 
    * **shame has covered my face** - AT: "I have felt very ashamed".  It was as if his face was covered in shame and everyone could see it.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
    * **I have become a stranger to my brothers, an alien to my mother’s children** - These two phrases mean the same thing. David felt like a stranger among his family. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
    * **the zeal of your house has eaten me up**  - The term “zeal” can be translated as “energetic devotion”  or “righteous enthusiasm.” David is saying that his whole life is devoted to the worship of God (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
