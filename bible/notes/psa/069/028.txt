===== translationNotes: =====


  * **Let them be blotted out of** - Here "them" refers to the names of the enemies. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Wipe out their names in" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **not be written down** - It is inferred that "let them" is understood. This can be stated in active form.  AT: "do not write down their names" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **let your salvation, God, set me up on high** - The abstract noun "salvation" can be stated with the verb "save." Here "on high" refers to a place of safety." AT: "God, save me and put me in a safe place" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
