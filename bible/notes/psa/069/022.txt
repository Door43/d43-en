===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Let their table before them become a snare ... let it become a trap** - The writer would like for his enemies' food to completely ruin them as if they were small animals caught in a snare or a trap. AT: "May their food ruin them like a snare ... may it destroy them like a trap" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **their table** - This refers to food that was served on the tables, possibly at a feast. AT: "their own food" or "sacrificial feasts" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Let their eyes be darkened** - The writer speaks of eyes that cannot see well as if they were darkened. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Please make them unable to see anything" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **make their loins shake** - Weak backs are spoken of as if they are shaking in weakness. AT: "cause their backs to be too weak for them to do anything" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **their loins** - "their sides" or "their backs"
