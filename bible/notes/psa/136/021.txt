===== translationNotes: =====

  * **called us to mind** - "thought about us"
  * **helped us in our humiliation** - The condition of feeling shame is spoken of as if it were a place that the Israelites had been in. This is a reference to the many times when the Israelites' enemies had defeated them in battle and shamed them. AT: "cared when we were shamed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
