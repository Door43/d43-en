===== translationNotes: =====

  * **for his covenant faithfulness endures forever** - The abstract noun "faithfulness" can be translated with an adjective. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:136:001|136:1]]. AT: "because he remains faithful to his covenant forever" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **called us to mind** - "thought about us"
  * **helped us in our humiliation** - The condition of feeling shame is spoken of as if it were a place that the Israelites had been in. This is a reference to the many times when the Israelites' enemies had defeated them in battle and shamed them. AT: "cared when we were shamed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
