===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Who will see us?** - The evildoers do not expect an answer to their question because they think no one will see them. AT: "No one will see what we are doing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **The inner thoughts and hearts of man are deep** - The writer speaks of man's "inner thoughts" and "hearts of man" as if they were a deep body of water that no one can explore all the way to the bottom. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **inner thoughts ... hearts of man** - Both of these phrases refer to man's private or inner thoughts. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
