\v 6 Then we disappear like a shadow does.
\q2 It seems that all that we do is for nothing.
\q2 We sometimes get a lot of money, but we do not even know who will get it after we die.
\q1
\v 7 So now, Yahweh, I can expect to receive nothing from anyone else.
\q2 You are the only one from whom I confidently expect to receive blessings.

\q
\v 6 Surely every man walks about like a shadow.
\q  Surely everyone hurries about
\q to accumulate riches although they do not know who will receive them.
\q
\v 7 Now, Lord, for what am I waiting?
\q You are my only hope.
