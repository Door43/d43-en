===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Hear my prayer ... listen to me ... listen to my weeping** - These three phrases mean basically the same thing and show how strongly the writer wants God to respond to him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Do not be deaf to me** - The writer speaks of Yahweh's lack of response to him as if Yahweh was deaf. AT: "Do not ignore me as if you could not hear me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I am like a foreigner with you, a refugee** - The writer speaks of Yahweh's lack of response as if Yahweh considered him to be a total stranger to him. AT: "I am like a complete stranger to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Turn your gaze from me** - Here "your gaze" represents Yahweh's punishment. AT: "Please stop punishing me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **so that I may smile again** - Here "smile" is associated with being happy. AT: "so that I can be happy again" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
