===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I kept silent; I kept back my words** - These two phrases mean the same thing and emphasize that the writer did not speak at all. AT: "I was completely silent" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **I kept back my words** - Here "my words" refers to the writer's speech. AT: "I did not speak" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **My heart became hot ... it burned like a fire** - Here "heart" represents the whole person. The anxious thoughts of the writer are spoken of as if they were a fire burning inside him. AT: "I became very anxious when I thought about these things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
