===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I kept silent; I kept back my words even from saying anything good,** -  The writer emphasizes his effort to avoid talking by repeating. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **My heart became hotâ€¦it burned like a fire** - AT - "I became very anxious when I thought about these things." Heart represents the whole person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
