===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the end of my life ... the extent of my days** - These phrases mean basically the same thing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Show me how transient I am** - "Show me how brief my life is" or "Show me how soon I will die"
  * **only the width of my hand** - The writer speaks of his lifespan is if it could be measured by the width of his hand. AT: "only a very short time" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **my lifetime is like nothing before you** - This simile states that the length of the writer's life is so short that it does not exist. This is an exaggeration to stress how short it is. AT: "the length of my life is barely any time at all" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **Surely every man is a single breath** - The brevity of life is spoken of as if it was only as long as the time it takes for a person to breathe one breath. AT: "The time that humans live is as short as a single breath of a person." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
