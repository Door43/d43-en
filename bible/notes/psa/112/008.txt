===== Translation Notes: =====

The person who sings this song continues to describe a person who reveres Yahweh.
  * **His heart is tranquil** - AT: "He is confident." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **his righteousness endures forever** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:psa:111:001|111:3]], but notice that here "his" refers to the man who reveres Yahweh and not to Yahweh.
  * **he will be exalted with honor** - AT: "Yahweh will exalt him by giving him honor." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
