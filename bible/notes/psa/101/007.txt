===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Deceitful people will not ... liars will not ...** - These two phrases have the same idea and are used together to emphasize how David will not tolerate deceitful people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **liars will not be welcome** - "I will not welcome liars" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **before my eyes** - Here "my eyes" refers to David himself. AT: "before me" or "in my presence" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
