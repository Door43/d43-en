<usfm>
\v 18 Now I know that you will surely put them in dangerous places,
\q2 where they will fall down and die.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 18 Surely you put them in slippery places;
\q You bring them down to ruin.
\q
\v 19 How they become a wilderness in a moment!
\q They come to an end and are finished in awful terrors.
\q
\v 20 They are like a dream after one wake up;
\q So, O Lord, when you awake, you will despise their fleeting image.
</usfm>
