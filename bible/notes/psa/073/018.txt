===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 18 Surely you put them in slippery places;
\q you bring them down to ruin.
\q
\v 19 How they become a wilderness in a moment!
\q They come to an end and are finished in awful terrors.
\q
\v 20 They are like a dream after one wakes up;
\q2 Lord, when you arise, you will think nothing of those dreams.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **put them** - The word "them" refers to the wicked.
  * **slippery places** - AT: "unsafe or unstable ground."
  * **How they become a wilderness in a moment** - This phrase means  "How quickly they are destroyed."
  * **like a dream after one wakes up** - This phrase means "easily forgotten." The wicked will last no longer than what we see in a dream. It disappears as soon as one wakes up.(See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
