===== Translation Notes: =====

Asaph continues to describe "the wicked."

  * **They are free from the burdens of other men; they are not afflicted like other men** - These two phrases share similar meanings and emphasize how easy the lives of wicked people appear to be. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
