  * **I am always with you** - The word "I" here represents Asaph. The word "you" here represents God.
  * **you hold my right hand** - The person's "right hand" refers to the whole person. This shows an intimate relationship with God that offers stability and security. AT: "You hold me close" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **receive me to glory** - Possible meanings are 1) "put me where people will honor me" or 2) "honor me by taking me to where you are." See how "receive me" is translated in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:049:014|49:15]].
