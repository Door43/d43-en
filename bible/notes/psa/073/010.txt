===== Translation Notes: =====

The wicked people influence Israel.

  * **drink deeply at their words**  - This expression means "to listen." AT: "receive and absorb their words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom|Idiom]])
  * **They say**  - The word "They" here refers to the wicked people.
  * **How does God know? Does God know what goes on?**  - These two rhetorical questions share similar meanings and are combined for emphasis. The wicked doubt God's ability to know all things. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
