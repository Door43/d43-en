===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Asaph continues to describe how he sometimes wants to complain to God about those who are "arrogant" and "wicked" ([[:en:bible:notes:psa:073:001|73:3]]).


  * **his people return to here** - Possible meanings are 1) "God's people love the wicked people" or "the wicked people return to this place"
  * **waters of fullness are drained by them** - Possible meanings are 1) "God's people listen gladly to the words of the wicked people" or 2) "the wicked people have plenty of food to eat and wine to drink"
  * **They say** - the wicked people say
  * **How does God know? Is there knowledge with the Most High?** - These rhetorical questions are to show contempt for God. AT: "Surely God does not know what we are doing. The Most High has no knowledge of it." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
