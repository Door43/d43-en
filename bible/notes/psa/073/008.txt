===== Translation Notes: =====

Asaph continues to think about "the wicked."

  * **They mockingly say evil things; they proudly threaten violence.** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize how bad the things are that the wicked say. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **They speak against the heavens**  - The word "heavens" here represents God. AT: "They speak against God, who is in heaven" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **their tongues roam through the earth**  - Here the word "tongues" represent the wicked person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
