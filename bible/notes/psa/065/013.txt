===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **pastures**  - a large field where animals feed on the grass.
    * **flocks**  - group of animals, such as sheep and goats.
    * **clothed with flocks**  - This phrase is one way of saying that there were so many animals on the pasture, that there seems to be no space in between them.  It was as if the pasture was completely covered by the flocks. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
    * **they shout for joy, and they sing**  - The pastures, hills and valleys are so bountiful, that they seem to shout and sing for joy. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
