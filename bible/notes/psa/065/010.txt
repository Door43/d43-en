\v 10 You water its furrows abundantly;
\q You settle down the furrows’ ridges;
\q You make them soft with rain showers;
\q You bless the sprouts between them.

\v 11 You crown the year with your goodness;
\q The tracks behind your chariot drop fatness down to the earth.
\q

\q And the hills are dressed with a belt of joy.
