\v 20 My companion, whom I mentioned previously, betrayed his friends
\q2 and broke the agreement that he made with them.
\q1
\v 21 What he said was as easy to listen to as butter is easy to swallow,
\q2 but in his inner being he hated people;
\q1 his words were as soothing as olive oil,
\q2 but they hurt people as sharp swords do.

<usfm>
\q
\v 20 My friend has raised his hands against those who were at peace with him;
\q he has profaned the covenant that he had.
\q
\v 21 His mouth was smooth as butter,
\q but his heart was hostile;
\q his words were softer than oil,
\q yet they were actually drawn swords.
