===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Let death come suddenly on them** - Death is spoken of as if it were a person that could attack people. AT: "Let my enemies die suddenly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **let them go down alive to Sheol** - Dying suddenly is spoken of as if people were to go to Sheol so fast that they do not even die first. AT: "let them suddenly go to Sheol" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **wickedness is where they live** - Wickedness is spoken of as if it were a thing that could be in a certain place. The habitual wickedness of his enemies is spoken of as if wickedness were with them or near them. AT: "they always do wicked things where they live" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **right among them** - This phrase intensifies the idea of wickedness being very near them. Here wickedness is spoken of as being not only in their homes, but right where they are. AT: "They always do wicked things wherever they are" or "wherever they are" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
