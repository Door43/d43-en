<usfm>
\v 12 If it were an enemy who was making fun of me,
\q2 I could endure it.
\q1 If it were someone who hates me, who despises me,
\q2 I could hide from him.
\q1
\v 13 But it is someone who is just like me, my companion,
\q2 someone who was my friend \add who is doing this to me\add*.
\q1
\v 14 We previously had many good talks together;
\q2 we walked around together in God's temple.

\q
\v 12 For it was not an enemy who rebuked me,
\q then I could have borne it;
\q neither was it he who hated me who raised himself up against me,
\q then I would have hidden myself from him.
\q
\v 13 But it was you, a man equal to myself,
\q my companion and my close friend.
\q
\v 14 We had sweet fellowship together;
\q we walked in the house of God with the throng.
