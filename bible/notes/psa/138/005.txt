===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Yahweh is high, yet he cares for the lowly** - Here "high" stands for the great honor and power that belong to Yahweh. AT: "Yahweh has all honor and power, but he cares for those who have nothing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]], [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]))
  * **the proud he knows from far off** - This expression probably means that God is not faithful to those who are proud. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]))
