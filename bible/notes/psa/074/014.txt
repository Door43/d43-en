===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Asaph continues to speak of what God did long ago. He is probably speaking of when God brought Israel out of Egypt and drowned Pharaoh's army in the Sea of Reeds. If possible, these words should be translated literally.

  * **leviathan** - Leviathan is a sea monster. It represents a cruel enemy. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **You broke open springs and streams** - Yahweh causing springs and streams to flow out of the ground as if he broke open the ground so that they could flow. AT: "You caused springs and streams to flow out of the ground" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
