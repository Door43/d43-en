===== translationNotes: =====

  * **defend your own honor** - "show everyone that you are right"
  * **call to mind** - "Pay attention to." God has not forgotten how fools insult him, but he does not seem to be thinking about it. See how this is translated in verse [[:en:bible:notes:psa:074:001|2]].
  * **the voice of your adversaries** - The word "voice" is a metonym for the words people use when they speak. AT: "what your adversaries are saying"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **or the uproar of those who continually defy you** - The psalmist speaks of the words of those who defy God as if they were the loud sound of animals or non-living objects like water or the wind. AT: "and pay attention to the loud and meaningless words of those who continually defy you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **defy** - boldly oppose
