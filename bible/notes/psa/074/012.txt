===== Translation Notes: =====

This begins a new theme: Asaph is proclaiming God's mighty deeds in the history of his people.

  * **You divided the sea by your strength**  - The word "You" here represents Yahweh. This sentence shows Yahweh's great power. It may refer to creation of the world or to when the Israelites crossed the Reed Sea.
  * **the sea**  - AT: "great waters."
