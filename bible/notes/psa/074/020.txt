===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Asaph continues his lament to Yahweh.

  * **the dark regions of the land are full of places of violence** - Asaph speaks of "regions" as if they were containers in which one could put "places of violence." AT: "violent people do evil deeds in dark places in the land wherever they can" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the dark regions of the land** - The word "dark" is probably a metaphor for a place where bad things happen or for the lands to which the Israelites had been sent in exile, but these words should be translated literally if possible. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Do not let the oppressed be turned back in shame** - "Do not let wicked people defeat the oppressed and make them ashamed"
  * **the poor and oppressed** - The words "poor" and "oppressed" mean basically the same thing and emphasize that Yahweh saves many who need his help. See how these words are translated in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:035:009|35:10]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **oppressed** - those to whom powerful people are cruel
