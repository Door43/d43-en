===== translationNotes: =====

  * **They have surrounded my steps** - Here "surrounded my steps" represents how David's enemies have followed him everywhere he goes in order to capture him. AT: "My enemies have surrounded me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **like a lion eager for a victim ... a young lion crouching in hidden places** - These two phrases express very similar ideas. The repetition adds intensity. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **They are like a lion** - The writer feels pursued the way a lion hunts its prey (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
