===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Rescue my life from the wicked by your sword ... Rescue me from men by your hand, Yahweh, from men of this world** - These two clauses have similar meanings. The repetition adds intensity to the writer's words. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])   
  * **by your sword ... by your hand** - Here "sword" and "hand" both represent the power of Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **You will fill the bellies of your treasured ones with riches** - The ancient text is corrupt here. Possible meanings are 1) that Yahweh will provide great blessings to his people. AT: "You will bless your people richly" or 2) that Yahweh greatly punishes the wicked people to their children and grandchildren. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
