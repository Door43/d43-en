===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **gird up your loins like a man** - This compares Job to a man getting ready for work. "Gird up your loins" means to tuck one robe up under their sash or belt, so the person can work. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
