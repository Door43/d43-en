\q
\v 22 The lotus-trees cover him with their shade;
\q The willows of the brook compass him about.
\q
\v 23 Behold, if a river overflow, he trembleth not;
\q He is confident, though a Jordan swell even to his mouth.
\q
\v 24 Shall any take him when he is on the watch,
\q Or pierce through his nose with a snare?
