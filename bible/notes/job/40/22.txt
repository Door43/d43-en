<usfm>
\q
\v 22 The lotus plants cover him with their shade;
\q the willows of the brook are all around him.
\q
\v 23 See, if a river floods its banks, he does not tremble;
\q he is confident, though the Jordan should surge up to his mouth.
\q
\v 24 Can anyone capture him with a hook,
\q or pierce his nose through with a snare?
