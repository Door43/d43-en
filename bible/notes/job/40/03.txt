===== translationNotes: =====

  * **See** - "Indeed." The word "behold" here adds emphasis to what follows.
  * **I am insignificant** - "I am not important" 
  * **how can I answer you** - Job uses this question to apologize for questioning God. AT: "I cannot answer you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
