This can be translated as a statement. AT: "I am surprised that you are saying I am unjust." or "You should be sure that you want to say that I am unjust, because that is what you are saying." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

  * **arm like God's** - The arm is a metonym for the strength in the arm. AT: "strength like God's strength" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Can you thunder with a voice like him?** - This can be translated as a statement. AT: "You certainly cannot cause thunder with your voice the way God does with his." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **a voice like him** - "a voice the way he does." Most translations read, "a voice like his voice" (see UDB).
