<usfm>
\q
\v 16 Even if I called and he answered me,
\q I would not believe that he was listening to my voice.
\q
\v 17 For he breaks me with a tempest
\q and multiplies my wounds without cause.
\q
\v 18 He does not even allow me to catch my breath;
\q instead, he fills me with bitterness.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **For he breaks me with a tempest** - Job compares his troubles to a tempest or storm or storm wind.  Just as a tempest can destroy things and people, the troubles God sends are destroying Job. "He attacks me with a storm" or "He crushes me with a tempest." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and multiples my wounds without cause** - "and gives me many wounds for no reason"
  * **He does not even allow me to catch my breath** - "He does not allow me to breathe a breath" or "He does not give me relief from pain"
  * **he fills me with bitterness** - "he fills me with misery"
