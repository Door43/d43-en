====== Job 09:21-24 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 21 I have not done what is wrong, but that is not important.
\q2 I despise continuing to remain alive.
\q1
\v 22 Nothing is important to me,
\q2 because God will get rid of \add all of us\add*, both those who are innocent and those who are wicked.
\q1
\v 23 When people experience disaster and it causes them to suddenly die,
\q2 God laughs at it, even if they are innocent.
\q1
\v 24 God has allowed wicked people to control \add what happens in\add* the world.
\q2 \add It is as though\add* he has caused judges to be blind, \add with the result that they cannot judge fairly\add*.
\q1 If it is not God who has done that,
\q2 who has done it?

<usfm>
\v 21 I have not done anything wrong, but that is not important anymore because I do not care what happens to me.
\q2 I despise living.
\q1
\v 22 Nothing is important to me
\q2 because God will get rid of all of us, both those who are innocent and those who are wicked.
\q1
\v 23 When people experience disaster and it causes them to suddenly die,
\q2 God laughs at it, even if they are innocent.
\q1
\v 24 God has allowed wicked people to control what happens in the world.
\q2 It is as though he had caused judges to be blind, no longer able to judge fairly.
\q1 If it is not God who has done that,
\q2 who, then, has done it?

<usfm>
\q
\v 21 I am blameless, but I do not care any more about myself;
\q I despise my own life.
\q
\v 22 It makes no difference, which is why I say
\q that he destroys blameless people and wicked people together.
\q
\v 23 If a plague should suddenly kill,
\q he would laugh at the afflictions of innocent people.
\q
\v 24 The earth is given into the hand of wicked people;
\q God covers the faces of its judges.
\q If it is not he who does it, then who is it?
