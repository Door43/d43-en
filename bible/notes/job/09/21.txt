\v 21 I have not done anything wrong, but that is not important anymore because I do not care what happens to me.
\q2 I despise living.
\q1
\v 22 Nothing is important to me
\q2 because God will get rid of all of us, both those who are innocent and those who are wicked.
\q1
\v 23 When people experience disaster and it causes them to suddenly die,
\q2 God laughs at it, even if they are innocent.
\q1
\v 24 God has allowed wicked people to control what happens in the world.
\q2 It is as though he had caused judges to be blind, no longer able to judge fairly.

<usfm>
\q
\v 21 I am perfect, but I do not care any more about myself;
\q I despise my own life.
\q
\v 22 It makes no difference, which is why I say
\q that he destroys the perfect and the wicked together.
\q
\v 23 If a plague should suddenly kill, 
\q he would laugh at the afflictions of the innocent.
\q
\v 24 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked;
\q God covers the faces of its judges.
\q If it is not he who does it, then who is it?
\b
