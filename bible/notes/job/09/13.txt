\q1

<usfm>
\q
\v 13 God will not withdraw his anger;
\q the helpers of Rahab bow beneath him.
\q
\v 14 How much less could I answer him,
\q could I choose words to reason with him?
\q
\v 15 Even if I were righteous, I could not answer him;
\q I could only plead for mercy with my judge.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the helpers of Rahab** - "Rahab" seems to be a powerful force of evil or a sea creature.
  * **How much less could I answer him, could I choose words to reason with him?** - Job poses parallel questions to emphasize his reluctance to confront God.  AT: "What could I say to answer or even question him?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
