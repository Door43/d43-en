\v 10 It is the same God who does great things, incomprehensible things—
\q indeed, marvelous things without number.
\q
\v 11 See, he goes by me, and I do not see him;
\q he passes on also, but I do not perceive him.
\q
\v 12 If he takes something away, who can stop him?
\q Who can say to him, 'What are you doing?'
