===== Translation Notes: =====

The writer continues to use parallelism in each of these verses, conveying a single idea using double statements to emphasize that God is mighty, unseen, and beyond grasp. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **It is the same God who does great things, incomprehensible things** - "He does unsearchably great things" or "He does things so great that no one can search them"
  * **Indeed, marvelous things without number** - "marvelous things that cannot be counted"
  * **he passes on also, but I do not perceive him** - "God moves by, but I do not realize it."
  * **If he catches a victim** - "If he tears someone away" or "If he snatches someone away"
