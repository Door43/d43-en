<usfm>
\v 27 If I smile and say \add to God\add*, 'I will forget what I am complaining about;
\q2 I will stop looking sad and try to be cheerful\f + \ft Or: happy \f*,'
\q1
\v 28 then I become afraid because of all that I am suffering
\q2 because I know that God does not consider that I am innocent.
\q1
\v 29 He will condemn me\f + \ft Or: declare that I should be punished \f*,
\q2 so why should I keep trying in vain \add to defend myself\add*?

<usfm>
\v 27 If I smile and say to God, 'I will forget what I am complaining about;
\q2 I will stop looking sad and try to be cheerful,'
\q1
\v 28 then I become afraid because of all that I am suffering
\q2 because I know that God does not consider that I am innocent.
\q1
\v 29 He will condemn me anyway,
\q2 so why should I keep trying in vain to defend myself?

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 27 If I said that I would forget about my complaints,
\q that I would take off my sad face and be happy,
\q
\v 28 I would be afraid of all my sorrows
\q because I know that you will not consider me innocent.
\q
\v 29 I will be condemned;
\q why, then, should I try in vain?
