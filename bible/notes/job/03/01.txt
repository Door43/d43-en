===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **opened his mouth**  - "began to speak" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom|Idiom]]) (See: UDB)
  * **Let the day on which I was born perish**  - AT: "I wish that I had never been born." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification|Personification]])
  * **the day…the night**  - "the day" refers to the day of his birth and "the night" to the day of his conception.
  * **the night that said, 'A boy has been conceived'** - AT: "let the night that said, 'A boy has been conceived' perish." This expression intensifies the statement of Job's grief by going even further back in time from his birth to his conception. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis|Ellipsis]])
  * **the night that said**  - AT: "the night about which people said." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification|Personification]])
  * **A boy has been conceived**  - AT: "she has conceived a man child."
