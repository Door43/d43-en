===== translationNotes: =====

  * **opened his mouth** - This idiom means he began to speak. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **May the day on which I was born perish, the night** - Job speaks of that day and night as if they were people. AT: "I wish that I had never been born" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **the night that said, 'A boy has been conceived.'** - This expression intensifies the statement of Job's grief by going even further back in time from his birth to his conception. AT: "the night that said, 'A boy has been conceived' perish." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **the night that said** - Here the night is spoken of as if it were a person who could speak. The translator may choose, however, to translate it in a less metaphorical way. AT: "the night about which people said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **A boy has been conceived** - This may be put into active form. AT: "his mother has conceived a male child"
