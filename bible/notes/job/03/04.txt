\q
\v 4 Let that day be darkness;
\q let not God from above call it to mind,
\q neither let the sunlight shine on it.
\q
\v 5 Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own;
\q let a cloud live on it;
\q let everything that makes the day black truly terrify it.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Let that day be darkness ... neither let the sunlight shine on it** - These two clauses describe the darkness of the day of Job's birth, thus repeating Job's regret that he had been born. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) 
  * **Let that day be darkness** - Darkness is a metonym for something that does not exist. AT: "let that day disappear." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **let not God** - AT: "may God not"
  * **Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own** - Here the human ability to claim something is applied to darkness and the shadow of death. The word "it" refers to the day of Job's birth. (See: [[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **let a cloud live on it** - "let a cloud cover it." AT: "let a cloud cover it so no one can see it." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **everything that makes the day black** - This refers to things that block out the sun's light.
