===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This passage contains four rhetorical questions, which Job asks in order to really make a series of statements.

  * **Why did I not die when I came out from the womb?** - "Why did I not die at birth?" Job poses this question in order to curse the day of his birth and to express his anguish. AT: "I wish I had died the day I was born" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Why did I not give up my spirit when my mother bore me?** - Job means to say that he should not have been born alive. AT: "I wish I had died when I came out of the womb." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **give up my spirit** - This refers to dying.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Why did her knees welcome me?** - This perhaps refers to the lap of Job's mother. His mother's knees are spoken of as if they were people who could welcome a newborn baby. AT: "I wish there had been no lap to receive me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **Why did her breasts receive me so that I should suck?** - Job's mother's breasts are spoken of as if they also were people who could welcome a newborn baby. AT: "I wish there had been no breasts for me to nurse." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
