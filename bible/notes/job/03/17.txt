===== Translation Notes: =====

Job changes his talk from dying to life after death.

    * **There the wicked cease from trouble; there the weary are at rest** - Job uses parallelism to emphasize that the lowly will find rest from those causing them hardship. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **There the wicked cease from trouble** - Job is talking about the place where people go after they stop living.   AT: "In that place, evil people stop causing trouble." 
    * **cease from trouble** - AT: "stop causing trouble" 
    * **there the weary are at rest** - AT: "in that place, very tired people are at peace." 
    * **There the prisoners are at ease together** - AT: "People who were in prison are at peace together."
    * **the voice of the slave driver** - Here "voice" is a metonym for the power that the slave drivers have over the slaves. AT: "They are no longer under the control of the slave drivers." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **The small and the great** - This is a figure of speech which means "all people, both poor people and rich people." (See:  [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
    * **the servant is free from his master** - A servant is no longer obligated to serve his master.
