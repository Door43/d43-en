  * **I would have been lying down quietly** - Job imagines something that could have happened in the past but which did not happen, as noted above.  AT: "I should have been lying down quietly." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]]) 
  * **lying down quietly** - AT: "asleep, resting peacefully" (See: UDB)
  * **lying down** - The writer uses this phrase as a mild way of referring to death because direct references to death may be considered unpleasant or offensive. AT: "no longer alive" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **I would have slept and been at rest** - (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
