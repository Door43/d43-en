===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Why is light given to him who is in misery? Why is life given to the one who is bitter in soul** - Job's two questions mean basically the same thing. He is wondering why those who face hardship continue to live. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Why is light given to him who is in misery?** - He is wondering why people must stay alive and suffer. AT: "I do not understand why God gives life to a person who is suffering" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Why is life given to the one who is bitter in soul ... hidden treasure?** - "why does God give life to a miserable person?" AT: "I do not understand why God gives life to a person who is very unhappy ... hidden treasure" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **to one who longs for death, but it does not come** - AT: "to a person who no longer wants to be alive, but is still alive"
  * **to one who searches for death more than those who search for hidden treasure** - AT: "to a person who wants to stop living more than he wants to look for hidden riches"
  * **Why is light given to one who rejoices very much and is glad when he can find the grave** - AT: "I do not understand why God allows a person to keep living when the person would be very happy to be buried in the ground" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **one who rejoices very much and is glad** - The phrase "rejoices very much" means basically the same thing as "is glad." Together, the two phrases emphasize the intensity of gladness. AT: "one who is extremely happy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
