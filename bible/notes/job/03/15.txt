===== Translation Notes: =====

Job continues his thoughts about dying before he was born.

  * **Or I would have been lying...that never see the light** -  This describes something that might have happened but did not happen. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **I would have been lying with princes** - "I would be resting with princes."(UDB) In this phrase, the words "lying" and "resting" represent a polite way of saying "no longer alive." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **who once had gold, who had filled their houses with silver** - Job uses parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Or perhaps I would have been stillborn, like infants that never see the light** - Job uses parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **I would have been stillborn** - AT: "I would have died in my mother's womb."
  * **like infants that never see the light** - AT: "like babies who had never been born"
  * **infants** - "babies" or "very small children"
