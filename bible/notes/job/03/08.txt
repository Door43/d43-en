\v 8 The magicians who are able to awaken the great sea monster—I want them to curse the day I was born.

\v 9 I wish that the stars that shone early in the morning on that day after I was born may not shine again.
\q2 If only those stars had wished in vain for light to shine,
\q2 and that they had not shone on that day.
\q1
\v 10 That was an evil day because my mother's womb was not closed;

<usfm>
\q
\v 8 May they curse that day,
\q those who know how to wake up Leviathan.
\q
\v 9 May the stars of that day's dawn be dark.
\q May that day look for light, but find none;
\q neither may it see the eyelids of the dawn,
\q
\v 10 because it did not shut up the doors of my mother's womb,
\q and because it did not hide trouble from my eyes.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **those who know how to wake up Leviathan** - Job is probably referring here to sorcerers and magicians, who he believes might be able to even provoke Leviathan in spreading chaos. Leviathan was an animal well known in Ancient Near Eastern mythology, which was thought to be responsible for all kinds of destruction, disorder, and chaos.
  * **May the stars of that day's dawn be dark** - This refers to the planets that are often visible just before dawn. AT: "May the stars that appear before that day's first light be dark"
  * **May that day look for light, but find none** - The day of Job's birth is spoken of as if it were a person looking for something. AT: "May that day hope for light, but have none." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]]
  * **neither may it see the eyelids of the dawn** - The dawn is spoken of as if it had eyelids as a person has. AT: "nor see the first light of the dawn." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **because it did not shut up the doors of my mother's womb** - A woman's womb is spoken of as if it were a container with doors. AT: "because that day did not close my mother's womb" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
