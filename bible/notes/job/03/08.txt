\q
\v 8 Let them curse that day,
\q those who know how to wake up Leviathan.
\q
\v 9 Let the stars of that day's twilight be dark.
\q Let that day look for light, but find none;
\q neither let it see the eyelids of the dawn,
\q
\v 10 because it did not shut up the doors of my mother's womb,
\q nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.
