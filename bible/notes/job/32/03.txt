  * **Elihu's anger was also kindled against his three friends** - This compares Elihu's anger to someone starting a fire. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Elihu also became very angry with his three friends" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. This tells background information about Elihu. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **that there was no answer in the mouths of these three men** - This means that the men were done speaking to Job. This speaks of the men possibly having an answer as if the answer were an object that would be in their mouths.
