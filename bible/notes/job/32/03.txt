===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Elihu's anger was also kindled against his three friends** - This compares Elihu's anger to someone starting a fire. AT: "Elihu also became very angry with his three friends" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
    * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. This tells background information about Elihu. (See: en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background)
    * **that there was no answer in the mouths of these three men** - AT: "that these three men had nothing else to say" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **his anger was kindled** - Again,this compares Elihu's anger to someone starting a fire. AT: "he became very angry"
