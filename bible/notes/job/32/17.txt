===== Translation Notes: =====
Elihu continues speaking using parallelisms.
  * **I am full of words** - "I have so much to say"
  * **the spirit in me compels me** - AT: "I must speak right now"
  * **my breast is like fermenting wine that has no vent; like new wineskins, it is ready to burst** - While wine is fermenting, gas collects in the container. If the gas is not let out the container will burst. Elihu means that he has so much to say that if he does not speak he feels like he will burst. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
