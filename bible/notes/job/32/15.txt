====== Job 32:15-16 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 You three are dismayed \add because you have not been able to convince him that he was wrong\add*,
\q2 so you are not saying anymore to him \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\q1
\v 16 But because you do not speak, I certainly will not wait any longer \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*;
\q2 you merely stand there and do not reply anymore.
\q1

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 I tell myself this: these three men are confused because they have nothing more to say to Job;
\q2 they have nothing more to say to him.
\q1
\v 16 But because you do not speak, I certainly will not wait any longer;
\q2 you merely stand there and do not reply anymore.
\q1
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 15 These three men are dumbfounded; they can answer Job no longer;
\q they have not a word more to say.
\q
\v 16 Should I wait because they are not speaking,
\q because they stand there silent and answer no more?
</usfm>

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Elihu continues speaking.

  * **dumbfounded** - "very upset"
  * **Should I wait because they are not speaking, because they stand there silent and answer no more?** - Elihu uses a question to emphasize that he will not wait any longer to speak. Elihu answers this question himself in the next verse. AT: But because you do not speak, I certainly will not wait any longer; you merely stand there and do not reply anymore.
