===== Translation Notes: =====
Elihu continues speaking.
  * **dumbfounded** - "speechless"
  * **they have not a word more to say** - This means the same as the previous two parts of the sentence. Elihu emphasizes that Job's friends have nothing left to say. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Should I wait because they are not speaking, because they stand there silent and answer no more?** - Elihu uses a question to emphasize that he will not wait any longer to speak. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
