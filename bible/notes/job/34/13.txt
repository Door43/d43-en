<usfm>
\v 13 No one gave him the authority to rule everything on the earth;
\q2 no one put him in control of the whole world.
\q2 He has always had that authority.
\q1
\v 14 If he ever thought only about himself and not about us also, and if he ever stopped making us live,
\q1
\v 15 everyone would die immediately,
\q2 and their corpses would soon become soil again.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 13 Who put him in charge over the earth?
\q Who put the whole world under him?
\q
\v 14 If he ever set his intentions only on himself,
\q and if he ever gathered back to himself his spirit and his breath,
\q
\v 15 then all flesh would perish together;
\q mankind would return to dust again.

===== Translation Notes: =====
Elihu continues speaking.
  * **Who put him in charge over the earth? Who put the whole world under him?** - Both of these mean the same thing. AT: "No one was needed to give permission to God to take responsibility over all the earth. He is the rightful one to rule the world." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **If he ever** - Elihu is describing a situation that he does not believe would ever happen. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **his spirit and his breath** AT: "his spirit and breath which gives us life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **all flesh** - AT: "all living things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
