Elihu continues speaking.
  * **Who put him in charge over the earth? Who put the whole world under him?** - Both of these mean the same thing.

(See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **If he ever** - Elihu is describing a situation that he does not believe would ever happen. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **his spirit and his breath** AT: "his spirit and breath which gives us life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **all flesh** - AT: "all living things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
