====== Job 34 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

According to Elihu, instead of being punished for his sins, Job is sinning in the midst of these difficulties. This is the second of Elihu's four statements and it is addressed first to Job's friends and then to Job. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sin]] and  [[:en:obe:kt:witness]])


Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers, or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation. Elihu uses many of Job's statements against him. His attitude is not too different from Job's friends.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Yahweh's justice ==
Elihu defends the justice of Yahweh after Job claimed that Yahweh was being unjust. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:justice]] and [[:en:obe:kt:unjust]])
