===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Elihu** - See how you translated this [[en:bible:notes:job:32:01|32:2]].
  * **Listen to my words** - AT: "Listen to what I say" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **you wise men...you who have knowledge** - Elihu is criticizing Job and his friends. He does not think they are actually wise. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **For the ear tries words as the palate tastes food** - Elihu means people listen carefully to determine what is right or wrong just like we taste food to determine if it is good or bad. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
