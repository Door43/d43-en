\q
\v 18 God, who says to a king, 'You are vile,'
\q or says to nobles, 'You are wicked'?
\q
\v 19 God, who does not show favoritism to leaders
\q and does not acknowledge rich people more than poor,
\q for they all are the work of his hands.
\q
\v 20 In a moment they will die;
\q at midnight people will be shaken and will pass away;
\q mighty people will be taken away, but not by human hands.

===== Translation Notes: =====
Elihu continues speaking.
  * **God, who says to a king, 'You are vile,' or says to nobles, 'You are wicked'?** - This continues the question from the previous verse. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **vile** - "evil" or "worthless" (UDB)
  * **for they all are the work of his hands** - Here "hands" refer to power. AT: "for God made them all" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **at midnight the people will be shaken and will pass away** - "Midnight" is the time when one day ends and another begins. AT: "when a person's time is over, God strikes him and he dies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **the mighty will be taken away, but not by human hands** - AT: "it is God and not humans who causes important people to die." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
