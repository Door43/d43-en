  * **For God's eyes are upon a person's ways** - AT: "For God watches everything a person does" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **he sees all his steps** - "he sees him wherever he goes"
  * **darkness...thick gloom** - These mean basically the same thing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
