===== Translation Notes: =====
Elihu continues speaking.

  * **teach me what I cannot see** - AT: "teach me what I have done wrong and did not even know it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Do you think that God will punish that person’s sin, since you dislike what God does?** - Elihu uses a question for emphasis. AT: "Even though you do not like what God does, surely even you do not think that God will punish this person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
