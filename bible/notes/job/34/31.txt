\v 31 Job, have you or anyone else ever said to God, 'I have certainly committed sin,
\q2 but I will not sin anymore;
\q1
\v 32 so teach me what sins I have committed;
\q1 if I have done anything that is evil,
\q2 I will not do it anymore'?

<usfm>
\q
\v 31 Suppose someone says to God,
\q 'I am certainly guilty, but I will not sin any longer;
\q
\v 32 teach me what I cannot see;
\q I have committed sin, but I will do it no longer.'
\q
\v 33 Do you think that God will punish that person's sin, since you dislike what God does?
\q You must choose, not I.
\q So say what it is that you know.

===== Translation Notes: =====
Elihu continues speaking.

  * **teach me what I cannot see** - AT: "teach me what I have done wrong and did not even know it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Do you think that God will punish that person's sin, since you dislike what God does?** - Elihu uses a question for emphasis. AT: "Even though you do not like what God does, surely even you do not think that God will punish this person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
