===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 10 So listen to me, you men of understanding:
\q far be it from God that he should do wickedness;
\q far be it from the Almighty that he should commit sin.
\q
\v 11 For he pays back a person's work;
\q he makes every man come upon the reward of his own ways.
\q
\v 12 Indeed, God does nothing wicked,
\q nor does the Almighty ever pervert justice.
