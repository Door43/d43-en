\v 10 Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding:
\q Far be it from God, that he should do wickedness,
\q And from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.

\v 11 For the work of a man will he render to him,
\q And cause every man to find according to his ways.
\q
\v 12 Yea, of a surety, God will not do wickedly,
\q Neither will the Almighty pervert justice.
