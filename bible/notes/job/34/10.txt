<usfm>
\q
\v 10 So listen to me, you men of understanding:
\q far be it from God that he should do wickedness;
\q far be it from the Almighty that he should commit sin.
\q
\v 11 For he pays back a person's work;
\q he makes every man come upon the reward of his own ways.
\q
\v 12 Indeed, God does nothing wicked,
\q nor does the Almighty ever pervert justice.

===== Translation Notes: =====
Elihu continues speaking.

    * **you men of understanding** - Elihu is criticizing Job and his friends. He does not actually think they are wise. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
    * **far be it from the Almighty that he should commit sin** - This means the same as the previous part of the sentence. Elihu emphasizes that God always does what is right. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **he makes every man come upon the reward of his own ways** - This means the same as the previous part of the sentence. Elihu emphasizes that God gives to people what they deserve.
    * **nor does the Almighty ever pervert justice** - This means the same as the previous part of the sentence. Elihu again emphasizes that God always does what is right.
