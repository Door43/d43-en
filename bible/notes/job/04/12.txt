  * **Now a certain matter was secretly brought to me ... my ear received a whisper about it** - These phrases express the same idea in a different way. They convey the idea that Eliphaz heard a message whispered to him. This repetition is a form of Hebrew poetry used frequently for emphasis, teaching, or clarity. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **I heard about a certain matter in secret** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "someone brought a certain matter to me secretly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **visions in the night** - "dreams"
  * **when deep sleep falls on people** - "when people sleep very deeply"
