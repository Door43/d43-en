<usfm>
\v 7 Think about this: No innocent people ever die when they are still young!
\q2 God never kills innocent people!
\q1
\v 8 I have seen this happen: if farmers plant bad seeds, they do not harvest good crops;
\q2 anyone who starts trouble for others later brings trouble on himself.
\q1
\v 9 These people die when God commands them to,
\q2 because he is very angry with them.

\q
\v 7 Remember, I beg you: who has ever perished when innocent?
\q Or when was the upright person ever cut off?
\q
\v 8 Based on what I have observed, those who plow iniquity
\q and sow trouble, reap the same.
\q
\v 9 By the breath of God they perish;
\q by the blast of his anger they are consumed.
