====== Job 04:7-9 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 Think about this: Do innocent people die \add while they are still young\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?
\q2 Does God get rid of godly people \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? \add No\add*!
\q1
\v 8 What I have experienced is this: \add Just as\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* farmers who plant bad \add seeds\add* do not harvest \add good crops\add*,
\q2 \add those who start\add* trouble for others later bring trouble on themselves.
\q1
\v 9 They die when God blows his breath on them,
\q2 when he is very angry with them.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 Think about this: No innocent people ever die when they are still young!
\q2 God never kills innocent people!
\q1
\v 8 I have seen this happen: if farmers plant bad seeds, they do not harvest good crops;
\q2 anyone who starts trouble for others later brings trouble on himself.
\q1
\v 9 These people die when God commands them to,
\q2 because he is very angry with them.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 7 Think about this, please: Who has ever perished when innocent?
\q Or when were the upright people ever cut off?
\q
\v 8 According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity
\q and sow trouble reap it.
\q
\v 9 By the breath of God they perish;
\q by the blast of his anger they are consumed.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **who has ever perished when innocent?** - Eliphaz uses this question to prompt Job to search his life for sin (and God's righteous judgment) as the cause of his loss. AT: "No one has ever perished when innocent." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **when were the upright people ever cut off** - This question also means to make a statement, and may be put into active form. AT: "No one has ever cut off an upright person." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **cut off** - Here being cut off represents being destroyed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **plow iniquity ... sow trouble ... reap** - Here the actions of plowing and sowing represent causing trouble for other people. The action of reaping represents suffering the trouble that one has himself caused. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **By the breath of God they perish; by the blast of his anger they are consumed** - The writer explains a single idea using two different statements. This is a form of Hebrew poetry used for emphasis, clarity, teaching, or all three. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) 
  * **the breath of God** - This may represent the action of God giving a command. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the blast of his anger** - This expression suggests the heavy breathing that a person sometimes does through his nose when he is very angry. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **breath ... blast** - The second builds on the first. They make the same point by using meanings that increase the result. "By the puff of God's mouth they die; the rushing wind of his anger devastates them." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **perish ... are consumed** - The second phrase builds on the first. They make the same point. "By the puff of God's breath they die, the rushing wind of his anger devastates them." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **they are consumed** - Here being consumed or eaten represents being killed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
