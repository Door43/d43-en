===== Translation Notes: =====

The writer uses parallelism in these verses, conveying a single idea using different statements to emphasize God's destruction of wicked people. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **The roaring of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion, the teeth of the young lions—they are broken.** - Eliphaz uses the picture of a lion's roaring, voice, and teeth being broken as an image of the wicked being destroyed. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **they are broken** - "something breaks the teeth of the young lions" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **The old lion perishes for lack of victims; the cubs of the lioness are scattered everywhere** - Eliphaz uses the picture of an old lion dying of hunger and of a lion's family being scattered as metaphors for the wicked being destroyed. 
  * **are scattered** - "something scatters the cubs of the lioness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
