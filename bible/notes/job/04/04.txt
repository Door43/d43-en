\v 6 You say that you honor God; so you should be trusting in him, for him not to let you suffer.

\q
\v 4 Your words have supported him who was falling,
\q you have made feeble knees firm.
\q
\v 5 But now trouble has come to you, and you faint;
\q it touches you, and you are troubled.
\q
\v 6 Should not your fear of God give you confidence?
\q Should not the integrity of your ways give you hope?

===== Translation Notes: =====

The writer uses parallelism in each of these verses make one idea using two different statements to emphasize 1) the support that Job has given others in the past, 2) the effect on him of his present troubles, and 3) his piety before God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]])

  * **supported**  - "held up" like catching someone from falling to the ground when they stumble on a rock
  * **falling**  - "stumbling"
  * **you have made feeble knees firm**  - "you encouraged others when they were in extreme sorrow."
  * **But now trouble has come to you**  - "But now you suffer from disasters"
  * **you faint**  - "you are emotionally weak"
  * **your fear of God**  - "your piety"
  * **Should not your fear of God give you confidence? Should not the integrity of your ways give you hope?**  - Eliphaz asks these questions to make Job consider that the cause of his suffering is sin in his life despite his supposed piety and integrity. AT: "Everyone thinks that you honor God; everyone thinks that you are an honest man. But these things must not be true, because you have no more trust in God." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
