====== Job 04:18-19 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 God cannot be sure that his own angels \add will always do what is right\add*;
\q2 he declares that some of them have done what is wrong.
\q1
\v 19 So he certainly cannot trust human beings who were made from dust and clay,
\q2 who are crushed as easily as moths are crushed!

\q1
\v 19 So he certainly cannot trust human beings whom he has made from dust and clay,
\q2 human beings, whom disaster crushes as easily as you can crush a moth!

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 18 See, if God puts no trust in his servants;
\q if he accuses his angels of folly,
\q
\v 19 how much more is this true of those who live in houses of clay,
\q whose foundation is in the dust,
\q who are crushed sooner than a moth?
