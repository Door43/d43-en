===== Translation Notes: =====

These verses continue the earlier use of parallelism, here emphasizing in different ways the idea that people die suddenly without having achieved wisdom and without concern from others. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **Between morning and evening they are destroyed** - This is a figurative way of saying that humans die quickly, that life is short, just at the time between morning and evening is short. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **they are destroyed** - "something destroys them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Are not their tent cords plucked up among them?** - The writer describes human beings like tents that collapse when someone pulls up the cords that hold it up. This is a figurative way of asking, "Are not they about to die?"  AT:  "Something plucks up their tent cords among them" or "Something plucks their lives from them."(See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]).
  * **Are not their tent cords plucked up among them?** - "Yes, their tent cords are plucked up among them." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
