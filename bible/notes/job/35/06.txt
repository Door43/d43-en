\q1

\v 6 If you have sinned, that cannot harm God at all.
\q2 Even if you do wrong things many, many times, that certainly does not hurt him.

\v 7 In the same way, if you are righteous, does that help God?
\q2 No, nothing you do can help him.

\q
\v 6 If you have sinned, what harm do you do to God?
\q If your transgressions pile up high, what do you do to him?
\q
\v 7 If you are righteous, what can you give to him?
\q What will he receive from your hand?
\q
\v 8 Your wickedness may hurt a man, as you are a man,
\q and your righteousness might benefit another son of man.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Elihu continues speaking.

  * **If you have sinned ... what do you do to him?** - These two lines share similar meanings. The second line intensifies the meaning of the first line. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **If you have sinned, what harm do you do to God?** - Elihu asks this question to emphasize that Job's sins cannot actually do anything to God. AT: "If you have sinned, do have not done any hard to God." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **If your transgressions pile up high, what do you do to him?** - Elihu speaks of "transgressions" as if they were objects, and of committing many transgressions as if it were piling those objects one on top of the other. He asks this question to emphasize that Job does nothing to God by his transgressions. AT: "If you committed a great many transgressions, you still do nothing to him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **If you are righteous, what can you give to him? What will he receive from your hand?** - The two rhetorical questions mean basically the same thing, that Job's righteousness adds nothing to God. AT: "If you are righteous, that does not enable you to give anything to him, and there is nothing that he will receive from your hand." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **receive from your hand** - Here the word "hand" represents Job. AT: "receive from you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **another son of man** - "another  human-being" or "another person"
