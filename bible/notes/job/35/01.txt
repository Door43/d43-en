===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Do you think you are innocent? Do you think, ‘I am more righteous than God?** - Elihu uses questions to challenge Job. AT: "You must think you are innocent and more righteous than God." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Do you think** - Here "you" is singular and refers to Job. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **For you say, ‘What use is it to me that I am righteous? What good is it to me now, more than if I had sinned?** - AT: "For you say that it does not matter that you are righteous. It is no more benefit to you than if you had sinned." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
