===== Translation Notes: =====
Elihu continues speaking.
  * **from the arms of mighty men** - Here "arms" refers to power or strength. AT: "because powerful men harm them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **But no one says, 'Where is God my Maker...birds of the sky?'** -  AT: "But the truly righteous person is never so arrogant as to suggest that God has abandoned them, or to say that God has refused to give them the ability to sing joyful songs, instead of very sad songs, during their suffering." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]] [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **who gives songs in the night**  - This means that God's promises give people reason to have joy even when they suffer. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
