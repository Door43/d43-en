  * **See, is not their prosperity in their own hands?** - Here "hand" refers to power or control. Job uses a question for emphasis. AT: "Look, these wicked people claim that they make themselves prosper" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **The advice of the wicked is far from me** - AT: "But I do not believe what they say"
  * **How often is it...How often does it happen** - Job uses three questions to emphasize that it seems to him that God does not punish the wicked very often. AT: "It is not often...It is not often"
  * **that the lamp of the wicked** - Job compares the life of the wicked to a lamp that is burning. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the lamp of the wicked is put out** - Job compares extinguishing the lamp to a person dying. AT: "that God causes them to die suddenly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **they become like stubble before the wind or like chaff that the storm carries away** - AT: "God takes them away like the wind blows away the chaff" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
