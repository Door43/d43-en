===== Translation Notes: =====
Job continues speaking to his friends.
  * **Why do the wicked continue to live, become old, and grow mighty in power?** - Job uses a question to introduce his speech and to cause his friends to think deeply about what he says. AT: "The wicked person indeed continues to live, becomes old, and becomes wealthier."
  * **their offspring are established before their eyes** - This means the same as the first part of the sentence. The wicked person gets to watch his descendants grow strong and wealthy. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Their houses** - AT: "Their families"
  * **rod of God** - This refers to God's punishment.
