\q
\v 19 You say, 'God lays up one's guilt for his children to pay.'
\q Let him pay it himself, so that he might know his guilt.
\q
\v 20 Let his eyes see his own destruction,
\q and let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
\q
\v 21 For what does he care about his family after him
\q when the number of his months is cut off?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Job continues speaking to his friends.

  * **You say** - These words are added by most versions in order to make it clear that the Job is quoting his friends in the next statement. 
  * **God lays up one's guilt for his children to pay** - Guilt is spoken of as something that can be stored for later use. Here "to pay" refers to punishment for sin. AT: "God keeps a record of a person's sins, then he punishes the person's children for his wicked deeds" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Let him pay it himself** - Job now begins to state his own opinion. It may be helpful to state this explicitly. AT: "But I say, 'Let him pay it himself'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Let his eyes see** - Here "eyes" refers to the person. AT: "Let him see" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty** - Here the wrath of God is spoken of as if it a drink that a person can taste, and tasting is a metonymy for experiencing the drink. Job wants the wicked person to experience God's punishment. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **For what does he care about his family after him when the number of his months is cut off?** - Job uses this question to show that the punishing the evil man's children is not effective. This can be stated in active form. AT: "For the wicked man does not care about his family after he has died!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the number of his months is cut off** - This is a polite way of saying that he dies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **the number of his months** - this refers to the length of his life
