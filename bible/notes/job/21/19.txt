===== Translation Notes: =====
Job continues speaking to his friends.
  * **God lays up one's guilt for his children to pay** - AT: "God keeps a record of a person's sins, then he punishes the person's children for his wicked deeds"
  * **Let his eyes see** - AT: "Let him see" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty** - Job wants the wicked person to experience God's punishment. Job compares "drink" to "feel" or "experience." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For what does he care about his family after him when the number of his months is cut off?** - Job uses a question for emphasis. AT: "For the wicked man does not care about his family after he has died" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
