====== Job 21:31-33 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 31 There is no one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* who accuses wicked people,
\q2 and there in no one who pays them back\f + \ft Or: gives them the punishment that they deserve \f* for all the evil things that they have done.
\q1
\v 32 When the corpses of wicked people are carried to their graves,
\q2 and people are put there to guard those graves,
\q1
\v 33 a huge number \f + \ft hyperbole \f* of people go to the grave site;
\q2 some go in front of the procession and some come behind,
\q2 and those wicked people who have died surely feel good when people throw clods of dirt on their graves.

\q
\v 31 Who will condemn the wicked man's way to his face?
\q Who will repay him for what he has done?
\q
\v 32 Yet he will be borne to the grave;
\q men will keep watch over his tomb.
\q
\v 33 The clods of the valley will be sweet to him;
\q all people will follow after him,
\q as there were innumerable people before him.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Job continues speaking to his friends.

  * **Who will condemn the wicked man's way to his face?** - Job uses this question to contradict his friends' belief that the wicked are always judged. AT: "No one condemns the wicked man to his face." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **to his face** - This means no one will go directly to the wicked person and condemn him personally. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Who will repay him for what he has done?** - Job uses this question to contradict his friends' belief that the wicked are always judged. AT: "No one repays him for the bad things that he has done." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **he will be borne** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "people will carry him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **The clods of the valley will be sweet to him** - Job imagines that the dead person will even enjoy the dirt that is put on him. This means the wicked person will even have a good death and a nice burial after a fulfilling life. "Clods" refer to the earth that covers the grave. AT: "He will enjoy being covered with the dirt of the valley" or "He will enjoy being buried in the dirt of the valley" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **all people will follow after him, as there were innumerable people before him** - Job emphasizes that a large crowd of people will be in the funeral procession of this imaginary wicked man to honor him. AT: "a huge number of people go to the grave site; some go in front of the procession and some come behind" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
