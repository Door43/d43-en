====== Job 21:31-33 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 31 There is no one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* who accuses wicked people,
\q2 and there in no one who pays them back\f + \ft Or: gives them the punishment that they deserve \f* for all the evil things that they have done.
\q1
\v 32 When the corpses of wicked people are carried to their graves,
\q2 and people are put there to guard those graves,
\q1
\v 33 a huge number \f + \ft hyperbole \f* of people go to the grave site;
\q2 some go in front of the procession and some come behind,
\q2 and those wicked people who have died surely feel good when people throw clods of dirt on their graves.

\q
\v 31 Who will condemn the wicked man’s way to his face?
\q Who will repay him for what he has done?
\q
\v 32 Yet he will be borne to the grave;
\q men will keep watch over his tomb.
\q
\v 33 The clods of the valley will be sweet to him;
\q all people will follow after him,
\q as there were innumerable people before him.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Who will condemn the wicked man’s way to his face? Who will repay him for what he has done?** - Job uses questions to teach his friends and cause them to think deeply about what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **to his face** - This means no one will go directly to the wicked person and condemn him personally. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Yet he will be borne** - AT: "Yet people will carry him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **The clods of the valley will be sweet to him** - Job imagines that the dead person will even enjoy the dirt that is put on him. This means the wicked person will even have a good death and a nice burial after a fulfilling life. "Clods" refer to the earth that covers the grave. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **all people will follow after him as there were innumerable people before him** - Job emphasizes his idea by including the many before and after this man who will have the same life and death as this imaginary wicked person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
