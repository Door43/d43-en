===== Translation Notes: =====
Job continues speaking with his friends.
  * **Where now is the house of the prince? Where is the tent in which the wicked once lived?** - Job believes his friends will ask these question in order to scold him. Both questions mean the same thing. AT: "See, the house of the evil ruler is gone. The tent of the wicked man has disappeared." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
