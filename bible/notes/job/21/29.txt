===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Have you never asked traveling people? Do you not know the evidence they can tell** - Job uses these questions to answer the questions he believes his friends will ask. AT: "You should listen to those who have traveled to distant places. Even they will tell you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **that the wicked man is kept from the day of calamity, and that he is led away from the day of wrath?** - Both of these statements mean the same thing. AT: "that when God brings disaster on a place he spares the wicked person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
