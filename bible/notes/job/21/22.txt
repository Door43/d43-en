===== Translation Notes: =====
Job continues speaking to his friends.
  * **Can anyone teach God knowledge since he judges even those who are high?** - Job uses a question for emphasis. AT: "Obviously, no one can teach anything to God since he even judges those in heaven." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **One man dies in his full strength** - Job is comparing this man who dies in complete health and peace to the man who dies in sorrow and pain. See how you will translate this in [[:en:bible:notes:job:21:25|21:25]] 
  * **His body is full of milk, and the marrow of his bones is moistened and in good health** - Both of these mean that the person is very healthy. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
