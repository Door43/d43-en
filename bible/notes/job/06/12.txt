<usfm>
\q
\v 12 Is my strength the strength of stones?
\q Or is my flesh of brass?
\q
\v 13 Is it not that I have no help in me,
\q And that wisdom is driven quite from me?
\b
\q
\v 14 To him that is ready to faint kindness should be showed from his friend;
\q Even to him that forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
