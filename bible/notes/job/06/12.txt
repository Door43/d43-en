===== Translation Notes: =====

The writer uses parallel rhetorical questions in each of these verses, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize Job's lack of strength to endure suffering. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh made of bronze?** - Job contrasts the weakness of his body to tough, durable building materials to emphasize his lack of strength.  AT: "I am not as strong as the rocks. My body is not made of metal." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Is it not true that I have no help in myself?** - AT: "It is true that I have no strength left." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **wisdom has been driven out of me** - "my success has been taken from me" or "or "inner strength has been driven out of me" This passive clause can be written as an active clause: "My inner strength is gone." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
