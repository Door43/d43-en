  * **Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh made of bronze?** - Job contrasts the weakness of his body to tough, durable building materials to emphasize his lack of strength. AT: "I am not as strong as the rocks. My body is not made of metal." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Is it not true that I have no help in myself ... me?** - AT: "It is true that I have no strength left ... me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **wisdom has been driven out of me?** - "my success has been taken from me" or "or "inner strength has been driven out of me" This can be stated in active form. AT: "My inner strength is gone."
