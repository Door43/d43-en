===== Translation Notes: =====

The writer continues to use parallelism in each of these verses, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize Job's intense suffering and his desire for death. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **I refuse to touch them** - "Them" refers to bad tasting foods.  Here Job continues to use the image of bad food as a metaphor for his unpalatable circumstances. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]).  
  * **Oh that I might have my request; oh, that God would grant me the thing that I long for** - AT: "Oh that God would do what I have been asking him to do"
  * **that it would please God to crush me once** - AT: "That God would go ahead and crush me"
  * **that he would let loose his hand and cut me off from this life** - AT: "that he would act quickly and cut short my life"
  * **let loose his hand** - "act quickly" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
