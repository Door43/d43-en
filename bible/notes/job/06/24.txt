<usfm>
\v 24 Answer me now, and then I will be quiet;
\q2 tell me what wrong things I have done!
\q1
\v 25 When people speak what is true, that truth will not hurt the person who hears it,
\q2 but what you have criticized me for having done is not true, so you have proven nothing when you say those things.

  * **make me understand** - This can be translated as "you make me understand." The verb is in second person plural form.
  * **How painful are truthful words** - The ULB and the UDB have opposite meanings for this phrase. This is because possible meanings in the Hebrew are 1) The truthful words are painful to hear or 2) The words of a truthful person are not painful to hear.
  * **But your arguments, how do they actually rebuke me?** - Job is using this question to rebuke his friends and to emphasize that what they are saying does not apply to him. AT: "Your reasons do not apply to me  even though you sternly correct me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
