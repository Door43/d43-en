===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **if only my anguish were weighed; if only all my calamity were laid in the balance!** - Here the writer uses two different statements to convey a single idea, the burden of Job's suffering.  (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **in the balance** - "on a scale"
  * **For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas** - Job compares the burden of his suffering to the weight of wet sand; both can crush a person.  "The burden of my anguish and troubles is heavier than the sand on the seashore."  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
