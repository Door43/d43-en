<usfm>
\q
\v 4 For the arrows of the Almighty are within me,
\q The poison whereof my spirit drinks up:
\q The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.
\q
\v 5 Doth the wild ass bray when he has grass?
\q Or loweth the ox over his fodder?
\q
\v 6 Can that which has no savor be eaten without salt?
\q Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
