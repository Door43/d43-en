====== Job 06:14-17 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 When a man has many troubles, his friends should be kind to him,
\q2 even if he stops revering Almighty \add God\add*.
\q1
\v 15 But \add you\add*, my friends, are not dependable.
\q2 You are like streams: They spill over their banks \add in the spring\add*
\q1
\v 16 when \add the melting\add* ice and snow make those streams overflow,
\q1
\v 17 but when the dry season comes, there is no water flowing \add in those streams\add*,
\q2 and the channels dry up.
\q1

\q1
\v 15 But you, my friends, are not dependable.
\q2 You are like streams in the wilderness: They spill over their banks in the spring
\q1

\q1
\v 17 but when the dry season comes, there is no water flowing in those streams,
\q2 and the channels dry up.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 14 To the person who is about to faint, faithfulness should be shown by his friend;
\q even to him who forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
\q
\v 15 But my brothers have been as faithful to me as a desert streambed, 
\q as channels of water that pass away to nothing,
\q
\v 16 which are darkened because of ice over them,
\q and because of the snow that hides itself in them.
\q
\v 17 When they thaw out, they vanish;
\q when it is hot, they melt out of their place.
