===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 When a man has many troubles, his friends should be kind to him,
\q2 even if he stops revering Almighty \add God\add*.
\q1
\v 15 But \add you\add*, my friends, are not dependable.
\q2 You are like streams: They spill over their banks \add in the spring\add*
\q1
\v 16 when \add the melting\add* ice and snow make those streams overflow,
\q1
\v 17 but when the dry season comes, there is no water flowing \add in those streams\add*,
\q2 and the channels dry up.

\q1
\v 15 But you, my friends, are not dependable.
\q2 You are like streams in the wilderness: They spill over their banks in the spring
\q1
\v 16 when the melting ice and snow make them overflow,
\q1
\v 17 but when the dry season comes, there is no water flowing in those streams,
\q2 and the channels dry up.

<usfm>
\q
\v 14 To the person who is about to faint, faithfulness should be shown by his friend;
\q even to him who forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
\q
\v 15 But my brothers have been as faithful to me as a desert streambed,
\q as channels of water that pass away to nothing,
\q
\v 16 which are darkened because of ice over them,
\q and because of the snow that hides itself in them.
\q
\v 17 When they thaw out, they vanish;
\q when it is hot, they melt out of their place.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **To the person who is about to faint, faithfulness should be shown by his friend** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "A friend should be faithful to the person who feels he is about to faint" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **who is about to faint** - This speaks of a person who feels hopeless and is overwhelmed by his troubles as if he were about to physically faint. AT: "who feels hopeless" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **even to him who forsakes the fear of the Almighty** - "even if he stops fearing Almighty God." Possible meanings are 1) the faint person does not fear God or 2) his friend does not fear God.
  * **But my brothers have been as faithful to me as a desert streambed** - Job speaks of his friends being unfaithful to him as being like a "wadi" which is a stream that can suddenly dry up. Also, Job refers to his friends ironically here as his "brothers." AT: "But my friends are unfaithful to me. They are like a desert streambed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **as channels of water that pass away to nothing** - "like streams of water that dry up." Job continues speaking of his friends being unfaithful as if they were streams that dry up. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **which are darkened because of ice over them ... and because of the snow that hides itself in them** - These two phrases have the same meaning. They describe how the streambed is full of ice and snow in the winter. AT: "which look dark in the winter because they are covered with ice and are full of melted snow" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **because of the snow that hides itself in them** - This speaks of the snow melting and the water going into the streambed as if the snow were hiding in the streambed. AT: "because the snow melts and goes into them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **When they thaw out, they vanish ... when it is hot, they melt out of their place** - These two phrases have the same meaning. They describe how the streambed dries up in the hot season. AT: "When it is hot, the ice melts and the streambeds dry up" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
