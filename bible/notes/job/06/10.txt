\q
\v 10 May this still be my consolation—
\q even if I exult in pain that does not lessen:
\q that I have not denied the words of the Holy One.
\q
\v 11 What is my strength, that I should try to wait?
\q What is my end, that I should prolong my life?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **May this still be my consolation** - "May this bring me comfort." The word "this" refers to God allowing him to die. AT: "May my death still bring me comfort" or "May my death still comfort me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **even if I exult in pain that does not lessen** - "I would leap for joy in unending pain" or "I would endure pain that does not diminish"
  * **exult** - "rejoice"
  * **does not lessen** - "does not diminish"
  * **that I have not denied the words of the Holy One** - "that I have not disowned God." This can be written in positive form. AT: "that I have always obeyed the Holy One" 
  * **What is my strength, that I should try to wait? What is my end, that I should prolong my life?** - Job poses these questions to emphasize that he has no reason to continue living. These questions have the same meaning. They may be written as statements. AT: "I do not have enough strength to go on living; I have no reason to prolong my life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
