\v 10 May this still be my consolation—
\q even if I exult in pain that does not lessen:
\q that I have not denied the words of the Holy One.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **May this still be my consolation** - "May this yet be my consolation" or "May this bring me comfort"
  * **even if I exult in pain that does not lessen** - "I would leap for joy in unending pain" or "I would endure pain that does not diminish"
  * **exult** - "rejoice"
  * **does not lessen** - "does not diminish"
  * **that I have not denied the words of the Holy One** - "that I have not disowned God"
  * **What is my strength, that I should try to wait?
What is my end, that I should prolong my life?** - Job poses these questions to emphasize that it is pointless for him to go on living. AT: "Besides, what else is there for me to live for and look forward to?" or "I have no strength to go on living; I have no reason to be patient" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
