===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **Do you plan to ignore my words, treating the words of a desperate man like the wind?** - Job uses this question to scold his friends. AT: "You ignore my words, and treat my words like they are nothing." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **Do you...** - "You" is in second person plural form. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_youdual]])
    * **treating the words of a desperate man like the wind** - Job is comparing the hopeless words of a man desperate for help to the emptiness of the wind; both are useless. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]]) 
    * **you cast lots for a fatherless child** - "you even gamble to win an orphan"
    * **you cast lots...and (you) haggle over your friend** - Here "you" and "your" are in second person plural form.
