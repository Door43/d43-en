<usfm>
\v 18 But, just as mountains crumble and rocks fall down from a cliff,
\q1
\v 19 and just as water slowly wears away the stones, and just as floods wash away soil,

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 18 But even mountains fall and come to nothing;
\q even rocks are moved out of their place;
\q
\v 19 the waters wear down the stones;
\q their flooding washes away the dust of the earth.
\q Like this, you destroy the hopes of man.
</usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **mountains fall and come to nothing** - Here the phrase "come to nothing" expands on the word "fall" and emphasizes complete destruction. AT: "mountains completely fall apart." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **rocks are moved out of their place** - AT: "rocks tumble down from their place" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Like this, you destroy the hopes of man** - If it is easier in your language, you can put this phrase at the beginning of verse 18 and adjust the text accordingly. AT: "You destroy the hopes of man, just like...dust of the earth." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **you destroy** - The word "you" refers to God.
  * **the hopes of man** - AT: "the things a man hopes for"
