\q
\v 10 But man dieth, and is laid low:
\q Yea, man gives up the ghost, and where is he?
\q
\v 11 As the waters fail from the sea,
\q And the river wastes and dries up;
\q
\v 12 So man lies down and rises not:
\q Till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake,
\q Nor be roused out of their sleep.
\b
