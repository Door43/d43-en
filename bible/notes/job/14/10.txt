===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 But when we people lose all our strength and die,
\q2 we stop breathing and then we are gone \add forever\add*.
\q1
\v 11 Just like water evaporates from the ocean,
\q2 or like a riverbed dries up,
\q1
\v 12 people sometimes \add lie down and die\add* and do not get up again.
\q1 Until the heavens disappear,
\q2 people who die \f + \ft euphemism \f* do not wake up,
\q2 and no one can wake them up.

\v 10 But when we people lose all our strength and die,
\q2 we stop breathing, and then we are gone forever.
\q1
\v 11 Just as water evaporates from a lake,
\q2 or as a riverbed dries up,
\q1
\v 12 people lie down and die and do not get up again.
\q1 Until the heavens do not exist any longer;
\q2 people who die do not wake up,
\q2 and no one can wake them up.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 10 But man dies; he becomes weak;
\q indeed, man stops breathing, and then where is he?
\q
\v 11 As water disappears from a lake,
\q and as a river loses water and dries up,
\q
\v 12 so people lie down and do not rise again.
\q Until the heavens are no more, they will not awake
\q nor be roused out of their sleep.
\b

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **where is he?** - AT: "no one knows where he is"
  * **As water disappears from a lake ... and do not rise again** - The fact that death cannot be reversed is compared to water that dried up and cannot return. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **As water disappears ... as a river loses ...** - These two phrases are describing the same thought and are repeated to emphasize the fact that death is final. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **they will not awake nor be roused out of their sleep** - These two phrases basically mean the same thing and are used together to emphasize that death is final. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
