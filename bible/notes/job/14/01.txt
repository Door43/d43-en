This chapter continues Job's speech, which started in [[:en:bible:notes:job:12:01|12:1]].

  * **Man, who is born of woman** - This refers to all people, both men and women; all are born into this world. 
  * **is full of trouble** - AT: "his life is full of trouble" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **He sprouts from the ground like a flower and is cut down** - A man's short life is compared to that of a flower. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])

  * **Do you look at any of these?** - Job talks to God; he implies that God should not pay attention to him. AT: "God, you should pay attention to any human being" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **look at** - This has here a negative connotation. AT: "pay attention to" or "look for faults in" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **any of these** - Job speaks about himself in the third person. AT: "me"
  * **Do you bring me into judgment with you?** - Implied is that God should not judge Job because he is so small. AT: "Do you accuse me of sinning?" or "You should not threaten to judge me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
