===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 But if he, sitting as the judge, looked closely at you, he would find that what you are doing for him is bad!
\q2 You have deceived other people, but do not think that you can lie about him in court and say that you are defending him!
\q1
\v 10 If you say clever things to persuade God to take your side,
\q2 he will surely rebuke you.


\q1

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 9 Would it really be good for you if he as judge should turn on you and examine you instead?
\q Or like someone deceives someone else, would you really misrepresent him in court?
\q
\v 10 He would surely reprove you
\q if you secretly showed favoritism to him.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Would it really be good for you when he searches you out** - Here "searches you out" is a metaphor meaning "examine you." Job uses this question to warn his friends that if God were to examine them, he would say that what they are doing is wrong. AT: "If God were to examine you, it would not be good for you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Could you deceive him as you might deceive men?** - Job uses this question to warn his friends that God knows the truth about them. AT: "You might be able to deceive men, but you cannot deceive God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **reprove you** - "rebuke you"
  * **if you secretly showed favoritism to him** - In this case, showing favoritism to someone refers to telling lies about him so that the judge will say that the person is good. AT: "if you tell lies in his favor" or "if you tell lies to make him appear good" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
