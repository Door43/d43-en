====== Job 13:9-10 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 If he looks closely, will he find that everything that you have done is good?
\q2 Or can you deceive him, like you deceive other people?
\q1
\v 10 If you secretly say\f + \ft Or: do \f* things to cause God to act favorably toward you,
\q2 he will surely rebuke you.
\q1
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 But if he, sitting as the judge, looked closely at you, he would find that what you are doing for him is bad!
\q2 You have deceived other people, but do not think that you can lie about him in court and say that you are defending him!
\q1
\v 10 If you say clever things to persuade God to take your side,
\q2 he will surely rebuke you.


\q1

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 9 Would it really be good for you if he as judge should turn on you and examine you instead? 
\q Or like someone deceives someone else, would you really misrepresent him in court?
\q
\v 10 He would surely reprove you
\q if you secretly showed favoritism to him.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **he as judge** - "He" is God who is the judge.
  * **Or like someone ... him in court?** - Job compares one person tricking another person to his friends giving a false account to God about God himself. He asks this as a question to give emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **secretly showed favoritism to him** - "God will surely scold you for your behavior if you try to show him secret favors"
