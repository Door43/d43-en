<usfm>
\v 13 So, be quiet and allow me to speak,

\v 13 So be quiet and allow me to speak;
\q2 after that, it will not matter what happens to me.
\q1
\v 14 I am ready to risk my life;
\q2 I am even willing to risk that God will execute me for what I say.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 13 Hold your peace, let me alone, so that I may speak,
\q let come what may on me.
\q
\v 14 I will take my own flesh in my teeth;
\q I will take my life in my hands.
\q
\v 15 See, if he kills me, I will have no hope left;
\q nevertheless, I will defend my ways before him.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **let come what may on me.** - Job puts his life in Gods hands. AT: "whatever happens to me I will accept."
  * **I will take my own flesh...my life in my hands.** - Job is willing to risk his life by arguing his case with God. "Flesh" and "life" refer to his body. "Teeth" and "hands" refer to his ability to take it under his own control. Both lines mean the same for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
