<usfm>
\q
\v 13 Hold your peace, let me alone, so that I may speak,
\q let come what may on me.

\q nevertheless, I will defend my ways before him.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Verse 13b**  The UDB does not really say what the ULB says. The UDB is troblesome in that it suggests that Job does not care what happens. He does care but puts his life in Gods hands.
  * **Verse 14 - There are 2 metonymies in the verse referring to flesh in his teeth and life in his hands. These mean he is willing to risk his life, speaking to God. **
