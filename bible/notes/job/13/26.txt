<usfm>
\v 26 It seems that you are writing things to accuse me of having sinned,
\q2 and that you are writing down even the bad things I did when I was young.
\q1
\v 27 It is as though you have put my feet in stocks
\q2 and that you were watching me wherever I walk;
\q2 it is as though you were following my footprints to see where I have gone.
\q1
\v 28 Because of this, my body is falling apart like rotten wood,
\q2 like a piece of cloth that the larvae of moths are eating.

<usfm>
\q
\v 26 For you write down bitter things against me;
\q you make me inherit the iniquities of my youth.
\q
\v 27 You also put my feet in the stocks;
\q you closely watch all my paths;
\q you examine the ground where the soles of my feet have walked
\q
\v 28 although I am like a rotten thing that wastes away,
\q like a garment that moths have eaten.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Job finishes presenting his case to God.

  * **inherit the iniquities of my youth** - "Inherit" here means to live with the results of his foolish actions while he was young.
  * **in the stocks** - "Stocks" are a form of restraint of prisoners by locking their feet in a fixed position so they can not move about.
  * **all my paths** - "Path" represents the course of action of his life. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **like a rotten thing that wastes away** - Job compares his life to something that is decaying. He is slowly dying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **like a garment that moths have eaten** - Job compares himself to clothes that the worms of a moth will eat so these are no good because of holes in it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
