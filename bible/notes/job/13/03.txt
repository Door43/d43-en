<usfm>
\v 3 But I would like to speak with Almighty God, not with you;
\q2 I would like to argue with him and show him that I am innocent.
\q1
\v 4 As for you, you tell lies and do not allow people to know unpleasant truth,
\q2 like someone who covers up the bad surface of a wall with whitewash.
\q1 You are all like doctors who sell people useless medicine.
\q1
\v 5 I wish that you would be silent;
\q2 that would be wiser than anything you have said to me.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 3 However, I would rather speak with the Almighty;
\q  I wish to reason with God.
\q
\v 4 But you whitewash the truth with lies;
\q you are all physicians of no value.
\q
\v 5 Oh, that you would altogether hold your peace!
\q That would be your wisdom.

===== translationWords: =====

  * [[:en:obe:kt:almighty]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:god]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:true]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:wise]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I wish to reason with God** - Job's friends are judging and not honest. Job would rather argue with God alone about his complaint.
  * **whitewash the truth** - This means to paint over a wall to cover the dirt instead of cleaning it. AT: "cover up the truth with false judgments" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **physicians of no value** - Their effort to heal with counsel was false, deceitful, and wrong. Physicians represent the friends who try to make healing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **hold your peace** - This expression means "be silent". (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **be your wisdom** - By being silent they would not say more foolish talk and would be wiser in their silence.
