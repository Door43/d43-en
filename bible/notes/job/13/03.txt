\v 3 But I would like to speak with Almighty God, not with you;
\q2 I would like to argue with him and show him that I am innocent.
\q1
\v 4 As for you, you tell lies and do not allow people to know unpleasant truth,
\q2 like someone who covers up the bad surface of a wall with whitewash.
\q1 You are all like doctors who sell people useless medicine.
\q1
\v 5 I wish that you would be silent;
\q2 that would be wiser than anything you have said to me.

<usfm>
\q
\v 3 However, I would rather speak with the Almighty;
\q I wish to reason with God.
\q
\v 4 But you whitewash the truth with lies;
\q you are all physicians of no value.
\q
\v 5 Oh, that you would altogether hold your peace!
\q That would be your wisdom.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Job continues to speak to his friends.

  * **you whitewash the truth with lies** - Putting whitewash or plaster on the truth represents ignoring the truth. AT: "you hide the truth with lies" or "you lie and ignore the truth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you are all physicians of no value** - Being a physician represents being a person who comforts others. Being of no value means that they do not know how to do what they should.

  * **hold your peace** - This expression means "be quiet" or "stop talking." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **That would be your wisdom** - They thought that they were saying wise things, but Job was saying that they would be wiser if they would stop talking. The abstract noun "wisdom" can be expressed with the word "wise."  AT: "If you were to do that, you would be wise" or "If you were to stop talking, you would appear wise" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
