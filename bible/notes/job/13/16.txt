===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Job finishes speaking to his friends and begins to address God directly.

  * **This will be the reason for my deliverance** - The abstract noun "deliverance" can be expressed with the verb "deliver." AT: "This is the reason that God will deliver me" or "This is the reason that God will save me from my troubles" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **God, listen carefully** - Job begins directing his speech directly to God.
  * **listen carefully to my speech; let my declaration come to your ears** - These two lines mean basically the same thing and intensify Job's request for God to listen to him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **let my declaration come to your ears** - The abstract noun "declaration" can be expressed with the verb "declare." The ears represent listening. AT: "listen to my declaration" or "listen to what I declare" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
