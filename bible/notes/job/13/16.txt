===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **my acquittal**  - AT: "My release from guilt"
    * **God, listen carefully**  - Job begins directing his speech directly to God.
    * **listen carefully ... come to your hears**  - Both lines mean the same for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **come to your ears**  - "Ears" represent the hearing and listening by a person who here is God himself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
