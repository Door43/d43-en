===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **my acquittal** - "My release from guilt"
  * **God, listen carefully** - Job begins directing his speech directly to God.
  * **listen carefully to my speech; let my declaration come to your ears** - These two lines mean basically the same thing and intensify Job's request for God to listen to him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **come to your ears** - "Ears" represent the hearing and listening by a person who here is God himself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
