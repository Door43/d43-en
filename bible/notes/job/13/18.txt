===== Translation Notes: =====

Job continues addressing his case directly to God himself.

  * **See now** - This emphasizes what follows. "Please pay special attention"
  * **I have set my defense in order** - This expression means "have thought how to explain myself and I am ready to show that I am innocent".
  * **Who is the one who would argue against me in court?** - Job asks this question because he assumes everyone would know the answer. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **If you**  - "You" here means God himself.
  * **give up my life**  - "allow myself to face death"
