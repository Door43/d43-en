====== Job 13 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation. This chapter is a continuation of Job's response to Zophar. It also contain Job's claim of righteousness to Yahweh. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:righteous]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Job's righteousness ==
Despite being upset about his circumstances, Job does not curse God. His friends on the other hand judge Job's case, which Job recognizes to be Yahweh's authority. These three friends therefore try to take God's place. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:curse]] and [[:en:obe:kt:judge]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===


== Rhetorical Questions ==
Job uses many different rhetorical questions in this chapter in order to try to convince Zophar that he is wrong. These questions help to build Job's response. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
