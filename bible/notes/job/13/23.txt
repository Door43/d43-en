===== Translation Notes: =====

Job continues to address his case to God himself.

  * **hide your face** - This expression means "avoid me" or "ignore me". "Face" represents the whole person, in this case God himself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Why do you hide ... like your enemy?** - Job asks these questions for emphasis and then twice for more emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Will you persecute...pursue dry stubble?** - Job asks these questions for emphasis and then twice for more emphasis describing Job's weakness, insignificance and frailty. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **driven leaf, dry stubble** - "Leaf" and "stubble" represent worthless things. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]
