===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **See** - "Behold," "Pay special attention." This word marks where Job wants the three friends to listen carefully.
  * **my eye has seen all this** - "I have seen everything that you have seen." Job referred to himself by his eye since it is with his eyes that he saw what the others had seen. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **My ear has heard and understood it** - "I have heard and understood all that you have said." Job referred to himself by his ear since it is with his ears that he heard what the others had heard. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **What you know, the same I also know** - "What you know, I also know" (UDB) or "I know as much as you"
  * **I am not inferior to you** - AT: "I do not know less than you" (UDB)
