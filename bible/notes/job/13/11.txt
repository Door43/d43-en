===== Translation Notes =====

  * **Would not his majesty ... dread fall upon you?** - Job asks these two questions for emphasis and twice over for more emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **proverbs made of ashes, defenses made of clay** - Job compares their useless proverbs to ashes and their resistance to the truth to clay. Both statements mean the same for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
