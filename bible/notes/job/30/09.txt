\q
\v 9 But now, for their sons I have become their subject for a song of mockery;
\q indeed, I am now a joke to them.
\q
\v 10 They abhor me and stand far off from me;
\q they do not refrain from spitting in my face.
\q
\v 11 For God has unstrung the string to my bow and has afflicted me,
\q and so these people lose all self-control in front of me.
