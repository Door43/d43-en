<usfm>
\q
\v 24 However, does no one reach out with his hand to beg for help when he falls?
\q Does no one in trouble call out for help?
\q
\v 25 Did not I weep for him who was in trouble?
\q Did I not grieve for the needy man?
\q
\v 26 When I looked for good, then evil came;
\q when I waited for light, darkness came instead.

===== Important Terms: =====

  * [[:en:obe:other:heart]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:evil]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:light]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:darkness]]
 

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **does no one reach out ... does no one in trouble call out ... Did I not weep ... Did I not grieve** - All of these questions can be put into the form of statements (see UDB). Job asks these questions, expecting affirmative ("yes") responses. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **I waited for light ... darkness came** - Here "light" represents God's blessing and favor and "darkness" represents trouble and suffering. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
