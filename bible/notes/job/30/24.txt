<usfm>
\v 24 When people experience disasters,
\q2 they sit on a pile of ruins and cry out for help;
\q2 they certainly cry out for help.
\q1
\v 25 I myself wept for people who were experiencing troubles,
\q2 and I felt sorry for poor people.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 24 However, does no one reach out with his hand to beg for help when he falls?
\q Does no one in trouble call out for help?
\q
\v 25 Did not I weep for him who was in trouble?
\q Did I not grieve for the needy man?
\q
\v 26 When I looked for good, then evil came;
\q when I waited for light, darkness came instead.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **does no one reach out ... does no one in trouble call out ... Did I not weep ... Did I not grieve** - All of these questions can be put into the form of statements (see UDB). Job asks these questions, expecting affirmative ("yes") responses. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **I waited for light ... darkness came** - Here "light" represents God's blessing and favor and "darkness" represents trouble and suffering. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
