\q
\v 5 See, these poor people go out to their work
\q like wild donkeys in the wilderness, looking carefully for food;
\q perhaps the Arabah will provide them food for their children.
\q
\v 6 Poor people reap in the night in other peopleâ€™s fields;
\q they glean grapes from the harvest of those wicked people.
\q
\v 7 They lie naked all night without clothing;
\q they have no covering in the cold.

===== Translation Notes: =====
Job continues speaking.
  * **like wild donkeys** - This compares poor people to donkeys who go out to graze but do not know where they will find food. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **wild donkeys** - AT: "untrained donkeys" or "donkeys that no one owns"
  * **Poor people reap in the night ... they glean grapes ...** - These two lines describe the same thing and are used together to describe how hungry these people are. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **They lie naked ... they have no covering ...** - These two lines describe the same thing and are used together to describe how vulerable these people are. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
