\v 8 They are wet with the showers of the mountains;

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **with the showers of the mountains** - AT: "with the rain that falls on the mountains"
    * **from their mothers' breast** - AT: "out of their mothers' arms" or "from their mothers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
    * **They go about** - "They walk around"
    * **naked without clothing** - These two words describe the same thing and are used together to emphasize the poverty of these people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
    * **they carry others' sheaves of grain** - This means their work will provide food for others but not for themselves.
