===== Translation Notes: =====
Job continues speaking.

    * **rebel against the light** - Possible meanings of "light" are 1) physical light or 2) spiritual light, which refers to God or living righteously. AT: "hate the daylight" or "do not want to do things openly" or "they rebel against God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **they know not its ways, nor do they stay in its paths** - These two lines describe the same thing, and are used together to emphasize that they do not want to follow the ways of the light. AT: "they do not know how to live a moral life; they stay far away from living a righteous life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **rises with the light** - AT: "wakes up when the sun comes up"
    * **the poor and needy** - These two words refer to the same group and are used together to emphasize that the murderer kills many people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
    * **he is like a thief** - AT: "he kills people secretly, just like a tief steals secretly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
