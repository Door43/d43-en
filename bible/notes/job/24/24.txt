====== Job 24:24-25 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 24 They prosper for a little while,
\q2 and then \add suddenly\add* they are gone;
\q2 they disappear like weeds wither and die;
\q2 they are like \f + \ft simile \f* stalks of grain that have been cut off.
\q1
\v 25 If this is not true, is there \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* anyone who will show that I am a liar
\q2 and prove that what I have said is not true?"
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 24 They prosper for a little while,
\q2 and then suddenly they are gone;
\q2 God will make them die like all the other people;
\q2 they will be like stalks of grain that the farmers have cut off.
\q1
\v 25 If this is not true, is there anyone who will show that I am a liar
\q2 and prove me wrong?"

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 24 These people are exalted; still, in only a little while, they will be gone;
\q indeed, they will be brought low; they will be gathered up like all the others;
\q they will be cut off like the tops of ears of grain.
\q
\v 25 If it is not so, who can prove me to be a liar;
\q who can make my speech worth nothing?"
