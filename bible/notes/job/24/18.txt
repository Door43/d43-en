<usfm>
\v 18 "\add But it is wicked people who\add* are swept\f + \ft Or: carried \f* away by floods,
\q2 and God curses the land that they own,
\q2 and no one goes to work in their vineyards.
\q1

\q2 those who have sinned disappear into the place where the dead people are.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 However, those wicked people will disappear very quickly,
\q2 and God will curse the land that they owned;
\q2 no one will go any longer to work in their vineyards.
\q1
\v 19 Just as the snow melts away when it is hot and there is no rain,
\q2 those who have sinned will disappear into the place where the dead people are.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 18 Swiftly they pass away, however, like foam on the surface of the waters;
\q their portion of the land is cursed;
\q no one goes to work in their vineyards.
\q
\v 19 Drought and heat consume the snow waters;
\q so sheol also consumes those who have sinned.
