\q
\v 15 Also, the eye of the adulterer waits for the twilight;
\q he says, ‘No eye will see me.’
\q He disguises his face.

\v 16 In the darkness the wicked dig into houses;
\q but the wicked shut themselves up in the daytime;
\q they do not care for the light.

\q they are comfortable with the terrors of the thick darkness.
