<usfm>
\q
\v 15 Also, the eye of the adulterer waits for the twilight;
\q he says, 'No eye will see me.'
\q He disguises his face.
\q
\v 16 In the darkness wicked people dig into houses;
\q but they shut themselves up in the daytime;
\q they do not care for the light.
\q
\v 17 For all of them, thick darkness is like the morning;
\q for they are friends with the terrors of thick darkness.
