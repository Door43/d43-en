===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Bildad continues speaking to Job.

  * **Why are we regarded as beasts** - "You should not think that we are like animals." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **Why are we** - The word "we" probably refers to Bildad and Job's other friends.
  * **why have we become stupid in your sight** - "We are not stupid like you think we are." 
  * **stupid** - Possible meanings are 1) dumb or 2) unclean.
  * **You who tear at yourself in your anger** - See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:job:16:09|16:9]]. Here, Bildad says that it is not God who tore Job in his wrath, but rather it is Job who tore himself in his own wrath.
  * **should the earth be forsaken for you ... out of their places** - This phrase suggests that letting a guilty man go free would be like changing the laws of nature. "Asking God to let a guilty man go free is as silly as asking him to change the entire order of the world." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **should the earth be forsaken** - "should everyone leave the earth?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **should the rocks be removed out of their places** - "should God move mountains around?"
