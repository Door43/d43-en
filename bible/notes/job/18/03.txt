===== Translation Notes: =====

Bildad continues speaking to Job.

  * **Why are we regarded as beasts**  - AT: "You should not think that we are like animals." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **Why are we**  - The word "we" probably refers to Bildad and Job's other friends.
  * **why have we become stupid in your sight**  - AT: "We are not stupid like you think we are." 
  * **stupid** - Possible meanings are 1) dumb or 2) unclean.
  * **You who tear at yourself in your anger**  - See how you translated a similar phrase in [[en:bible:notes:job:16:09|16:9]]. Here, Bildad says that it is not God who tore Job in his wrath, but rather it is Job who tore himself in his own wrath.
  * **should the earth be forsaken for you
...out of their places**  - This phrase suggests that letting a guilty man go free would be like changing the laws of nature. AT: "Asking God to let a guilty man go free is as silly as asking him to change the entire order of the world." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **should the earth be forsaken**  - AT: "should everyone leave the earth?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **should the rocks be removed out of their places**  - AT: "should God move mountains around?"
