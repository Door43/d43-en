===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Bildad continues to speak and uses three parallel images to describe how suddenly the wicked person will experience disaster. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **A trap will take him ... a snare will ... A noose is ... and a trap for him in the way** - These four phrases speak of the wicked man experiencing disaster as if he were caught in a trap. AT: "It will be as though a trap will take him ... a snare will ... A noose is ... and a trap for him in the way" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **A trap** - People used this kind of trap to catch birds. The trap snapped shut and held on to the foot of the bird.
  * **will take him by the heel** - Here the "heel" refers to the whole foot. AT: "will take hold of his foot" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **A noose is hidden for him on the ground** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Someone has hidden a noose on the ground in order to catch him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **A noose** - a rope with a loop that grabs hold of an animal's leg when the animal steps in the middle of the loop
  * **a trap for him** - The missing words may be added. AT: "a trap is hidden on the path to catch him" or "someone will hide a trap to catch him in the way" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **Terrors will make him afraid on every side** - "Terrors all around will make him afraid"
  * **they will chase him at his heels** - This speaks of the things that terrify the wicked person as if they were enemies who chased him. AT: "it will be as if the terrors will chase him all around" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
