===== Translation Notes: =====

Bildad continues to describe the wicked person.
  * **He will be torn out of his tent** - AT: "Disaster will rip him out of his tent." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **he will be brought to death** - AT: "disaster will make him march to death" or "disaster will make him die." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the king of terrors** - Bildad refers to "death" as "the king of terrors" because death is more terrifying than anything else that is terrifying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **People not his own will live in his tent** - "Other people will live in his tent." This refers to people who are not part of the wicked persons family.
  * **after they see that sulfur is scattered within his home** - "after they spread sulfur all over his home." People used sulfur to get rid of any diseases from a dying person.
