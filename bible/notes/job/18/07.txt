===== Translation Notes: =====

Bildad continues to describe the wicked person.
    * **The steps of his strength...into a pitfall** - Bildad uses these images to say that the wicked experience sudden disaster. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **The steps of his strength**  - "The steps he takes when he is strong" or "His strong steps"
    * **will be made short**  - "will become short." When a person is strong, he is able to take long and quick steps. When a person is weak, he can only take short steps. 
    * **his own plans will cast him down** - "his own advice makes him fall down"
    * **For he will thrown into a net by his own feet**  - "His own feet will lead him into a net." Bildad uses this image to say that the way that a wicked person lives his life leads him to sudden disaster. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **a net** - cords or ropes that people weave together to create a mesh. People used nets to catch animals.
    * **a pitfall** - a pit that has branches and leaves over it so that an animal will walk onto the branches and leaves and fall into the pit
