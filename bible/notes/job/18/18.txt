===== Translation Notes: =====

Bildad continues to describe the wicked person.

  * **He will be driven...out of this world**  - These phrases together emphasize the fact that the wicked person will be sent to Sheol, the place of the dead. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) 
  * **He will be driven from light into darkness**  - AT: "God will drive the wicked person from light into darkness." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **from light into darkness**  - The word "light" refers life, and the word "darkness" refers to death.
  * **and be chased out of this world**  - AT: "and God will send him to the place where dead people go."
  * **He will have no son...remaining kinfolk where he had stayed**  - "He will not have any children to continue his family line." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **kinfolk** - "relatives"
  * **Those who live in the west...will be frightened by it**  - "Everyone in the whole world will be scared when they see what happens to the evil person."
