===== Translation Notes: =====

Bildad continues speaking to Job.
  * **Indeed, the light...his lamp above him will be put out** - Bildad uses these images to say that the wicked will experience sudden and complete disaster or death. Light represent prosperity, joy, and life. Darkness poverty, sorrow, and death. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **will be put out** - "will go out" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **The light will be dark** - AT: "The light will turn into darkness"
