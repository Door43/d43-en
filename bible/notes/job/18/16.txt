===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Bildad continues to describe the wicked person.

  * **His roots will be dried up ... branch be cut off** - This speaks of the wicked man dying and having no descendants as if he were a tree whose roots dried up and branches withered, producing no fruit. AT: "He will die and leave no descendants, he will be like a tree whose roots have dried up and whose branches have all withered" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **will his branch be cut off** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "his branches will wither" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **His memory will perish from the earth; he will have no name in the street** - These phrases have the same meaning and are used together to emphasize the fact that nobody will remember him after he dies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) 
  * **His memory will perish from the earth** - This speaks of the "memory" of the wicked man as if it were a person who died. AT: "No one on the earth will remember him" 
  * **he will have no name in the street** - This is an idiom. AT: "no one walking along the street will even remember his name" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
