===== Translation Notes: =====

Bildad continues to describe the wicked person.

  * **His roots will be dried up...branch be cut off**  - This compares a wicked person to a sick tree that looses its roots and branches. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **His memory will perish...no name in the street**  - These phrases are used together to emphasize the fact that nobody will remember him anymore. AT: "Everybody in the world will forget about him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
