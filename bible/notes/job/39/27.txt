===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues to challenge Job.

  * **Is it at your orders ... nest in high places?** - Yahweh uses this question to prove that Job is not powerful enough to command the eagles. The implicit answer to this question is "no." AT: "You are not able to command the eagle to mount up and build his nest in high places." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **at your orders** - The abstract noun "orders" can be stated as a verb. AT: "because you tell it to do so" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **mounts up** - This means he flies upward. AT: "flies up into the sky" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **a stronghold** - The high cliffs are strongholds for eagles because the animals that would want to eat them cannot reach them.
