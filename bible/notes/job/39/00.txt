====== Job 39 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter is a continuation of the previous chapter. Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers, or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation. Yahweh continues to speak in this chapter. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Yahweh's greatness ==
Yahweh is far greater than any man. He is the creator of the earth, and his ways will not always be understood by men because their knowledge is always limited. Since Job cannot understand creation, he cannot truly understand Yahweh. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical questions ==
Yahweh uses a series of rhetorical questions in this chapter in order to defend his character. Many of these questions focus on nature because Yahweh is the creator of the heavens and the earth. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:obe:kt:heaven]])
