  * **He** - The word "he" refers to the wild donkey.
  * **laughs in scorn** - Yahweh describes the donkey as though he were a person. The donkeys laughs because those in the city have to hear loud noise, but he lives in quiet place. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **the driver's** - someone who forces an animal to work 
  * **pastures** - places where animals can eat plants
