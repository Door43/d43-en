====== Job 39:13-15 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 \add Think also about\add* the ostriches. They joyfully flap their wings,
\q2 but they do not have wing feathers \add that enable them to fly\add* like storks do.
\q1
\v 14 Ostriches lay their eggs on top of the ground \add and then walk away\add*,
\q2 leaving the eggs to be warmed in the sand.
\q1
\v 15 Ostriches do not worry that some wild animal may step on the eggs and crush them \f + \ft doublet \f*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 Think also about the ostriches. They joyfully flap their wings,
\q2 but they have no love for their own young.
\q1
\v 14 Ostriches lay their eggs on top of the ground and then walk away,
\q2 leaving the eggs to be warmed in the sand.
\q1
\v 15 Ostriches never think about the possibility that some wild animal may step on the eggs and crush them.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 13 The wings of the ostrich wave proudly,
\q but are they the pinions and plumage of love?
\q
\v 14 For she leaves her eggs on the earth,
\q and she lets them keep warm in the dust;
\q
\v 15 she forgets that a foot might crush them
\q or that a wild beast might trample them.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues to challenge Job.

  * **The wings of the ostrich ... pinions and plumage of love?** - Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that Job cannot explain why ostriches behave the way they do. AT: "You do not know whether the pinions and plumage of the ostrich represent love when they wave their wings proudly." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **ostrich** - a very large bird that can run very fast but cannot fly
  * **wave proudly** - "move with joy"
  * **pinions** - the very long feathers on the wings of birds
  * **plumage** - the smaller feathers that cover the body of a bird
  * **of love** - The Hebrew word is uncertain. Possible meanings are 1) "of faithfulness" or 2) "of a stork." The name of the stork meant "the faithful one" or "the loving one" because people knew that storks take very good care of their chicks.
  * **on the earth** - "on the ground"
  * **crush them** - The word "them" refers to the eggs.
  * **trample them** - "step on them"
