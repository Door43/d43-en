Yahweh continues to challenge Job.
    * **They crouch down** - The word "they" refers to the goats and the deer.
    * **birthe their young**  - "make their offspring come out"
    * **then they finish their labor pains**  - The word "labor pains" refers to the offspring of the goats and deer because they are the result of the mother's labor and pain. AT: "send out their offspring from their womb." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
    * **the open fields**  - "the countryside" or "the wild"
