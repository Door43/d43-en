  * **Is it by your wisdom that the hawk soars** - AT: "It is not you who taughts the hawk to soar." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **stretches out his wings** - AT: "flies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **for the south** - In the biblical geography, birds fly south during the winter in order to live in warmer climates.
