===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.

  * **Will you trust...your threshing floor** - Yahweh uses these questions to emphasize that Job cannot control the wild ox. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **trust him** - The word "him" refers to the "wild ox."
  * **leave your work to him to do** - "have him do your hard work for you"
