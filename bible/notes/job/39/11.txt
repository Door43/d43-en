===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.
    * **Will you trust...your threshing floor**  - Yahweh uses these questions to emphasize that Job cannot control the wild ox. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **trust him**  - The word "him" refers to the "wild ox."
    * **leave your work to him to do**  - "have him do your hard work for you"
