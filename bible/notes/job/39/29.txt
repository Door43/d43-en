===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **he searches for victims** - Here the word "he" refers to the eagle.
    * **his eyes see them** - AT: "he sees them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
    * **where killed people are** - "where there are dead people." This phrase refers to dead bodies that are lying out in the open, not to bodies that are buried in the ground.
    * **there he is** - AT: "he is there to eat them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
