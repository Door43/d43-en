===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.
    * **Will the wild ox...the valleys for you** - Yahweh uses these questions to emphasize that Job cannot control the wild ox. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **the wild ox**  - Possible meanings are 1) "the wild ox," a type of ox that used to live in the wild or 2) "the antelope," some kinds of antelope look like oxen.
    * **be happy**  - "be willing"
    * **consent to stay by your manger**  - "stay by your manger through the night"
    * **manger** - something that holds food so that animals can eat it
    * **furrows**  - Long channels made in the dirt while plowing. See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:job:31:38|31:38]].
    * **harrow**  - "plow"
    * **for you**  - "behind you." When plowing, a person would lead an ox that was behind him.
