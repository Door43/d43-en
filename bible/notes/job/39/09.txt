===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.
  * **Will the wild ox...the valleys for you** - Yahweh uses these questions to emphasize that Job cannot control the wild ox. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the wild ox** - Possible meanings are 1) "the wild ox," a type of ox that used to live in the wild or 2) "the antelope," some kinds of antelope look like oxen.
  * **be happy** - "be willing"
  * **consent to stay by your manger** - "stay by your manger through the night"
  * **manger** - something that holds food so that animals can eat it
  * **furrows** - Long channels made in the dirt while plowing. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:job:31:38|31:38]].
  * **harrow** - "plow"
  * **for you** - "behind you." When plowing, a person would lead an ox that was behind him.
