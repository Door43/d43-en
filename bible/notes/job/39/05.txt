===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.
    * **Who let...the salt land**  - Yahweh uses these questions to emphasize that he takes care of the wild donkeys and that Job does not. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * ** the wild donkey...the swift donkey**  - These are different names for the same kind of donkey.
    * **bonds**  - ropes, chains, or straps that hold an animal and keep it from running away
    * **whose home** - Yahweh describes the donkey as though he were a person that had a house. AT: "I gave him the Arabah as a place to live." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **the salt land**  - the land around the Salt Sea that has a lot of salt in it
