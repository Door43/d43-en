===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.
  * **Have you given the horse...a locust?** - Yahweh uses these questions to emphasize that he is the one who does these things and that Job is not. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **clothe his neck** - The word "cloth" is a way of describing how Yahweh made the neck of the horse."make his neck." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **his flowing mane** - the long hair that comes down from the neck of a horse and shakes when the horse moves
  * **a locust** - a large kind of grasshopper that can jump very far and very quickly
  * **snorting** - a very loud sound that horses make with their nose
