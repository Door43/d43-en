===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.
    * **Have you given the horse...a locust?**  - Yahweh uses these questions to emphasize that he is the one who does these things and that Job is not. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **clothe his neck**  - The word "cloth" is a way of describing how Yahweh made the neck of the horse. AT: "make his neck." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **his flowing mane**  - the long hair that comes down from the neck of a horse and shakes when the horse moves
    * **a locust**  - a large kind of grasshopper that can jump very far and very quickly
    * **snorting**  - a very loud sound that horses make with their nose
