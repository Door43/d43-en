====== Job 39:16-18 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 Ostriches act cruelly towards their chicks;
\q2 they act as though the chicks belonged to some other ostrich.
\q1 They are not concerned \add if their chicks die\add*,
\q2 and so the laying of the eggs was in vain.
\q1
\v 17 That is because I did not allow ostriches to be wise.
\q2 I did not enable them to be intelligent.
\q1
\v 18 But, when they get up and begin to run,
\q2 they scornfully laugh at horses with their riders
\q2 \add because the horses cannot run as fast as the ostriches\add*!
\b

\q
\v 16 She deals roughly with her young ones as if they were not hers;
\q she does not fear that her labor might have been in vain,
\q
\v 17 because God has deprived her of wisdom
\q and has not given her any understanding.
\q
\v 18 When she runs swiftly,
\q she laughs in scorn at the horse and its rider.
