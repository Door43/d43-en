====== Job 39:16-18 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 Ostriches act cruelly towards their chicks;
\q2 they act as though the chicks belonged to some other ostrich.
\q1 They are not concerned \add if their chicks die\add*,
\q2 and so the laying of the eggs was in vain.
\q1
\v 17 That is because I did not allow ostriches to be wise.
\q2 I did not enable them to be intelligent.
\q1
\v 18 But, when they get up and begin to run,
\q2 they scornfully laugh at horses with their riders
\q2 \add because the horses cannot run as fast as the ostriches\add*!

\v 16 She deals hardly with her young ones, as if they were not hers:
\q Though her labor be in vain, she is without fear;
\q
\v 17 Because God has deprived her of wisdom,
\q Neither has he imparted to her understanding.
\q
\v 18 What time she lifts up herself on high,
\q She scorneth the horse and his rider.
