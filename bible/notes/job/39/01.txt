===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.
  * **Do you know at what time...time when they bear their young** - Yahweh uses these questions to emphasize that he takes care of the goats and deer and Job does not. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Can you watch when the deer are having their fawns** - "When the deer give birth can you watch to make sure everything goes well"
  * **are having their fawns** - "give birth" 
  * **months** - (See: [[:en:obe:other:biblicaltimemonth]])
  * **that they gestate** - "to make sure that they complete their pregnancy" or "to make sure that they get to full term"   
  * **they** - The word "they" refers to the goats and the deer.
  * **gestate** - "are pregnant"
  * **the time when they bear their young** - "when they give birth"
