===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Job continues to speak to his three friends.

  * **My bones cling to my skin and to my flesh** - Job speaks of his bones, skin, and flesh to describe his appearance. He was extremely thin, and people could easily see the shape of his bones. Some languages have idioms for this. AT: "I am just skin and bones" or "I am bony" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I survive only by the skin of my teeth** - This idiom means that he is barely surviving, that he almost does not survive. AT: "I am barely alive"  or "I hardly survive" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Have pity upon me** - "Have compassion on me"
  * **for the hand of God has touched me** - Here "touched me" is a metonym for "hit me." This is a metaphor for doing things that cause Job to suffer. AT: "because God has afflicted me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Why do you persecute me ... God?** - Job uses this question to complain about how his friends are treating him.  AT: "Do not persecute me ... God!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Why are you not satisfied with consuming my flesh?** - Job uses this question to complain about how his friends are treating him. AT: "You have consumed my flesh enough" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Why are you not satisfied with consuming my flesh?** - Job speaks of his friends speaking so cruelly to him as if they were wild beasts eating up another animal. AT: "Stop violently slandering me" or "Stop attacking me with your words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
