\v 25 But as for me, I know that my Redeemer lives,
\q and that at last he will stand on the earth;
\q
\v 26 after my skin, that is, this body, is destroyed,
\q then in my flesh I will see God.
\q
\v 27 I will see him, I myself will see him on my side;
\q my eyes will see him, and not as a stranger.
\q My kidneys fail within me.
