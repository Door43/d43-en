\v 25 But as for me, I know that my Redeemer lives,
\q and that at last he will stand on the earth;
\q
\v 26 after my skin, that is, this body, is destroyed,
\q then in my flesh I will see God.
\q
\v 27 I will see him, I myself will see him on my side;
\q my eyes will see him, and not as a stranger.
\q My kidneys fail within me.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Job continues to speak to his three friends.
    * **my Redeemer**  - a person who will rescue Job by proving Job's innocence, restoring his honor, and giving him justice
    * **at last** - This refers to the time when the argument about Job's guilt is finally resolved.
    * **he will stand**  - This refers to the Redeemer standing as a witness or advocate for Job. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]) 
    * **on the earth**  - "on the dust" or "on the ground"
    * **after my skin...is destroyed**  - AT: "after my skin...is gone." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
    * **in my flesh**  - "in my body" or "with my body alive"
    * **on my side** - "as my advocate" or "helping me"
    * **not as a stranger**  - The Redeemer will act like a friend and will no longer act like a stranger.
    * **My kidneys fail within me** - People thought of the kidneys as the source of emotions. As Job looks forward to the day when his redeemer will rescue him, he is overwhelmed by emotion. AT: "I am overwhelmed with emotion as I look forward to that time." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
