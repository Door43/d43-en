  * **He has walled up my way so that I cannot pass** - "God has put a wall the road that I am walking on"
  * **He has stripped...the crown from my head** - Job uses these images to say that God has taken his good reputation, wealth and prosperity away from him.
  * **He has stripped me of my glory** - "He has taken away my glory." Job describes his glory as a robe that God has taken off of him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
