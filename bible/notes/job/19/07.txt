===== Translation Notes: =====

Job continues to speak to his three friends.
  * **See** - The word "See" here adds emphasis to what follows. AT: "Indeed"
  * **I call out to say that I have been done wrong** - "I scream 'Violence'" or "I shout 'Injustice'." Job shouts "Violence" as a short and urgent way of saying "Help me because someone is treating me violently." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **but I am not heard** - AT: "but no one hears me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **I call out for help** - "I shout for help" or "I cry for help"
  * **but there is no justice** - AT: "no one helps me and gets justice for me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **He has walled up...darkness in my path** - Job uses these images to say that God has made him feel helpless and hopeless. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **He has walled up my way so that I cannot pass** - "God has put a wall on the road that I am walking on"
  * **He has stripped...the crown from my head** - Job uses these images to say that God has taken his good reputation, wealth and prosperity away from him. "Crown" refers to Job's good reputation. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **He has stripped me of my glory** - "He has taken away my glory." Job describes his glory as a robe that God has taken off of him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the crown from my head** - "the crown that was on my head"
