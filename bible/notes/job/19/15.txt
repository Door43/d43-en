Job continues to speak to his three friends.

  * **I am an alien in their sight** - AT: "they think of me as a foreigner." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **in their sight** - "from their perspective" or "in their opinion" Job uses the ability to see to the opinion people have. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **my servant** - This was Job's male servant, who was probably highly trusted and dear to Job.
  * **but he gives me no answer** - "but he does not answer"
  * **although I entreat him with my mouth** - The phrase "with my mouth" refers to speaking. AT: "even though I speak to him and plead with him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **entreat him** - "plead with him"
