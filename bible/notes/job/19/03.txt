===== Translation Notes: =====

Job continues to speak to his three friends.

  * **have treated me harshly** - "have despised me" or "have publicly ridiculed me"
  * **have erred** - "have sinned by accident" or "mistakenly sinned"
  * **my error** - "my sin" or "my mistake"
  * **remains my own concern** - Job implies that his friends are not responsible for continuing to rebuke him. AT: "is my own responsibility and you should not continue to rebuke me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
