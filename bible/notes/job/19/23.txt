===== Translation Notes: =====

Job continues to speak to his three friends.
  * **Oh, that my words were now written down** - AT: "I wish that someone would write down my words." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Oh, that they were inscribed in a book** - AT: "I wish that someone would write them in a book." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Oh, that with an iron pen and lead
they were engraven in the rock forever** - "I wish that someone would use an iron chisel and lead to carve them in the rock forever." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **an iron pen** - "an iron chisel." This was a tool made out of hard iron that people used to carve rocks.
  * **and lead** - Lead is a soft metal. We do not know how people used lead when carving rock. They might have filled the letters of the inscription with lead in order to make the inscription last longer.
