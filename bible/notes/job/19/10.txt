===== Translation Notes: =====

Job continues to speak to his three friends.

  * **he has broken me down on every side - He refers to God. This is a compaarison, and Job is compared to a fortress attacked and destroyed by and enemy. (See: Metaphor)**
  * he has plucked up my hopes like a tree - This is a comparison . Job is protrayed as a plant that is not wanted and pulled out of the ground to get rid of it. (See: Simile)
  * **kindled his wrath - This expression means "he has become very angry". (See: Idiom)**
  * **cast up seige mounds- This expression refers to ancient warfare when a city would have a high fortified wall around it for protection. The enemy would build a road or ramp to the top of the wall, called a seige mound, to invade the city. Job's friends are protrayed as these troops, who invade his tent.**
