===== Translation Notes: =====

Job continues to speak to his three friends.
  * **If indeed you will boast against me** - "Since indeed you act as though you are better than me"
  * **am disgraced** - AT: "have done something disgraceful." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **has caught me in his net** - Job compares God with a hunter that has violently caught an innocent animal in his net. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
