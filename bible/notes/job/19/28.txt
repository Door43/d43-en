\v 28 If you three men say, 'What more can we do cause him to suffer?'

\q
\v 28 If you say, ‘How we will persecute him!
\q The root of his troubles lies in him,’
\q

===== Translation Notes: =====

Job continues to speak to his three friends.

  * **How we will persecute him**  - This is also a question requesting ways to make Job suffer. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) AT: "How can we make him suffer as much as possible"
  * **because the root of the matter is found in him**  - AT: "and if you say that I am the cause of my own suffering." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **then be afraid of the sword** - The sword represents God's anger and judgement. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **because wrath brings the punishment**  - The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain. Possible meanings are 1) the things that Job's friends have been saying bring punishment or 2) God's anger brings punishment.
  * **there is a judgment**  - "God punishes sinners"
