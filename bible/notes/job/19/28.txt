===== Translation Notes: =====

Job continues to speak to his three friends.

  * **How we will persecute him**  - This is also a question requesting ways to make Job suffer. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) AT: "How can we make him suffer as much as possible"
  * **because the root of the matter is found in him**  - AT: "and if you say that I am the cause of my own suffering." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **then be afraid of the sword** - The sword represents God's anger and judgement. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **because wrath brings the punishment**  - The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain. Possible meanings are 1) the things that Job's friends have been saying bring punishment or 2) God's anger brings punishment.
  * **there is a judgment**  - "God punishes sinners"
