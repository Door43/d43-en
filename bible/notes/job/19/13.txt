===== Translation Notes: =====

Job continues to speak to his three friends.
  * **He has put my brothers far from me** - "God caused my brothers to be far away from me."  This image means that Job's brothers refuse to help him. AT: "God caused my brothers to refuse to help me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **my acquaintances are wholly alienated from me** - "my friends even treat me like they were strangers"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **My kinsfolk have failed me**  - "My relatives have left me without help"
  * **my close friends**  - "my intimate friends"
  * **have forgotten**  - refuse to treat a person according to former deeds and relationship. Job compares forgetting to refusal to help. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
