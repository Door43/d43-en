\v 10 He cuts out channels among the rocks;
\q his eye sees every valuable thing there.
\q

\q what is hidden there he brings out to the light.

  * **flinty rock** - "hard rock"
  * **overturns mountains by their roots** - "turns the mountains upside down by pulling out their roots." This hyperbole represents digging up the mountains and the ground underneath them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **he overturns mountains by their roots** - The ground underneath the mountains is spoken of as if the mountains were a tree and the ground beneath them were the roots. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
