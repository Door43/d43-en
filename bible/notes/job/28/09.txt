  * **lays his hand on the flinty rock** - This represents breaking up the rock. AT: "digs into the flinty rock" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **flinty rock** - "hard rock"
  * **he overturns mountains by their roots** - Digging up the mountains and the ground underneath them is a metaphor from digging out weeds or trees, an exaggeration that represents digging minerals out of the ground. AT: "he turns the mountains upside down by pulling out their roots." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **his eye sees** - Here "his eye" represents him. AT: "he sees" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **He ties up the streams so they do not run** - Here "ties up the streams" means damming or blocking the streams. AT: "He blocks the streams so they do not flow" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **what is hidden there** - This refers to things that people normally do not see because they are in the ground or underwater.
