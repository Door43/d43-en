===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **No bird of prey knows ... nor has the falcon's eye ...** - Both of these clauses express similar meaning. AT: "No falcon knows or has ever seen the path to the mines" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **bird of prey** - a bird that eats other animals
    * **falcon** - This may also be translated "vulture". Both are large flying bird that eat smaller animals. You may translate this with a similar bird from your culture that is large and eats other animals.
    * **proud animals have not walked ... nor has the fierce lion passed ...** - These clauses also express similar meaning. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **it ... there** - The words "it" and "there" refer to the mines.
