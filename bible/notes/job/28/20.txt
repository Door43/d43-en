===== translationNotes: =====

  * **From where, then, comes wisdom? Where is the place of understanding?** - Job uses these questions to introduce how people get wisdom and understanding. AT: "I will tell you where wisdom comes from and where understanding is." or "I will tell you how to become wise and how to learn to understand things." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **From where, then, comes wisdom** - Wisdom is spoken of as if it were in a place and comes to people. Its coming represents people becoming wise. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Where is the place of understanding** - Understanding is spoken of as if it were in a place. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Wisdom is hidden from the eyes of all living things** - This means that living things are unable to see wisdom. It can be expressed in active form. AT: "No living thing can see wisdom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **is kept hidden from the birds of the heavens** - This means that the birds are unable to see wisdom. This can be expressed in active form. AT: "even the birds that fly in the skies cannot see wisdom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Destruction and Death say** - Here "Destruction" and "Death" are spoken of as if they are living things who can speak. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
