<usfm>
\q
\v 20 From where, then, comes wisdom?
\q Where is the place of understanding?
\q
\v 21 Wisdom is hidden from the eyes of all living things
\q and is kept hidden from the birds of the heavens.
\q
\v 22 Destruction and Death say,
\q 'We have heard just a rumor about it with our ears.'

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **hidden from the eyes of all living things** - AT: "Wisdom is not a thing that can be observed by man or beast. For example, a bird cannot watch it as it flies over the ground. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **destruction and death** - Both "death" and "destruction" are represented as saying that they have only "heard" about wisdom. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
