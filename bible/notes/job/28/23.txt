===== translationNotes: =====

  * **God understands the way to it; he knows its place** - Wisdom is spoken of as if it were in a certain place. AT: "God knows how to find wisdom. He knows where it is" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the very ends of the earth** - "the farthest places on the earth"
  * **parceled out the waters by measure** - This represents God deciding how much water should be in each place. Possible meanings are that this refers to deciding 1) how much rain should be in each cloud or 2) how much water should be in each sea. AT: "decided how much water should be in each place" or "put the amount of water that he planned for each place" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
