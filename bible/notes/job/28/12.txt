===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Where will wisdom be found? Where is the place of understanding?** - Both of these questions have the same meaning and are seeking the same answer. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **its price ... is it found ... It is not** - Here the word "it" refers to wisdom. 
  * **The deep waters ... say, 'It is not in me;' the sea says, 'It is not with me.'** - AT: "It is not in the deep waters under the earth, nor is it in the sea" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
