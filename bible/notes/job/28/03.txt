\q
\v 3 A man sets an end to darkness
\q and searches out, to the farthest limit,
\q the stones in obscurity and thick darkness.
\q
\v 4 He breaks open a shaft away from where people live,
\q places that are forgotten by anyone's foot.
\q He hangs far away from people; he swings to and fro.

===== translationNotes: =====
  * **A man sets an end to darkness** - Here "sets and end to darkness" represents shining a light in the darkness. People would use a flame, either in a lantern or on a torch. AT: "A man carries light into dark places" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **to the farthest limit** - "to the farthest parts of the mine"
  * **obscurity ... thick darkness** - These two phrases are used together to emphasize that the darkness is extremely dark. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **shaft** - a deep narrow hole dug into the ground or rock. People go down the hole to mine it. 
  * **places that are forgotten by anyone's foot** - Places where people do not walk are spoken of as if the feet of anyone who might have walked there long ago had forgotten the places. AT: "where no one ever walks" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * He hangs far away from people** - How and where he hangs can be stated clearly. AT: "Far away from people, he hangs from a rope in the shaft" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
