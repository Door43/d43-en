===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the earth, out of which comes bread** - Here "bread" is a metonym for food in general. Food coming out of the ground is a metaphor for food growing in the ground. AT: "the earth, where food grows," (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **it is turned up below as if by fire** - Possible meanings are that 1) people made fires under the ground to break apart the rock. AT: "it is broken up below by the fires that the miners make" or 2) "turn" is a metaphor for change. AT: "it is broken up below so much it is as if it were destroyed by fire"
  * **it is turned ... Its stones ... its dust** - The word "it" refers to the earth.
  * **sapphires** - This word refers to a type of rare and expensive blue gem stone.
