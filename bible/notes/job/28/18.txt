===== translationNotes: =====

  * **No mention is worth making of coral or jasper** - "It is not worth making mention of coral and jasper." This implies that wisdom is worth so much more than coral and jasper that there is no need for Job to say anything about them. AT: "I will not bother to mention coral or jasper" or "Coral and jasper are worthless compared to wisdom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) 
  * **coral** - This is a beautiful, hard substance that grows on ocean reefs. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **jasper ... rubies ... topaz** - These are valuable gemstones.
  * **The topaz of Ethiopia does not equal it** - This implies that wisdom is much more valuable than topaz.
  * **neither can it be valued in terms of pure gold** - "and wisdom cannot be valued in terms of pure gold." This implies that wisdom is much more valuable than pure gold.
