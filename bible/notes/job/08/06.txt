  * **General Information:** - Bildad says that God would treat Job well if he was pure, but Bildad does not believe that Job is pure. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])

  * **Suppose that you were pure and upright** - "If only you were pure and righteous" or "If only you would obey God and do what is right"
  * **act for you** - "help you" or "do good things for you"
  * **reward you with a home that truly belonged to you** - 
  * **Even though your beginning was small, still your final condition would be much greater** - Here lack of wealth is spoken of as being a "small beginning." AT: "Even if you were poor early in your life, God would make you very wealthy later in your life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
