===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Can papyrus grow without a marsh?  Can reeds grow without water?** - Bildad poses two rhetorical questions to emphasize his point made in [[en:bible:notes:job:08:08|08:8-10]]: People need the teachings of their ancestors. AT: "Papyrus plants cannot grow away from the marshes.  Reeds cannot grow without water." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]). 
  * **wither** - "dry up"
