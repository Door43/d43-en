  * **General Information:** - It is unclear if verses 11-14 are the teaching of Bildad, or if Bildad is quoting the sayings of the ancestors of [[:en:bible:notes:job:08:08|8:8-10]].

  * **Can papyrus grow without a marsh? Can reeds grow without water?** - Bildad uses these two parallel questions to emphasize the single point that people cannot live without God. Here the plants represent people and the water represents God. AT: "Papyrus plants cannot grow away from the marshes. Reeds cannot grow without water." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]).
  * **papyrus** - a tall reed-like plant that grows in shallow water
  * **While they are still green and not cut down, they wither before any other plant** - It is implied that they wither when there is no water. This can be stated explicitly. AT: "Without water, they stop growing and wither faster than any other plant, even if no one cuts them down" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **wither** - "dry up"
