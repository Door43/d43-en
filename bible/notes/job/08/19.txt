===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **'joy'** - the reward, the result of a person's evil behavior that Bildad scornfully voices as 'joy.' (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **behavior** - "actions" or "way of life"
  * **other plants will sprout up from the same soil in his place** - Here the writer continues the metaphor from [[en:bible:notes:job:08:16|08:16-18]]. Godless people are compared to plants that take the place of the first ones that grow among rocks. AT: "When one wicked man dies, another will take his place" or "From the soil, another will grow." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **sprout up** - "grow"
  * **same soil** - "the rocky ground"
  * **in his place** - "in the place of the godless man"
  * **neither will he take the hand of evildoers** - "Hand" represents the whole person. "he will not support evildoers" or "he will not strengthen evildoers" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
