===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **for he has handed them over to their sins** - "it is because God has allowed the power of their sin to control them" or "he punished them with the consequences of their sins."
  * **But suppose you diligently sought God and presented your request to the Almighty** - Here the writer expresses the single idea of seeking God in order to present his case using two steps.  (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
