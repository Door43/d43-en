===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He will yet fill your mouth with laughter, your lips with shouting** - These two phrases mean the same thing and emphasize how happy Job would be if he were innocent. The word "he" refers to God and "your" refers to Job.

  * **Those who hate you will be clothed with shame** - Here "shame" is spoken of as if it were clothing that God will Job's enemies to wear. This means they will be very ashamed. AT: "God will cause those who hate you to be very ashamed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
