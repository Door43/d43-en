===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **He will yet fill your mouth with laughter, your lips with shouting** - Bildad continues speaking to Job. The word "he" refers to God, and "your" refers to Job.  The writer conveys a single idea using two different statements to convey the joy that Job will experience. "God will make you happy again." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])  
  * **your lips with shouting** - The complete meaning of this phrase can be understood from the beginning of the sentence. "God will fill your lips with shouts of joy." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **Those who hate you will be clothed with shame; the tent of the wicked will be no more** - "The godless will be filled with shame; the wicked will cease to exist."
  * **will be no more** - "will not last" or "will come to nothing"
