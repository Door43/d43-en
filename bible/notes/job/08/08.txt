===== Translation Notes: =====

The writer continues to use parallelism in each of these verses, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize the people's capacity to learn from their ancestors, given the brevity of life and the ancestors' willingness to impart teachings. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]])

  * **about the ages past**  - "about earlier generations"
  * **apply yourself to learn what our ancestors discovered**  - "study carefully what our ancestors discovered" or "consider what our forefathers discovered"
  * **our days on earth are a shadow**  - In this simile, life is compared to a shadow; both pass by quickly. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
  * **Will they not teach you and tell you, Will they not speak words from their hearts?**  - Bildad poses this question to rebuke Job. AT: "They will teach you and tell you, and from their understanding bring forth words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
