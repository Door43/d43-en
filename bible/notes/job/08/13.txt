\v 13 Those who do not pay attention to what God says are like those reeds;
\q2 godless people stop confidently expecting that good things will happen to them.
\q1
\v 14 The things they confidently expect to happen do not happen;
\q2 things they trust will help them are as weak as a spider's web.
\q1
\v 15 If they lean against a house, it falls on them;
\q2 if they cling to things for safety, those things will not remain firm.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 13 So also are the paths of all who forget God,
\q the hope of the godless men will perish—
\q
\v 14 those whose confidence will break apart,
\q and those whose trust is as fragile as a spider's web.
\q
\v 15 Such a person will lean on his house, but it will not stand;
\q he will hold onto it, but it will not last.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - These verses continue Bildad's speech. In verses 14-15, the writer uses parallelism, conveying a single idea with two different statements to emphasize the destruction of those who do not build their lives on the teachings of their ancestors. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **So also are the paths of all who forget God** - "Walking a path" is a common idiom that refers to a person's life and its direction. It often refers to whether people are following God's way or their own. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **his trust is as weak as a spider's web** - Here Bildad compares the lives of the godless to a spider's web; the slightest force will break both. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **he will hold onto it** - "he will try to keep it together" or "he will try to support it"
