  * **Connecting Statement:** - In this chapter, Bildad begins to speak about Job's complaints. 
  * **General Information:** -  Verses 2 and 3 each consist of two different questions that have the same meaning. Bildad uses these questions to rebuke Job. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **How long will the words of your mouth be a mighty wind?** - Bildad speaks of Job's words as if they are as empty and insubstantial as the wind. This can be translated as a statement.
