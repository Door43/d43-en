===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In each verse of his speech, Bildad conveys a single idea using two different statements, first to rebuke Job and then to defend God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **Then Bildad the Shuhite answered** - "Bildad" is the name of a man who is a member of the tribe of Shuah. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **How long will the words of your mouth be a mighty wind?** - Bildad poses this question to rebuke Job for complaining to God. In this metaphor, both Job's words and the wind are empty and insubstantial. AT: "The words of your mouth are a mighty wind." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert righteousness?** - Here the writer uses two parallel rhetorical questions, which Bildad poses to rebuke Job. AT: "God does not act unjustly; the Almighty does not fail to do what is right." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
