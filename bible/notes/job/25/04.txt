===== Translation Notes: =====
Bildad continues speaking.

  * **How then can man ... How can he who is born ...** - These two questions are used together to emphasize the impossibility of a man being good enough for God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * Both of these mean the same thing. Bildad uses questions for emphasis. AT: "There is certainly no human that is righteous and acceptable to God." (See:  and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **the stars are not pure in his sight** - AT: "he does think even the stars shine brightly"
  * **How much less man, who is a worm—a son of man, who is a worm!** - AT: "Certainly no person could impress God. Humans are like worms to him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
