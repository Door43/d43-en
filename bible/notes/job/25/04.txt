===== Translation Notes: =====
Bildad continues speaking.

  * **How then can man ... How can he who is born ...** - These two questions are used together to emphasize the impossibility of a man being good enough for God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **How then can man be righteous with God?** - The implicit reaction is that he cannot. AT: "A man can never be righteous for God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **How can he who is born ... acceptable to him?** - The implicit reaction is that he cannot. AT: "He who is born of a woman cannot be clean or acceptable to him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

  * **he who is born of a woman** - AT: "any man" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])

  * **the stars are not pure in his sight** - AT: "he does think even the stars are perfect"
  * **How much less man ... a son of man ...** - These two lines say the same thing and are used together to emphasize that man is not perfect. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
