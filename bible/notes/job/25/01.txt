===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Bildad the Shuhite** - See how you translated this man's name in [[:en:bible:notes:job:02:11|2:11]].
  * **Dominion and fear are with him** - Here "him" refers to God. The abstract nouns "dominion" and "fear" can be stated as verbs. AT: "God rules over all and people should fear only him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **he makes order in his high places of heaven** - "he makes peace in the high heaven"
  * **Is there any end to the number of his armies?** - Bildad uses this question to emphasize how great God is. The implicit answer is "no." This refers to the armies of God's angels. AT: "There is no end to the number of angels in his army." or "His armies are so big that no one can count them." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Upon whom does his light not shine?** - Bildad uses this question to emphasize that God gives light to every person. AT: "There is no one upon whom his light does not shine." or "God makes his light shine over everyone." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
