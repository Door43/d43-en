\q
\v 13 With God are wisdom and might;
\q he has good thoughts and understanding.

\v 14 See, he breaks down, and it cannot be built again;
\q if he imprisons someone, there can be no release.
\q
\v 15 See, if he withholds the waters, they dry up;
\q and if he sends them out, they overwhelm the land.
