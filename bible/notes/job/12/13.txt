  * **if he imprisons someone, there can be no release** - Job says that no one can free a person if God does not allow. AT: "if God shuts someone in, no one can release that person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **if he withholds the waters, they dry up** - Whatever kind of water, whether rain, flood, rivers or wells will stop when God wants. AT: "If he blocks up the places where water comes from, they dry up"
