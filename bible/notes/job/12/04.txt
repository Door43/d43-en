\v 4 My friends all laugh at me now.
\q2 Previously I habitually requested God to help me, and he always answered me.
\q1 I am righteous, and I honor God, but now everyone laughs at me.
\q1
\v 5 It is easy for people like you, who have no troubles, to laugh at people like me;
\q2 you make us who are already suffering to have even more troubles.
\q1
\v 6 Meanwhile, bandits live peacefully,
\q2 and no one threatens those who cause God to become angry;
\q2 the god they worship is their own strength.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 4 I am something for my neighbor to laugh at—
\q I, one who called on God and who was answered by him!
\q I, a just and blameless man—I am now something to laugh at.
\q
\v 5 In the thought of someone who is at ease, there is contempt for misfortune;
\q he thinks in a way that brings more misfortune to those whose foot is slipping.
\q
\v 6 The tents of robbers prosper,
\q and those who provoke God feel secure;
\q their own hands are their gods.
\b
