===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **No doubt**  - "Surely,"
    * **you are the people**  - "you are the important people who know everything"
    * **No doubt you are the people; wisdom will die with you.**  - In this figure of speech, Job mocks how they are acting and shows how ridiculous they sound.  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]]). “Surely you are all such important people that wisdom cannot exist without you." AT: "You are all acting like you are the only source of wisdom and without you wisdom would disappear."
    * **You** -this is plural in these next two sentences. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pluralpronouns]])
    * **Indeed, who does not know such things as these?**  - "In fact, everyone understands these things." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
