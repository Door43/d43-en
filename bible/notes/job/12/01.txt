===== translationNotes: =====

  * **No doubt** - "Surely"
  * **you are the people** - "you are the important people who know everything"
  * **No doubt you are the people; wisdom will die with you.** - In this figure of speech, Job mocks how they are acting and shows how ridiculous they sound. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]]). "Surely you are all such important people that wisdom cannot exist without you." AT: "You are all acting like you are the only source of wisdom and without you wisdom would disappear."
  * **you** - This is plural here and in the next two sentences. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **Indeed, who does not know such things as these?** - Job used this question to express a truth that should be obvious to his listeners. It can be expressed as a statement. AT: "Indeed, there is no one who does not know such things as these." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Indeed, who does not know such things as these?** - The word "not" in this rhetorical question emphasizes that everyone knows these things. AT: "In fact, everyone understands these things." (See [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
