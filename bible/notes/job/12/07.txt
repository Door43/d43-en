  * **But now ask ... will declare to you.** - These 4 statements all express the idea that the beasts, the birds, the earth, and the fish are understand God better than Job's friends. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **But now ask the beasts, and they will teach you** - The imperative in the first part of the sentence functions as a hypothetical condition. AT: "But if you were to ask the beasts, they would teach you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_imperative]] an [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **ask the birds of the heavens, and they will tell you** - The imperative in the first part of the sentence functions as a hypothetical condition.
