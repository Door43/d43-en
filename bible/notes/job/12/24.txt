===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **He takes away understanding from the leaders of the people of the earth**  - "He causes some rulers to become foolish" (UDB)
    * **he causes them to wander**  - "he causes them to go in the wrong direction" or "he causes them to go astray"
    * **in a wilderness where there is no path**  - "in a wasteland with no paths" or "in an unmarked wasteland"
    * **They grope in the dark without light**  - "AT: They feel around like a blind man" or "They try to find their way like a blind man"
    * **he makes them stagger like a drunk man**  - "he makes them wander and wobble like a person who has had too much alcohol." Job compared the actions of the leaders to a person's attempts to walk while under the influence of alcohol - both lack direction and purpose. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
