===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Which animal among all these does not know ... mankind?** - This is a figure of speech that does not expect an answer, but states the question to emphasize the point. It means, "Every animal knows that ... mankind." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Yahweh, in whose hand is the life of every living thing and the breath of all mankind?** - This figure of speech uses two similar statements to emphasize the idea. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
