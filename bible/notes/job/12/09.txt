===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **Which animal among all these does not know**  - This is a figure of speech that does not expect an answer, but states the question to emphasize the point. It means, "Every animal knows that... " (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **Yahweh, in whose hand is the life of every living thing
and the breath of all mankind?**  - This figure of speech uses two similar statements to emphasize the idea. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
