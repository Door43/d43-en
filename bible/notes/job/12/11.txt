<usfm>
\v 11 When we hear what people like you say,
\q2 we  think carefully about what they say to determine what is good and what is bad,
\q2 like we taste food to know what is good and what is bad.
\q1
\v 12 Old people are usually very wise;
\q2 because they have lived a long time, they understand much.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Does not the ear test words just as the palate tastes its food?** - Job compares ears that evaluate words to the mouth that tests food.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]]) This is a question that does not expect an answer for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) AT: "The ear studies words just as the mouth tests food."
  * **With aged men is wisdom; in length of days is understanding.** - This  uses similar to say almost the same thing for emphasis. (see: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) AT: "Wisdom and understanding come when men grow old and have many days."
