===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **bold words**  - explanation
  * **How long will it be before you look away from me, before you let me alone long enough for me to swallow down my own saliva?**  - These two questions are figures of speech where two phrases or sentences illustrate one idea (see: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]]). Because it is among many doublets, it is probably a poetic form of speech. (see: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]). Job means that he feels like he is constantly being watched; that there is no relief for his suffering.

  * **Even if I have sinned, what would that do to you, you who watch men?**  - This may be a prayer or it may be a figure of speech that is not intended to have an answer (see: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * ** Why have you made a target of me?** - "Why have you made me a target for yourself"
  * **bold words**  - explanation
