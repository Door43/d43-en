===== Translation Notes: =====

The writer continues to use parallelism in each of these verses, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize that his personal suffering is part of the universal suffering which all people experience.   (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **Is there not hard labor for every person on earth?** - Job poses this question to emphasize his awareness that all people experience suffering.  AT: "Does not everyone have hard labor on earth?" or "Everyone has hard labor on earth" (see: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Are not his days like the days of a hired man?** - Job poses this question to emphasize his awareness that all people struggle in life. AT: "And his days are like the days of a hired man." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Like a slave ... like a hired man** - Job compares himself (verse 3) to those who work hard have no relief (verse 2). (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **the shadows of the evening** - "shade"
  * **a hired man** - This is a man who worked jobs one day at a time and was paid at the end of every day. "a day laborer"  
  * **so I have been made to endure months of misery; God has assigned me months of trouble-filled nights** - "so I endure months of misery and trouble-filled nights"
