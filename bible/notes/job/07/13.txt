f====== Job 07:13-15 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 When I \add lie down at night\add*, I say \add to myself\add*, 'I will be comforted here on my bed;
\q2 my pain will be less while I am sleeping.'
\q1
\v 14 But then you give me dreams that cause me to be afraid;
\q2 you give me visions that terrify me,
\q1
\v 15 with the result that I would prefer to die because of being strangled
\q2 than to continue to \add be alive\add* being only a bunch of bones.
\q1

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 When I lie down at night, I say to myself, 'I will go to sleep and stop suffering;
\q2 my pain will be less while I am sleeping.'
\q1
\v 14 But then you give me dreams that cause me to be afraid;
\q2 you give me visions that terrify me;
\q1
\v 15 these things make me wish that someone would strangle me to death,
\q2 rather than for me to continue to be alive when I am only a bunch of bones.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 13 When I say, ‘My bed will comfort me,
\q and my couch will ease my complaint,’
\q
\v 14 then you scare me with dreams
\q and terrify me through visions,
\q
\v 15 so that I would choose strangling
\q and death rather than preserving these bones of mine.

===== Translation Notes: =====

The writer continues to use parallelism in the first two verses, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize Job's intense suffering. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **My bed will comfort me and my couch will ease my complaint** - Here "bed" and "couch" are metonyms for "sleep." In lying down to sleep, Job would hope to be comforted.  The metonyms also have human attributes; they have the ability to comfort and ease a person. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **You scare me** - "You" refers to God to whom Job is making his complaint.
  * **strangling** - killing a person by squeezing his throat and stopping his breathing
  * **these bones of mine** - Here Job uses the word "bones" to refer to his body. AT: "This body of mine" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]]).
