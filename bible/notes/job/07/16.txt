\v 16 I detest continuing to be alive; I do not want to live for many more years.
\q2 Allow me to be alone, because I will be alive for only a very short time.
\b
\q1
\v 17 We human beings are not very important;
\q2 so why do you pay so much attention to us ?
\q1
\v 18 You look at us every morning to see what we are doing,

\q
\v 16 I loathe my life; I would not wish to always be alive;
\q let me alone for my days are useless.

\v 17 What is man that you should pay attention to him,
\q that you should set your mind on him,
\q
\v 18 that you should observe him every morning
\q and test him every moment?

===== Translation Notes: =====

The writer continues to use parallelism in these verses, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize the impact of Job's misery on his sense of self worth. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **I loathe my life** - "I despise my life"
  * **to always be alive** - "to live forever"
  * **my days are useless** - "my days are pointless" or "my days are of no value"
  * **that you should pay attention to him** - "that you should magnify him"
  * **that you should set your mind on him** - "that you should direct your attention to him"
  * **that you should observe him** - "that you should carefully inspect him"
