\v 16 I loathe my life; I would not wish to always be alive;

\q that you should set your mind on him,
\q
\v 18 that you should observe him every morning

===== Translation Notes: =====

The writer continues to use parallelism in these verses, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize the impact of Job's misery on his sense of self worth. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **I loathe my life** - "I despise my life"
  * **to always be alive** - "to live forever"
  * **my days are useless** - "my days are pointless" or "my days are of no value"
  * **that you should pay attention to him** - "that you should magnify him"
  * **that you should set your mind on him** - "that you should direct your attention to him"
  * **that you should observe him** - "that you should carefully inspect him"
