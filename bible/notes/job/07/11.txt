===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul** - Job conveys a single idea using two different statements to emphasize the reason he will not remain silent. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])  
  * **I will not restrain my mouth** - "I will not stop talking"
  * **the anguish of my spirit** - "the torment of my spirit" or "the agony of my suffering"
  * **the bitterness of my soul** - "the resentment of my soul"  
  * **Am I the sea or a sea monster, that you place a guard over me?** - Job poses this question to express his anger at God.  In comparing himself to the sea or a sea monster, Job suggests that God regards him as a hideous creature. "I am not the sea or a sea monster that needs a guard to watch it."  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
