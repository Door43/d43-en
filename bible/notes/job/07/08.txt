===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 8 The eye of God, who sees me, will see me no more;
\q God's eyes will be on me, but I will not exist.
\q
\v 9 As a cloud is consumed and vanishes away,
\q so he who goes down to Sheol will come up no more.
\q
\v 10 He will return no more to his house;
\q neither will his place know him again.
\b

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The writer continues to use parallelism in each of these verses, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize Job's thought that, after death, neither God nor the people he knew will see him again. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **The eye of God, who sees me, will see me no more** - The word "God" was added to this phrase because the context implies that Job is speaking with God. "The eye which sees me will see me no more." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]).
  * **God's eyes will be on me, but I will not exist** - "Your eyes will be on me, but I will not exist."
  * **As a cloud is consumed and vanishes away, so he who goes down to sheol will come up no more** - Job is describing death in terms of the vanishing clouds. "As the cloud vanishes, so he who dies disappears" or "Once you are in the grave, you cannot arise." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **As a cloud is consumed** - "As a cloud fades away"
