===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Why do you not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity?** - Here Job uses two different clauses within a rhetorical question to emphasize his desire that God pardon his sin. He poses this question to rebuke God for making him suffer. AT: "Forgive my transgression and remove my iniquity." See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **Why do you not pardon my transgression** - "Why not pardon my transgression?"
  * **take away** - "remove"
  * **now will I lie down in the dust** - The phrase "lie down in the dust" is a mild or polite way of saying "die." "now I will die" (see: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
