===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Why do you not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity?** - Here Job uses two similar clauses within a rhetorical question to emphasize his point. Possible meanings are: 1) Job is asking why God does not forgive him. AT: "Tell me why you do not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity." or 2) Job is asking God why he cannot just overlook his supposed wrongdoings. AT: "Tell me why you do not just bear with my transgression and iniquity." See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **take away** - "remove"
  * **now will I lie down in the dust** - The phrase "lie down in the dust" is a mild or polite way of saying "die." AT: "now I will die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
