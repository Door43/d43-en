===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The writer continues to use parallelism in each of these verses, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize Job's sense of the shortness of life. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle** - Job compares his days to the quickness of a weaver's shuttle. "My days" is a metonymy for all the days of Job's life. AT: "My life goes by very quickly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **weaver** - a person who makes cloth by crossing threads or yarn
  * **a weaver's shuttle** - a moving part that carries thread or yarn back and forth quickly in a loom when making cloth
  * **call to mind** - "remember"
  * **my life is only a breath** - Job compares the shortness of his life to the shortness of a breath. AT: "my life is very short, like taking one breath" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **my eye will no more see good** - Here "my eye" represents Job's whole person and his ability to see or experience things. AT: "I will never again experience good things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
