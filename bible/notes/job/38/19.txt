===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues to challenge Job.
  * **General Information:** - Each of these verses have two parallel phrases. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **Where is the way ... houses for them?** - These questions can be expressed as statements. AT: "You do not know the way to the resting place of light or the place of darkness. You cannot lead light and darkness to their places of work, or find the way back to their houses for them." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the resting place of light** - "the dwelling of light." Light is spoken of as having a resting place from which it comes forth each day. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **light** - "daylight" or "sunlight"
  * **to their places of work** - "to their territory." Light and darkness are spoken of as being led out and back each day to accomplish Yahweh's purposes. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **Undoubtedly ... so large** - Yahweh uses mocking irony to emphasize that Job does not understand light and darkness. AT: "It is obvious that you do not know, because you were not born when I created them, and you are not very old." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **for you were born then** - "for you were already living then." The word "then" refers to the time when light was created and separated from darkness. AT: "for you were already born when I created them"
  * **the number of your days is so large** - "you have lived so many years"
