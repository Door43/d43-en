===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.
    * **the resting place of light** - "the place that light dwells" or "the place that light inhabits." Yahweh describes light as though it were a person. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
    * **to their places of work** - "to their border" or "to their boundary." The boundary surrounds the place of the light and of the darkness. When the night is finished, darkness returns to its place. When the day is over, light returns to its place. AT: "back to their place."
    * **Undoubtedly ... so large** - Yahweh uses mocking irony to emphasize that Job does not understand light and darkness. AT: "It is obvious that you do not know because you were not born when I created them and you are not very old." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
    * **for you were born then** - The word "then" refers to the time when light was created and separated from darkness. AT: "for you were born when when I created the world."  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
    * **the number of your days is so large** - "you have lived very many years" or "you are very old" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
