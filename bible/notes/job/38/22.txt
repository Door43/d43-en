===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.
    * **Have you...over the earth?** - Yahweh uses theses questions to emphasize that Job does not know how Yahweh send snow, hail, lightning and the east wind onto the earth. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **hail** - round pieces of ice that fall down from the sky
