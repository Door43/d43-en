===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.
  * **Have you...over the earth?** - Yahweh uses theses questions to emphasize that Job does not know how Yahweh send snow, hail, lightning and the east wind onto the earth. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **hail** - round pieces of ice that fall down from the sky
