===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.

  * **Is there a fatherâ€¦fathered it**  - Yahweh uses these questions to emphasize that Job does not understand how Yahweh makes rain, dew, ice, and frost. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **Is there a father of the rain**  - Yahweh describes the rains as though it were a person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification|Personification]])
  * **engendered**  - the role that the father has in causing a child to be born
  * **dewdrops**  - the drops of dew that form from condensation on plant and other things
  * **Who bore the white frost**  - "Who has given birth to the frost"
  * **The waters hide themselves**  - during the winter the ice hides the water underneath it
  * **the deep**  - This refers to deep water such as lakes, rivers, and oceans.
