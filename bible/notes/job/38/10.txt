===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.
    * **I marked out for the sea my boundary** - "I made a boundary for the sea"
    * **boundary** - Yahweh created a border around the sea that the seas was not allowed to cross.
    * **I placed its bars and doors** - Yahweh compares the way that he made a boundary for the sea to containing the sea with bars and doors. AT: "I put barriers so that the water would not come over the land." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **bars** - a long piece of wood or metal that is used to lock a door shut
    * **to it** - "to the sea." Yahweh speaks to the sea as though it were a person." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
    * **to the pride of your waves** - Yahweh speaks about the waves as though they were people. It is implied that the waves are proud because they are powerful. AT: "for you waves that are proud because they are so powerful." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
