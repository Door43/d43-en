===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I marked out for the sea my boundary** - "I made a boundary for the sea"
  * **boundary** - Yahweh set a limit beyond which the sea was not allowed to cross.
  * **I placed its bars and doors** - Yahweh compares the way that he made a boundary for the sea to containing the sea with bars and doors. AT: "I set up its barriers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **bars** - long pieces of wood or metal that are used to keep a door shut
  * **when I said to it** - "when I said to the sea." Yahweh speaks to the sea as though it were a person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **You may come this far, but no farther** - The words "this far" mean only as far as the boundary that Yahweh set up. AT: "You may come as far as this boundary, but no farther" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **to the pride of your waves** - "to the power of your waves." The waves are spoken of as if they could have pride. The abstract noun "pride" can be translated as the adjective "proud." AT: "to your proud waves" or "to your powerful waves" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
