===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The earth is changed in appearance like clay changes under a seal** - At night time, people cannot see clearly, but in the morning the light reveals the distinct shape of everything, just like a seal creates distinct images in clay. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]]) 
  * **From wicked people their 'light' is taken away** - AT: "The morning takes away the light of wicked people." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **their 'light'** - The wicked consider darkness to be their light, because they do their evil deeds in the darkness and they are familiar with the darkness. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **their uplifted arm is broken** - The raised arm of the wicked shows that they have the power and the intention to do evil things, but the morning light breaks their arm so that they are not able to do evil things. AT: "in the daylight they no longer are able to hurt anyone." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
