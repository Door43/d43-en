===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.

    * **On what were its foundations laid** - What did I put the foundations of the earth on." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **the morning stars** - "the bright stars that shine in the morning"
    * **when the morning stars sang together** - Yahweh describes the stars as though they were people who could sing. AT: "when it was as though the morning stars sang together." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
    * **the sons of God** - "the angels"
    * **for joy** - "because they were full of joy"
