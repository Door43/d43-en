Yahweh continues to challenge Job.
    * **Can you raise...Here we are**  - Yahweh uses these question to emphasize that Job cannot control the clouds, the rain, or the lightning. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **so that an abundance of rainwater may cover you**  - "so that plenty of water will cover you"
    * **Can you send out bolts of lightning that they may go out**  - "Can you command the lightning bolts to go where you want them to and they actually go"
    * **that they say to you**  - "and will they say to you"
    * **Here we are**  - This phrase means, "We are here so that you can tell us what you want us to do." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
