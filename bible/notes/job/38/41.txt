===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.
    * **Who provides victims...**  - Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that he provides food for the ravens and that Job does not. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **victims**  - animals that ravens look for and can eat
    * **ravens**  - "crows"
    * **cry out to God**  - "cry to God for help" or "cry out for God to save them"
    * **stagger about**  - "wander around"
    * **for lack of food**  - "because they have no food" or "because they have nothing to eat"
