===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.
    * **Have you...its expanse** - Yahweh uses these questions to emphasize that these are things that Job has not done and that there are many things that Job does not know. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **the sources** - "the springs"
    * **the deep** - This can be translated as "the water" or "the ocean" (UDB) or "the deep water."
    * **Have the gates of death been revealed to you** - "Has anyone shown the gates of death to you." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
    * **Have you understood the earth in its expanse** - "Have you look carefully at everything all the way to the farthest parts of the earth" 
    * **if you know it all** - "if you are familiar with the whole earth" or "if you know everything about the earth"
