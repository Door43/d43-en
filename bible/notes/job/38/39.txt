===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.
    * **Can you hunt down...to lie in wait**  - Yahweh uses these questions to emphasize that he knows how to feed the lions, but Job does not. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **a victim**  - "prey." This is an animal that a lion could eat.
    * **a lioness** - Possibly "a lion."
    * **or satisfy the appetite of her young lion cubs** - "or give young lions enough food that they can live"
    * **of her young lion cubs**  - "of young lions." These are young lions that are old enough to hunt for themselves.
    * **in their dens**  - "in the places that they live" or "in their dwelling places"
    * **sheltering in hiding**  - "lie still in the thick vegetation"
    * **to lie in wait**  - "which is their place of ambush" or "which is the place that they hide in order to catch other animals." The lions hide in the thick plants and wait for an animal to pass by so that they can jump out and catch that animal.
