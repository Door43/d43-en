===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.
  * **Can you fasten chains...over the earth** - Yahweh uses these questions to emphasize that Job does not know how to control the stars. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **fasten chains** - "bind the chains" or "tie the bonds"
  * **Pleiades...Orion...Bear** - These are the names of constellations. See how you translated them in [[:en:bible:notes:job:09:07|9:9]].
  * **undo the cords of Orion** - "break the cords that hold Orion"
  * **the constellations** - This refers to the twelve different constellation that appear behind the sun as it sets. A different constellation appears behind the sun each month.
  * **to appear at their proper times** - "so that they appear at the right time"
  * **its children** - "its cubs"
