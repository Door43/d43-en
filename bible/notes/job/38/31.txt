===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.
    * **Can you fasten chains...over the earth**  - Yahweh uses these questions to emphasize that Job does not know how to control the stars. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **fasten chains** - "bind the chains" or "tie the bonds"
    * **Pleiades...Orion...Bear**  - These are the names of constellations. See how you translated them in [[en:bible:notes:job:09:07|9:9]].
    * **undo the cords of Orion** - "break the cords that hold Orion"
    * **the constellations**  - This refers to the twelve different constellation that appear behind the sun as it sets. A different constellation appears behind the sun each month.
    * **to appear at their proper times**  - "so that they appear at the right time"
    * **its children**  - "its cubs"
