===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.
    * **Where were you...foundations** - Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that Job did not exist when he created the earth, so Job does not understand how Yahweh made the earth. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **I laid the earth's foundations** - "I made the foundations for the earth." Yahweh describes creating the earth as though he was building a building. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **Tell me** - AT: "Tell me the answer." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
    * **if you have so much understanding** - "you think you know so much"
    * **Who determined its dimensions** - Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that he decide how big the earth should be, so he is the only one who understands how he made it.
    * **stretched the measuring line over it** - "measured the earth with a rope"
    * **measuring line** - a rope or cord that people use to make sure that they build a building the right size and the right shape
