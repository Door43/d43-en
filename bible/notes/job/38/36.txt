===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.
    * **Who has put wisdom...tightly together** - Yahweh uses these question to emphasize that he has control of the clouds and that Job does not. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **has put wisdom in the clouds**  - "has given wisdom to the clouds." Yahweh describes the clouds as though they were people and gives them wisdom so that they know what to do. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
    * **Who can number the clouds by his skill**  - This phrase means: "Who can wisely control how many thin clouds are in the sky." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])  
    * **the water skins**  - skins that people sewed together so that they could hold water. Yahweh refers to the thick clouds as "waters skin" because they hold a lot of water just like water skins. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **when the dust runs into a hard mass** - "when the rain molds the dirt together into one piece." The rain makes the loose dry dirt stick together like one piece of dirt. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
    * **the clods of earth clump tightly together**  - "the chunks of dirt stick together"
