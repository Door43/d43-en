===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.
    * **Have you ever...be shaken out of it** - Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that only he has power over the morning and Job does not. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **since your own days began** - This phrase means "since you were born" or "on any of the days that you have lived." 
    * **given orders to the morning** - Yahweh describes the morning as though it were a person who could receive orders. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]]) 
    * **caused the morning dawn to know its place in the scheme of things** - "let the dawn know where it belongs" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
    * **dawn** - the light that appears in the morning before the sun rises
    * **might take hold of the sides of the earth** - Yahweh describes dawn as a person holding the horizons of the earth like the edges of a rug. Dawn looks like it holds the sides of the earth because its light first appears on the horizons. AT: "would appear on the horizons of the earth." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **so that it** - The word "it" refers to the dawn.
    * **so that the wicked might be shaken out of it**  - "and shake the wicked out of the earth." The light of the dawn makes wicked people go away like shaking a rug gets the dirt out. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
