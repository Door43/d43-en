\v 10 But he knows the way that I take;
\q when he has tested me, I will come out like gold.
\q
\v 11 My foot has held fast to his steps;
\q I have kept to his way and turned not aside.
\q
\v 12 I have not gone back from the commandment of his lips;
\q I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my portion of food.
