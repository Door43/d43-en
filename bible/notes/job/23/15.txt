===== Translation Notes: =====

Job continues speaking. Each verse in this chunk has the form of a parallelism to emphasize the main point Job makes there. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **For God has made my heart weak** - AT: "For God has made me weak" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **the Almighty has terrified me** - This means the same as the first part of the sentence. They emphasize how scared Job is of God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **It is not that I have been cut off by darkness** - "I have not been destroyed by darkness" or "It is not darkness that has cut me off" AT: "God has cut me off, not the darkness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **nor does the thick darkness cover my face** - AT: "nor am I cut off because the thick darkness covers my face" or "nor does the thick darkness cover my face, but God has cut me off" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **my face** - AT: "me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
