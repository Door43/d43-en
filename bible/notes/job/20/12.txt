===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 Although doing wicked things was like having sweet food in their mouths,
\q2 and they wanted to continue to taste it,
\q1
\v 13 and even though they did not want to stop doing those things,
\q1
\v 14 some day the evil things that they enjoyed doing will become like food \add that they swallow\add*
\q2 \add and become\add* as bitter as snake poison.

\v 12 Although doing wicked things was like having sweet food in their mouths
\q2 that they wanted to continue tasting,
\q1
\v 13 and although they did not want to stop doing those things,
\q1
\v 14 those evil things will someday become like poison that they swallow,
\q2 or like the poison from snakes.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 12 Although wickedness is sweet in his mouth,
\q although he hides it under his tongue,
\q
\v 13 although he holds it there and does not let it go
\q but keeps it still in his mouth—
\q
\v 14 the food in his intestines turns bitter;
\q it becomes the poison of asps inside him.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Zophar continues speaking to Job.

  * **Although wickedness is sweet in his mouth ... the poison of asps inside him** - Zophar describes "wickedness" (or doing evil things) as if it is food that tastes very good, but when wickedness is swallowed and enters into us it becomes poison, like the poison of deadly snakes. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **intestines** - "stomach"
  * **asps** - "poisonous snakes"
