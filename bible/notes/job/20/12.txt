\q2 that they wanted to continue tasting,
\q1

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 12 Although wickedness is sweet in his mouth,
\q although he hides it under his tongue,
\q
\v 13 although he holds it there and does not let it go
\q but keeps it still in his mouth—
\q
\v 14 the food in his intestines turns bitter;
\q it becomes the poison of asps inside him.

===== Translation Notes: =====
Zophar continues speaking to Job.
  * **Although wickedness is sweet in his mouth...the poison of asps inside him** - Zophar describes “wickedness” (or doing evil things) as if it is food that tastes very good, but when wickedness is swallowed and enters into us it becomes poison, like the poison of deadly snakes. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **intestines** - AT: "stomach"
  * **asps** - AT: "poisonous snakes"
