===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Zophar continues speaking to Job.

  * **Though his height reaches up to the heavens** - "Though the wicked person's height reaches up to the heavens." The abstract noun "height" can be expressed with the adjective "tall." AT: "Though he is as tall as the heavens" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Though his height reaches up to the heavens** - The wicked man's height represents either his reputation or his pride. Also, here "reaches up to the heavens" represents being very great. AT: "Though his reputation is great" or "Though his pride is great" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **his head reaches to the clouds** - "and though his head is as high as the clouds." This also represents his reputation or pride being great. This means the same as the previous phrase. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **will perish permanently like his own feces** - Feces mixes in with the ground and disappears. The reference to feces may also imply that the wicked person is worthless. AT: "will perish permanently like his feces, which completely disappears in the ground" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **will perish permanently like his own feces** - If people are embarrassed about the word feces, translators may refer to something else that disappears completely. AT: "will disappear permanently like dust that the wind blows away" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
