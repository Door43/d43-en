  * **a fire not fanned will devour him** - AT: "God will cause a fire that will burn him up"
  * **The heavens...the earth** - Possible meanings are: 1) those who live in the heavens and the earth (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]), or 2) Zophar is describing the heavens and the earth as if they are humans who will testify in court against the wicked person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
