===== Translation Notes: =====
Zophar continues speaking to Job.
  * **He swallows down riches...cast them out of his belly** - Zophar compares wealth to food. Just like a person who eats too much food will vomit it back up, God will take the wealth from a rich person who stores up things for himself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **He will suck the poison of asps; the viper's tongue will kill him** - Zophar says   that holding onto wealth is evil, and like poison evil can kill a person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **vomit** - when a full stomach throws food back out of the mouth
  * **cast** - "throw"
  * **belly** - AT: "stomach"
  * **suck** - to pull liquid into the stomach by the mouth
