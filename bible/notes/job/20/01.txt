===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Zophar replies to Job.

  * **Zophar the Naamathite** - See how you translated this man's name in [[:en:bible:notes:job:02:11|2:11]]. Since this is the second time that Zophar speaks, some translations omit "the Naamathite" here. 
  * **My thoughts make me answer quickly** - The idea of Zophar's thoughts making him do something represents his strong desire to do something. AT: "I want very much to answer you quickly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **because of the worry that is in me** - The abstract noun "worry" can be expressed with the adjective "worried." The reason for the worry can be stated clearly.

  * **a spirit from my understanding answers me** - Here "spirit" probably refers to a thought or idea. AT: "a thought from my understanding answers me" 
  * **a spirit from my understanding answers me** - This "spirit" or thought is spoken of as if it were a person that could answer Zophar. AT: "I have a thought from my understanding, and now I know what I wanted to know" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **a spirit from my understanding answers me** - The content of the answer can be stated clearly. AT: "a thought from my understanding answers me about how I can reply to you" or "I have a thought from my understanding, and now I know how I can reply to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **a spirit from my understanding answers me** - The abstract nouns "spirit" and "understanding" can be expressed with the verbs "think" and "understand." AT: "because I understand things, I have thought, and now I know how I can reply to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
