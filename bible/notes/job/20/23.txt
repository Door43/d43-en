\q
\v 23 When he is about to fill his belly, God will throw the fierceness of his wrath on him;
\q God will rain it down on him while he is eating.
\q
\v 24 Although that man will flee from the iron weapon,
\q a bow of bronze will shoot him.
\q
\v 25 The arrow will pierce through his back and will emerge;
\q indeed, the glittering point will come out through his liver;
\q terrors come on him.
