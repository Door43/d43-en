===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Zophar continues speaking to Job.

  * **the streams, the torrents of honey and butter** - "Streams" and "torrents" are metaphors that represent abundance. "Honey" and "butter" are metonyms that represent the good things that God gives people. AT: "the abundance of good things that God gives his people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the fruit of his labor** - Normally "the fruit of his labor" simply refers to the results of his labor. In this case it refers to the things the wicked man had stolen. AT: "the things he had worked to get" or "the things he had stolen" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) 
  * **will not be able to eat it** - Here "to eat" the fruit of his labor represents enjoying the things he had stolen. AT: "will not be able to enjoy them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
