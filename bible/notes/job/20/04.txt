===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Zophar continues speaking with Job.

  * **Do you not know this fact from ancient times** - Zophar uses a question to cause Job to think deeply about what he will now say. AT: "Surely you know what has been true since the ancient times" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the triumph of a wicked man is short** - "the wicked person only celebrates for a little while"
  * **the joy of a godless man lasts only for a moment** - This means the same thing as "the triumph of the wicked is short." Zophar means their joy will not continue for a long time. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
