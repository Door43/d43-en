\v 20 Then Job stood up and tore his robe and shaved his head because he was very sad. Then he laid down on the ground to worship God.
\v 21 He said,
\q1 "When I was born, I had no clothes.
\q1 When I die, I will not take any clothes with me.
\q1 Yahweh gave me everything that I possessed,
\q1 and now he has taken it all away.
\q1 But we should always praise Yahweh!"
\p
\v 22 So in spite of all the things that happened to Job, he did speak not like a foolish man—he did not sin by saying that what God had done was wrong.*

\v 20 Then Job rose, tore his robe, shaved his head, lay face down on the ground, and worshiped God.
\v 21 He said, "I came naked out of my mother's womb, and I return there naked. Yahweh gave, and Yahweh has taken away; may the name of Yahweh be blessed."
\v 22 In all this matter, Job did not sin, nor did he foolishly accuse God.
