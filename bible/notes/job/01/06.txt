\v 6 Then it was the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Yahweh. Satan also came with them.
\v 7 Yahweh said to Satan, "From where have you come?" Then Satan answered Yahweh and said, "From wandering on the earth, from going back and forth on it."
\v 8 Yahweh said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and turns from evil."
