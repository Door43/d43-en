\v 9 Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?
\v 10 Hast not you made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath, on every side? you have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.
\v 11 But put forth your hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will renounce you to your face.
\v 12 And Jehovah said to Satan, Behold, all that he has is in your power; only upon himself put not forth your hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah.
