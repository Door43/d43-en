===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 Satan replied to Yahweh, "What you say is true, but Job honors you only because of what you have done for him.
\v 10 You have always protected him, his family, and everything he owns. You make him succeed in whatever work he tries to do, and he has very much livestock all over his land.
\v 11 But if you attacked what he owns and took it away, he would curse you in front of everyone."
\p
\v 12 Yahweh replied to Satan, "So this is what you want me to do! All right, I will permit you to take away everything that he has. But do not harm him in his own body."
\p Satan agreed and then left Yahweh in order to plan how he would attack Job.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 Then Satan answered Yahweh and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing?
\v 10 Have you not made a hedge around him, around his house, and around all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions in the land have increased.
\v 11 But extend your hand now and attack all that he possesses, and he will renounce you to your face.”
\v 12 Yahweh said to Satan, “See, all that he has is in your power; only do not lay your hand on his person.” So Satan went away from the presence of Yahweh.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Does Job fear God for nothing?** - "Does Job respect God for no reason?" Satan responds to God by presenting and answering his own question that Job obeys God only because God blesses him. AT: "Job has a reason for obeying God." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Have you not made a hedge around him, around his house, and around all that he has on every side?** - Satan states the facts to support his argument . AT: "You have protected him, his family and everything he owns." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **made a hedge around him** - Just as a hedge is a row of small bushes or trees planted close together to form a wall of protection around one's land, God has surrounding Job with his protection. AT: "protected him" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the work of his hands** - "everything that he does"
  * **his possession in the land has increased** - "he has more and more livestock in the land"
  * **But put forth your hand now** - "But stretch out your hand now." This is an expression for God to remove His blessing from Job and remove Job's material wealth. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **attack all that he possesses** - "strike all that he owns" or "destroy all that he owns"
  * **he will renounce you to your face** - "he will reject you" 
  * **to your face** - Satan is saying that Job will clearly abandon God. 
  * **See, all that he has** - AT: "Look" or "Pay attention to all that I'm about to tell you"
  * **all that he has is in your power** - "You have power over all that he has." Satan has been given authority over everything that Job owns. 
  * **only do not lay your hand on his person** - "lay your hand on" is an expression regarding harming someone. AT: "but do not harm him physically." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **went forth from the presence of Yahweh** - "departed from Yahweh" or "left Yahweh"
