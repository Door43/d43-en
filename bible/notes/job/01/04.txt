\v 5 When each celebration ended, Job would summon them. He would get up early in the morning and kill animals and burn them on the altar as sacrifices, one for each of his children. He said to himself, "Perhaps \add one of\add* my sons has sinned and said something evil about God in his heart."

\v 4 Job's sons often held feasts in their houses. Whenever each one made a feast, he would invite all his brothers and sisters to come and eat together.
\v 5 After each celebration, Job would summon them and he would ask Yahweh to purify them from any sins or short-comings they may have. He would get up early in the morning, kill animals, and burn them on the altar as sacrifices, one for each of his children. For Job always said, "Perhaps my children have sinned and said something evil about God in their hearts."

\v 4 On his assigned day, each of his sons would give a feast in his house and would send for his three sisters to eat and drink with them all.
\v 5 When the days of the feast were over, Job would send for them and consecrated them once more to God. He would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings for each of his children, for he would say, "Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." Job always did this.
