\v 4 Each year, Job's sons made feasts \add in their houses\add* to celebrate their birthdays. Whenever each one made a feast, he would invite \add all his brothers\add* and his three sisters to come and eat together.
\v 5 When each celebration ended, Job would summon them. He would get up early in the morning and kill animals and burn them on the altar as sacrifices, one for each of his children. He said to himself, "Perhaps \add one of\add* my sons has sinned and said something evil about God in his heart."

\v 4 Job's sons often held feasts in their houses. Whenever each one made a feast, he would invite all his brothers and sisters to come and eat together.
\v 5 After each celebration, Job would summon them and he would ask Yahweh to purify them from any sins or shortcomings they may have. He would get up early in the morning, kill animals, and burn them on the altar as sacrifices, one for each of his children. For Job always said, "Perhaps my children have sinned and said something evil about God in their hearts."

\v 4 On each son's assigned day, he would give a feast in his house and they would send and call for their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
\v 5 When the days of the feast were over, Job would send for them and he would consecrate them. He would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings for each of his children, for he would say, "It may be that my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." Job always did this.
