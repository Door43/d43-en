===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Out of his mouth go burning torches, sparks of fire leap out**  - AT: "Out of his mouth go burning torches, out of his mouth sparks of fire leap out." The same idea is expressed in two different ways. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **Out of his nostrils goes smoke â€¦  to be very hot**  - The smoke coming out of his nostrils is compared to a boiling pot on a fire.(See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **nostrils**  - the two openings of the nose
