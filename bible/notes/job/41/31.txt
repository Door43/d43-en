  * **he makes the sea like a pot of ointment**  - This means that he churns the sea like a jar of ointment would look after it was shaken thoroughly. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **one would think the deep to be white**  - This means that the water is all riled up as Leviathan swims by because of his size, causing a trail of bubbles.
