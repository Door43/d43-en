<usfm>
\v 28 Shooting arrows at them does not cause them to run away.
\q2 Hurling stones at them from a sling is like hurling bits of chaff at them.
\q1
\v 29 They are not afraid of clubs \add anymore than they would be afraid of men throwing\add* bits of straw at them,
\q2 and they laugh when they hear the whirl\f + \ft Or: sound \f* of javelins \add being thrown at them\add*.
\q1
\v 30 Their bellies are covered with scales that are as sharp as broken pieces of pottery.
\q2 When they drag themselves through the mud,
\q2 their bellies tear up the ground like a plow.

\q
\v 28 An arrow cannot make him flee;
\q to him sling stones become chaff.
\q
\v 29 Clubs are regarded as straw;
\q he laughs at the whirring flight of a spear.
\q
\v 30 His lower parts are like sharp pieces of broken pottery;
\q he leaves a spreading trail in the mud as if he were a threshing sledge.

  * **to him sling stones become chaff**  - This means that sling stones are no more useful than chaff in the wind against Leviathan. (See:  [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Clubs are regarded as straw**  - This means that a club is no more effective than a piece of straw for beating Leviathan. (See:  [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **he laughs at the whirring flight of a spear**  - The Leviathan is compared to a human being laughing at the futility of their battling against him by throwing spears. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **His lower parts are like sharp pieces of broken pottery**  - This says that his scales are sharp. (See:  [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **he leaves a spreading trail in the mud as if he were a threshing sledge**  - This compares his tail to threshing sledge that scrapes the ground and leaves a mark as it moves. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
