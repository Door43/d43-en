===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 Shooting arrows at them does not cause them to run away.
\q2 Hurling stones at them from a sling is like hurling bits of chaff at them.
\q1
\v 29 They are not afraid of clubs \add anymore than they would be afraid of men throwing\add* bits of straw at them,
\q2 and they laugh when they hear the whirl\f + \ft Or: sound \f* of javelins \add being thrown at them\add*.
\q1
\v 30 Their bellies are covered with scales that are as sharp as broken pieces of pottery.
\q2 When they drag themselves through the mud,
\q2 their bellies tear up the ground like a plow.

\q
\v 28 The arrow cannot make him flee:
\q Sling-stones are turned with him into stubble.

\q He laugheth at the rushing of the javelin.
\q
\v 30 His underparts are like sharp potsherds:
\q He spreadeth as it were a threshing-wain upon the mire.
