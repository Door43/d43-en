\q1
\v 29 They are not afraid of clubs \add anymore than they would be afraid of men throwing\add* bits of straw at them,
\q2 and they laugh when they hear the whirl\f + \ft Or: sound \f* of javelins \add being thrown at them\add*.
\q1
\v 30 Their bellies are covered with scales that are as sharp as broken pieces of pottery.
\q2 When they drag themselves through the mud,
\q2 their bellies tear up the ground like a plow.
