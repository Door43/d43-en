<usfm>
\v 4 \add If it were you three and not I who were suffering\add*,
\q2 I could say the things that you are saying;
\q1 I could make great speeches \add to criticize\f + \ft Or: condemn \f* you\add*,
\q2 and I could shake my head at you \add to ridicule you\add*.
\q1
\v 5 But, \add unlike all of you\add*, with what I said \f + \ft metonymy \f* I would encourage you
\q2 and try to cause your pain to be less.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 If it were you three and not I who were suffering,
\q2 I could, in your place, say the things that you are saying.
\q1 I could make great speeches to criticize you,
\q2 and I could shake my head at you to ridicule you.
\q1
\v 5 Then you would see whether my words encouraged you or not;
\q2 you would see whether they made you feel your pain less.
\b


\q1

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 4 I also could speak as you do,
\q if you were in my place;
\q I could collect and join words together against you
\q and shake my head at you in mockery.
\q
\v 5 Oh, how I would encourage you with my mouth!
\q how the comfort from my lips would lighten your grief!
\b

===== Translation Notes =====

  * **shake my head** - "reject what you are saying" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Oh, how I would encourage you with my mouth! How the comfort from my lips would lighten your grief!** - Job's sarcasm is communicating: "By saying to you what you said to me earlier, I would not encourage you or lighten your grief."   (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
