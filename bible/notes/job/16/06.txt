\v 6 If I speak, my grief is not lessened;

  * **But now, God, you...** - Job now turns his complaining to God.
  * **You have made me dry up** - "Dry up" is another way to describe how everything Job had has now vanished. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the leanness of my body rises up against me, it testifies against...** - Job describes his body's difficulties as if they were accusers against him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
