\q
\v 6 If I speak, my grief is not lessened;
\q if I keep from speaking, how am I helped?
\q
\v 7 But now, God, you have made me weary;
\q you have made all my family desolate.
\q
\v 8 You have made me dry up, which itself is a witness against me;
\q the leanness of my body rises up against me,
\q and it testifies against my face.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **grief** - Job has experienced great loss of family and health that is unexplained and therefore causes him "great sorrow and emotional pain".
  * **how am I helped?** - Job asks this question to emphasize that there is no help in keeping silent. AT: "keeping silent does not help me at all." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **But now, God, you...** - Job now turns his complaining to God.
  * **You have made me dry up** - "Dry up" is another way to describe how everything Job had has now vanished. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the leanness of my body rises up against me, it testifies against...** - Job describes his body's difficulties as if they were accusers against him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **against my face** - "Face" represents Job's reputation. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
