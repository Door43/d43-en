===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **It is as though ... into the power of the wicked** - Job expresses the same idea in two ways to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **dashed me to pieces** - Job says that his life is "ruined", like a glass that is dropped on the floor and breaks. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **target** - Job compares himself to a focus of attack and criticism. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
