\v 6 For you have demanded guarantee of a loan from your brother for no reason,
\q and you have stripped away clothing from the naked.

\q

  * **you have stripped someone naked of their clothing** - Eliphaz is accusing Job of taking clothes as security from poor people who borrowed from him.

  * **possessed the earth ... lived in it** - Eliphaz is accusing Job of taking land from poor people and not allowing them to live on it. He is emphasizing this point by restating it twice. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
