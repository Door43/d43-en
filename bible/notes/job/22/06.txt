===== Translation Notes: =====
Eliphaz continues speaking to Job.

    * **you have exacted security** - This refers to a lender taking something from the borrower to ensure that the borrower pays him back.
    * **you have stripped the naked of their clothing** - Eliphaz is accusing Job of taking clothes as security from poor people who borrowed from him.
    * **possessed the earth...lived in it** - Eliphaz is accusing Job of taking land from poor people and not allowing them to live on it. He is emphasizing this point by restating it twice. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
