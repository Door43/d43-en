===== Translation Notes: =====
Eliphaz continues speaking to Job.
  * **Is it because of your reverence for him that he rebukes you and takes you to judgment?** - Eliphaz uses a question to scold Job. AT: "God is certainly not punishing you because you have been devoted to him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Is not your wickedness great? Is there no end to your iniquities?** - Eliphaz uses questions to accuse Job of committing terrible sins (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
