\v 15 Will you keep the old way

===== Translation Notes: =====
Eliphaz continues speaking to Job.
  * **Will you keep the old way that wicked men have walked** - AT: "Will you continue to do the things that evil people do"
  * **those who were snatched away** - AT: "those who died" or "those whom God took away" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **those whose foundations have washed away like a river** - This means the wicked people thought they were safe and secure but God destroyed them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]]) 
  * **What can the Almighty do to us?** - Eliphaz quotes the wicked people who use this question to mock God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
