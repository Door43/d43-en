\v 12 \add But consider this, Job:\add* God lives \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* high up in the heavens.
\q2 From there he \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* looks down on the highest stars.
\q1
\v 13 So why do you say, 'What does God know \add about what we are doing\add*?
\q2 \add He is hidden from us by\add* dark clouds, so how can he judge us?\f + \ft Or: he certainly cannot judge us. \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*'
\q1
\v 14 \add Do you think that\add* while he walks on the dome that covers the sky,

\v 12 But consider this, Job: God lives high up in the heavens.
\q2 From there he looks down on the highest stars.
\q1
\v 13 So why do you say, 'God knows nothing about what we are doing'?
\q2 And why do you say, 'Dark clouds keep him from seeing us, so he cannot judge us'?
\q1
\v 14 Do you think that while he walks on the dome that covers the sky,
\q2 where there are thick clouds around him, he cannot see what we do?'

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 12 Is not God in the heights of heaven?
\q Look at the height of the stars, how high they are!
\q
\v 13 You say, 'What does God know?
\q Can he judge through the thick darkness?
\q
\v 14 Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he does not see us;
\q he walks on the vault of heaven.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Eliphaz continues speaking to Job.

  * **Is not God in the heights of heaven?** - Eliphaz uses this question to suggest that God see Job's sin and will judge him. AT: "God is in the heights of heaven and sees everything that happens on earth." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Look at the height of the stars, how high they are!** - Eliphaz implies that God is higher than the stars. This can be made explicit. AT: "Look at how high the stars are. God is even high above them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **What does God know? Can he judge through the thick darkness?** - Eliphaz uses these questions to imply that Job has said these things against God. AT: "God does not know what happens on earth. He sits in dark clouds and cannot judge us." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **he walks on the vault of heaven** - Here "vault" refers to the barrier that ancient people believed separated the earth from heaven. AT: "he lives too far away in heaven to see what happens here"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
