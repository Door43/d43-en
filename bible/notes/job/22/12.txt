\q2 And why do you say, 'Dark clouds keep him from seeing us, so he cannot judge us'?
\q1
\v 14 Do you think that while he walks on the dome that covers the sky,
\q2 where there are thick clouds around him, he cannot see what we do?'

===== Translation Notes: =====
Eliphaz continues speaking to Job.
  * **Is not God in the heights of heaven?** - Eliphaz uses a question to remind Job that God is in heaven and sees everything that happens on earth.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Look at the height of the stars, how high they are!** - AT: "Look at how high the stars are. God is even high above them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **What does God know? Can he judge through the thick darkness?** - Eliphaz is stating what he believes Job would say. He uses questions for emphasis. AT: "God does not know what happens on earth. He sits in dark clouds and cannot judge us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **he walks on the vault of heaven** - Here "vault" refers to the barrier that ancient people believed separated the earth from heaven. AT: "he lives too far away in heaven to see what happens here"
