  * **Can a man be useful to God? Can a wise man be useful to him?** - Both questions mean basically the same thing. Eliphaz uses questions to emphasize that a person's actions and wisdom do not benefit God. AT: "A man cannot be useful to God. A wise man cannot be useful to him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Is it any pleasure to the Almighty if you are righteous? Is it gain to him if you make your ways blameless?** - Both of these statements mean the same thing. Eliphaz uses questions to emphasize that Job's actions do not help God. AT: "The Almighty does not receive any pleasure if you are righteous. He does not gain anything if you make your ways blameless." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
