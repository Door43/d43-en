===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Eliphaz the Temanite** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:job:02:11|2:11]].
  * **Can a man be useful to God? Can a wise man be useful to him?** - Eliphaz uses questions to emphasize that a person's actions or wisdom do not benefit God.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Is it any pleasure to the Almighty if you are righteous? Is it gain to him if you make your ways perfect?** - Both of these statements mean the same thing. Eliphaz uses questions again for emphasis. AT: "It does not benefit God if you are perfectly righteous" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
