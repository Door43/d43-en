===== Translation Notes: =====
Eliphaz continues speaking to Job.
  * **You have sent widows away empty** - "You made widows go away with nothing"
  * **widows** - women whose husbands have died
  * **the arms of the fatherless have been broken** - Here "arms" refer to power. AT: "You even oppressed orphans" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **snares are all around you...there is darkness...an abundance of water** - All of these mean that there are troubles and dangers all around Job because of his sin. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
