===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **How you have helped one... the arm that has no strength!** - In these statements, Job is accusing Bildad. The word "one" refers to himself. AT: "I am powerless and have no strength, but you act like you have helped me--but really, you have not helped me at all!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]]) 
  * **the arm that has no strength** - Job uses this phrase to describe himself. AT: "me, who is like an arm that has no strength" or "the one who is so weak" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **How you have advised on who has no wisdom and announced to him sound knowledge** - Job is saying that Bildad has not provided him with good advice and knowledge. AT: "You act like I have no wisdom and that you have advised me,  that you have given me good advice!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]]) 
  * **announced to him sound knowledge** - "given him good advice"
  * **Who helped you to say all those great things? Whose spirit was it that came out from you?** - In these questions Job continues to mock Bildad. They are both rhetorical questions and have basically the same meaning. They are used together to strengthen each other.  AT: "You must have had help speaking these words, perhaps some spirit helped you speak them!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
