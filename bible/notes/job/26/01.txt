\v 1 Then Job answered and said,
\q
\v 2 “How you have helped one who has no power!
\q How you have saved the arm that has no strength!
\q
\v 3 How you have advised one who has no wisdom
\q and announced to him sound knowledge!

  * **How you have helped ... How you have saved** - In these statements, Job really means that Bildad did not help him at all. AT: "I am powerless, but you have not helped me at all! I have no strength, but you have not saved me!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]]) 
  * **How you have advised ... announced to him sound knowledge** - Job is saying that Bildad has not provided him with good advice and knowledge.
  * **With whose help ... Whose spirit** - In these questions, Job implies that Bildad's words have not come from God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
