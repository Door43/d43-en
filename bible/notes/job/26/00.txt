====== Job 26 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation. This chapter is Job's response to Bildad.

This chapter begins a section continuing through chapter 31. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Yahweh's power ==
While Bildad described Yahweh's power as being so much greater than Job's, Job understands the true extent of Yahweh's power. It is not just over Job's life, but over all of creation. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Sarcasm ==
Job uses sarcasm in this chapter. This is the use of irony to insult Bildad. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:job:26:01:26:1-4]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
