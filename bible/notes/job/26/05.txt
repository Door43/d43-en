===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Those who are deceased, the shades,** -  AT: "The dead" or "Those who have died"
  * **those inhabitants** - "those who live" or "they live"
  * **Sheol is naked before God; destruction itself has no covering ...** - These two phrases have the same meaning and are used together for emphasis. To be "naked" or have "no covering" is to be completely exposed and not able to hide anything. AT: "It is like Sheol is naked before God, for nothing in Sheol, the place of destruction, is hidden from God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **destruction** - This is another name for Sheol. AT: "the place of destruction"
