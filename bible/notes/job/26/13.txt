\v 13 By his breath he caused the sky to be bright;
\q2 by his hand he killed the great dragon in the sea as it was fleeing from him.

\q2 it is as though we were hearing only whispers of his powerful voice.

\q
\v 13 By his breath, he cleared the heavens of storms; the heavens were cleared of storms;

\q how small a whisper do we hear of him!
\q Who can understand the thunder of his power?"
