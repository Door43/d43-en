===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Are not my days only a few?** - Here "my days" represent the length of Job's life. This question expects a positive answer, to emphasize that Job only expects to live a few more days. It can be translated as a statement. AT: "I only have a few days left to live." or "My life will soon end." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the land** - Here the place where the spirits of dead people go is spoken of as if it was a land. AT: "the place" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **of darkness and of the shadow of death** - The phrase "shadow of death" intensifies the idea of "darkness." Both phrases describe where the spirits of dead people go. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **the shadow of death** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:job:03:04|3:5]].
  * **as dark as midnight** - The darkness of the place where the spirits of dead people go is compared to the darkness of midnight. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **without any order** - This negative phrase can be expressed in positive form. AT: "full of confusion" or "where all is confused" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **where the light is like midnight** - The light of the place where the spirits of dead people go is compared to midnight. AT: "where there is no light" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
