  * **Why then have you brought me out of the womb?** - AT: "You should not have allowed me to be born!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **I wish I had given up my spirit** - AT: "I wish that I had died" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
