===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In these verses, Eliphaz continues his speech from [[:en:bible:notes:job:04:01|4:01]]. The writer continues to use parallelism in each verse, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize that Job needs to plead his case to God who does wonderful things. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) 

  * **great and profound things, marvelous things without number** - "great things that cannot be understood, wonders that cannot be counted" 
  * **great and profound things** - Here the writer uses two independent words connected by "and" to emphasize the greatness of God's actions. AT: "greatly profound things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hendiadys]])
  * **marvelous things** - "wonderful things" or "wonders"
