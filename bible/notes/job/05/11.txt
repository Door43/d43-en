===== Translation Notes: =====

The writer continues to use parallelism in each verse, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize how God lifts those who are lowly and debases those who are cunning. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])  

  * **He does this in order to set up on high those who are low** - "God sets up on high those who are lowly" or "God gives honor to those who are lowly" or "God exalts those who are lowly"
  * **to raise to safety those who mourn in ashes** - "he raises to safety those who mourn" 
  * **He frustrates** - "He breaks" or "He brings to nothing"
  * **schemes** - "plans" or "designs" or "undertakings"
  * **the crafty** - "those who are cunning" or "those who are devious" or "those who are shrewd"
