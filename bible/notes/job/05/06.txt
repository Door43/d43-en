===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **For difficulties do not come out from the soil** - "For difficulties do not come from the dust"
  * **But mankind makes his own trouble, just as sparks fly upward** - The writer compares the trouble in people's lives to sparks shooting up from a fire.  Both are inevitable.  "But people have troubles from the time they are born just as surely as sparks shoot up from a fire" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
