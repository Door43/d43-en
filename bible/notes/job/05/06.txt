===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For difficulties do not come out from the soil; neither does trouble sprout out of the ground** - "For difficulties do not come from the dust"
  * **but mankind makes his own trouble, just as sparks fly upward** - The writer compares the trouble in people's lives to sparks shooting up from a fire. Both are inevitable. "but people have troubles from the time they are born just as surely as sparks shoot up from a fire" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
