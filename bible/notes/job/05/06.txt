===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **For difficulties do not come forth from the soil** - "For difficulties do not come forth from the dust"
  * **But mankind makes his own trouble just as sparks fly upward** - The writer compares the trouble in people's lives to sparks shooting up from a fire.  Both are inevitable.  "But people have troubles from the time they are born just as surely as sparks shoot up from a fire" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
