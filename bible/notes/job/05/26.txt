  * **"like a stack of grain sheaves that is carried up to the threshing floor" **- Eliphaz is using simile to make his point that Job will die when it is time for him to die. AT: "Just as grain is harvested at the appointed time, so shall you die when it is your appointed time, and not before." See: Simile.
  * **"we have examined this matter; it is like this; listen to it, and know it for yourself" **- "We" refers to Job's friends that are speaking to him. AT: "We have thought about your situation and this is how we see it; trust us; if you think about it you will realize we are right." See: Implicit/Explicit.
