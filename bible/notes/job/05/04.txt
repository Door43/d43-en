===== Translation Notes: =====

These verses continue the earlier use of parallelism, here emphasizing in different ways the idea that the children of foolish people are never safe. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **His children are far from safety** - "His" refers to the foolish person or the foolish people in [[en:bible:notes:job:05:01|05:02]]. AT: "Their children are never safe"
  * **are crushed** - "someone crushes them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **city gate** - The city gate, functioning as a court, was the place where disputes were resolved and where judgments were rendered.
  * **There is no one to rescue them** - AT: "There is no one to deliver the foolish people's children"
  * **those whose harvest is eaten up by others who are hungry** - This passive clause can be translated as an active clause.  AT: "the hungry eat the foolish people's harvest" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **people who take it even out of the thorns** - "and take it from behind the thorns"
