===== translationNotes: =====

  * **To which of the holy ones will you turn?** - Eliphaz poses this question to make the point that no one Job can turn to for help. AT: "Is there a holy one to whom you may turn?" or "There is no holy one to whom you can turn for help." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **holy ones** - This refers to supernatural beings of some kind, whether angels or other spirits.
  * **the silly one...a foolish person** - This refers to any silly person and any foolish person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_genericnoun]])
  * **jealousy kills the silly one** - "jealousy kills anyone who acts ignorantly and impulsively"
  * **a foolish person taking root** - Here a person is spoken of as if he were a plant, perhaps becoming more foolish over time. AT: "a foolish person becoming grounded in foolishness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
