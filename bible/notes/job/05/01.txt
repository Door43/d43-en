  * **To which of the holy ones will you turn?** - Eliphaz poses this question to make the point that no one Job can turn to for help.  AT: "Is there a holy one to whom you may turn?" or "There is no holy one to whom you can turn for help."  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **jealousy kills the silly one"** - "jealousy kills the gullible one"
  * **a foolish person taking root** - Here a foolish person is compared to a tree taking root, suggesting that the person grows in foolishness over time. "a foolish person becoming grounded in foolishness" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
