\v 14 It is as though even in the daytime they were living in darkness
\q2 and were groping around trying to find the road at noontime like people do at night.
\q1
\v 15 But God saves helpless people from the wicked who say evil things about them;
\q2 he saves poor people from powerful people harming them.
\q1
\v 16 So poor people confidently expect that good things will happen to them;
\q2 but God stops wicked people from saying evil things.

\q
\v 14 They meet with darkness in the daytime,
\q and grope at noonday as if it were night.
\q
\v 15 But he saves the poor person from the sword in their mouths
\q and the needy person from the hand of mighty people.
\q
\v 16 So the poor person has hope,
\q and injustice shuts her own mouth.

===== Translation Notes: =====

The writer continues to use parallelism in each verse, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize how God debases those who are cunning and saves those who are poor. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])  

  * **They meet with darkness in the daytime** - This metaphor compares those who are cunning with those in darkness who cannot see which way to go or what to do when God breaks their schemes.  "Those who are cunning encounter darkness"
  * **grope** - feel around like a blind person
  * **noonday** - "at noon" or "in the afternoon" 
  * **But he saves the poor person from the sword in their mouths** - "But God saves the poor person from the threats and oppression of the mighty"
  * **the sword in their mouths** - This is symbolic language describing oppressors' exploitation of the poor.  AT: "cruel, destructive words in the oppressors' mouths"
  * **injustice shuts her mouth** - The speaker is giving human characteristics to "injustice". "It is as though injustice shuts her mouth".  (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]]).
