===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Then Satan went away from the presence of Yahweh** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:job:01:09|1:12]].
  * **struck** - "attacked" or "afflicted with"
  * **severe boils** - large, itching and painful skin infections
  * **a piece of broken pottery to scrape himself** - The scraping scratches the skin to lessen the itch.
  * **sat down in the middle of ashes** - This probably refers to a place where trash and garbage were dumped and perhaps burned. Sitting in such a place was a sign of deep mourning. AT: "sat on the trash heap" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
