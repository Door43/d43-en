===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **So Satan went forth from from the presence of Yahweh** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:job:01:09|01:12]].
    * **severe boils** - large, itching and painful skin infection covering Job's entire body
    * ** potshard to scrape himself** - A "potsherd" is a piece of broken pottery. The scraping scratches the skin to lessen the itch.
    * **sat in ashes** - AT: "sat on the trash heap" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
