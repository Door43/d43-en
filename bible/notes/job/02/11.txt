\v 11 Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that had come on him, each of them came from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. They set a time to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite** - Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar are men's names. Teman was a city in Edom. Shuhites are the decedents of Abraham and Keturah. Naamah was a city in Canaan. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **set a time** - "agreed on a time" 
  * **to mourn with him and to comfort him** - Here the words "mourn with" and "comfort" share similar meanings. The friends try to comfort Job by mourning with him. AT: "to grieve with Job in order to help ease his suffering" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
