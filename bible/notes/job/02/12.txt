\v 12 When they saw Job from a distance, they almost did not recognize him. They wailed loudly, they tore their robes, and they threw dust over their heads \add to show how sorry they were because of what had happened to Job\add*.
\v 13 Then they sat on the ground with Job for seven days. None of them said anything to Job, because they saw that he was suffering greatly, \add and they did not think that anything that they said would lessen his pain\add*.

\v 12 But when they saw Job from a distance, they almost did not recognize him. They wailed loudly, they tore their robes, and they threw dust into the air that settled on their heads. They did this to show how sorry they were for him.
\v 13 Then they sat on the ground with Job for seven days. None of them said anything to him, because they saw that he was suffering greatly, and they did not think that anything that they could say would lessen his pain.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 When they lifted up their eyes at a distance, they barely recognized him; they raised their voices and wept; each tore his robe and threw dust into the air and upon his own head.
\v 13 So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great.
