\v 9 His wife said to him, "Are you still trying to be loyal to God? You should curse God, and then go ahead and die."
\p
\v 10 But Job replied, "You talk like people talk who do not know God. We should not only accept the good things that God does for us. We should also accept the bad things." So in spite of all these things that happened to Job, he did not offend God by saying anything against him.
