  * **Again it came about**  - This points back to Job 1:6.
  * **sons of God **- "heavenly beings" or "angels" (UDB)
  * **on the day when**  - This is not a specific day. Alternate translation, "at the time when". This gathering was routine and happened often.
  * **present themselves before Yahweh **- "stand before Yahweh ready to serve," or "present themselves to Yahweh for service."
  * **Satan also came among them**  - That is, "among the angels".
  * **From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it**  - These two clauses mean basically the same thing. "To and fro" as well as "back and forth" are used together to mean everything. Alternative translation: "I have been everywhere upon the earth." (See: Parallelism and Merism)
