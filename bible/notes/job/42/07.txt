\v 8 So now you must take to Job seven young bulls and seven rams and \add kill them and\add* burn them on the altar as a sacrifice for yourselves. Then Job will pray for you, and I will do what he requests me to do, \add and I will forgive you for speaking wrongly about me\add*.

\p
\v 7 And it was so, that, after Jehovah had spoken these words to Job, Jehovah said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is
kindled against thee, and against your two friends; for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job
hath.
\v 8 Now therefore, take to you seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a
burnt-offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you; for him will I accept, that I deal not with you after your folly; for you
have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.
\v 9 So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as Jehovah commanded
them: and Jehovah accepted Job.
