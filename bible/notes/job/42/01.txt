===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I know that you can do all things, that no purpose of yours can be stopped** - AT: "I know that you can do all things. I know that no purpose of yours can be stopped." This is the same idea expressed in two different ways. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **no purpose of yours can be stopped** - AT: "no one can stop any of your plans" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Who is this who without knowledge conceals plans?** - Most modern versions agree that Job is loosely quoting God's own words from [[:en:bible:notes:job:38:01|38:2]]. Translators may therefore decide, as does the UDB, to make it clear that God asked this question of Job, and that Job is now remembering it. AT: "You said to me, 'Who is this who has no knowledge, but who dares to hide my plans from people?'" Or, "You said to me, 'You have no knowledge; you should not tell lies about my plans.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **conceals plans** - That is, conceals or misrepresents God's plans and advice. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
