====== Job 42 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers, or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 42:1-6, which is an extended quotation of Job.

Having faced the temptation to curse Yahweh, and after being rebuked by him, in the end Job shows his complete trust in Yahweh. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:tempt]], [[:en:obe:kt:curse]] and [[:en:obe:kt:trust]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Justice ==
Yahweh enacts justice at the end of this book. He punishes Job's friends and restores Job's blessings. Yahweh's blessing was not dependent upon Job's repentance, but upon Yahweh's grace. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:justice]], [[:en:obe:kt:restore]], [[:en:obe:kt:bless]], [[:en:obe:kt:repent]] and [[:en:obe:kt:grace]])
