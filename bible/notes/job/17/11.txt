===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Job continues to speak.

  * **My days are past** - AT: "My time is past" or "My life is over" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **my plans are over** - AT: "my plans will never come about"
  * **As for the wishes of my heart** - Job implies that he has no hope for the wishes of his heart. (See UDB)
  * **These people, these mockers** - These two phrases refer to the same people, namely Job's friends, Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. The second phrase emphasizes their unfriendly attitude. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **change the night into day** - Here "change" probably represents "say that, pretend that." AT: "they claim it is daytime when it is night" or "what they say is the opposite of what is true, just as night is the opposite of day" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
