\q
\v 11 My days are past; my plans are shattered,

The wishes of my heart are finished \fqa* or \fqa ... the strings of my heart have been broken \fqa* . Others have \fqa My days are past; my plans are over, as are the wishes of my heart \fqa* \f*
\q
\v 12 These people, these mockers, change the night into day;
\q light is near to darkness.

  * **My days are past** - This is an idiom. AT: "My time is past" or "My life is over" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **my plans are shattered, and so are the desires of my heart** - Here Job's "heart" represents his inner being. AT: "my plans will never happen, nor will the things that I have desired most" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **These people, these mockers** - These two phrases refer to the same people, namely Job's friends, Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. The second phrase emphasizes their unfriendly attitude. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **change the night into day** - This speaks of the people claiming that night is day as if they actually changed night into day. AT: "claim it is daytime when it is night" or "say the opposite of what is true, just as night is the opposite of day" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **light is near to darkness** - It is implied that the mockers claim that it is light when it is close to dark. AT: "they claim that light is near to darkness" or "they claim that when it is becoming dark, that it is getting light" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
