===== Translation Notes: =====

Job continues to speak.
  * **My days are past** - AT: "My time is past" or "My life is over" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **my plans are over** - AT: "my plans will never happen"
  * **even the wishes of my heart** - AT: "even my wishes will never happen" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]]) 
  * **These people, these mockers** - These two words refer to the same people, namely Job's friends, Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. He uses two words to emphasize their unfriendly attitude. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **change the night into day** - AT: "they claim it is daytime when it is night" or "what they say is the opposite of what is true, just like the night is the opposite of the day" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
