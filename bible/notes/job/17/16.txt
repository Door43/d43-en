  * **Will hope go down with me ...** - The implicit answer is "no." AT: "Hope will not go down with me ..." or "I will no longer hope when I go down ..." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **gates of sheol** - Sheol does not really have gates, but it is a metaphor for Job entering sheol. AT: "when I go into sheol" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **when we** - The word "we" refers to Job and his hope.
  * **descend to the dust** - "go down into the dirt" AT: "go to sheol" or "die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
