===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Will hope go down with me ... dust?** - The implicit answer is "no." This question can be written as a statement. AT: "Hope will not go down with me ... dust." or "I will no longer hope when I go down ... dust." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **gates of Sheol** - Sheol does not really have gates, but it is a metaphor for Job entering Sheol. AT: "when I go into Sheol" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **when we** - "when I and the things that I hope for" or "when I and my hopes." The word "we" refers to Job and his hope.
  * **descend to the dust** - This is an idiom. AT: "die and am buried" or "go to my grave" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
