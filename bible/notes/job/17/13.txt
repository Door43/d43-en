\v 13 Since I look at sheol as my home;

===== Translation Notes: =====

Job continues to speak.
  * **I look at sheol as my home** - AT: "I think of sheol as my home" or "Sheol is like my home" or "I will soon be at home among other dead people"
  * **have spread my couch in the darkness** - AT: "have made my bed in the darkness" or "have prepared myself to go and sleep among the dead" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I have said to the pit... and to the worm ...** - These two lines are a variation to each other and are used together to emphasize how desperate Job is. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **You are my father** - Job feels as though "corruption" is as familar as a father. AT: "You are as close to me as my father" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **the worm** - Worms are the small creatures that eat dead bodies.
  * **You are my mother or my sister** - Job feels as though "the worm" is as familar as a mother or a sister. AT: "You are as close to me as my mother or my sister" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **where then is my hope?** - The implicit answer is "now where", because he has no hope. AT: "I have no hope" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **As for my hope, who can see any?** - The implicit answer is "no one can see my hope", because he has none. AT: "As for my hope, I do not have any" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
