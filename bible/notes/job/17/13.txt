\q2 I may say to the maggots, 'You will be \add like\add* a mother or younger sisters to me \add because that is where I will always be\add*.'
\q1

\v 13 I know that my home will be the place where dead people are,
\q2 where I will sleep in the darkness.
\q1
\v 14 I can say to the grave, 'Where I am buried, that place will be like a father to me.'
\q2 I can say to the maggots, 'You will be like a mother or younger sisters to me because that is where I will always be.'
\q1
\v 15 There is certainly no more hope left for me.
\q2 No one expects that I will have any more happiness.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 13 Since I look at Sheol as my home;
\q since I have spread my couch in the darkness;
\q
\v 14 since I have said to the pit, 'You are my father,'
\q and to the worm, 'You are my mother or my sister,'
\q
\v 15 where then is my hope?
\q As for my hope, who can see any?
