\v 13 I know that my home will be the place where dead people are,
\q2 where I will sleep in the darkness.
\q1
\v 14 I can say to the grave, 'Where I am buried, that place will be like a father to me.'
\q2 I can say to the maggots, 'You will be like a mother or younger sisters to me because that is where I will always be.'

<usfm>
\q
\v 13 If the only home I hope for is Sheol;
\q and if I have spread my couch in the darkness;
\q
\v 14 and if I have said to the pit, 'You are my father,'
\q and to the worm, 'You are my mother or my sister,'
\q
\v 15 where then is my hope?
\q As for my hope, who can see any?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Job continues to speak.

  * **If the only home ... and if I have spread ... and if I have said** - All instances of "if" here have the meaning of "since"; Job is speaking as if all these things were true. "Since the only home ... and since I have spread ... and since I have said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **have spread my couch in the darkness** - Here Job speaks of being prepared to die as having laid his bed in the darkness. AT: "have prepared myself to go and sleep among the dead" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **have spread my couch** - "have made my bed"
  * **I have said to the pit ... and to the worm** - These two lines are a variation to each other and are used together to emphasize how desperate Job is. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **the pit** - "the grave" 
  * **You are my father** - Job speaks of the closeness he will soon have with his grave by comparing it to the closeness a man has with his father. AT: "You are as close to me as my father" or "When I am buried, you will be as close to me as a father" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
