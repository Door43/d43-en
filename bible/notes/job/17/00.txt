====== Job 17 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation. This chapter is a continuation of Job's response to Eliphaz.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Job's grief ==
Job expresses grief or great sadness in this chapter. He awaits the justice and intercession of Yahweh as he awaits his own death. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:curse]] and  [[:en:obe:kt:intercede]])

== Advocate ==
Job describes the need for someone to intercede for him in heaven. This person would be his advocate and provide a witness for him. Although this is probably not intended as a prophecy, it closely parallels the way Jesus intercedes for people in heaven. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:heaven]], [[:en:obe:kt:witness]] and [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])
