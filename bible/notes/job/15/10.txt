===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **gray-headed and the very aged men** - "men with gray hair and very old men." These two descriptions refer to the same group and are used together to emphasize how wise they must be. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Are the consolations of God ... gentle toward you?** - The implied answer is an accusation. AT: "You must think that the consolations of God are too small for you, the words that are gentle toward you"
