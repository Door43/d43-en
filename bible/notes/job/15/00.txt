====== Job 15 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation. This chapter is a continuation of the advice of Job's friend, Eliphaz. His words in this chapter are much stronger than when he previously spoke.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Eliphaz's advice ==
Eliphaz tells Job to curse Yahweh. The advice Eliphaz gives to Job is bad advice. He tries to convince Job that he is sinning and has been punished by Yahweh. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:curse]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical Questions ==
Eliphaz uses many different rhetorical questions in this chapter in order to try to convince Job that he is wrong. These questions help to build Bildad's argument. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
