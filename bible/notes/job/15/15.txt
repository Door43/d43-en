  * **his holy ones** - "his angels" 
  * **clean** - Something that God considers spiritually acceptable is spoken of as if it were physically clean. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in his sight** - Here sight represents judgment or evaluation. AT: "in his judgment" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
