  * **he has covered his face with his fat and gathered fat upon his loins** - This wicked man is described as fat and weak, while believing himself to be strong enough to defeat God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **he has covered his face with his fat** - AT: "his face looks fat and chubby"
  * **gathered fat upon his loins** - "loins" are often considered the location of physical strength and generative power. To cover them with fat would be to destroy his power and ability to fight.
