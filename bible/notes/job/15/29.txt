===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **He will not be rich; his wealth will not last** - These two phrases repeat the same thought and are used together to emphasize that the wicked will not be wealthy. AT: "he will be poor; all his money will disappear" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **not even his shadow will last over the earth** - This repeats the idea that all the possessions of the wicked will disappear. Other translations may read: "nor will his possessions spread out over the earth" or "nor will will his grain bend down to the ground"
  * **a flame will dry up his branches** - Here the flame represents God's judgment and the drying up of his branches represents either the fact that his possessions disappear, or that he will die. AT: "God will take everything he owns away, like a fire dries out the moist branches of a tree" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the breath of God’s mouth** - AT: "God's breath" or "God's judgment" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **he will go away** - Possible meanings are 1) he will become poor or 2) he will die (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
