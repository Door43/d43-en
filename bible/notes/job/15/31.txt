====== Job 15:31-33 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 31 If they are very foolish, with the result that they trust in things that are really worthless,
\q2 then things that are worthless will be all that they get.
\q1
\v 32 While they are still young, they will disappear;
\q2 they will be like \f + \ft metaphor \f* branches that wither and never become green again.
\q1
\v 33 They will be like \f + \ft simile \f* vines whose grapes fall off before they are ripe,
\q2 like olive trees whose blossoms fall off before they produce any fruit.

\q
\v 31 Let him not trust in useless things, deceiving himself;
\q for uselessness will be his reward.
\q
\v 32 It will happen before his time should come to die;
\q his branch will not be green.
\q
\v 33 He will drop his unripe grapes like a grapevine;
\q he will cast off his flowers like the olive tree.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **for uselessness will be his reward** - The missing words can be added. AT: "for if he trusts in them, uselessness will be his reward" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **his branch will not be green** - This speaks of the man looking pale and dead as if he were a dried out stalk or tree branch. AT: "he will look dead, just like the branch of a dead tree does not look green" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **He will drop his ... he will cast off his** - These two lines give a similar image, which is repeated to emphasize that this will surely happen. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **He will drop his unripe grapes like a grapevine** - This speaks of the wicked man growing weak and dying as if he were a grapevine dropping unripe grapes. AT: "Just like a grapevine drops its unripe grapes, so the wicked man will drop his strength" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he will cast off his flowers like the olive tree** - This speaks of the wicked man growing weak and dying as if he were were an olive tree dropping its flowers and not producing fruit. At: "just like an olive tree looses its flowers, so the wicked man will loose his strength" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
