====== Job 15:31-33 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 31 If they are very foolish, with the result that they trust in things that are really worthless,
\q2 then things that are worthless will be all that they get.
\q1
\v 32 While they are still young, they will disappear;
\q2 they will be like \f + \ft metaphor \f* branches that wither and never become green again.
\q1
\v 33 They will be like \f + \ft simile \f* vines whose grapes fall off before they are ripe,
\q2 like olive trees whose blossoms fall off before they produce any fruit.

\q
\v 31 Let him not trust in useless things, deceiving himself;
\q for uselessness will be his reward.
\q
\v 32 It will happen before his time should come to die;
\q his branch will not be green.
\q
\v 33 He will drop his unripe grapes like a grapevine;
\q he will cast off his flowers like the olive tree.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **will not be green** - This negative statement emphasizes the intended meaning: "his branch will be dead." Alternate Meaning: "He will be dead." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **He will drop his unripe grapes like a grapevine; he will cast off his flowers like the olive tree.** - These two lines provide similar images of loss, repeated for emphasis. Also, comparisons are created using "like" - (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
