===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Elihu continues speaking to Job.

  * **The Spirit of God ... has given me life** - These two lines mean the same thing. Elihu is emphasizing that God has made him and so gives authority to what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **set your words in order before me and stand up** - This speaks of Job preparing what he will say as if here were setting up and organizing physical objects. AT: "prepare what you will say, and stand up and answer me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
