===== Translation Notes: =====
Elihu continues speaking to Job.
  * **The Spirit of God...the breath of the Almighty** - These mean the same thing. They emphasize that God is the one who gives power to Elhu to speak. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **set your words in order before me and stand up** - "prepare what you will say and answer me"
