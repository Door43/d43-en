===== Translation Notes: =====
Elihu continues speaking to Job.

    * **I sinned and perverted that which was right** - The words "sinned" and "perverted" mean basically the same thing. AT: "I sinned and did evil instead of doing what is right" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
    * **but my sin was not punished** - AT: "but God did not punish me for sinning" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
    * **rescued my soul** - AT: "rescued me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
    * **my life will continue to see light** - He will see the light of life instead of the darkness he would see in death. AT: "I will continue to live" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
