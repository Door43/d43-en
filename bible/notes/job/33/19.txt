  * **Man is punished also** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God also punishes a person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **with pain on his bed** - This means that a person is experiencing such pain that he must lie in bed. AT: "with pain so that he must lie in bed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **agony in his bones** - Here the "bones" represent the body. AT: "in his body" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **so that his life abhors food, and his soul abhors delicacies** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing, that the person is in so much pain that he cannot even eat. The person is represented by his "life" and his "soul." AT: "The result is that he does not desire any food, not even very special food" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
