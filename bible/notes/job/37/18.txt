===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Can you spread out the sky ... a mirror of cast metal?** - Elihu asks this question to emphasize that Job cannot do this. AT: "You cannot spread out the sky ... a mirror of cast metal." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **as strong as a mirror of cast metal** - In biblical days, mirrors were made of metal. Elihu speaks of the sky giving no rain as if it were as hard as solid metal. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **cast metal** - This refers to metal that is melted, poured into a mold, and then hardens as it cools.
  * **Teach us what we should say to him** - Here the words "us" and "we" refer to Elihu, Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, but not to Job. Elihu uses this phrase sarcastically. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **because of the darkness of our minds** - Elihu speaks of the inability to understand as if it were having darkness in one's mind. AT: "because we do not understand" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Should he be told that I wish to speak with him?** - Elihu asks this rhetorical question to emphasize that no one can do this. AT: "I cannot have someone tell him that I wish to speak with him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Should he be told** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Should I have someone tell him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Would a person wish to be swallowed up?** - Elihu asks this rhetorical question to emphasize that no one would want this to happen. AT: "No person would want to be swallowed up." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **to be swallowed up** - Elihu speaks of a person being destroyed as if the person were swallowed up. This can be stated in active form. AT: "for God to destroy him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
