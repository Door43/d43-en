\q2 and he will never oppress us.
\q1
\v 24 That is the reason that we have an awesome respect for him;
\q2 he does not pay attention to those who proudly, \add but wrongly\add*, think that they are wise."

\q
\v 23 Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out:
\q He is excellent in power;
\q And in justice and plenteous righteousness he will not afflict.
\q
\v 24 Men do therefore fear him:
\q He regards not any that are wise of heart.
