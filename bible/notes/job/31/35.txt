\q
\v 35 Oh, if only I had someone to hear me!
\q See, here is my signature; let the Almighty answer me!
\q If only I had the indictment that my opponent has written!
\q
\v 36 Surely I would carry it openly on my shoulder;
\q I would put it on like a crown.
\q
\v 37 I would declare to him an accounting for my steps;
\q as a confident prince I would go up to him.
