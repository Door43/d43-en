\q
\v 35 Oh, if only I had someone to hear me!
\q See, here is my signature; let the Almighty answer me!
\q if only I had the indictment that my opponent has written!
\q
\v 36 Surely I would carry it openly on my shoulder;
\q I would put it on like a crown.
\q

\q as a confident prince I would go up to him.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **here is my signature** - Job is describing his complaint to God as if he wrote it down in a legal document. His signature would be his promise that everything he has written in the document is true.
    * **if only I had the indictment that my opponent has written** - "if only I could read my opponent's complaint against me"
    * **Surely I would carry it openly on my shoulder; I would put it on like a crown** - This means if God would write down his complaints against Job, then Job would put the document where everyone could read it.
    * **for my steps** - This refers to Job's actions.
    * **as a confident prince** - This means Job would approach God without any fear. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
