===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 31-32 \add or that\add* I never welcomed travelers to stay in my tent
\q2 and did not open my doors to them, but \add forced them to\add* sleep in the streets.
\q2 All the men who work for me certainly know that \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*!
\q1
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 31-32 No one can truthfully that I did not welcome travelers to stay in my house, 
\q2 or that I did not open my doors to them, but that I forced them to sleep in the streets!
\q2 All the men who work for me certainly know that I have given food to anyone who needed it!


\q1
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 31 If the men of my tent have not said,
\q 'Who can find one who has not been filled with Job's food?'
\q
\v 32 (even the foreigner has never had to stay in the city square,
\q because I have always opened my doors to the traveler), and if that is not so,  then bring charges against me!
