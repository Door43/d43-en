\v 13 If it is true that I have ever refused to listen to one of my male or female servants
\q2 when they complained to me about something,
\q1
\v 14 I hope that God would stand up and declare that he will punish me;
\q2 when he does that, what could I do?
\q2 If he asked me about what I have done, what would I answer?
\q1
\v 15 God, who created me, certainly also created my servants;
\q2 surely he is the one who formed them and me in our mothers' wombs,
\q2 so we all should behave toward each other in the same way.

\q
\v 13 If I ignored the plea for justice from my male or female servant
\q when they argued with me,
\q
\v 14 what then would I do when God rises up to accuse me?
\q When he comes to judge me, how would I answer him?
\q
\v 15 Did the one who made me in the womb not make them also?
\q Did not the same one mold us all in the womb?
\b

===== Translation Notes: =====
Job continues describing situations in which he would deserve God's punishment, but he knows they are not true. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **what then would I do when God rises up to accuse me? When he comes to judge me, how would I answer him?** - Job uses a question for emphasis. AT: "then there would absolutely nothing I could say to defend myself when God comes to judge me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **Did the one who made me in the womb not make them also? Did not the same one mold us all in the womb?** - Both of these mean the same thing. Job uses questions to emphasize that God created every person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
