===== Translation Notes: =====
Job continue speaking.

  * **I have made a covenant with my eyes** - AT: "I have promised myself that I would not look with lust at a woman" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **how then should I look with desire on a virgin?** - Job uses a question to emphasize that he would never break his promise. AT: "So I certainly will not look with lust at a virgin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **For what is the portion from God above, the inheritance from the Almighty on high?** - Both of these mean the same thing. Job uses a question to emphasize that God would not give him anything good if he sins and breaks his promise. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
