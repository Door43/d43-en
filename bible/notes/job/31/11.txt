===== Translation Notes: =====
Job continues describing situations in which he would deserve God's punishment, but he knows they are not true. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **it would be a crime to be punished by the judges** - AT: "it would be a crime for which the judges would be right to punish me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **For that is a fire that consumes everything for sheol and that would burn up all my harvest** - Job is emphasizing how terrible and destructive the sin of adultery is. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
