====== Job 31:16-18 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 16-18 I have guided orphans from the time that they were born;
\q2 I have taken care of them since they were young.
\q1 So, if \add it were true that\add* I ate all my food myself and did not share some of it with orphans,
\q2 or that I refused to give poor people the things that they wanted,
\q2 or that I caused widows to live in despair\f + \ft Or: without hope \add that they would receive any help from anyone\add* \f*,
\q1

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 16-18 I have guided orphans from the time that they were born;
\q2 I have taken care of them since they were young.
\q1 So if it is true that I ate all my food myself and did not share some of it with orphans,
\q2 or that I refused to give poor people the things that they wanted,
\q2 or that I caused widows to live in despair, then you do to me whatever you must do to me.


\q1

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 16 If I have withheld poor people from their desire,
\q or if I have caused the eyes of the widow to grow dim from crying,
\q
\v 17 or if I have eaten my morsel alone
\q and not allowed those without fathers to eat it also—
\q
\v 18 because from my youth the orphan grew up with me as with a father,
\q and I have guided his mother, a widow, from my own mother's womb.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Job begins describing situations in which he would deserve God's punishment (described in [[:en:bible:notes:job:31:22|31:22]]), but he knows they are not true. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])

  * **I have caused the eyes of the widow to grow dim from crying** - Here "to grow dim" refers to the widow having bad eyesight due to how much she cries. AT: "I have caused a widow to cry in great sadness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **my morsel** - "my food"
  * **instead, from my youth the orphan grew up with me as with a father, and I have guided his mother, a widow, from my own mother's womb** - Job is describing how he truly treated the orphan and widow. AT: "actually, I have taken care of orphans and widows since I was very young"
