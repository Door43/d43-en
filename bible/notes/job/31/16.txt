\q2 or that I refused to give poor people the things that they wanted,
\q2 or that I caused widows to live in despair\f + \ft Or: without hope \add that they would receive any help from anyone\add* \f*,

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 16 If I have withheld poor people from their desire,
\q or if I have caused the eyes of the widow to grow dim from crying,
\q
\v 17 or if I have eaten my morsel alone
\q and not allowed those without fathers to eat it also—
\q
\v 18 (instead, from my youth the orphan grew up with me as with a father,
\q and I have guided his mother, a widow, from my own mother’s womb)—

===== Translation Notes: =====
Job continues describing situations in which he would deserve God's punishment, but he knows they are not true. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **I have caused the eyes of the widow to grow dim from crying** - Here "to grow dim" refers to the widow having bad eyesight due to how much she cries. AT: "I have caused a widow to cry in great sadness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **my morsel** - "my food"
  * **instead, from my youth the orphan grew up with me as with a father, and I have guided his mother, a widow, from my own mother’s womb** - Job is describing how he truly treated the orphan and widow. AT: "actually, I have taken care of orphans and widows since I was very young"
