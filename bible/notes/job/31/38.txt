\q2 without paying for those crops,
\q2 so that the farmers who grew those crops died from hunger;

This concludes Job's description of situations in which he would deserve God's punishment, but he knows they are not true. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **If my land ever cries out against me, and its furrows weep together** - Job describes the land as a person who cries because Job has stolen it from its proper owner. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
