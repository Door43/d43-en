<usfm>
\v 38 If it is true that I have stolen land,
\q2 so that its furrows were like someone who shouted out to accuse me;
\q1
\v 39 or that I have eaten the crops that grew in someone else's fields
\q2 without paying for those crops,
\q2 so that the farmers who grew those crops died from hunger;
\q1
\v 40 then I wish that thorns would grow in my fields instead of wheat,
\q2 and that bad weeds would grow instead of barley!"
\q1 That is the end of what Job said to his three friends.

\q
\v 38 If my land ever cries out against me,
\q and its furrows weep together,
\q
\v 39 if I have eaten its harvest without paying for it
\q or have caused its owners to lose their lives,
\q
\v 40 then let thorns grow instead of wheat
\q and weeds instead of barley."

\p The words of Job are finished.
