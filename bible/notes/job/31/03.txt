===== Translation Notes: =====
Job continues speaking.
  * **Does not God see my ways and count all my steps?** - Here "my ways" and "my steps" refer to Job's behavior. Job uses a question for emphasis. AT: "Certainly God watches me and knows everything that I do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
