===== Translation Notes: =====
Job continues speaking.

    * **If I have** - In 31:5-40 Job describes different situations in which he would deserve God's punishment. But, he knows that they are not true and he is innocent. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
    * **walked with falsehood, if my foot has hurried to deceit** - AT: "done anything false or purposely deceived anyone"
    * **let me be weighed in an even balance** - People used balances to weigh items and to determine their value.  AT: "Let God judge me honestly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
