===== Translation Notes: =====
Job continues describing situations in which he would deserve God's punishment, but he knows they are not true. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])

  * **If my heart has been attracted to another woman** - AT: "If I have desired another man's wife" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **if I have lain in wait at my neighbor's door for his wife** - "and I have waited for him to leave his house so I could sleep with her"
  * **then let my wife grind grain for another man** - Possible meanings are 1) this is a way of saying another man will sleep with Job's wife (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]]) or 2) it means she will become a slave and work for another man.
