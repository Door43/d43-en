===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 33 if, like mankind, I have hidden my sins
\q by hiding my guilt inside my tunic
\q
\v 34 because I feared the great multitude,
\q because the contempt of families terrified me,
\q so that I kept silent and did not go outside of my house....

===== Translation Notes: =====
Job continues describing situations in which he would deserve God's punishment, but he knows they are not true. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **by hiding my guilt inside my tunic** - AT: "like a person hides things under his tunic" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **because I feared the great multitude, because the contempt of families terrified me** - These mean the same thing. They emphasize that a person may hide his sin because he fears what other people may say. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
