===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Can you understand God by searching for him** and **Can you comprehend the Almighty perfectly** - These two parallel questions are asking the same thing. The writer uses the form of a question to add emphasis. AT: "You cannot understand God by searching for him!" and AT: "You will never have a complete understanding of the Almighty!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **The matter** - AT: "To know God fully"
  * **high as heaven ... deeper than Sheol ... longer than the earth ... wider than the sea** - These parallel clauses compare the greatness of God with concepts or ideas that are already familiar to the reader. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **What can you do** - AT: "You cannot understand it fully." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **What can you know**  - AT: "You cannot know all there is to know." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])  
  * **its measure** - AT: "What there is to know about God"
