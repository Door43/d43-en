\q
\v 4 For you say to God, ‘My beliefs are pure,
\q I am blameless in your eyes.’
\q
\v 5 But, oh, that God would speak
\q and open his lips against you;
\q
\v 6 that he would show you the secrets of wisdom!
\q For he is great in understanding.
\q Know then that God demands from you less than your iniquity deserves.
