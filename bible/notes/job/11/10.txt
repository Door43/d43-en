<usfm>
\q
\v 10 If he passes through and shuts anyone up,
\q if he calls anyone to judgment, then who can stop him?
\q
\v 11 For he knows false people;
\q when he sees iniquity, does he not notice it?
\q
\v 12 But foolish people have no understanding;
\q they will get it when a wild donkey gives birth to a man.
