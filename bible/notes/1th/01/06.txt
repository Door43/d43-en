At that time you were joyful because the Holy Spirit caused you to be joyful.
\v 7 As a result \add of your joyfully enduring your troubles\add*, all the believers who live in Macedonia and Achaia \add provinces have heard how firmly you trust God. So they know that they should firmly trust in God\add* as you do.

\v 6 We have now heard that you are living like we live and are following our example. But more important, you are also living like our Lord lived. You received the message of God's love with great joy that only comes from the Holy Spirit, even though you had to go through many trials and difficulties.
\v 7 All the believers who are in the provinces of Macedonia and Achaia are learning how they  should trust God just like you have learned and as you are trusting him.

\v 6 You became imitators of us and of the Lord, as you received the word in much hardship with joy from the Holy Spirit.
\v 7 As a result, you became an example to all in Macedonia and Achaia who believe.
