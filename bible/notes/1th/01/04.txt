\v 4 My fellow believers whom God loves, we also thank him because we know that he chose you to become his people.
\v 5 We know that he chose you because when we told the good news to you, it was much more than words only. The Holy Spirit powerfully worked among you, and he strongly assured us that he was doing so. In the same way, you know how we spoke and how we conducted ourselves when we were with you, in order that we might help you.

  * **what kind of men** - "how we conducted ourselves" (UDB)
