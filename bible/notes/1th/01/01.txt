===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Paul identifies himself as the writer of the letter and greets the church at Thessalonica. 

  * **Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy to the church** - The UDB makes clear that it was Paul who wrote this letter. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **May grace and peace be to you** - The terms "grace" and "peace" are metonyms for the person who acts toward people in a kindly and peaceful manner. AT: "May God be kind to you and give you peace" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **peace be to you** - The word "you" refers to the Thessalonian believers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
