\v 8 Other people have heard you tell the message from the Lord Jesus. Then they also proclaimed the good news to people who live throughout Macedonia and Achaia. Not only that, but people who live in many faraway places have heard that you trust in God. So we do not need to tell people what God has done in your lives.
\v 9 People who live far from you are telling others how warmly you welcomed us when we came to you. They also report that you stopped worshiping false gods and that now you worship and serve the God who alone is the living God, and he is the real and only God.
\v 10 They also tell us that now you wait expectantly for his Son to return to earth from heaven. You firmly believe that God caused him to live again after he died. You believe also that Jesus will rescue all of us, who trust in him, when God punishes all the people of the entire world.

\v 8 For from you the word of the Lord has rung out, and not only in Macedonia and Achaia. Instead, to every place your faith in God has gone out. As a result, we do not need to say anything.
\v 9 For they themselves report what kind of coming we had among you. They tell how you turned to God from the idols to serve the living and true God.
\v 10 They report that you are waiting for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead ones. This is Jesus, who frees us from the wrath to come.
