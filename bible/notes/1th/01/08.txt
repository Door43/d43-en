\v 8 Other people have heard you tell the message from the Lord Jesus. Then they also proclaimed the good news to people who live throughout Macedonia and Achaia. Not only that, but people who live in many faraway places  have heard that you trust in God. So we do not need to tell people what God has done in your lives.
\v 9 People who live far from you are telling others how warmly you welcomed us when we came to you. They also report that you stopped worshiping false gods and that now you worship the God who can do anything and who truly is God. It was in him that you became believers!
\v 10 They also tell us that now you wait expectantly for his Son to return to earth from heaven. You firmly believe that God caused him to live again after he died. You believe also that Jesus will rescue all of us, who trust in him, when God punishes all the people of the entire world.

\v 8 For from you the word of the Lord has rung out, and not only in Macedonia and Achaiaâ€”but in every place your faith in God has gone out, so that we do not need to say anything.
\v 9 For they themselves report concerning us, what kind of reception we had with you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God,
\v 10 and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to come.
