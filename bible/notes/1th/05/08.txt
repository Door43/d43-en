\v 8 But we believers are people who \add should do what is right\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, so we must be self-controlled, \add as people\add* in the daytime \add are usually not drunk and are able to control what they do\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add As Roman soldiers protect themselves by\add* putting on breastplates and helmets \f + \ft metaphor \f*, we \add believers\add* must \add protect ourselves by continuing to\add* trust and love \add the Lord Jesus\add* and by continuing to confidently expect that he will save \add us from God's punishing us at the time when he will punish other people\add*.


\p
\v 9 When God chose us, he did not plan for us to \add be people whom he will severely\add* punish \f + \ft metonymy \f*. On the contrary, \add he decided\add* that he would save us because of \add our trusting in what\add* our Lord Jesus Christ \add has done for us\add*.
\v 10 Jesus died \add to atone\f + \ft Or: pay \f*\add* for our \add sins\add* in order that we might be able to live together with him, whether we are alive \f + \ft metaphor \f* or whether we are dead \f + \ft euphemism \f* \add when he returns to earth\add*.
\v 11 Because \add you know that this is true\add*, continue to encourage\f + \ft Or: comfort \f* each other, as indeed you now are doing.

\v 8 But we believers belong to the day, so let us control ourselves. Let us be like soldiers: As they protect their chests with breastplates, let us protect ourselves by trusting in Christ and loving him. As they protect their heads with helmets, let us protect ourselves by expecting Christ to rescue us completely from evil.



\p
\v 9 When God chose us, he did not plan for us to be people whom he will punish. On the contrary, he decided to save us because we trust in what our Lord Jesus Christ has done for us.
\v 10 Jesus died to atone for our sins in order that we might live together with him, whether we are alive or whether we are dead when he returns to earth.
\v 11 Because you know that this is true, continue to encourage each other, as indeed you now are doing.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 But since we belong to the day, we must stay sober and put on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation for our helmet.
\v 9 For God did not destine us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.
\v 10 It is he who died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.
\v 11 Therefore comfort one another and build each other up, just as you are already doing.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In verses 8-10 the word "we" refers to all believers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])

  * **we belong to the day** - Paul speaks of knowing the truth about God as belonging to the day. AT: "we know the truth" or "we have received the light of truth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **we must stay sober** - Paul compares being sober to exercising self-control. AT: "let us exercise self-control" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **put on faith and love as a breastplate** - As a soldier would put on a breastplate to protect his body, a believer who lives by faith and love will find protection. AT: "protect ourselves with faith and love" or "protect ourselves by trusting Christ and loving him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the certainty of future salvation for our helmet** - As a helmet protects a soldier's head, assurance of salvation protects the believer. AT: "protect ourselves by being certain that Christ will save us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **whether we are awake or asleep** - These are polite ways of saying alive or dead. AT: "whether we are alive or dead" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **build each other up** - Here "build" is a metaphor that means encourage. AT: "encourage each other" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
