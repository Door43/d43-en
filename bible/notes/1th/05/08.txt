\v 8 But we believers are people who \add should do what is right\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, so we must be self-controlled, \add as people\add* in the daytime \add are usually not drunk and are able to control what they do\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add As Roman soldiers protect themselves by\add* putting on breastplates and helmets \f + \ft metaphor \f*, we \add believers\add* must \add protect ourselves by continuing to\add* trust and love \add the Lord Jesus\add* and by continuing to confidently expect that he will save \add us from God's punishing us at the time when he will punish other people\add*.

\v 9 When God chose us, he did not plan for us to \add be people whom he will severely\add* punish \f + \ft metonymy \f*. On the contrary, \add he decided\add* that he would save us because of \add our trusting in what\add* our Lord Jesus Christ \add has done for us\add*.
\v 10 Jesus died \add to atone\f + \ft Or: pay \f*\add* for our \add sins\add* in order that we might be able to live together with him, whether we are alive \f + \ft metaphor \f* or whether we are dead \f + \ft euphemism \f* \add when he returns to earth\add*.
\v 11 Because \add you know that this is true\add*, continue to encourage\f + \ft Or: comfort \f* each other, as indeed you now are doing.

\v 8 But we believers are people who should do what is right, so we must be self-controlled, as people in the daytime are usually not drunk and are able to control what they do. As Roman soldiers protect themselves by putting on breastplates and helmets we believers must protect ourselves by continuing to trust and love the Lord Jesus and by continuing to confidently expect that he will save us from God's punishing us at the time when he will punish other people.


\p
\v 9 When God chose us, he did not plan for us to be people whom he will severely punish. On the contrary, he decided that he would save us because of our trusting in what our Lord Jesus Christ has done for us.
\v 10 Jesus died to atone for our sins in order that we might be able to live together with him, whether we are alive or whether we are dead when he returns to earth.
\v 11 Because you know that this is true, continue to encourage each other, as indeed you now are doing.

\v 8 But Let us, since we are of the day, be sober, put on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.
\v 9 For God did not appoint us to wrath, but to attainment of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
\v 10 who died for us, that, whether we are awake or asleep, we would live together with him.
\v 11 Therefore, comfort one another, and build each other up, even as also you already do.
