====== 1 Thessalonians 05 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

The end of this chapter forms a typical conclusion to a letter in the ancient Near East. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Day of the Lord ==
The exact time of the coming [[:en:obe:kt:dayofthelord|Day of the Lord]] will come as a surprise to the world. This is what the [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] "like a thief in the night" means. Because of this Christians are to be prepared for the coming of the Lord. 

== Quench the Spirit ==
This means to ignore the Holy Spirit's guidance and to ignore the work He is trying to do through you.
