===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **May our God** - "We pray that our God"

  * **Father himself** - the "himself" referring back to the "Father" is for emphasis.
  * **direct our way to you** - Paul is excluding the Thessalonians with the use of "our". (See [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **we also do** - The pronoun "we" refers to Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy but not the Thessalonians.
  * **May he do** - "We pray that God will do"
  * **at the coming of our Lord Jesus** - "when Jesus comes back to earth"
  * **with all his holy ones** - "with all those who belong to him" (UDB)
