\v 2 and we sent Timothy to you. You know that he is our close associate and also works for God by proclaiming the good news about Christ. Silas and I sent him in order that he would urge you to continue to strongly trust in Christ.
\v 3 We did not want any of you to think about turning away from Christ because of what you were suffering. You well know that God knew that others would mistreat us because of Christ.
