\v 3 We wanted that none \add of you\add* would consider turning away from Christ as a result of \add people\add* causing you to suffer. You know that \add God has\add* planned that \add we who trust in him will suffer like that when people do that to us who trust in him\add*.

\v 2 and we sent Timothy to you. You know that he is our close associate and also works for God by proclaiming the good news about Christ. Silas and I sent him in order that he would urge you to continue to strongly trust in Christ.
\v 3 We did not want any of you to think about turning away from Christ because of what you were suffering. You well know that God knew that others would mistreat us because of Christ.

\v 1 Therefore, when we could no longer bear it, we thought it was good to be left behind at Athens alone.
\v 2 We sent Timothy, our brother and Godâ€™s minister in the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and comfort you regarding your faith,
\v 3 that no one would be disturbed by these afflictions, for yourselves know that for this we are appointed.
