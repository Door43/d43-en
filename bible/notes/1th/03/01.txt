\v 3 We did not want any of you to think about turning away from Christ because of what you were suffering. You well know that God knew that others would mistreat us because of Christ.

\v 1 Therefore, when we could no longer bear it, we thought it was good to be left behind at Athens alone.
\v 2 We sent Timothy, our brother and God’s minister in the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and comfort you regarding your faith,
\v 3 that no one would be disturbed by these afflictions, for yourselves know that for this we are appointed.
