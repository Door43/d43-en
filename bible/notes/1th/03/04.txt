\v 4 Remember that when we were present with you, we kept telling you that we would be persecuted \f + \ft Or:that \add people\add* would cause us to suffer \f*. And because that is what happened, you know that \add what we said\add* was true!
\v 5 \add I was\add* afraid that \add Satan\add*, the one who tempts us, had caused you \add to stop trusting in Christ. If that had happened\add*, we would have worked uselessly \add while we were present with you! So\add* I sent \add Timothy to you\add* in order to find out whether or not you were \add still\add* trusting \add in Christ\add*. I sent him because I could no longer endure \add not knowing about your spiritual condition\f + \ft Or: whether or not you were still trusting in Christ\add* \f*.

\v 4 Remember that when we were present with you, we kept telling you that others would mistreat us. And this is what happened!
\v 5 This is why I sent Timothy to you: because I wanted so badly to know whether you were still trusting in Christ. I was afraid that Satan, the one who tempts us, had caused you to stop trusting in Christ. I was afraid that everything we had done with you was useless.

\v 4 Truly, when we were with you, we told you in advance that we were about to suffer affliction, and it came about, as you know.
\v 5 For this reason, when I could no longer stand it, I sent that I might know about your faith, lest somehow the tempter had tempted you and our labor would be in vain.
