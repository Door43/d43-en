\v 13 This is why we always thank God, because when you heard the message that we told to you, you accepted it as the true message, the good message that God gave to us. We ourselves did not invent it. We also thank God that he is changing your lives because you trust this message.

\v 13 For this reason we also thank God constantly, that, when you received from us the word of the message, the word of God, you accepted it not as the word of man, but, as it truly is, the word of God, that also works in you who believe.
