<usfm>
\v 10 Both you and God know that we lived toward you believers in a very good and right way—in a way that no one could criticize.
\v 11 You know also that we behaved toward each one of you as a father who loves his children behaves toward them.
\v 12 We kept strongly exhorting and encouraging you to live like God's people should, because he has called you to become his people to whom he will show himself as king with the most wonderful power.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 You are witnesses, and God also, how holy, righteous, and blameless was our behavior toward you who believe.
\v 11 In the same way you know how we dealt with each one of you as a father deals with his own children. 
\v 12 We were begging you and encouraging and urging you to walk in a manner that is worthy of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.
