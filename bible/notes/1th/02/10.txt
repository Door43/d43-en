===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 Both you and God know that we lived toward you believers in a very good and right way—in a way that no one could criticize.
\v 11 You know also that we behaved toward each one of you as a father who loves his children behaves toward them.
\v 12 We kept strongly exhorting and encouraging you to live like God's people should, because he has called you to become his people to whom he will show himself as king with the most wonderful power.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 You are witnesses, and God also, how holy, righteously, and blamelessly we behaved ourselves to you who believe,
\v 11 just as you know how with each one of you, as a father with his own children, we exhorted and encouraged you and testified
\v 12 that you should walk in a manner that is worthy of God, who calls you to his own kingdom and glory.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **holy, righteously, and blamelessly** - Paul uses three words that mean basically the same thing to emphasize that they behaved in a very good way. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **father with his own children** - Paul compares how a father teaches his children to behave to how they exhorted and encouraged the believers to walk in a manner that is worthy of God.
  * **we exhorted and encouraged you** - The words "exhorted" and "encouraged" mean basically the same thing. Paul uses them to emphasize how passionately they encouraged the Thessalonians. AT: "we strongly encouraged you." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **to his own kingdom and glory** - The word "glory" describes the word "kingdom." AT: "to his own glorious kingdom." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hendiadys]])
