<usfm>
\v 10 Both you and God know that we lived toward you believers in a very good and right way—in a way that no one could criticize.
\v 11 You know also that we behaved toward each one of you as a father who loves his children behaves toward them.
\v 12 We kept strongly exhorting and encouraging you to live like God's people should, because he has called you to become his people to whom he will show himself as king with the most wonderful power.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 You are witnesses, and God also, how holy, righteously, and blamelessly we behaved ourselves toward you who believe.
\v 11 In the same way, you know how with each one of you, as a father with his own children, we exhorted and encouraged you. We testified
\v 12 that you should walk in a manner that is worthy of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **holy, righteously, and blamelessly** - Paul uses three words that focus on how they behaved in a very good way toward the Thessalonian believers.
  * **a father with his own children** - Paul compares how a father teaches his children to behave to how Paul's team exhorted and encouraged the believers to walk in a manner that is worthy of God.
  * **we exhorted and encouraged you** - The words "exhorted" and "encouraged" express how passionately Paul's group encouraged the Thessalonians. AT: "we strongly encouraged you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **into his own kingdom and glory** - The word "glory" describes the word "kingdom." AT: "into his own glorious kingdom." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hendiadys]])
