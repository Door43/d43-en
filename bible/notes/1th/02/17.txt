\v 17 My fellow believers, when for a short time \f + \ft idiom \f* \add those people forced us to be separated\add* from you, \add we felt like parents\add* who had lost all their children\f + \ft Or: whose children had died \f* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add Although\add* we were far away from you, \add we were still\add* emotionally \add concerned about you\add*, and we strongly desired to be present with you.
\v 18 \add You can know that\add* we wanted to return to you. Indeed I, Paul, \add tried to return\add* twice \f + \ft idiom \f*. But \add we did not return because\add* each time Satan \add prevented us from returning\add*.
\v 19 \add We were strongly desiring to be with you\add*, because truly you \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add are the ones about whom we are proud and are joyful!\add* It is because we are confident that you \add will\add* \add remain faithful\f + \ft Or: continue believing in God\add* \f* that we \add will be\add* joyful! You are the ones who we confidently expect \add will keep strongly trusting in God!\add* It is because you \add will\add* \add remain faithful\f + \ft Or: continue believing in God\add* \f* that we \add will\add* be proud \add of the work that we have done\add* \f + \ft metaphor, rhetorical question \f* \add when\add* our Lord Jesus \add examines what we all have done, at the time\add* when he comes back \add to earth!\add*
\v 20 Indeed, it is because of you that \add even now we\add* are pleased and are joyful!

\v 17 My fellow believers, when we had to be away from you for a short time, we felt like parents who had lost their children. We strongly desired to be present with you.
\v 18 Indeed I, Paul, tried to return twice to see you. But each time Satan prevented us from returning.
\v 19 Indeed, it is because of you that we hope to do God's work well; it is you who make us happy; it is because of you that we hope to succeed in serving God. It is because of you as well as others that we hope that the Lord Jesus will reward us when he returns to earth.
\v 20 Indeed, it is because of you that even now we are pleased and are joyful!

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 17 We, brothers, were separated from you for a short time, in presence, not in heart, and we did our best with great desire to see your face,
\v 18 because we wished to come to you, I Paul once and again, but Satan hindered us.
\v 19 For what is our confidence for the future, or joy, or crown of glorying—is it not you just as much as others—before our Lord Jesus at his coming?
\v 20 For you are our glory and our joy.
</usfm>
