====== 1 Thessalonians 02:14-16 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 My fellow believers, we \add know that you sincerely believed the message from God\add*, because the manner in which you acted was just like the manner in which \add the congregations\add* in Judea acted. They also \add worship\add* God, \add and they\add* \add have a close relationship with\f + \ft Or: are united to\add* \f* Christ Jesus. Specifically, you endured it \add when\add* your own countrymen \add mistreated you because you believe the message from God\add*, in the same manner that those \add Jewish believers in Judea\add* endured it \add when\add* the Jews \add who do not believe in Christ mistreated them\add*.
\v 15 \add Unbelieving Jews are\add* the ones whom God considers guilty \add for\add* killing the Lord Jesus, as well as \add for killing\add* many prophets. Other unbelieving Jews forced us to leave \add many towns\add*. They really make God angry; and \add they are\add* opposed to \add what is best for\add* all human beings!
\v 16 \add Specifically\add*, when we tell \add the good message\add* to non-Jewish people in order that they can be saved \f + \ft Or:\add that God\add* will save them \f* \add spiritually\add*, these \add unbelieving Jews\add* try to stop, Or: prevent us from doing that. Because they continually sin more and more, they are almost reaching the limit that has been \add set by God\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*! \add God\add* will soon punish them \f + \ft metonymy \f*, at last, for all their sins!

\v 14 We are certain about these things, because you acted just like the groups of believers in Judea acted. They also are joined to Christ Jesus, and, just as they endured it when their fellow countrymen mistreated them because of Christ, in the same way you have endured it when your own fellow countrymen mistreat you.
\v 15 Those Jews had killed the Lord Jesus and many prophets, too. Other unbelieving Jews forced us to leave many towns. They really make God angry; and they work against what is best for all human beings!
\v 16 For example, they try to stop us from telling the good news to non-Jews; they do not want God to save them! They have sinned almost as much as God will allow them to before he punishes them at last!

<usfm>
\v 14 For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God that are in Judea in Christ Jesus, for you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, as they did from the Jews,
\v 15 who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out, and who do not please God but are hostile to all people.
\v 16 They forbid us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved, to always fill up their sins. Wrath has come on them to the uttermost.
