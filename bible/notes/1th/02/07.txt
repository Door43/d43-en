\v 7 although we could have demanded \add that you should honor\f + \ft Or: respect \f* us\add*, because we are apostles \add who represent\add* \f + \ft Or: \add speak for\add* \f* Christ. On the contrary, we were gentle when we were among you, as a mother \add gently\add* takes care of her own children \f + \ft simile \f*.
\v 8 So, because we love you, we were delighted to personally tell you the good message that God \add gave us\add*. But also we were delighted to lovingly do all that we could do to help you \f + \ft synecdoche \f* because you had become very dear to us\f + \ft Or: we had begun to love you very much \f*.
\v 9 My fellow believers, you remember that we worked very hard \f + \ft doublet \f* \add in order to\add* \add support ourselves\f + \ft Or: earn money to buy what we needed\add* \f* \add while we were with you\add*. We worked \add during the\add* day and \add also at\add* night in order that we would not have to ask any one of you to give us what we needed, \add while\add* we proclaimed to you the good message that God \add gave us\add*.

\v 7 On the contrary, we were gentle when we were among you, as a mother gently takes care of her own children.
\v 8 So, because we love you, we were delighted to personally tell you the good message that God gave us. But also we were delighted to do all that we could do to help you because we began to love you very much.
\v 9 My fellow believers, you remember that we worked hard during the day and also at night. This is how we earned money, so that we would not have to ask any one of you to give us what we needed. We did this while we proclaimed to you the good news about God.

\v 7 Instead, we were as gentle among you as when a mother comforts her own children.
\v 8 Thus we had affection for you; we were pleased to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives, because you had become very dear to us.
\v 9 For you remember, brothers, our labor and toil: we worked night and day that we might not be a burden to any of you, as we preached to you the gospel of God.
