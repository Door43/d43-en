\v 8 So, because we love you, we were delighted to personally tell you the good message that God \add gave us\add*.

\v 7 On the contrary, we were gentle when we were among you, as a mother gently takes care of her own children.
\v 8 So, because we love you, we were delighted to personally tell you the good message that God gave us. But also we were delighted to do all that we could do to help you because we began to love you very much.
\v 9 My fellow believers, you remember that we worked hard during the day and also at night. This is how we earned money, so that we would not have to ask any one of you to give us what we needed. We did this while we proclaimed to you the good news about God.

\v 7 Instead, we were as gentle among you as a mother comforting her own children.
\f + \ft Some other versions read, \fqa Instead, we were like babies among you, as when a mother comforts her own children. \fqa* \f*

\v 8 In this way we had affection for you. We were pleased to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives. For you had become very dear to us.
\v 9 For you remember, brothers, our labor and toil. Night and day we were working so that we might not weigh down any of you. During that time, we preached to you the gospel of God.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **as a mother comforting her own children** - Just as a mother gently comforts her children, so Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy spoke gently to the Thessalonian believers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **In this way we had affection for you** - "This is how we demonstrated our affection for you"
  * **we had affection for you** - "we loved you"
  * **We were pleased to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives** - Paul speaks of the gospel message and his life and the lives of those with him as if they were a physical object that one could share with others. AT: "We were pleased not only to tell you the gospel of God but also to spend time with you and to help you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you had become very dear to us** - "we cared for you deeply"
  * **brothers** - Here this means fellow Christians, including both men and women.
  * **our labor and toil** - The words "labor" and "toil" mean basically the same thing. Paul uses them to emphasize how hard they worked. AT: "how hard we worked" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Night and day we were working so that we might not weigh down any of you** - "We worked hard to make our own living so you would not need to support us"
