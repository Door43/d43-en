=== What is the Book of 1 Thessalonians about? ===

Paul wrote this letter to the believers in the city of Thessalonica after he had been forced by Jewish riots to suddenly leave the city. In this letter, he explains that in spite of that event, he viewed his visit to them as a success. 

Paul is also responding in this letter to news about the Thessalonian believers that Timothy had brought him. He encourages the believers to live in a way that honors God, and in a way that they will be ready for Jesus Christ when he comes again in triumph.

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “1 Thessalonians” or "First Thessalonians." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul's First Letter to the Church in Thessalonica,” or “The First Letter to the Christians in Thessalonica.” (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])


===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== What is the "second coming" of Jesus? ===

The Book of 1 Thessalonians focuses on Jesus' eventual return to Earth. At this time, Christ will judge all mankind; he will also begin his full rule as king, bringing peace to all creation.

=== What happens to those who die before the return of Christ? ===

  * "Instead, we were as gentle among you as when a mother comforts her own children." (2:7) The ULB, UDB, and most other modern versions have this reading. A few modern versions read, Instead, we were like babies among you, as when a mother comforts her own children."
  * "Timothy, our brother and fellow worker for God." (3:2) The ULB, UDB, and many other modern versions have this reading. Some other versions have this reading: "Timothy, our brother and servant of God."
