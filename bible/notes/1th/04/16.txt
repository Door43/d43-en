\v 16 I write this, because it is the Lord Jesus himself who will descend from heaven. When he comes down, he will command all of us believers to rise. The chief angel will shout with a loud voice, and another angel will blow a trumpet for God. Then the first thing that will happen is that the people who are joined to Christ will live again.
\v 17 After that, God will take up into the clouds all of us believers who are still living on this earth. He will take us and those other believers who have died, in order that we all might together meet the Lord Jesus in the sky. As a result of that, we all will be with him forever.
\v 18 Because all this is true, encourage each other by sharing this teaching with each other.

\v 16 For the Lord himself will descend from heaven, with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.
\v 17 Then we who are alive, who are left, will together with them be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord.
\v 18 Therefore, comfort one another with these words.
