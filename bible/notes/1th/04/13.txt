\v 13 My fellow believers, we also want you to understand well \f + \ft litotes \f* \add what will happen\add* to our fellow believers \add who now\add* are dead \f + \ft euphemism \f*. \add You must not be\f + \ft Or: do \f* like\add* the unbelievers. They \add grieve deeply for people who die because\add* they do not confidently expect \add people to live again after they die\add*.
\v 14 We \add believers\add* know that it is true that Jesus died and that he rose \add to live\add* again. So \add we also know well that\add* God \add will cause\add* those \add believers\add* who died \f + \ft euphemism \f* \add to live again\add*. \add We know that he\add* will cause them to go \add to heaven\add* \f + \ft Or: come \f* with Jesus as a result of God's \add commanding them to arise and\add* \add go to\f + \ft Or: come with\add* \f* \add Jesus\add*.
\v 15 \add I write this\add* because the Lord \add Jesus\add* revealed \add to me\add* what I am now telling you. \add Some of you may think that\add* when the Lord \add Jesus\add* comes back, he will consider that we \add believers\add* who are still living will be superior to those \add believers\add* who have died \f + \ft euphemism \f*, because \add we will meet Jesus first. That is certainly not true!\add*

\v 13 My fellow believers, we also want you to understand what will happen to our fellow believers who now are dead. You must not be like the unbelievers. They grieve deeply for people who die because they do not expect to live again after they die.
\v 14 We believers know that Jesus died and that he rose to live again. So we also know well that God will cause those joined to Jesus to live again, and that he will bring them back with Jesus.
\v 15 I write this because the Lord Jesus revealed to me what I am now telling you. Some of you may think that when the Lord Jesus comes back, we believers who are still living will meet Jesus sooner than those who have already died. That is certainly not true!

\v 13 We do not want you to misunderstand, brothers, about those who sleep, so that you do not grieve like the rest who do have no certainty of the future.
\v 14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him.
\v 15 For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left at the coming of the Lord, will surely not precede those who have fallen asleep.
