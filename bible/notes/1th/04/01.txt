\v 1-2 Now, my fellow believers, I want to write about some other matters. I urge you—and when I urge you, it is the same as the Lord Jesus himself urging you—to conduct your lives in a way that pleases God. We taught you to do that because of what the Lord Jesus had told us to say. We know that you are conducting your lives that way, but we strongly urge that you do that even more.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **we encourage and exhort you** - Here the word "we" refers to Paul, Timothy and Silvanus but not the Thessalonians. The words "encourage" and "exhort" mean basically the same thing. Paul uses them to emphasize how strongly they encourage them. AT: "we strongly encourage you" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **you received instructions from**  - "you were taught by"
  * **you must walk**  - "Walk" is an expression for the way one is to live. Alternate Translation: "you ought to live." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
