\v 9 I want to urge you again that you should love your fellow believers. You do not really need that anyone write to you about that, because God has already taught you how to love each other,
\v 10 and because you already are showing that you love your fellow believers who live in other places in your province of Macedonia. Nevertheless, my fellow believers, we urge you to love each other more and more.
\v 11 We urge you also to try hard to attend to your own affairs and to not meddle with the affairs of others. We urge you also to work at your own occupations to earn what you need to live. Remember that we taught you previously to live like that.
\v 12 If you do these things, unbelievers will acknowledge that you behave decently, and you will not have to depend on others to supply what you need.

\v 9 Regarding brotherly love you have no need for anyone to write to you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another.
\v 10 Indeed, you do it to all the brothers who are in all Macedonia, but we exhort you, brothers, that you do it even more.
\v 11 We also exhort you to aspire to be quiet, mind your own business, and work with your hands, just as we commanded you.
\v 12 Do this so that you may walk properly in respect to those who are outside the faith, and so that you may have need of nothing.
