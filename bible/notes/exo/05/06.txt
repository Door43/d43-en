\v 6 That same day the king commanded the Egyptian slave bosses and the \add Israelite\add* men supervising the slaves,
\v 7 "Do not continue to give the \add Israelite\add* people straw for making bricks, as you have done previously. Make them go \add into the fields\add* and gather straw for themselves.
\v 8 But require them to make the same number of bricks that they did before. Do not decrease the number at all. They are lazy\f + \ft Or: do not have enough work to do \f*. That is the reason they are asking me to let them go \add into the desert\add* to offer sacrifices to their god.
\v 9 Force the men to work harder, so that they will not \add have time\add* to listen to lies \add from their leaders\add*!"

\v 6 That same day the king commanded the Egyptian slave bosses and the Israelite assistants who directed the slaves,
\v 7 "Do not give the Israelite people straw for making bricks, unlike what you have done before. Make them go into the fields and gather straw for themselves.
\v 8 However, still force them to make the same number of bricks that they did before. Do not lower the number at all. They do not want to work. That is the reason they are asking me to let them go into the wilderness to worship their god.
\v 9 Make the men work harder so that they will not have time to listen to lies from their leaders!"

\v 6 On that same day, Pharaoh gave a command to the people's taskmasters and foremen. He said,
\v 7 "You must no longer give the people straw to make bricks, unlike before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves.
\v 8 However, you must still demand from them the  same number of the bricks as they made before. Do not demand any fewer, because they are lazy. That is why they are crying out and saying, 'Allow us to go and sacrifice to our God.'
\v 9 Increase the workload for the men so that they keep at it and pay no more attention to deceptive words."
