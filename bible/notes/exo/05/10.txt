===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **taskmasters** - “slave drivers” or “masters.” These were Egyptians whose job was to force the Israelites to do hard work.
  * **I will no longer give you any straw … get straw wherever you can find it**  - The word "you" in these verses is plural and refers to the Israelite people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you|Forms of You]])
  * **your workload will not be reduced**  - AT: "you must continue to make the same number of bricks as before"
