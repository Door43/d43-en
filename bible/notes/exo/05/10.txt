===== translationNotes: =====

  * **taskmasters** - "slave drivers." These were Egyptians whose job was to force the Israelites to do hard work. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:01:11|1:11]].
  * **I will no longer give you any straw ... get straw wherever you can find it** - The word "you" in these verses is plural and refers to the Israelite people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **You yourselves must go** - Here "yourselves" emphasizes that the Egyptians will no longer help them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_rpronouns]])
  * **your workload will not be reduced** - This statement is used to emphasize the opposite of what is said. AT: "you must continue to make the same number of bricks as before" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
