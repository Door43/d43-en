\v 12 So the people scattered throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.
\v 13 The taskmasters kept urging them and saying, "Finish your work, just as when straw was given to you."
\v 14 Pharaoh’s taskmasters beat the Israelite foremen, those same men whom they had put in charge of the workers. The taskmasters kept asking them, "Why have you not produced all the  bricks required of you, either yesterday and today, as you used to do in the past?"

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **all the land of Egypt**  - This is not to be understood literally. AT: "throughout a wide area" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole|Hyperbole]])
  * **taskmasters** - “slave drivers” or “masters.” These were Egyptians whose job was to force the Israelites to do hard work.
  * **stubble**  - "the part of a plant that is left over after harvest"
  * **Why have you not produced all the bricks required of you**  - Using a question here shows that the taskmasters were angry and harsh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
