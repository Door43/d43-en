\v 12 So the people scattered throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.
\v 13 The taskmasters kept urging them and saying, "Finish your work, just as when straw was given to you."
\v 14 Pharaoh's taskmasters beat the Israelite foremen, those same men whom they had put in charge of the workers. The taskmasters kept asking them, "Why have you not produced all the bricks required of you, either yesterday and today, as you used to do in the past?"
