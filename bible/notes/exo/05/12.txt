===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **stubble for straw**  - Stubble is the part of the plant left over after harvest, which may involve having to chop it up, too.
  * **Why have you not produced all the bricks required of you …?**  - These remarks in form of a question show that the angry slave bosses' scolding was especially harsh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
