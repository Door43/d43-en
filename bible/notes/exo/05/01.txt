  * **festival for me**  - This is a celebration to worship Yahweh.
  * **"Who is Yahweh? Why should I ... let Israel go?"**  - These questions are used to show Pharaoh's contempt of Yahweh and that he has no interest in Yahweh or in letting the Israelites go to worship him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **listen to his voice**  - The phrase "his voice" is used to refer to what he says. AT: "listen to what he says" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
