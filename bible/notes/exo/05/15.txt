\v 15 Then the Israelite supervisors went to the king and complained, saying "\add Your Majesty\add*, why are you treating us this way?
\v 16 \add Now\add* they are not giving us any straw \add for making bricks\add*, but they keep commanding us to make bricks. And now sometimes they beat us. But it is the fault of your own slave bosses \add that we cannot make as many bricks as before\add*!"
\v 17 But the king said, "You are lazy and do not \add want to\add* work! That is why you keep saying, 'Allow us to go \add to the desert\add* and offer sacrifices to Yahweh.'
\v 18 So go and get back to work! \add We\add* are not going to give you any straw, but you must keep making the same number of bricks!"

\v 15 Then the Israelite assistants went to the king and cried out, "Your Majesty, why are you treating us this way?
\v 16 Now they are not giving us any straw for making bricks, but they keep telling us to make more bricks. And they beat us. But it is because of your own slave bosses that we cannot make as many bricks as before!"
\v 17 But the king said, "You are lazy and do not want to work! That is why you keep saying, 'Allow us to go to the desert to worship Yahweh.'
\v 18 So get back to work! We are not going to give you any straw, but you must keep making the same number of bricks!"

\v 15 So the Israelite foremen came to Pharaoh and cried out to him. They said, "Why are you  treating your servants this way?
\v 16 No straw is being given to your servants anymore, but they are still telling us, 'Make bricks!' We, your servants, are even beaten now, but it is the fault of your own people."
\v 17 But Pharaoh said, "You are lazy! You are lazy! You say, 'Allow us to go sacrifice to Yahweh.'
\v 18 So now go back to work. No more straw will be given to you, but you must still make the same number of bricks."
