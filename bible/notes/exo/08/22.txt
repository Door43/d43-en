\v 22 But on that day I treat the land of Goshen differently, the land in which my people are living, so that no swarms of flies will be there. This will happen so that you may know that I am Yahweh in the midst of this land.
\v 23 I will make a distinction between my people and your people. This sign of my power will take place tomorrow."'"
