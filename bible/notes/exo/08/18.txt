\v 18 The magicians tried with their magic to produce gnats, but they could not. There were gnats on man and beast.
\v 19 Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, "This is the finger of God." But Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, so he refused to listen to them. It was just as Yahweh had said Pharaoh would do.
