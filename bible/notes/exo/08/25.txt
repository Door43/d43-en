\v 25 Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron and said, "Go, sacrifice to your God in our own land."
\v 26 Moses said, "It is not right for us to do so, for the  sacrifices we make to Yahweh our God are something disgusting to the Egyptians. If we make sacrifices right before their eyes that are disgusting to the Egyptians, will they not stone us?
