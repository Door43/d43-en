\v 25 So Moses prayed to Yahweh. Then Yahweh showed him a tree. So he took one of the branches and threw it into the water, and the water became good to drink. There at Marah, Yahweh gave them a fixed rule by which to live. He also tested them there to determine if they would obey him.
\v 26 He said, "I am Yahweh, your God. If you will obey me when I speak to you and do those things that are right to me, and listen to all the things that I tell you, I will keep you from all the diseases that I brought on the Egyptians. Do not forget that I am Yahweh, the one who heals you."

\v 24 So the people complained to Moses and said, "What can we drink?"
\v 25 Moses cried out to Yahweh, and Yahweh showed him a tree. Moses threw it into the water, and the water became sweet to drink. It was there that Yahweh gave them a strict law, and it was there that he tested them.
\v 26 He said, "If you will listen carefully to my voice, I, Yahweh your God, and do what is right in my eyesâ€”and if you pay attention to my commandments and obey all my laws, I will put on you none of the diseases that I 
put on the Egyptians; for I am Yahweh, who heals you."
