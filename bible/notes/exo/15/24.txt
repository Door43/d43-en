<usfm> \v 24 So the people complained to Moses and said, "What can we drink?" \v 25 Moses cried out to Yahweh, and Yahweh showed him a tree. Moses threw it into the water, and the water became sweet to drink. It was there that Yahweh gave them a strict law, and it was there that he tested them. \v 26 He said, "If you will diligently listen carefully to my voice, I, Yahweh your God, and do what is right in my eyes—and if you pay attention to my commandments and obey all my laws, I will put on you none of the diseases that I put on the Egyptians; for I am Yahweh, who heals you." </usfm>
