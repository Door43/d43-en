===== translationNotes: =====

  * **You will bring them** - Where God would bring them can be stated clearly. Since Moses was not already in Canaan, some languages would use "take" rather than "bring." AT: "You will take your people to Canaan" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_go]])
  * **plant them on the mountain** - Moses speaks about God giving his people the land to live in as if they were a tree that God was planting. AT: "settle them on the mountain" or "let them live on the mountain" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the mountain of your inheritance** - This refers to Mount Zion in the land of Canaan.
  * **of your inheritance** - "that you have given them as an inheritance." Moses speaks about God promising to give his people the mountain forever as if he were giving it to them as an inheritance. AT: "that you promised to give them forever" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **that your hands have built** - The phrase "your hands" refers to God's power. This refers to something God would do in the future. AT: "that you have built by your power" or "that you will build by your power" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pastforfuture]])
