<usfm>
\v 20 On the lampstand itself, the central shaft, there were four cups made like almond blossoms, with their leafy bases and the flowers.
\v 21 There was a leafy base under the first pair of branches—made as one piece with it, and a leafy base under the second pair of branches—also made as one piece with it. In the same way there was a leafy base under the third pair of branches, made as one piece with it. It was the same for all six branches extending out from the lampstand.
\v 22 Their leafy bases and branches were all one piece with it, one beaten piece of work of pure gold.
