\v 33 On the bottom hem, you must make pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn all around. Gold bells must be between them all around.
\v 34 There must  be a golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate—and so on—all around the hem of the robe.
\v 35 The robe is to be on Aaron when he serves, so that its sound can be heard when he goes into the holy place before Yahweh and when he leaves. This is so that he does not die.
