===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues to tell Moses what the people must do.
   * **on his heart** - "over his heart" or "on his chest"
   * **the Urim and the Thummim** - It not clear what these are. They were objects that the priest used to determine somehow the will of God. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
