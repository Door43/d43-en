\v 36 You must make a plate of pure gold and engrave on it, like the engraving on a signet, HOLY TO YAHWEH.
\v 37 You must attach this plate by a blue cord to the front of the turban.
\v 38 It must be on Aaron's forehead; he must always bear any guilt that might attach to the offering of the holy gifts that the Israelites consecrated. The turban must be always on his forehead so that Yahweh may accept their gifts.
