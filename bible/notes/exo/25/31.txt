\v 31 You must make a lampstand of pure hammered gold. The lampstand is to be made with its base and shaft. Its cups, its leafy bases, and its flowers are to be all made of one piece with it.
\v 32 Six branches must extend out from its sides—three branches must extend from one side, and three branches of the lampstand must extend from the other side.
