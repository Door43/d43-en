\v 35 There must be a leafy base under the first pair of branches—made as one piece with it, and a leafy base under the second pair of branches—also made as one piece with it. In the same way there must be a leafy base under the third pair of branches, made as one piece with it. It must be the same for all six branches extending out from the lampstand.
\v 36 Their leafy bases and branches must all be one piece with it, one beaten piece of work of pure gold.
