===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues to tell Moses what the people must do.
  * **sanctuary...tabernacle** - Here these words mean the same thing.
  * **You must make it** - Here "you" is plural and refers to Moses and the people of Israel. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **show you in the plans**  - "show you in the design" or "show you in the pattern." Here "you" is singular and refers to Moses.
