  * **It is at the ark that I will meet with you** - "I will meet with you at the ark." In 25:22 the word "you" is singular and refers to Moses. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **atonement lid** - This is the lid that sits on top of the ark where the atonement offering was made. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:25:15|25:17]].
