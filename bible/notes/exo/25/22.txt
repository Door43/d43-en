===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues to speak to Moses.
  * **It is at the ark that I will meet with you** - "I will meet with you at the ark." In 25:22 the word "you" is singular and refers to Moses. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **atonement lid** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:exo:25:15|25:17]].
