== The tent of meeting ==
This chapter gives specific instructions regarding the building of a tent where Moses would meet Yahweh and the ark would be stored. This would eventually become the tabernacle. It was to be considered a very holy place. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:tabernacle]] and [[:en:obe:kt:holy]])
