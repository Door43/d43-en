\v 6 When that happens, people all over Egypt will lament loudly. They will lament more loudly than they ever have lamented before and more than they ever will again.
\v 7 But among the Israelite people it will be so quiet that not even a dog will bark! Then you will know for sure that I, Yahweh, am treating the Egyptians differently from the Israelites.'
\v 8 Then all these officials of yours will come and bow down before me and will say, 'Please get out of Egypt, you and all the Israelite people!' After that, we will leave Egypt!" When Moses had said that, he left the king very angrily.

\v 6 Then there will be a great wailing throughout all the land of Egypt, such as has never been nor ever will be again.
\v 7 But not even a dog will bark against any of the people of Israel, against either man or beast. In this way you will know that I am treating the Egyptians and the Israelites differently.'
\v 8 All these servants of yours, Pharaoh, will come down to me and bow down to me. They will say, 'Go, you and all the people who follow you!' After that I will go out." Then he went out from Pharaoh in great anger.
