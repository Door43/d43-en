**What is the Book of Exodus about?**  \\ 
Exodus appears to be a continuation of the previous book, Genesis. The first half of Exodus is about Israel’s creation as a nation that was meant to live in close relationship to Yahweh. The second half of Exodus describes how the Israelites received the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|Law of God]] to guide them in this process. 

Exodus also includes instructions about how to build the [[:en:obe:kt:tabernacle|Tabernacle]], the tent of worship that the people of Israel would carry with them through the wilderness. Exodus is also about how they ended up spending forty years in the wilderness before entering the [[:en:obe:kt:promisedland|Promised Land]].   

**How should the title of this book be translated?**\\
These titles often describe the author or audience of the biblical book. Many titles summarize the contents of the book. It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or to follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]). Exodus means "exit" or "departure."

“Exodus” means “departure” or "the going away," so translators should express in their title this idea. Titles such as “About the Israelites Leaving Egypt” may be suitable. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]].)

**Who wrote the Book of Exodus?**
The writers of both the Old and New Testament present Moses as being closely associated with creating the book of Exodus.

**What is the significance of deliverance of God's people in the Book of Exodus?**  \\ Deliverance is a key theme in the book of Exodus because it shows God as the creator and savior of his people. After the time of the patriarchs, God has now metaphorically given birth to the nation of Israel as his special, chosen people. After their production of the golden calf, God becomes more directive in his relationship with Israel. This is also due to God's holiness and Israel's inability to rightly worship Yahweh.

**How does the Book of Exodus relate to the fulfillment of the promises given to Abraham?**  \\ Exodus begins to show the fulfillment of the promise that Abraham would have many descendants. These descendants start to become a great nation in Exodus. God makes additional arrangements at Mount Sinai and puts them into the form of a covenant with the nation of Israel.

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

**What was the Jewish Passover?**\\
The Jewish Passover was a festival that the Israelites were commanded to celebrate every year in order to remember their people's departure from Egypt. The first Passover meal was eaten in the evening just before they left, and it became part of the covenant requirements that Yahweh gave them at Mount Sinai.

**What was the Law of Moses to the people of Israel?**\\
The Law of Moses was a set of instructions for the people of Israel which told them what Yahweh required them to do in order to participate in his covenant with them. The Law gave instructions for how the people should live in a way that would honor him. It also instructed them about their need to offer animal sacrifices for their sins, and for their need to maintain a right relationship with Yahweh. The Law gave instructions for how the priests should present the people's worship to Yahweh, and for how they should build the tabernacle, the place of worship that would be the center of Yahweh's presence among them.
 
**What did it mean that Israel was to be a "kingdom of priests and a holy nation?"**\\
Even though most nations in the time of Israel honored many gods, Israel was to worship only Yahweh. This fact was meant to make them very different from the other nations in the world. The entire nation was to honor Yahweh by living according to his standards.
===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

**Why are the details of the construction of the tabernacle in Exodus 25-32 repeated in Exodus 35-40?**\\
The first description of the construction of the tabernacle were God's specific instructions to Israel.  The details were repeated exactly to show that the people carefully followed God's plan.   

**Are the events in chronological order?**\\
While most of the events follow a chronological order, not all of the events are in a strict chronological sequence. Translators may have to be careful that they present in translation the unusual time relationships among various parts.  

**What does it mean that God "[[:en:obe:kt:life|lived]]" among his people?**\\
While God is present everywhere in the world, the Book of Exodus presents him as being among the people of Israel in order to guide them and in order that they would worship him with all their hearts.
