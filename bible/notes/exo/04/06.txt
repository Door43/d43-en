\v 6 Yahweh said to Moses, "Put your hand in your robe." Moses put his hand in his robe. When he brought his hand out, it had a disease that made the skin look white as snow.
\v 7 Then Yahweh said, "Put your hand in your robe again." Moses put his hand back inside his robe. This time when he brought it out, the disease was healed, and it looked like his other hand.

===== Translation Notes: =====



    * **as white as snow** - This is a [[en:ta:translate:simile]] which is one of the [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_intro]].  Snow is water that comes from very cold rain.   Because the snow is very cold, its consistency is like powdery flakes and is white in color (similar in color to baby powder or talcum powder that ladies often use to powder their noses).    Sometimes snow is present on the top of very tall mountains even in countries where it never is present in most places.    This verse could easily be translated "as white as talcum powder".   The color white also symbolizes purity and being free from sin and disease.    The "as white as snow" implies the purity of being free from the disease.
