\v 21 Yahweh said to Moses, "When you return to Egypt, be sure to do all the miracles that I have given you power to do in front of the king. But I will make him reject you, and he will not let the Israelite people leave Egypt.
\v 22 Then say to him, 'This is what Yahweh says: Israel is like my first born son,
\v 23 and I say to you, "Let my son go, so that he may worship me." But you did not let my son go and because of this, I will kill your firstborn son!'"

\v 21 Yahweh said to Moses, "When you go back to Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the wonders that I have put in your power. But I will harden his heart, and he will not let the people go.
\v 22 You must say to Pharaoh, 'This is what Yahweh says: Israel is my son, my first-born,
\v 23 and I say to you, "Let my son go, so he may worship me." But since you have refused to let him go, I will certainly kill your son, your first-born.'"
