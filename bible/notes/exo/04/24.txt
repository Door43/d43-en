\v 24 One night, as they were on the way to Egypt, Yahweh appeared to Moses in order to kill him.
\v 25 Then Moses' wife, Zipporah, took a knife and cut off the foreskin of their firstborn son. Then she touched the foreskin to Moses' feet and said, "You are a bridegroom of blood to me."
\v 26 Yahweh did not kill Moses. Zipporah said, "You are a bridegroom of blood to me" because of the circumcision.

\v 24 Now on the way, when they stopped for the night, Yahweh met Moses and tried to kill him.
\v 25 Then Zipporah took a flint knife and cut off the foreskin of her son, and touched it to Moses' feet. Then she said, "Surely you are a bridegroom to me by blood."
\v 26 So Yahweh let him alone. She said, "You are a bridegroom of blood" because of the circumcision.
