====== Exodus 04 General Notes ======



=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Moses does not understand ==
Although Moses believes in Yahweh, he does not trust in him. This is because Moses lacks understanding. Moses tries to believe the things he is asked to do are done by his own power. Yahweh is trying to get Moses to trust that these are are Yahweh's doing. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:believe]] and [[:en:obe:kt:trust]])

== Children of God ==
This chapter really introduces the concept that the people group Israel is the chosen people of God and God's children, possibly God's firstborn children. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:elect]], [[:en:obe:kt:peopleofgod]] and [[:en:obe:kt:firstborn]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Yahweh harden Pharaoh's heart ==
Scholars are divided over how to understand this statement. There is debate over whether Pharaoh plays an active or passive role in the hardening of his own heart. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
