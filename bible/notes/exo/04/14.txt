\v 14 Then Yahweh became angry with Moses. He said, "What about Aaron, your brother, the Levite? I know that he can speak well. Moreover, he is coming to meet you, and when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.
\v 15 You will speak to him and put the words to say into his mouth. I will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and I will show you both what to do.
\v 16 He will speak to the people for you. He will be your mouth, and you will be to him like me, God.
\v 17 You will take in your hand this staff. With it you will do the signs."
