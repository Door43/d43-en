\v 9 If they do not believe you or do what you say, even \add after you perform\add* those two miracles, get some water from the Nile \add River\add* and pour it on the ground. \add When you do that\add*, the water from the river, the water that you pour on the ground, will become blood \f + \ft metonymy \f* \f + \ft Or: \add red like\add* blood \f*."

\v 8 Yahweh said, "You can do that in front of the Israelite people, too. If they do not believe you or listen to you after seeing the first miracle, they will believe you when you perform the second miracle.
\v 9 But if they do not believe you or listen to what you say even after you show them these two miracles, get some water from the Nile River and pour it on the dry ground. When you do that, the water that you pour on the dry ground will become blood."
