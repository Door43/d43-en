\v 10 Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* replied, "O Yahweh! I am not an eloquent \add speaker\add*! I was not an eloquent speaker before, and I have not become one since you started talking to me! I am not a good speaker \f + \ft metonymy \f*, and I speak very slowly."
\v 11 Then Yahweh said to him\f + \ft Or: me \f*, "\add You seem to forget\add* who it is that makes people able to speak \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*! Who is it that enables people to be unable to speak or unable to hear, or able to see or not to see? It is I, Yahweh \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*!
\v 12 So start going \add to Egypt\add*, and I will help you to speak \f + \ft metonymy \f*, and I will tell you what you should say."

\v 10 Then Moses said to Yahweh, "Oh Lord, I have never been good at speaking to people. I am still that way even after you began talking to me. I speak slowly and never know what to say."
\v 11 Then Yahweh said to him, "Who made a man's mouth? Who is it who makes a man able to speak, hear, see, or not see? Is it not I, Yahweh?
\v 12 So now go, and I will help you speak, and I will tell you what to say."
\v 13 But Moses replied, "Oh Lord, I ask you, please send someone else in my place!"

\v 10 Then Moses said to Yahweh, "Lord, I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant. I am slow of speech and slow of tongue."
\v 11 Yahweh said to him, "Who is it who made man’s mouth? Who makes a man mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, Yahweh?
\v 12 So now go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what to say."
\v 13 But Moses said, "Lord, please send anyone else, anyone whom you wish to send."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **eloquent**  - an excellent speaker
  * **I am slow of speech and slow of tongue**  - These two phrases mean about the same thing. Moses is saying that he cannot speak well or possibly clearly. He might be comparing his ability to the great orators/speakers he had heard in the Egyptian court. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet|Doublet]])
  * **"Who has made man’s mouth? Who makes a man mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, Yahweh?**  - By these questions Yahweh presses his point, showing his creative powers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **and I will be with your mouth**  - This means that God will give Moses the right words to speak at the right time. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom|Idiom]])
