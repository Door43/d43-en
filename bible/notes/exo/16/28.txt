  * **How long will you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws?** - God used this question to scold the people because they did not obey his laws. AT: "You people still do not keep my commandments and laws" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **to keep my commandments and my laws** - "to obey my commandments and my laws"
  * **Yahweh has given you the Sabbath** - Yahweh speaks about teaching people to rest on the Sabbath as if the Sabbath were a gift. AT: "I, Yahweh, have taught you to rest on the Sabbath" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **sixth day ... two days ... seventh day** - "day 6 ... 2 days ... day 7" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **bread** - God speaks of the food that he sent as if it were bread. The Israelites would eat this food every day, just as they had eaten bread every day before this.
