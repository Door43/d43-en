\v 13 That evening quails appeared, and there were so many that they covered the campsite. The next morning there was something like small drops of water all around the campsite.
\v 14 When the water dried up, on the ground there was a thin layer of something that looked like small white flakes. It looked like ice laying on the ground.
\v 15 When the Israelite people saw it, since they had never seen it before and did not know what it was, they said to each other, "What is it?" Moses replied to them, "It is something Yahweh has given you to eat, to take the place of bread.
