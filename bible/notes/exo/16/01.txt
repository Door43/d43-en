===== translationNotes: =====

  * **wilderness of Sin** - The word "Sin" here is the Hebrew name of the wilderness. It is not the English word "sin." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **on the fifteenth day of the second month** - This time coincides with the end of April and the beginning of May on Western calendars. AT: "on day 15 of the second month" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_hebrewmonths]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **The whole community of Israelites** - "All the Israelites." This is a generalization. Moses and Aaron did not complain. AT: "The Israelites" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **complained** - "were angry and spoke"
  * **If only we had died** - This is a way of saying that they wished that they had died. AT: "We wish that we had died"
  * **by Yahweh's hand** - The phrase "Yahweh's hand" represents Yahweh's action. AT: "by Yahweh's action" See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
