\v 4 Then Yahweh said to Moses, "I will rain down bread from heaven for you. The people will go out and gather a day's portion every day so that I may test them to see whether or not they will walk in my law.
\v 5 It will come about on the sixth day, that they will gather twice as much as what they gathered every day before, and they will cook what they bring in."
