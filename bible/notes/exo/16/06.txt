\v 6 Then Moses and Aaron said to all the people of Israel, "In the evening you will know that it is Yahweh who has brought you out from the land of Egypt.
\v 7 In the morning you will see Yahweh's glory, for he hears your complaining against him. Who are we for you to complain against us?"
\v 8 Moses also said, "You will know this when Yahweh gives you meat in the evening and bread in the morning  to the full—for he has heard the complaints that you speak against him. Who are Aaron and I? Your complaints are not against us; they are against Yahweh."
