===== translationNotes: =====

  * **It came about** - This phrase is used here to mark an important event in the story. The important event here is the people seeing Yahweh's glory. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **behold** - The word "behold" here shows that the people saw something interesting.
  * **bread** - God speaks of the food that he will send as if it were bread. The Israelites would eat this food every day, just as they had eaten bread every day before this. AT: "food" or "food like bread." See how you translated it in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:16:04|16:4]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
