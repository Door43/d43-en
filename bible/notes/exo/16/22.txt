\v 22 It came about that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each person. All the leaders of the community came and told this to Moses.
\v 23 He said to them, "This is what Yahweh has said: 'Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy Sabbath in Yahweh's honor. Bake what you want to bake, and boil what you want to boil. All that remains over, set it aside for yourselves until morning.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **It came about that** - This phrase is used here to mark the beginning of a new part of the story. Verses 16:22-30 tell about what the people did concerning the manna on the sixth and seventh days of the week. If your language has a way for marking this as a new part of the story, you could consider using it here.
  * **sixth day** - "on day 6" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **twice** - "two times" or "2 times" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **bread** - Moses writes of the food that God sent as if it were bread. The Israelites would eat this food every day, just as they had eaten bread every day before this. AT: "food" or "food like bread." See how you translated it in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:16:04|16:4]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **solemn** - "serious" or "quiet and thoughtful"
