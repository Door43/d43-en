\v 14 The stones were arranged by the names of Israel's twelve sons, each in order by name. They were like the engraving on a signet ring, each name standing for one of the twelve tribes.
\v 15 On the breastpiece they made chains like cords, braided work of pure gold.
\v 16 They made two settings of gold and two gold rings, and they attached the two rings to the two corners of the breastpiece.
