===== Translation Notes: =====

Bezalel's work crew continues to make the priestly garments.

  * **They set in it** - "The workers set in the breastpiece"
  * **precious stones** - Twelve very rare and expensive stones are listed. The are almost the same stone that are listed in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:28:17|28:17-20]]. Some languages may not have words of each of these stones. The important fact is that they were valuable, and different from one another. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **The stones were mounted in gold settings** - "They mounted the stones in gold settings" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
