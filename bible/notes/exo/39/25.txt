\v 25 They made bells of pure gold, and they put the bells between the pomegranates all around on the bottom edge the robe, between the pomegranates—
\v 26 a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate—on the edge of the robe for Aaron to serve in. This was as Yahweh had commanded Moses.

Bezalel's work crew continues to make the priestly garments.

  * **They made...commanded Moses** - For 39:25-26 see how you translated many of these words in [[en:bible:notes:exo:28:33|28:34-35]]
  * **a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate** - This is how the pattern is supposed to repeat all along the bottom edge of the robe.
