\v 3 But I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and I will display many signs of my power, many wonders, in the land of Egypt.
\v 4 But Pharaoh will not listen to you, so I will put my hand on Egypt and bring out my groups of fighting men, my people, the descendants  of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great acts of punishment.
\v 5 The Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh when I reach out with my hand on Egypt and bring out the Israelites from among them."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **many signs...many wonders** - The words "signs" and "wonders" mean basically the same thing. God uses them to emphasize the greatness of what he will do in Egypt. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **put my hand on...reach out with my hand** - The words "my hand" represent God's great power. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
