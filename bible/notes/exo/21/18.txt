\v 18 If men fight and one hits the other with a stone or with his fist, and that person does not die, but is confined to his bed;
\v 19 then if he recovers and is able to walk about using his staff, the man who struck him must pay for the loss of his time; he must also pay for his complete recovery. But that man is not guilty of murder.
