\p
\v 22 If men fight together and hurt a pregnant woman so that she miscarries, but there is no other injury to her, then the guilty man must surely be fined, if the womanâ€™s husband demands it from him, and he must pay as the judges determine.
\v 23 But if there is serious injury, then you must give a life for a life,
\v 24 an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, a foot for a foot,
\v 25 a burn for a burn, a wound for a wound, or a bruise for a bruise.
