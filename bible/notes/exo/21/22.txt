\v 22 Suppose two people are fighting and they hurt a pregnant woman with the result that she has a miscarriage\f + \ft Or: her baby is born prematurely and dies \f*. If the woman is not harmed in any other way, the one who injured her must pay a fine. He must pay whatever the woman's husband demands, after a judge approves of the fine.
\v 23 But if the woman is injured in some additional way, the one who injured her must be caused to suffer in exactly the same way \add that he caused her to suffer\add*. If she dies, he must be executed.
\v 24-25 If her eye is injured or destroyed, or if he knocks out one of her teeth, or her hand or foot is injured, or if she is burned or bruised, the one who injured her must be injured in the same way.

\v 22 If two people are fighting and they hurt a pregnant woman so that she has a miscarriage but the woman is not harmed in any other way, the one who hurt her must pay a fine. He must pay whatever the woman's husband asks after a judge approves of the fine.
\v 23 But if the woman is hurt in another way, the one who hurt her must be caused to suffer in the same way that he caused her to suffer. If she dies, he must be killed.
\v 24 If her eye is hurt, or if he knocks out her teeth, or her hand or foot is hurt,
\v 25 or if she is burned or bruised, the one who hurt her must be hurt in the same way.

\p
\v 22 If men fight together and hurt a pregnant woman so that she miscarries, but there is no other injury to her, then the guilty man must surely be fined as the woman's husband demands it from him, and he must pay as the judges determine.
\v 23 But if there is serious injury, then you must give a life for a life,
\v 24 an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, a foot for a foot,
\v 25 a burn for a burn, a wound for a wound, or a bruise for a bruise.
