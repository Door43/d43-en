\v 7 If a man sells his daughter as a female servant, she must not go free as the male servants do.
\v 8 If she does not please her master, who has designated her for himself, then he must let her be bought back. He has no right to sell her to a foreign people. He has no such right, since he has treated her deceitfully.
