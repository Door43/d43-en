\v 7 If a man sells his daughter to be a female servant, she will not go out as the male servants do.
\v 8 If she does not please her master, who has designated her to himself, then he must let her be redeemed. He has no right  to sell her to a foreign people. He will have no such right, seeing he has dealt deceitfully with her.
