\v 5 But if the servant plainly says, "I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free,"
\v 6 then his master must bring him to God. The master must bring him to a door or doorpost, and his master must bore his ear through with an awl. Then the servant will serve him for the rest of his life.
