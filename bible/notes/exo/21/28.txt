\v 28 If a bull gores a man or woman with the result that the person dies, you \add must kill the bull by\add* throwing stones at it, but you must not punish the owner of the bull.
\v 29 But suppose the bull had attacked people several times before, and its owner had been warned, but he did not keep the bull inside a fence. Then you \add must kill the bull by\add* throwing stones at it, but you must also execute its owner.
\v 30 However, if the owner of the bull is allowed to pay a fine to save his own life\f + \ft Or: in order not to be executed \f*, he must pay the full amount that the judges say that he must pay.
