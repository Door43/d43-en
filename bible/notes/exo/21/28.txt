\v 28 If a bull gores a man or woman with the result that the person dies, you \add must kill the bull by\add* throwing stones at it, but you must not punish the owner of the bull.
\v 29 But suppose the bull had attacked people several times before, and its owner had been warned, but he did not keep the bull inside a fence. Then you \add must kill the bull by\add* throwing stones at it, but you must also execute its owner.
\v 30 However, if the owner of the bull is allowed to pay a fine to save his own life\f + \ft Or: in order not to be executed \f*, he must pay the full amount that the judges say that he must pay.

\v 28 If an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox must surely be stoned, and its flesh must not be eaten; but the ox's owner must be acquitted of guilt.
\v 29 But if the ox had a habit of goring in the past, and its owner was warned but did not keep it in, and the ox has killed a man or a woman, that ox must be stoned, and its owner also must be put to death.
\v 30 If a payment is required for his life, he must pay whatever he is required to pay.
