\v 29 But suppose the bull had attacked people several times before, and its owner had been warned, but he did not keep the bull inside a fence. Then you \add must kill the bull by\add* throwing stones at it, but you must also execute its owner.
\v 30 However, if the owner of the bull is allowed to pay a fine to save his own life\f + \ft Or: in order not to be executed \f*, he must pay the full amount that the judges say that he must pay.

\v 28 If an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox must surely be stoned, and its flesh must not be eaten; but the ox's owner must  be acquitted of guilt.
\v 29 But if the ox had a habit of goring in the past, and its owner was warned but did not keep it in, and the ox has killed a man or a woman, that ox must be stoned, and its owner also must be put to death.
\v 30 If a payment is required for his life, he must pay whatever he is required to pay.
