\v 12 You must execute anyone who strikes another person with the result that the person who is struck dies.
\v 13 But if the one who struck the other did not intend to kill that person, the one who struck him can escape to a place that I will choose for you, \add and he will be safe there\add*.
\v 14 But if someone gets angry with another person and kills him, even if the murderer runs to the altar, \add a place that God designated as a place to be safe\add*, you must execute him.

\v 12 Whoever strikes a man so that he dies, that person shall surely be put to death.
\v 13 If a man did not do it with premeditation, but instead it happened by accident, then I will appoint a place where he may flee.
\v 14 If a man willfully attacks his neighbor to kill him deceitfully, then you will take him even from my altar, that he may die.
