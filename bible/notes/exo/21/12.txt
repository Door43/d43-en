\v 14 But if someone gets angry with another person and kills him, even if the murderer runs to the altar, \add a place that God designated as a place to be safe\add*, you must execute him.

\v 12 If someone hits a man in order to kill him and the man dies, then that person should also be put to death.
\v 13 But if the one who hit the other did not mean to kill that person, the one who hit him can go to a place that I will choose for you, and he will be safe there.
\v 14 But if someone gets angry with another person and kills him, even if the murderer runs to the altar, you must kill him.

\v 12 Whoever strikes a man so that he dies, that person must surely be put to death.
\v 13 If the man did not do it with premeditation, but instead by accident, then I will fix a place to where he can flee.
\v 14 If a man willfully attacks his neighbor to kill him deceitfully, then you must take him, even if he is at God's altar, so that he may die.
