\v 27 Set apart for me the ram's breast that you lifted high to offer to me. Also set apart for me the ram's thigh that you presented to me—both of these pieces that came from the ram that was slaughtered when you set apart for me Aaron and his sons as priests.
\v 28 In the future, whenever the Israelite people present to me, Yahweh, offerings to restore fellowship with each other, the breast and the thigh of animals that they present to me will be for Aaron and his male descendants to eat.

\v 26 You must take the breast of Aaron's ram of dedication and raise it up and present it as an offering to me, Yahweh. Then it will be your portion to eat.
\v 27 You must set apart to me the breast of the offering that is raised high and the thigh of the offering that is presented—the breast that is raised and the thigh that is presented, both coming from the ram for the confirmation of Aaron and his sons to me.
\v 28 These portions of meat, given by the Israelites, must forever belong to Aaron and his descendants. By the regulations for the fellowship offerings, these will be offerings for the priests taken from the Israelites' offerings presented to me, Yahweh.
