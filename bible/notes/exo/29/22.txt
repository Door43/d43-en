===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 Also, cut off the ram's fat, its fat tail, and the fat that covers the inner organs, the covering of the liver, the two kidneys with the fat on them, and the right thigh. (This ram is for setting Aaron and his sons apart for me as priests.)
\v 23 From the basket, also take one of each of the kinds of bread that was baked without yeast—one made with no oil, one with oil, and one thin wafer.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 You must take the ram's fat, the fat tail, the fat that covers the inner parts, the covering of the liver, the two kidneys and the fat on them, and the right thigh—for this ram is for the priests' consecration to me.
\v 23 Take one loaf of bread, one cake of bread made with oil, and one wafer out of the basket of bread without yeast that will be before me, Yahweh.
</usfm>
