\v 24 You must put these in Aaron's hands and in the hands of his sons. They must raise them up before me, Yahweh, and present them as an offering to me.
\v 25 You must then take the food from their hands and burn it on the altar with the burnt offering. It will produce a sweet aroma for me; it will be an offering made to me by fire.
