===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to Moses.

  * **tent of meeting** - This is another name for the tabernacle. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:27:20|27:21]].
  * **You must kill the bull** - The bull offering was to be killed by Moses, not the priests, at the doorway, not inside the tent of meeting.
  * **kill the bull** - Since the following verses will tell what to do with the blood from the bull, use a term for "kill" that will imply a method similar to "slitting its throat and catch the blood in a bowl." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
