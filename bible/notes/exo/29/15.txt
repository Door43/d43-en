\v 15 You must also take the one ram, and Aaron and his sons must lay their hands on its head.
\v 16 You must kill the ram. Then take its blood and sprinkled it against the altar on every side and on it.
\v 17 You must cut the ram into pieces and wash its inner parts and its legs, and you must put the inner parts, together with its pieces and with its head,
\v 18 on the altar. Then burn the whole ram. It will be a burnt offering to me, Yahweh. It will produce a sweet aroma for me; it will be an offering made to me by fire.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **You must kill the ram** - For these consecration sacrifices for the priests, it was Moses, not Aaron or his sons, who had to kill the animals.
  * **on the altar** - Unlike the bull offering that was burned outside of the tent, the ram was to be burned on the inner altar.
  * **the inner parts** - "the organs." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:29:12|29:13]].
