\v 41 You must offer the second lamb about sunset. You must offer the same grain offering as in the morning, and the same drink offering. These will produce a sweet aroma for me; it will be an offering made to me by fire.
\v 42 These must be regular burnt offerings throughout your people's generations. You must do them at the entrance to the tent of meeting before me, Yahweh, where I will meet with you to speak to you.
