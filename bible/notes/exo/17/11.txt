\v 11 Whenever Moses lifted up his arms, the Israelite men started to win the battle; whenever he lowered his arms, the people of Amalek started to win.
\v 12 But Moses' arms became tired. So Aaron and Hur rolled a large stone for him to sit on. While he was sitting on it, those two held up his arms, one man on either side of him. In that way, they kept his arms lifted up until the sun went down.
\v 13 In this way Joshua and the men with him defeated the people of Amalek in battle.

\v 11 While Moses was holding his hands up, Israel was winning; when he let his hands rest, Amalek would begin to win.
\v 12 When Moses' hands became heavy, Aaron and Hur took a stone and put it under him for him to sit on. At the same time, Aaron and Hur held his hands up, one person on one side of him, and the other person on the other side. So Moses' hands were held steady until the sun went down.
\v 13 So Joshua defeated the people of Amalek with the sword.
