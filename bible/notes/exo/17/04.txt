\v 4 So Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* prayed earnestly to Yahweh. He\f + \ft Or: I \f* said, "How shall I deal with these people?\f + \ft Or: I do not know how to deal with these people! \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* They are almost ready to \add kill me by throwing\add* stones at me!"
\v 5 Yahweh replied to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, "Take some of the elders\f + \ft Or: leaders \f* of the Israelite people with you and \add tell the rest of\add* the people to follow you \add to\add* Sinai Mountain. Take along the stick with which you struck the Nile \add River\add*.
\v 6 Listen carefully: I will stand in front of you on top of a \add large\add* rock at the foot of the mountain. Strike the rock with your stick. \add When you do that\add*, water for the people to drink will flow out of the rock." \add When they\f + \ft Or: we \f* arrived at the mountain\add*, Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* did that while the Israelite elders were watching, \add and water flowed from the rock\add*.
\v 7 Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* gave that place two names \add in the Hebrew language:\add* Massah, \add which means 'testing'\add*, and Meribah, \add which means 'complaining'\add*. He\f + \ft Or: I \f* gave it the name Massah because the Israelite people were testing Yahweh, saying "Is Yahweh really among us \add and able to help us\add*, or not?", and he\f + \ft Or: I \f* gave it the name Meribah because they were \add continually\add* complaining.

\v 4 So Moses prayed to Yahweh. He said, "How shall I deal with these people? They are almost ready to kill me by throwing stones at me!"
\v 5 Yahweh said to Moses, "Take some of the elders of the Israelite people with you and tell the rest of the people to follow you to Mount Sinai. Take along the staff with which you struck the Nile River.
\v 6 Listen to me! I will stand in front of you on top of a large rock at the foot of Mount Horeb. Strike the rock with your stick. When you do that, water for the people to drink will flow out of the rock." When the people arrived at the mountain, Moses did what God had said, while the Israelite elders were watching, and water flowed from the rock.
\v 7 Moses gave that place two names in the Hebrew language—Masseh, which means 'testing,' and Meribah, which means 'complaining.' He gave it the name Massah because the Israelite people were testing Yahweh, saying "Is Yahweh really among us and able to help us, or not?" and Moses gave it the name Meribah because they were complaining all the time to him.

\v 4 Then Moses cried out to Yahweh, "What should I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me."
\v 5 Yahweh said to Moses, "Go on ahead of the people, and take with you some elders of Israel. Take with you the staff with which you struck the river, and go.
\v 6 I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb, and you will strike the rock. Water will come out of it for the people to drink." Then Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.
\v 7 He called that place Massah and Meribah because of the Israelites' complaining, and because they had tested the Lord by saying, "Is Yahweh among us or not?"
