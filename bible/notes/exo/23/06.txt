\v 6 You must not pervert justice when it should go to your poor people in a poor man's lawsuit.
\v 7 Do not join others in making false accusations, and do not kill the innocent or righteous, for I will not acquit the wicked.
\v 8 Never take a bribe, for a bribe blinds those who see, and perverts honest people's words.
\v 9 You must not oppress a foreigner, since you know the mind of a foreigner, for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt.
