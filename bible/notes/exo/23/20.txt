===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues telling Moses his laws for the people of Israel.

  * **Be attentive to him** - "Listen to him" or "Obey him"
  * **Do not provoke him, for he will not pardon** - AT: "If you provoke him, he will not pardon"
  * **My name is on him** - Here "name" refers to God's authority (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **If you indeed obey his voice** - AT: "If you carefully obey what he says" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries** - These two phrases mean the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
