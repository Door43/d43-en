\v 14 You must travel to hold a festival for me three times every year.
\v 15 You are to observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread.  As I commanded you, you will eat unleavened bread for seven days. At that time,  you will appear before me in the month Abib, which is fixed for this purpose. It was in this month that you came out from Egypt.  But you must not appear before me empty handed.
