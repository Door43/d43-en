\v 14 Every year you must travel to three festivals to honor me.
\v 15 The first one is the Festival of Bread with no Yeast. Celebrate it in the month of Aviv, which is the month in which you left Egypt. Celebrate it in the way that I commanded you; eat the bread for seven days. Always bring an offering when you come to worship me. Do not come empty-handed.

\v 14 You must travel to hold a festival for me three times every year.
\v 15 You are to observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread. As I commanded you, you will eat unleavened bread for seven days. At that time, you will appear before me in the month of Aviv, which is fixed for this purpose. It was in this month that you came out from Egypt. But you must not appear before me empty-handed.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues telling Moses his laws for the people of Israel.

  * **Aviv** - This is the name of the first month of the Hebrew calendar. Aviv is during the last part of March and the first part of April on Western calendars. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:13:03|13:4]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_hebrewmonths]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **not appear before me empty-handed** - Here understatement is used to emphasize that the Israelites must bring a suitable offering to Yahweh. AT: "come to me without a proper offering" or "always bring an offering to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
