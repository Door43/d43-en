I will give you the power \f + \ft metonymy \f* to expel the people who live there, so that you will expel them as you occupy more of the country.
\v 32 You must not make any agreement\f + \ft Or: treaty \f* with those people or with their gods.
\v 33 Do not allow \add those people\add* to live in your land, in order that they do not cause you to sin against me.

\v 30 I will remove those people groups slowly, a few at a time, until the number of your people increases and you are able to live everywhere in the land.
\v 31 I will cause the borders of your land to extend from the Sea of Reeds in the southeast to the Mediterranean Sea in the northwest, and from the wilderness of Sinai in the southwest to the Euphrates River in the northeast of the country. I will give you the power to remove the people who live there so that you will remove them as you occupy more of the country.
\v 32 You must not make any agreement with those people or with their gods.
\v 33 Do not allow those people to live in your land in order that they do not cause you to sin against me. If you worship their gods, you will not be able to escape from worshiping them and sinning against me just as someone caught in a trap is unable to escape."

\v 30 Instead, I will drive them out little by little from before you until you become fruitful and inherit the land.
\v 31 I will fix your borders from the Red Sea to the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness to the Euphrates River. I will give you victory over the land's inhabitants. You will drive them out before yourselves.
\v 32 You must not make a covenant with them or with their gods.
\v 33 They must not live in your land, or they would make you sin against me.  If you worship their gods, this will surely become a trap for you.'"

===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues telling Moses his laws for the people of Israel.
  * **this will surely become a trap for you** - This means worshiping other gods will lead the people of Israel to ruin like an animal caught in a hunter's trap. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
