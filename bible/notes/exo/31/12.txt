\v 12 Yahweh said to Moses,
\v 13 "Tell the Israelite people, 'Obey my instructions regarding the sabbath days for rest. Those days will remind to me and to you and your descendants, throughout all future generations, that I, Yahweh, have set you apart to be my people.
\v 14 You must obey my rules about the sabbath days for rest because you must regard them as special for me. Those who treat these days with disrespect must be killed; this will show that I no longer consider them to belong to my people.

\v 12 Yahweh spoke to Moses, 
\v 13 "Tell the Israelites, you must certainly keep my sabbath days, for these will be a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that you may know that I am Yahweh, who sets you apart.
\v 14 You shall therefore keep the sabbath, for it is holy to you. Everyone who defiles it shall surely be put to death; anyone who works on the sabbath shall surely be cut off from his people.
\v 15 Six days may work be done, but  the seventh day is a sabbath of complete rest, holy to Yahweh. Whoever does any work on the sabbath day shall surely be put to death.
