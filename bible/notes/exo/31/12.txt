\v 12 Yahweh spoke to Moses, 
\v 13 "Tell the Israelites, you must certainly keep my Sabbath days, for these will be a sign between me and you throughout your generations so that you may know that I am Yahweh, who sets you apart.
\v 14 You shall therefore keep the Sabbath, for it is holy to you. Everyone who defiles it shall surely be put to death; anyone who works on the Sabbath shall surely be cut off from his people.
\v 15 Work be done for six days, but the seventh day is to be a Sabbath of complete rest, holy, reserved for Yahweh's honor. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day must surely be put to death.
