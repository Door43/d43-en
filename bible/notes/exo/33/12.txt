\v 12 Moses said to Yahweh, "See, you have been saying to me, 'Take this people on their journey,' but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. You have said, 'I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight.'
\v 13 Now if I have found favor in your sight, show me your ways so that I may know you and continue to find favor in your sight. Remember that this nation is your people."
