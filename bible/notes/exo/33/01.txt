\c 33
\p
\v 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, "Go from here, you and the people whom you have brought up out of the land of Egypt. Go to the land about which I made an oath to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, when I said, 'I will give it to your descendants.'
\v 2 I will send an angel before you, and I will drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
\v 3 Go to that land, which is flowing with milk and honey, but I will not go up with you, because you are a stubborn people. I might destroy you on the way."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues to tell Moses of his anger.

  * **that land, which is flowing with milk and honey** - God spoke of the land being good for animals and plants as if the milk and honey from those animals and plants were flowing through the land.  AT: "a land that is excellent for raising animals and farming." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:03:07|3:8]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **flowing with** - "full of" or "with an abundance of"
  * **milk** - Since milk comes from cows and goats, this represents food produced by livestock. AT: "food from livestock" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **honey** - Since honey is produced from flowers, this represents food from crops. AT: "food from crops" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
 
  * **a stubborn people** - "people who refuse to change"
