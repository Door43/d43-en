===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Yahweh would speak to Moses face to face** - Speaking directly rather than through dreams and visions, is spoken of as if Moses and God saw each other's faces while they spoke. AT: "Yahweh would speak directly to Moses" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **young man** - old enough to be a soldier ([[:en:bible:notes:exo:17:08|17:9-10]]), but much younger than Moses
