\v 5 You must not bow down to any idol and worship it because I am Yahweh your God, and I will not allow you to worship any other gods. I will punish those who sin and hate me. I will punish not only them, but also I will punish their descendants down to the third and fourth generation.

\p
\v 4 You must not make for yourself a carved figure nor the likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water below.
\v 5 You must not bow down to them or worship them, for I, Yahweh your God, am a jealous God. I punish the ancestors' wickedness by bringing punishment on the descendants, to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me.
\v 6 But I show covenant faithfulness to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **nor the likeness** - "and you must not make the likeness"
  * **You must not bow down to them or worship them** - The word "them" refers to carved figures or idols.
  * **jealous** - God wants his people to worship only him.
  * **punish the ancestors' wickedness by bringing punishment on the descendants** - God will punish people for the sin of their parents.
  * **the third and the fourth generation** - "the 3rd and the 4th generation." Here "third" and "fourth" are ordinal numbers for "3" and "4." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])

AT: "I faithfully love thousands of those who love me" or "I am faithful to the covenant with thousands of those who love me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **to thousands of those** - The word "thousands" is a metonym for a number too many to count. AT: "forever to those who love me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
