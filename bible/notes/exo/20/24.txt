\v 25 If you make for me an altar from stones, do not make it from stones that you have cut \add to make them look nice\add*, because you will make the altar unsuitable for \add worshiping\add* me if you use tools to cut the stones.
\v 26 Do not make an altar that has steps in front of it, because if you do that, \add people\add* could see your naked \add buttocks\add* as you go up the steps.'"

\v 25 If you make for me an altar from stones, do not make it from stones that you have cut to make them look nice because you will make the altar unsuitable for worshiping me if you use tools to cut the stones.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 24 You must make an earthen altar for me, and you must sacrifice on it your burnt offerings, fellowship offerings, sheep, and oxen. In every place where I cause my name to be honored, I will come to you and bless you.
\v 25 If you make me an altar of stone, you must not build it of cut stones, for if you use your tools on it, you will have defiled it.
\v 26 You must not go up by steps to my altar; this is to keep you from exposing your private parts.'"
