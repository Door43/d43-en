<usfm>
\v 8 Do not forget that the seventh day \add of every week\add* is mine, so dedicate those days to me.
\v 9 There are six days each week for you to do all your work,
\v 10 but the seventh day is a rest day, a day dedicated to me, Yahweh God, the one whom you \add should worship\add*. On that day you must not do any work. You and your sons and daughters and your male and female slaves must not work. You must not even force your livestock to work, and you must not allow foreigners to work, those who are living in your country.
\v 11 I, Yahweh, created the sky, the earth, the ocean, and everything that is in them, in six days. Then I stopped my work of creating everything, and rested on the seventh day. That is the reason that I, Yahweh, have blessed the rest day and set it apart \add to be a sacred\f + \ft Or: special \f* day\add*.

\v 9 There are six days each week for you to do all your work,
\v 10 but the seventh day is a day of rest, a day dedicated to me, Yahweh your God, the one whom you should worship. On that day you must not do any work. You and your sons and daughters and your male and female slaves must not work. You must not even force your livestock to work, and you must not allow foreigners to work, those strangers who are living in your country.
\v 11 I, Yahweh, created the sky, the earth, the ocean, and everything that is in them, in six days. Then I stopped my work of creating everything, and rested on the seventh day. That is the reason that I, Yahweh, have blessed the rest day and set it apart to be a sacred day.

\v 8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
\v 9 Six days will you labor, and do all your work;
\v 10 but the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God. In it you will not do any work, you, nor your son, or your daughter, your male servant, or your female servant, or your cattle, or foreigner who is within your gates.
\v 11 For in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and then rested on the seventh day. Therefore Yahweh blessed the sabbath day, and consecrated it.
