\v 10 If a man gives his neighbor a donkey, an ox, a sheep, or any animal to keep, and if it dies or is hurt or is carried away without anyone seeing it,
\v 11 an oath to Yahweh must be taken by them both, as to whether or not one person has put his hand on his neighbor's property. The owner must accept this, and the other will make no restitution.
\v 12 But if it was stolen from him, the other must make restitution to the owner for it.
\v 13 If an animal was torn in pieces, let the other man bring the animal as evidence. He will not have to pay for what was torn.
