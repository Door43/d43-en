\v 29 You must not hold back offerings from your harvest or your winepresses. You must give to me the firstborn of your sons.
\v 30 You must also do the same with your oxen and your sheep. For seven days they may remain with their mothers, but on the eighth day you must give them to me.
\v 31 You are to be a holy people. So you must not eat any meat that was torn by animals in the field. Instead, you must throw it to the dogs.
