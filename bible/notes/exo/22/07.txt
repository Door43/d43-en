\v 7 Suppose that someone gives another person some money or other valuable item and asks him to keep it in his house for a while. And suppose that a thief steals it from that person's house. If the thief is caught, the thief must pay back twice as much as he stole.
\v 8 But if the thief is not caught, the owner of the house from which the item was stolen must stand before the judges so that the judges can say whether the owner of the house was the one who took the other man's valuable item.

\v 9 If two people argue about which one of them owns a bull or a donkey or a sheep or some clothing, or something else that has been lost, they must stand before the judges.

\v 7 If a man gives money or goods to his neighbor for safe keeping, and if it is stolen out of the man’s house, if the thief is found, that thief must pay double.
\v 8 But if the thief is not found, then the owner of the house must come before the judges to see whether he has put his own hand on his neighbor’s property.
\v 9 For every dispute about something, whether it is an ox, a donkey, a sheep, clothing, or any other missing thing about which one says, "This belongs to me," the claim of  both parties must come before the judges. The man whom the judges find guilty must pay double to his neighbor.
