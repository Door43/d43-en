<usfm> \p \v 25 If you lend money to any of my people among you who are poor, you must not be like a moneylender to him or charge him interest. \v 26 If you take your neighbor’s garment in pledge, you must return it to him before the sun goes down, \v 27 for that is his only covering; it is his garment for his body. What else can he sleep in? When he cries out to me, I will hear him, for I am compassionate. </usfm>
