\v 27 because he needs it to keep him warm \add during the night\add*. That is the only covering that poor people have when they sleep at night.\f + \ft Or: What else will he cover himself with during the night? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add If you do not act mercifully toward him by returning his cloak\add*, when he cries out to me asking for my help, I will help him, because I \add always act\add* mercifully.

\v 25 If you lend money to any of my people among you who are poor, you must not be like a moneylender to him or charge him interest.
\v 26 If you take your neighbor's garment in pledge, you must return it to him before the sun goes down,
\v 27 for that is his only covering; it is his garment for his body. What else can he sleep in? When he calls out to me, I will hear him, for I am compassionate.
