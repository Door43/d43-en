\p
\v 1 If a man steals an ox or a sheep and kills it or sells it, then he must pay five oxen for one ox, and four sheep for one sheep.
\v 2 If a thief is found breaking in, and if he is struck so that he dies, in that case no guilt for murder will attach to anyone on his account.
\v 3 But if the sun has risen before he breaks in, guilt for murder will attach to the person who kills him.
\p
A thief must make restitution. If he has nothing, then he must be sold for his theft.
