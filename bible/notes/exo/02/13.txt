\v 13 He went out the next day, and, behold, two Hebrew men were fighting. He said to the one who was in the wrong, "Why are you hitting your companion?"
\v 14 But the man said, "Who made you a leader and judge over us? Are you planning to kill me as you killed that Egyptian?"  Then Moses became afraid and said, "What I did has certainly become known to others."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **He went out**  - "Moses went out"
  * **behold**  - The word "behold" here shows that Moses was surprised by what he saw. You can use a word in your language that will give this meaning.
  * **the one who was in the wrong**  - "the one who started the fight" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Are you planning to kill me as you killed that Egyptian?**  - The writer uses a question here to be sarcastic. AT: "Surely you are not going to kill me like you killed that Egyptian!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
