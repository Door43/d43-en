===== translationNotes: =====

  * **blue, purple, or scarlet wool** - Possible meanings are 1) "material that is dyed blue, purple, and scarlet," probably wool yarn, or 2) "blue, purple and scarlet dye" to dye the linen. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:25:03|25:4]].
  * **whose hearts stirred them up** - Here "hearts" refers to the women. The hearts of the women who responded to God are spoken of as if they were water stirred up by a storm.  AT: "who responded to God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
