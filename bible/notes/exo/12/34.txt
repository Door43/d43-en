\v 34 Yahweh caused the Egyptian people to greatly respect the \add Israelite\add* people, so they gave them what they asked for. In that way, they carried away the wealth of the Egyptian people.
\v 35 The Egyptians urged the \add Israelite\add* people to leave their country quickly. They said, "\add If you do not do that\add*, we will all die!"
\v 36 So the \add Israelite\add* people \add prepared to leave at once\add*. They took the bowls in which they mixed the dough to make bread, and the dough that was in the bowls without any yeast in it, and they wrapped the bowls in their cloaks. They put the bowls on their shoulders \add and left\add*.
