  * **the first month of the year** - The first month of the Hebrew calendar is during the last part of March and the first part of April on western calendars. It is at the beginning of the spring season when the late rains come and people begin to harvest their crops. It also marks when Yahweh rescued the Israelites from the Egyptians.
