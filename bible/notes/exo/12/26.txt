\v 26 When your children ask you, 'What does this act of worship mean?'
\v 27 then you must say, 'It is the sacrifice of Yahweh's Passover, because Yahweh passed over the Israelites' houses in Egypt when he attacked the Egyptians. He set our households free.'" Then the people bowed down and worshiped Yahweh.
\v 28 The Israelites went and did exactly as Yahweh had commanded Moses and Aaron.
