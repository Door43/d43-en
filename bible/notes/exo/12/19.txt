===== translationNotes: =====

  * **no yeast must be found in your houses** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "there must not be any yeast in your houses" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **must be cut off from the community of Israel** - The metaphor "cut off" has at least three possible meanings. They can be expressed in active form: 1) "the people of Israel must send him away" or 2) "I will no longer consider him to be one of the people of Israel" or 3) "the people of Israel must kill him." See how you translated "must be cut off from Israel" in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:12:15|12:15]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **bread made without yeast** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "bread which you have made without yeast." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:12:05|12:08]]. (See: Active or Passive)
