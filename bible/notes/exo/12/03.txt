<usfm>
\v 3 Tell the assembly of Israel, saying, 'On the tenth day of this month they must each take a lamb for themselves, each family doing this, a lamb for each household.
\v 4 If the household is too small for a lamb, the man and his next door neighbor are to take a lamb, that would be enough for the number of the people. Enough for each one to eat, so you will take enough lamb to feed them all.
