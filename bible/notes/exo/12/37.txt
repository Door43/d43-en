<usfm>
\v 37 The Israelite people traveled from Rameses \add city\add* to Succoth \add town\add*. There were about 600,000 men who went, in addition to the women and children.
\v 38 Many other people who were not Israelites went along with them. There were also livestock, including flocks \add of sheep and goats\add* and herds \add of cattle\add*.
\v 39 On their way, they baked bread with the dough that they carried with them when they had been expelled from Egypt. The dough did not have yeast in it, because they were told to leave Egypt so quickly that they did not have enough time to get food ready to take with them, or enough time to mix yeast in the dough.
\p
\v 40 The Israelite people had lived in Egypt 430 years.

\v 37 The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Succoth. They numbered about 600,000 men on foot, in addition to the women and children.
\v 38 A mixed crowd of non-Israelites also went with them, together with flocks and herds, a very large number of cattle.
\v 39 They baked bread without yeast in the dough that they brought from Egypt. It was without yeast because they had been driven out of Egypt and could not delay to prepare food.
\v 40 The Israelites had lived in Egypt for 430 years.
