\v 12 On that night I will go through all the land of Egypt, and I will kill all the oldest males in Egypt, both humans and animals. \add By doing this\add* I will punish all the gods in Egypt. \add I can do this\add*, because I am Yahweh, \add the all-powerful God\add*.
\v 13 The blood \add that you smear on the doorways will be a mark to indicate\add* the houses in which you \add Israelites\add* live. When I see the blood, I will \add ignore and\add* pass by those houses, and I will not harm you \add people who live there\add*, when I punish the Egyptians.
\p
\v 14 \add Each year\add*, you must celebrate this festival on this day, to remember \add what I\add*, Yahweh, \add have done for you\add*. In all the generations to come, \add each year\add* you must celebrate \add this festival\add*. \add It must continue\add* forever.

\v 12 On that night I will go through all the land of Egypt, and I will kill all the oldest males in Egypt, both humans and animals. By doing this, I will punish all the gods in Egypt. It is I, Yahweh God, who am speaking to you!
\v 13 The blood that you smear on the doorways will be a mark to show me the houses in which you Israelites live. When I see the blood, I will pass over those houses, and I will not harm the people who live there when I come to punish the Egyptians.
\p
\v 14 Each year, you must celebrate this festival on this day to remember what I, Yahweh, have done for you. In all the generations to come, each year you must celebrate this festival. It must continue forever.

\v 12 Yahweh says this: I will go through the land of Egypt in that night and attack all the firstborn of man and animal in the land of Egypt. I will bring punishment on all the gods of Egypt. I am Yahweh.
\v 13 The blood will be a sign on your houses for my coming to you. When I see the blood, I will pass over you when I attack the land of Egypt. This plague will not come on you and destroy you 
\v 14 This day will become a memorial day for you, which you must observe as a festival for Yahweh. It will always be a law for you, throughout your people's generations, that you must observe this day.
