\v 16 On the first day \add of that week\add*, you must have a holy meeting\f + \ft Or: gather together to \add worship\add* me \f*. You must do the same thing on the seventh day. People must not work on those two days. The only work they may do is to prepare food for you to eat.

\v 15 You will eat bread without yeast during seven days. On the first day you will remove the yeast from your houses. Whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that person must be cut off from Israel.
\v 16 On the first day there will be an assembly that is set apart to me, and on the seventh day there will be another such gathering. No work will be done on these days, except the cooking for everyone to eat. That must be the only work that may be done by you.
