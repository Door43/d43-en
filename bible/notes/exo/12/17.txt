\v 17 \add Every year\add* you must keep celebrating this festival of eating bread that has no yeast in it, because it will remind you that it was on this day that I brought all your tribal groups out of the land of Egypt. So \add every year\add*, in all the generations to come, you must celebrate this day as a festival. It must continue forever.
\v 18-19 In the first month of the year, on the 14th day of that month, the only bread you may eat is bread that has no yeast in it. You must keep doing that each day until the 21st day of that month. For those seven days you must not have any yeast in your house. \add During that time\add*, if anyone, either an Israelite or a foreigner, eats bread made with yeast, you must consider that person no longer to be an Israelite.
