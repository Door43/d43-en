\v 31 Bezalel made crossbars of acacia wood—five for the frames of the one side of the tabernacle,
\v 32 five crossbars for the frames of the other side of the tabernacle, and five crossbars for the frames for the back side of the tabernacle to the west.
\v 33 He made the crossbar in the center of the frames, that is, halfway up, to reach from end to end.
\v 34 He covered the frames with gold. He made their rings of gold, for them to serve as holders for the crossbars, and he covered the bars with gold.
