===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Bezalel made...south side** - For 36:20-23 see how you translated many of these words in [[en:bible:notes:exo:26:15|26:15-18]].
  * **ten cubits...one and a half cubits** - "10 cubits...1.5 cubits" (See: [[en:obe:other:biblicaldistance]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_fraction]])
  * **two projections in each board** - A projection is a small piece of wood sticking out beyond the end of the board so it can be secured.
