\v 10 Then Yahweh said to Moses,
\v 11 "Go and tell the king of Egypt again that he must allow the Israelite people to leave his land!"
\v 12 But Moses said to Yahweh, "Please listen to me. Even the Israelite people have not paid attention to what I told them. I am a poor speaker. So why should the king pay attention to what I tell him?"
\v 13 But Yahweh spoke to Aaron and Moses, "Tell the Israelite people and the king of Egypt that I have called you two to lead the Israelite people out of Egypt."

\v 10 So Yahweh spoke to Moses and said,
\v 11 "Go tell Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to let the people of Israel go from his land."
\v 12 Moses said to Yahweh, "If the Israelites have not listened to me, why will Pharaoh listen to me, since I am not good at speaking?"
\v 13 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron. He gave them a command for the Israelites and for Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt.
