\v 2 God spoke to Moses and said to him, "I am Yahweh.
\v 3 I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as God Almighty; but by my name, Yahweh, I was not known to them.
\v 4 I also established my covenant with them, in order to give them the land of Canaan, the land where they lived as non-citizens, the land in which they wandered about.
\v 5 Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites whom the Egyptians have enslaved, and I have called to mind my covenant.
