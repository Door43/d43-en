\v 8 However, many years later, a new king began to rule in Egypt. He was not at all thankful for the good things Joseph had done for the people of Egypt long ago.
\v 9 He said to his people, "Look at what has happened! The Israelite people have become so many and so powerful that they are dangerous to us!
\v 10 We must find a way to control them! If we do not do that, there will be more of them. Then, if enemies attack us, the Israelites will join with our enemies and fight against us, and they will escape from our land."

\v 8 Then a new king arose over Egypt, who did not care for the memory of Joseph.
\v 9 He said to his people, "Look at the Israelites; they are more numerous and stronger than we are.
\v 10 Come, let us deal wisely with them. Otherwise they will continue to multiply, and if war breaks out, they will join our enemies, fight against us, and leave the land."
