\v 36 From that day, whenever the people of Israel wanted to move to another place, they went only when the cloud rose from above the sacred tent and moved on.
\v 37 If the cloud did not rise, they stayed where they were and waited for the cloud to rise and move.
\v 38 Wherever they traveled, the cloud that showed Yahweh's presence was above the sacred tent during the day, and a bright fire was over it at night. All the people of Israel could see it at any time, for as long as they were traveling to the land that God had promised to give them.

\v 36 Whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the people of Israel would set out on their journey.
\v 37 But if the cloud did not rise up from the tabernacle, then the people would not travel. They would stay until the day that it was lifted up.
\v 38 For Yahweh's cloud was over the tabernacle by day, and his fire was over it by night, in plain view of all the people of Israel throughout their journey.
