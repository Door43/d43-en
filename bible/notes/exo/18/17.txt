\v 17 Mosesâ€™ father-in-law said to him, "What you are doing is not very good.
\v 18 You will certainly wear out yourself and the people who come to you, because the burden is too heavy for you. You cannot do it yourself alone.
\v 19 Listen to me. I will give you advice, and God will be with you, because you are the people's  representative to God, and you bring their disputes to him.
\v 20 You must teach them his statutes and laws. You must show them the way to walk and the work to do.
