===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do.
  * **silver bases** -  These were silver blocks that had a slot in them to keep the board in place.
  * **pedestals** -  The silver bases kept the wood off the ground.
  * **and so on** - This means that what was said about the first two boards should be done for the rest of the boards.  AT: "and two bases for each of the rest of the boards"
