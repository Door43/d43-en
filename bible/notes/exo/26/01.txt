===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:exo:25:01|25:1]])

  * **You must make** - Yahweh is speaking to Moses, so the word "you" is singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]]) Yahweh probably expected Moses to tell someone else to do the actual work, but Moses would be the one responsible for seeing that the work was done correctly. "Tell a craftsman to make"
  * **scarlet wool** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:25:03|25:4]].
  * **craftsman** - a person who is skilled in making beautiful objects by hand
  * **twenty-eight cubits ... four cubits** - "28 cubits ... 4 cubits." A cubit is 46 centimeters. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bdistance]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **Five curtains must be joined to each other ... must also be joined to each other** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Sew five curtains together to make one set, and sew the other five curtains together to make another set" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
