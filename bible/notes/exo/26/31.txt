\v 31 You must make a curtain of blue, purple, and scarlet wool, and of fine linen, with designs of cherubim, the work of a skillful workman.
\v 32 You must hang it on four pillars of acacia wood covered with gold. These pillars must have  hooks of gold set on four silver bases.
\v 33 You must hang up the curtain under the clasps, and you must bring in the ark of the covenant decrees. The curtain is to separate the holy place from the most holy place.
