\v 4 When Yahweh saw that he had turned aside to look, God called to him out of the bush and said, "Moses, Moses." Moses said, "Here I am."
\v 5 God said, "Do not come any closer!  Take off your shoes from your feet, for the place where you are  standing is ground consecrated for my own purpose."
\v 6 He added, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." Then Moses covered his face, for he was afraid to look at God.
