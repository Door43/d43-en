\v 7 Yahweh said, "I have certainly seen the suffering of my people who are in Egypt. I have heard their shouts because of their taskmasters, for I know about their suffering.
\v 8 I have come down to free them from the Egyptians' power and to bring them up from that land to a good, large land, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the region of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **taskmasters** - "slave drivers." These were Egyptians whose job was to force the Israelites to do hard work. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:01:11|1:11]].
  * **a land flowing with milk and honey** - "a land where milk and honey flow." God spoke of the land being good for animals and plants as if the milk and honey from those animals and plants were flowing through the land. AT: "a land that is excellent for raising livestock and growing crops" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **flowing with** - "full of" or "with an abundance of"
  * **milk** - Since milk comes from cows and goats, this represents food produced by livestock. AT: "food from livestock" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **honey** - Since honey is produced from flowers, this represents food from crops. AT: "food from crops" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
