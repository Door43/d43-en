\v 7 Yahweh said, "I have certainly seen the suffering of my people who are in Egypt. I have heard their shouts because of their taskmasters, for I know about their suffering.
\v 8  I have come down to free them from the Egyptians' power and to bring them up from that land to a good, large land, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the region of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **taskmasters** - "slave drivers" or "masters." These were Egyptians whose job was to force the Israelites to do hard work.
  * **a land flowing with milk and honey**  - "a land where plenty of milk and honey flow." This means that the land will be rich and productive, so there will be enough food for everyone. AT: "a land that is excellent for cattle and farming" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
