\v 19 But I know that the king of Egypt will allow you to go only if he sees that I am more powerful than he is.
\v 20 So I will use my power by performing many miracles there. Then he will allow you to leave.
\v 21 When this happens, I will cause the people of Egypt to honor the Hebrew people so that when you leave Egypt, they will give you what you need for the journey.
\v 22 At that time, each Hebrew woman will ask for what belongs to the Egyptian women living nearby. The Egyptians will give you all they haveâ€”silver and gold jewelry and clothing. You will put these things on your children. In this way, you will take everything from the Egyptians."

\v 19 But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go, unless his hand is forced.
\v 20 I will reach out with my hand and attack the Egyptians with all the miracles that I will do among them. After that, he will let you go.
\v 21 I will grant this people favor from the Egyptians, so when you leave, you will not go empty-handed.
\v 22 Every woman will ask for silver and gold jewels and for clothing from her Egyptian neighbors and any women staying in her neighbors' houses. You will put them on your sons and daughters. In this way you will plunder the Egyptians."
