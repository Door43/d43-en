\v 13 Moses said to God, "If I go to the Israelite people and say to them, 'God, the one your ancestors worshiped, has sent me to you,' they will ask me, 'What is his name?' Then what should I say to them?"
\v 14 God replied to Moses, "I am who I am. Tell the Israelite people that the one named 'I AM' has sent you to them."

\v 15 God also said to Moses, "You must say to the Israelites, 'Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God whom Abraham worshiped, whom Isaac worshiped, and whom Jacob worshiped, has sent me to you. Yahweh is my name forever, and this is what all generations should call me.'

\v 13 Moses said to God, "When I go to the Israelites and tell them, 'The God of your ancestors has sent me to you,' and when they say to me, 'What is his name?' what should I say to them?"

  * **I AM THAT I AM**  - Possible meanings are that 1) this whole sentence is God's name or 2) God is not telling his name but something about himself (as in the UDB).  By saying this, God is teaching that he is eternal; he has always lived and always will live.
