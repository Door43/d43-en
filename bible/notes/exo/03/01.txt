===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **angel of Yahweh** - Yahweh appeared in the form of an angel. This was not just an angel that Yahweh sent. AT: "Yahweh appeared as an angel" (UDB)
    * **behold** - The word “behold” here shows that Moses saw something that was very different from what he expected.
