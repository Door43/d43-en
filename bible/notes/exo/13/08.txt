\v 8 On that day you are to say to your children, 'This is because of what Yahweh did for me when I came  out of Egypt.'
\v 9 This will be a reminder for you on your hand, and a reminder on your forehead. This is so the law of Yahweh may be in your mouth, for with a strong hand Yahweh brought you out of Egypt.
\v 10 Therefore you must keep this law at its appointed  time from year to year.
