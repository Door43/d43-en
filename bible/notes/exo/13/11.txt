\v 11 When Yahweh brings you into the land of the Canaanites, as he swore to you and to your ancestors to do, and when he gives the land to you,
\v 12 you must set apart for him every firstborn child and the first offspring of your animals. The males will be Yahweh's.
\v 13 Every firstborn of a donkey you must buy back with a lamb. If you do not buy it back, then you must break its neck. But each of your firstborn males among all your sons—you must buy them back.
