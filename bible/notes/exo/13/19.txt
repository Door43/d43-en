<usfm>
\v 19 Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* \add had them\add* take along the bones of Joseph with them\f + \ft Or: us \f*, because Joseph long ago had made the Israelite people promise solemnly that they would do that. He had said to them, "God will enable your descendants to leave Egypt. When that happens, you must carry my bones with you."
\p
\v 20 The Israelite people left Succoth and traveled to Etham, at the edge of the desert, and they set up their tents there.
\v 21 \add When they traveled\add* during the daytime, Yahweh went in front of them in a tall \add white\add* cloud to show them the way. During the night, he went in front of them in a tall cloud that looked like a fire. By doing that, he enabled them to travel in the daytime and also at nighttime.
\v 22 The tall cloud did not leave them. It was always in front of them, as a bright white cloud in the daytime and like a fire at night.

\v 19 Moses had them take along the bones of Joseph with them because Joseph long ago had made the Israelite people promise that they would do that. He had said to them, "God will rescue your descendants out of Egypt. When that happens, you must carry my bones with you."
\p
\v 20 The Israelite people left Succoth and walked to Etham at the edge of the wilderness, and they set up their tents there.
\v 21 When they walked during the daytime, Yahweh went in front of them in a tall white cloud to show them the way. During the night, he went in front of them in a tall cloud that looked like a fire. By doing this, he enabled them to travel in the daytime and also at nighttime.
\v 22 The tall cloud did not leave them. It was always in front of them, as a bright white cloud in the daytime and like a tall column of fire in the night.

\v 19 Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for Joseph had made the Israelites solemnly swear and said, "God will surely rescue you, and you must carry away my bones with you."
\v 20 The Israelites journeyed from Succoth and camped at Etham on the edge of the wilderness.
\v 21 Yahweh went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them on the way. By night he went in a pillar of fire to give them light. In this way they could travel by day and by night.
\v 22 Yahweh did not take away from before the people the daytime pillar of cloud or the nighttime pillar of fire.
