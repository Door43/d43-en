\v 3 Moses said to the people, "Call this day to mind, the day on which you came out from Egypt, out of the house of slavery, for by Yahweh's strong hand he brought you out from this place. No bread with yeast may be eaten.
\v 4 You are going out of Egypt on this day, in the month of Aviv.
\v 5 When Yahweh brings you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites, and the Jebusites, the land that he swore to your ancestors to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey—then you must observe this act of worship in this month.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Call this day to mind** - The words "Call ... to mind" were a customary way of telling someone to remember something. AT: "Remember and celebrate this day" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the house of slavery** - Moses speaks of Egypt as if it were a house where people keep slaves. AT: "the place where you were slaves" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Yahweh's strong hand** - Here the word "hand" refers to power. See how you translated "strong hand" in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:06:01|6:1]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **No bread with yeast may be eaten** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "You must not eat bread with yeast" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the month of Aviv** - This is the name of the first month of the Hebrew calendar. Aviv is during the last part of March and the first part of April on Western calendars. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_hebrewmonths]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **a land flowing with milk and honey** - Since milk comes from cows and goats, "milk" represents food produced by livestock. Because honey is produced from flowers, "honey" represents food from crops. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:03:07|3:8]]. AT: "food from livestock and from crops" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **you must observe this act of worship** - When the Israelites live in Canaan, they must celebrate the Passover on this day each year. See how you translated this phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:12:24|12:25]].
