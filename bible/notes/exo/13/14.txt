<usfm>
\v 14 In the future, when one of your children asks, 'What does this mean?', you must say to him, 'Yahweh brought our ancestors out of Egypt with his great power \f + \ft metonymy \f*, and freed us from being slaves there.
\v 15 The king of Egypt stubbornly refused to let them leave his land, so Yahweh killed all the firstborn males in Egypt, both the boys and the firstborn of their livestock. That is why we now sacrifice to Yahweh all the firstborn of our livestock, but we buy back our own firstborn sons.'
\v 16 I repeat that this ritual will remind you about how Yahweh brought our \add ancestors\add* out of Egypt by his great power \f + \ft metonymy \f*; it will be like something you tie on your wrist or on your forehead \add to remind you of that\add*."

\v 14 When your son asks you later, 'What does this mean?' then you are to tell him, 'It was by a strong hand that Yahweh brought us out from Egypt, from the house of slavery.
\v 15 When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, Yahweh killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of people and the firstborn of animals. That is why I sacrifice to Yahweh the firstborn male of every animal, and why I buy back the firstborn of my sons.'
\v 16 This will become a reminder on your hands, and a reminder on your forehead, for it was by a strong hand Yahweh brought us out of Egypt."
