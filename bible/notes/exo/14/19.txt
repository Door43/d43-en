\v 20 until it was between the Egyptian army and the Israelite people. The cloud caused the Egyptian army to be in the darkness but it gave light for the Israelites. As a result, neither group could come near the other group during the whole night.

\v 20 It came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel.  It was a dark cloud, but it lit the night, so that one did not come near the other all night.
