\v 15-16 Yahweh said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, "Tell the people to stop crying out for me \add to help them\add*, and to go forward.

The water will divide, so that the Israelite people can go in the middle of the sea, walking on dry ground \add between the walls of water on each side\add*.
\v 17 I will make the Egyptians stubborn, so that they will try to follow us. And then as a result of \add what I will do to the\add* king and his army and his chariots and his horsemen, \add my people\add* will praise\f + \ft Or: thank \f* me.
\v 18 And when I have won a glorious \add victory\add* over the king and his chariots and his horsemen, the \add other\add* Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh, \add the all-powerful God\add*."

\v 15 Then Yahweh said to Moses, "You must not call out to me for help any longer in this situation. Instead, tell the people to go forward.
\v 16 Lift up your staff and stretch it out as though you were stretching it over the sea. The water will move away so that the Israelite people can go in the middle of the sea, walking on dry ground between the walls of water on each side.
\v 17 I will make the Egyptians stubborn so that they will try to follow the Israelites. Then because of what I will do to the king, his army, his chariots, and his horsemen, my people will praise me.
\v 18 When I have won a glorious victory over the king, his chariots, and his horsemen, the other Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh, the God who can do anything."

\v 15 Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Why are you, Moses, continuing to call out to me? Tell the Israelites to go forward.
\v 16 Lift up your staff, reach out with your hand over the sea and divide it in two, so that the people of Israel may go through the sea on dry ground.
\v 17 Be aware that I will harden the Egyptians' hearts so they will go after them. I will get honor because of Pharaoh and all his army, his chariots, and his horsemen.
\v 18 Then the Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh when I have gotten honor because of Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Why are you, Moses, continuing to call out to me?** - Moses apparently had been praying to God for help so God uses this question to compel Moses to act. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "Do not call out to me any longer, Moses." See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **divide it in two** - "divide the sea into two parts"
  * **Be aware** - "Know"
  * **I will harden the Egyptians' hearts** - Here "hearts" refers to the Egyptians themselves. Their stubborn attitude is spoken of as if their hearts were hard. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:09:11|9:12]]. AT: "I will cause the Egyptians to became more defiant" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **so they will go after them** - "so that the Egyptians will go into the sea after the Israelites"
