\v 29 However, the Israelites walked on dry land in the middle of the sea. The waters were a wall for them on their right hand and on their left.
\v 30 So Yahweh saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw dead Egyptians on the seashore.
\v 31 When Israel saw the great power that Yahweh used against the Egyptians, the people honored Yahweh, and they trusted in Yahweh and in his servant Moses.
