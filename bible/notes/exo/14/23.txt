\v 23 The Egyptians pursued them. They went after them into the middle of the sea—all Pharaoh’s horses, chariots, and horsemen.
\v 24 But in the early morning hours, Yahweh looked down on the Egyptian army through the pillars of fire and cloud. He caused panic among the Egyptians.
\v 25 Their chariot wheels were clogged, and the horsemen drove with difficulty. So the Egyptians said, "Let us flee from Israel, for Yahweh is fighting for them against us."
