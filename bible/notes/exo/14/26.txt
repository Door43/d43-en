===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Yahweh said to Moses, "Reach out with your hand ... and their horsemen."** - This can be stated as an indirect quote. AT: "Yahweh told Moses to reach out with his hand over the sea so that the waters would come back onto the Egyptians, their chariots, and their horsemen." 
  * **come back onto** - "fall on"
  * **The Egyptians fled into the sea** - Since the sea was closing in on top of the Egyptians, instead of escaping, they were actually running right into the water. 
  * **Yahweh drove the Egyptians** - "Yahweh pushed the Egyptians" or "Yahweh threw the Egyptians"
