\v 8 Because Yahweh made the king of Egypt so stubborn that he and his army went to pursue the Israelites, who were leaving triumphantly,
\v 9 the Egyptian army, with all the king's horses and chariots and horsemen, pursued the Israelites. They caught up with them as they were camped near the sea, close to Pi-Hahiroth, in front of Baal-Zephon.
