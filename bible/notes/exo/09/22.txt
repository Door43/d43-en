\v 22 Then Yahweh said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, "Raise your hand up toward the sky, in order that hail will fall all over the land of Egypt—on the people and on their animals and on all the plants in the fields."
\v 23 So Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* lifted his\f + \ft Or: my \f* stick up toward the sky. And Yahweh sent down hail, all over the land of Egypt. There was also thunder and lightning.
\v 24 While very heavy hail was falling, there was thunder, and lightning struck the ground. There had never been a hailstorm like that since Egypt first became a country.

\v 23  Moses reached out with his staff toward the sky, and Yahweh sent thunder, hail, and lightning to the ground. He also rained hail on the land of Egypt.
\v 24 So there were hail and lightning mixed with hail, very severe, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.
