\v 1 Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Go to the king and say to him, 'This is what Yahweh, the one we Hebrews worship, says: "Allow my people to go, in order that they may worship me.
\v 2 If you still refuse to let them go,

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues talking with Moses about dealing with Pharaoh and bringing the Hebrew people out of Egypt.
  * **if you refuse to let them go, if you still keep them back** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize what will happen if Pharaoh does this. AT: "If you still refuse to let them go" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **then Yahweh's hand will be on your cattle** - Yahweh will show his power by sending a terrible disease upon the Egyptians' livestock. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
