\v 1 Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Go to the king and say to him, 'This is what Yahweh, the one we Hebrews worship, says: "Allow my people to go, in order that they may worship me.
\v 2 If you still refuse to let them go,
\v 3 I warn you that I will punish you with my power by sending a terrible disease on all your livestock to make them sick and die—on your horses, on your donkeys, on your camels, on your cattle, and on your flocks of sheep and goats.
\v 4 But I, Yahweh, will not treat the livestock that belongs to the Israelite people the same as yours. You will see that none of the livestock that belongs to the Israelite people will die."

\c 9
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh and tell him, 'Thus says Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, "Let my people go, that they may worship me."
\v 2 For if you refuse to let them go, and will hold them still,
\v 3 then the hand of Yahweh will be on your cattle that are in the field, on the horses, the donkeys, the camels, the herds, and the flocks, with a terrible disease.
\v 4 Yahweh will distinguish between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt; nothing will die of all that belongs to the Israelites.
