<usfm>
\v 15 By now I could have reached out with my hand and attacked you and your people with disease, and you would have been eradicated from the land.
\v 16 However, it was for this reason that I allowed you to survive: in order to show you my power, so that my name may be spread throughout all the earth.
\v 17 You are still vaunting yourself against my people by not letting them go.
</usfm>
