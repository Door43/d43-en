===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 By now I could have reached out with my hand and attacked you and your people with disease, and you would have been eradicated from the land.
\v 16 But it was for this reason I allowed you to survive: in order to show you my power, so that my name may be proclaimed throughout all the earth.
\v 17 You are still lifting yourself up against my people by not letting them go.
