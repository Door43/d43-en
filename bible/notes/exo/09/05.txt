===== translationNotes: =====

  * **fixed a time** - "set a time" or "appointed a time"
  * **all the cattle of Egypt died** - This is exaggerated to emphasize the seriousness of the event. There were still some animals alive that were afflicted by later plagues. However, it may be best to translate this with the word "all." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **cattle of Egypt** - Here "Egypt" refers to the people of Egypt. AT: "the cattle belonging to the people of Egypt" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Pharaoh investigated** - Pharaoh collected facts about the situation.
  * **behold** - The word "behold" here shows that Pharaoh was surprised by what he saw.
  * **his heart was stubborn** - Here "heart" refers to Pharaoh. AT: "he refused to change his mind" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
