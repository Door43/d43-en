\v 34 Yahweh said to Moses, "Take spices—stacte, onycha, and galbanum—sweet spices along with pure frankincense, each in equal amounts.
\v 35 Make it into the form of incense, blended by a perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy, reserved for me.
\v 36 You will grind it into a very fine mixture. Put part of it in front of the ark of the covenant decrees, which is in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with you. You will regard it as most holy.
