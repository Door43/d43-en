\v 11 Yahweh spoke to Moses,
\v 12 "When you take a census of the Israeites, then each will give a ransom for his life to Yahweh. This you will do when you count them, so that there  will be no plague among them, when you count them.
\v 13 Every one who is counted in the census is to pay half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is twenty gerahs)—half a shekel for an offering to Yahweh.
\v 14 Every one who is counted, from twenty years old and up, will give this offering to Yahweh.
