<usfm> \p \v 11 Yahweh spoke to Moses, \v 12 "When you take a census of the Israelites, then each person must give a ransom for his life to me. You must do this after you count them, so that there will be no plague among them when you count them. \v 13 Everyone who is counted in the census is to pay half a shekel of silver, according to the weight of the shekel of the sanctuary (a shekel is the same as twenty gerahs).This half shekel will be an offering to me, Yahweh. \v 14 Everyone who is counted, from twenty years old and up, must give this offering to me. </usfm>
