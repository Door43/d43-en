Yahweh shifts to instructing Moses in the construction worship equipment.
  * **You must make** - Here "you" refers to Moses and the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **Its horns must be made** - See how you translated "horns" in [[en:bible:notes:exo:27:01|27:2]]. AT: "You must make its horns" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
