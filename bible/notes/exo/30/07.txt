<usfm>
\v 7 Aaron must burn fragrant incense every morning. He must burn it when he tends the lamps.
\v 8 When Aaron lights the lamps again in the evening, he must burn incense on the incense altar. This must be a regular burning of incense before me, Yahweh, throughout your people's generations.
\v 9 But you must offer no other incense on the incense altar, nor any burnt offering or grain offering. You must pour no drink offering on it.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do.

  * **throughout your people's generations** - "through all the generations of your descendants." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:12:12|12:14]].
  * **But you must offer** - Though the word "you" is addressed to Moses, the instruction is given specifically to Aaron and his descendants as to when and what they are to offer on the altar of incense.
