\v 7 Aaron must burn fragrant  incense every morning. He must burn it when he tends the lamps.
\v 8 When Aaron lights the lamps again in the evening, he must burn incense on the incense altar. This must be a regular burning of incense before me, Yahweh, throughout your people's generations.

===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do.

  * **throughout your people's generations** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:exo:12:12|12:14]].
  * **But you must offer** - Though the word "you" is addressed to Moses, it's instruction is specifically to Aaron and his descendants as to when and what they are to offer on the altar of incense.
