====== Exodus 30:32-33 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 32 You must not pour it on the bodies of people who are not priests, and you must not make other oil to be like it by mixing those same things. This oil is sacred, and you must consider it to be sacred.'
\v 33 I will consider that anyone who makes ointment like this \add for any other purpose\add*, and anyone who puts any of this ointment on someone who is not a priest, no longer belongs to my people."

</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 32 You must not pour it on the bodies of people who are not priests, and you must not make other oil to be like it by mixing those same things. This oil is reserved for me, and you must consider it to be such.
\v 33 Yahweh will view anyone who makes ointment like this for any other purpose, or anyone who puts any of this ointment on someone who is not a priest, as no longer belonging to his people.'"

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 32 It must not be applied to people's skin, nor must you make any oil like it with the same formula, because it is set apart to Yahweh. You must regard it in this manner.
\v 33 Whoever makes perfume like it, or whoever puts any of it on someone, that person must be cut off from his people.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues telling Moses what Moses must tell the people.

  * **It must not be applied to people's skin** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "You must not put the anointing oil that is dedicated to Yahweh on a person's skin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **with the same formula** - "with the same ingredients" or "with the same items"
  * **that person must be cut off from his people** - The metaphor "cut off" has at least three possible meanings. They can be expressed in active form: 1) "I will no longer consider him to be one of the people of Israel" 2)  "the people of Israel must send him away" or 3) "the people of Israel must kill him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
