\v 25 Moses saw that the people were running wild, for Aaron had let them get out of control to the secret delight of their enemies.
\v 26 Then Moses stood at the gate of the camp, and said, "Whoever is on Yahweh's side, come to me." All the Levites gathered themselves around him.
\v 27 He said to them, "Yahweh says this: the God of Israel, 'Let each man fasten his sword on his side and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and kill every man his brother, his companion, and his
neighbor.'"
