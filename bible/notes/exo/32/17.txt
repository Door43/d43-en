===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **he said to Moses** - It is assumed that Joshua did not go into the cloud with Moses (See: [[en:bible:notes:exo:24:16|24:18]]). It is assumed that Joshua joined Moses at this point on the side of the mountain and finished coming down together (see:  [[en:bible:notes:exo:24:12|24:13]]). (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
