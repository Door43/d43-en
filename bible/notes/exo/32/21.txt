\v 21 Then Moses said to Aaron, "What did this people do to you, that you have brought such a great sin on them?"
\v 22 Aaron said, "Do not let your anger burn hot, my master. You know these people, how they are set on doing evil.
\v 23 They said to me, 'Make us a god who will go before us. As for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him.'
\v 24 So I said to them, 'Whoever has any gold, let him take it off. They gave me the gold and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf.'"

===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **let your anger burn hot** - "become very angry"
  * **I threw it into the fire and out came this calf** - instead of taking ownership for making the calf, Aaron claims the calf came out of the fire supernaturally.
