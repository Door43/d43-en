\v 21 Then Moses said to Aaron, "What did this people do to you, that you have brought such a great sin on them?"
\v 22 Aaron said, "Do not let your anger burn hot, my master. You know these people, how they are set on doing evil.
\v 23 They said to me, 'Make us a god who will go before us. As for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him.'
\v 24 So I said to them, 'Whoever has any gold, let him take it off.' They gave me the gold and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **you have brought such a great sin on them** - Moses spoke of causing people to sin as if sin were an object and Aaron put it on them. AT: "you have caused them to sin so terribly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Do not let your anger burn hot** - Aaron spoke of Moses' anger as if it were a fire that could burn. "Do not be so angry" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **they are set on doing evil** - Being determined to do evil is spoken of as being on evil. AT: "they are determined to do what is evil" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **this Moses** - People showed disrespect by putting the word "this" before his name, as if Moses were someone they did not know and could not trust.
  * **I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf** - Instead of taking ownership for making the calf, Aaron claims the calf came out of the fire supernaturally.
