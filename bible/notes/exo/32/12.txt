\v 12 Do not \add do anything that would\add* allow the people of Egypt to say, 'Their god led them out from our country, but \add he did that\add* only \add because he wanted\add* to kill them in the mountains and get rid of them completely\f + \ft rhetorical question \f*!' Stop being so angry! Change your mind\f + \ft Or: Do not do what you have told me that you will do \f*! Do not do to your people this terrible thing \add that you have just said that you will do\add*!
\v 13 Think about your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. You solemnly promised to them, saying, 'I will enable you to have as many descendants as the stars that are in the sky.' You said to them, 'I will give to your descendants all the land that I am promising to give them. It will be their land forever.'~"
\p
\v 14 So Yahweh changed his mind. He did not do to his people the terrible thing that he said he would do.

\v 12 Why should the Egyptians say, 'He led them out with evil intent, to kill them in the mountains and to destroy them from the face of the earth?' Turn from your burning anger and relent from this punishment on your people.
\v 13 Call to mind Abraham and Isaac and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self and said to them, 'I will make your descendants as many as the stars in the heavens, and I will give to your descendants all this land of which I have spoken. They will inherit it forever.'"
\v 14 Then Yahweh relented from the punishment that he had said he would inflict on his people.
