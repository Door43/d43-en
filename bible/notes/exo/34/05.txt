\v 5 Yahweh came down in the cloud and stood with Moses there, and he pronounced the name "Yahweh."
\v 6 Yahweh passed by before him and proclaimed, "Yahweh, Yahweh, God is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in covenant faithfulness and trustworthiness,
\v 7 keeping covenant faithfulness for thousands of generations, forgiving iniquities, transgressions, and sins. But he will by no means clear the guilty. He will bring the punishment for the fathers' sin on their children and on their children's children, as far as the third and fourth generations."
