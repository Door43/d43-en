\v 5 Yahweh came down in the cloud and stood with Moses there, and he pronounced the name "Yahweh."
\v 6 Yahweh passed by before him and proclaimed, "Yahweh, Yahweh, God is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in covenant faithfulness and trustworthiness,
\v 7 keeping covenant faithfulness for thousands of generations, forgiving iniquities, transgressions, and sins. But he will by no means clear the guilty. He will bring the punishment for the fathers' sin on their children and on their children’s children, as far as the third and fourth generations."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **stood with Moses there** - "stood with Moses on the mountain"
  * **he pronounced the name** - "he spoke the name." Here "he" refers to Yahweh.
  * **God is merciful and gracious** - "God is fully of mercy and grace"
  * **and abounding in** - "and always shows" or "and is full of"
  * **covenant faithfulness** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:exo:20:04|20:6]]
  * **But he will** - Yahweh is speaking about himself.
  * **he will by no means clear the guilty** - This means that God will surely punish those who are guilty. AT: “he will punish those who are guilty.” (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
