===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 But be careful that you do not make a covenant to live peacefully with any of the people who live in the land into which you are going because if you do that, you will begin to do the evil things that they do. It will be like falling into a trap.
\v 13 You must tear down their altars, destroy their idols, and cut down the poles that they use to worship Asherah.
\v 14 You must worship only me, and not worship any other god because I, Yahweh, always guard my honor, and I will not allow you to worship any other gods.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 Be careful not to make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going, or they will become a trap among you.
\v 13 Instead, you must break down their altars, smash their sacred stone pillars, and cut down their Asherah poles.
\v 14 For you must worship no other god, for I, Yahweh, whose name is 'Jealous,' am a jealous God.

===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do.
  * **they will become a trap among you**  - This emphasizes that they will cause the people of Israel to sin.  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **whose name is 'Jealous'** - it is a part of God's character that he actively pursues to guard his people from worshiping other god's before him.
