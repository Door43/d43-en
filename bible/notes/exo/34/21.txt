===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do.

  * **Even at plowing time and in harvest** - "Even when you are preparing the soil or gathering the crops"
  * **Festival of Ingathering** - This festival was also known as the Festival of Shelters or the Festival of Booths. The idea came from the practice of the farmers living in temporary booths, or huts, out in the fields to guard the crop as it ripened. The word "Ingathering" means when they harvest their crop.
