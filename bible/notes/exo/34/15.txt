\v 15 Do not make peace agreements with \add any group\add* that lives in that land. When they worship their gods and offer sacrifices to their gods, and they invite you to join them, do not join them. If \add you join them\add*, you will eat the food that they sacrifice to their gods, and \add you will not be faithful to me. You will be like people who\add* commit adultery, \add who are not being faithful to their spouses\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 16 If you take some of their women to be wives for your sons, and these women worship their own gods, they will persuade your sons also to worship their gods.
\p
\v 17 Do not pour melted metal into molds to make statues for you to worship.

\v 15 Do not make a covenant to live peacefully with any group that lives in that land. When they worship their gods and offer sacrifices to them and invite you to join them, do not join them. If you join them, you will eat the food that they sacrifice to their gods, and you will not be faithful to me. You will be like women who commit adultery, who are not faithful to their husbands.
\v 16 If you take some of their women to be wives for your sons, these women will worship their own gods, and they will also make your sons worship their gods.
\p
\v 17 Do not pour melted metal into molds to make statues to worship.

<usfm>
\v 15 So be careful not to make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, for they prostitute themselves to their gods, and they sacrifice to their gods. Then one of them will invite you and you will eat some of his sacrifice,
\v 16 and then you will even take some of his daughters for your sons, and his daughters will prostitute themselves to their gods, and they will make your sons prostitute themselves to their gods.
\v 17 Do not make for yourselves gods of molten metal.
