\v 15 Do not make a covenant to live peacefully with any group that lives in that land. When they worship their gods and offer sacrifices to them and invite you to join them, do not join them. If you join them, you will eat the food that they sacrifice to their gods, and you will not be faithful to me. You will be like women who commit adultery, who are not faithful to their husbands.
\v 16 If you take some of their women to be wives for your sons, these women will worship their own gods, and they will also make your sons worship their gods.

\v 17 Do not pour melted metal into molds to make statues to worship.

\v 15 Do not make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land. They commit adultery and go after their gods and sacrifice to their gods, and they will invite you and you eat some of their sacrifices.
\v 16 If so, you will even take some of their daughters for your sons, and their daughters will commit adultery and go after their own gods, and they will make your sons commit adultery and go after their gods.
\v 17 You must mold no idols for yourselves.

===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues to tell Moses what the people must do.
  * **commit adultery and go after their gods** - This compares Yahweh to a husband and the people to his wife. If they worship other gods it is like a wife who is unfaithful to her husband. AT: "worship other gods" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **You must mold no idols** - "You must not make idols"
