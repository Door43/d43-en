===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **found favor in your sight** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:exo:33:12|33:12]].
  * **my Lord** - The Hebrew here actually is "my Lord," and not "Yahweh."
  * **please go among us** - Here "us" refers to Moses and the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
  * **our iniquity and our sin** - The words "iniquity" and "sin" mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
