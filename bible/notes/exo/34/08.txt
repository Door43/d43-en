  * **our iniquity and our sin** - The words "iniquity" and "sin" mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. AT: "all our sins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **take us as your inheritance** - Something that someone possesses forever is spoken of as if it were something that they had inherited. AT: "take us as the people that you possess forever" or "accept us as the people who belong to you forever" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
