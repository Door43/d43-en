===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do.

  * **buy back** - Firstborn sons and firstborn donkeys belonged to Yahweh, but Yahweh did not want them sacrificed to Him. Instead, the Israelites were to sacrifice a lamb in their place. This allowed the Israelites to “buy” the donkeys and sons from Yahweh.
  * **no one may appear before me empty-handed** - "no one may come to me without an offering." AT: "Every person who comes to me must bring an offering" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
