\v 24 Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, "Go worship Yahweh. Even your families may go with you, but your flocks and herds must remain behind."
\v 25 But Moses said, "You must also give us animals for sacrifices and burnt offerings so that we may sacrifice them to Yahweh our God.
\v 26 Our cattle must also go with us; not a hoof of them may be left behind, for we must take them to worship Yahweh our God. For we do not know with what we must worship Yahweh until we arrive there."
