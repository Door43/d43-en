===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart** - Here "heart" refers to Pharaoh. His stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his heart was hard. AT: "caused Pharaoh to became more defiant." See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:07:11|7:13]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
