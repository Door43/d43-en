It is clear that you are wickedly planning \add not to return\add*.
\v 11 So no, \add I will not let you all go\add*. \add The Israelite\add* men may go \add and worship Yahweh\add*, if that is what you want." Then the king expelled them\f + \ft Or: us \f* from \add his palace\add*.

\v 9 Moses replied, "We all need to go, everyone, including those who are young and those who are old. We need to take our sons, our daughters, and our flocks of sheep, goats, and herds of livestock because we must have a festival to honor Yahweh."
\p
\v 10 So the king replied, "I never want Yahweh to help you, and I myself will never let you take your children and your wives with you! It is clear that you are planning not to return.
\v 11 So, no, I will not let you all go. The Israelite men may go and worship Yahweh if that is what you want." Then the king drove Moses and Aaron from his palace.

\v 10 Pharaoh said to them, "May Yahweh indeed be with you, if I ever let you go and your little ones go. Look, you have some evil in mind.
\v 11 No! Go, just the men among you, and worship Yahweh, for that is what you want." Then Moses and Aaron were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.
