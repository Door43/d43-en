\v 14 The locusts went through all the land of Egypt and infested all parts of it. So many locusts had never before been in the land and never will be again.
\v 15 They covered the surface of the whole land so that it was darkened. They ate every plant in the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left. Throughout all the land of Egypt, no living green plant remained, nor any tree or plant in the fields.
