\v 14  The locusts went through all the land of Egypt and infested all the territory of Egypt; so many locusts had never before been in the land, and never will be again.
\v 15 For they covered the face of the whole earth so that the land was darkened. They ate every plant of the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left, and there did not remain any green thing, either tree or plant of the field, through all the land of Egypt.
