===== translationNotes: =====

  * **In the third month ... on the same day** - This means they arrived at the wilderness on the first day of the month just as they left Egypt on the first day of the month. The first day of the third month on the Hebrew calendar is near the middle of May on Western calendars. AT: "In the third month ... on the first day of the month." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_hebrewmonths]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **had gone out from** - "had left"
  * **Rephidim** - This is an area on the edge of the wilderness of Sinai where the people of Israel had been camping. See how you translated this name in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:17:01|17:1]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
