\v 4 'You have seen what I did to the Egyptians. You have seen \add what I did for you\add* and how I brought you here to me. It was as though I \add lifted you up as\add* an eagle \add carries its young eaglets\add* on its wings \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 5 So now, if you will do what I tell you and obey all that I command you, you will be my own people. All the people-groups on the earth are mine, but you will be dearer\f + \ft Or: more special \f* to me than all the other people-groups.
\v 6 You will be people over whom I will rule, and you will all be like priests\f + \ft Or: represent me to other nations as priests represent me to one nation \f* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, and you will be completely dedicated to me.' That is what you must tell the Israelite people."

\v 6 You will be people over whom I will rule, and you will be a kingdom where everyone will worship me like priests, and you will be a nation only for me.' That is what you must tell the Israelite people."

\v 3 Moses went up to God. Yahweh called to him from the mountain and said, "You must tell the house of Jacob, the people of Israel:
\v 4 You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, how I carried you on eagles’ wings and brought you to myself.
\v 5 Now then, if you obediently listen to my voice and keep my covenant, then you will be my special possession from among all peoples, for all the earth is mine.
\v 6 You will be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation for me. These are the words that you must speak to the people of Israel."
