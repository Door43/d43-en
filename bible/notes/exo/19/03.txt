\v 3 Moses went up to God. Yahweh called to him from the mountain and said, "You must tell the house of Jacob, the people of Israel:
\v 4 You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, how I carried you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself.
\v 5 Now then, if you obediently listen to my voice and keep my covenant, then you will be my special possession from among all peoples, for all the earth is mine.
\v 6 You will be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation for me. These are the words that you must speak to the people of Israel."
