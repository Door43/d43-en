\v 23 Moses said to Yahweh, "The people cannot come up to the mountain, for you commanded us: 'Set boundaries around the mountain and set it apart to Yahweh.'"
\v 24 Yahweh said to him, "Go, get down the mountain, and bring up Aaron with you, but do not let the priests and the people break through the barrier to come up to me, or I will attack them."
\v 25 So Moses went down to the people and spoke to them.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **get down** - "go down"
  * **break through the barrier** - God spoke about walking past the boundary as if they might break down a barrier and walk through it. AT: "go beyond the boundary" or "go through the barrier." See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:exo:19:19|19:21]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
