\v 19 When the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him in a voice.
\v 20 Yahweh came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain, and he summoned Moses to the top. So Moses went up.
\v 21 Yahweh said to Moses, "Go down and warn the people not to break through to me to look, or many of them will perish.
\v 22 Let the priests also who come near to me set themselves apart—prepare themselves for my coming—so that I do not attack them."
