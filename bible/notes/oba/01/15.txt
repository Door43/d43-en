\v 15 For the day of Yahweh is near upon all the nations. As you have done, it will be done to you; your deeds will
return on your own head.
\v 16 For as you have drunk on my holy mountain, so will all the nations drink continually. They will drink, and
swallow, and it will be as though they had never existed.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues giving Obadiah his message to Edom.

  * **For the day of Yahweh is near upon all the nations**  - "Soon the time will come when Yahweh will show all the nations that he is Lord."
  * **As you have done, it will be done to you**  - "I will do to you the same things that you did to others." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **your deeds will return on your own head**  - AT: "you will suffer the consequences for the things you have done." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom|Idiom]])
  * **For as you**  - The word "you" to the people of Edom.
  * **as you have drunk**  - The prophets describe people whom Yahweh punished as drinking the punishment from Yahweh AT: "as I have punished you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **my holy mountain**  - This was a way of referring to Jerusalem.
  * **will all the nations drink continually**  - AT: "I will punish all of the nations without stopping." Yahweh punished Jerusalem, but he stopped before he destroyed all of the people. However, he will punish the rest of the nations until they no longer exist.
