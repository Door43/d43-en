Yahweh continues giving Obadiah his message to Edom.

  * **you will be covered with shame** - "you will be completely ashamed"
  * **will be cut off forever** - "will never exist again." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **stood aloof** - "watched and did nothing to help"
  * **strangers** - people from other nations
  * **his wealth** - The word "his" refers to "Jacob," which is another way of referring to the people of Israel.
  * **cast lots upon Jerusalem** - This phrase means "they cast lots to decide who would get the valuable things that they took from Jerusalem." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
