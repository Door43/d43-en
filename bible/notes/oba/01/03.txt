\v 3 The pride of your heart has deceived you, you who live in the clefts of the rock, in your lofty home; who
say in your heart, "Who will bring me down to the ground?"
\v 4 Though you tower high like the eagle, and though your nest is set among the stars, I will bring you down from there,
says Yahweh.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Obadiah's vision concerning Edom continues.

  * **The pride of your heart** - Yahweh uses the part of a person's body that is associated with emotions to refer to the people of Edom feeling pride. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **in the clefts of the rock** - "in the cracks in the rock"
  * **in your lofty home** - "in your home that was built in a high place"
  * **Who will bring me down to the ground?** - This question is showing how the Edomites were proud and felt safe. AT: "I am safe from all attackers." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Though you tower high like the eagle, and though your nest is set among the stars** - Both of these phrases are saying Edom is built much higher than possible, to say it was built in a very high place. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]], [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **tower ** - to be much taller than other things.
  * **I will bring you down from there** - Pride is associated with height and humility is associated with being low.  Yahweh says he will bring Edom down to say he will humble it. AT: "I will humble you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
