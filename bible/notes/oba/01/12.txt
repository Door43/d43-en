\v 12 But do not gloat over your brother's day,  in the day of his misfortune, and do not rejoice over the children of Judah in the
day of their destruction; do not boast in the day of their distress.
\v 13 Do not enter my people's gate in the day of their calamity; do not gloat over their affliction in the day of
their calamity, neither lay you hands on their substance in the day of their calamity.
\v 14 And stand you not in the crossway, to cut off those of his that escape; and deliver not up those of his that remain in
the day of distress.
