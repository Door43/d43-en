\v 12 But do not gloat over your brother's day,  in the day of his misfortune, and do not rejoice over the people of Judah in the
day of their destruction; do not boast in the day of their distress.
\v 13 Do not enter my people's gate in the day of their calamity; do not gloat over their affliction in the day of
their disaster, do not loot their wealth in the day of their ruin.
\v 14 And do not stand at the crossroads, to cut off his fugitives; and do not hand over his survivors in the day of distress.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues giving Obadiah his message to Edom.
  * **do not gloat over** - "do not be happy because of" or "do not take pleasure in"
  * **your brother's** - This was a way of referring to the people of Israel because Jacob and Esau were brothers.
  * **day** - AT: "day of punishment" or "time of punishment." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **misfortune** - "disaster" or "trouble"
  * **in the day of their destruction** - "in the day that their enemies destroy them"
  * **in the day of their distress** - "because of the time that they are suffering"
  * **calamity..disaster...ruin** - These are all different translations of the same word. Translators should use one word to translate all three of these.
  * **over their affliction** - "because of the bad things that happen to them"
  * **do not loot their wealth** - "do not take their wealth" "or "do not steal their wealth"
  * **crossroads** - a place where two roads come together
  * **to cut off his fugitives** - "to kill the people of Israel who are trying to escape" or "to catch those who were trying to escape" (UDB)
  * **do not hand over his survivors** - "do not capture those who are still alive and give them to their enemies"
