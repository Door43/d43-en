===== Translation Notes: =====

The prophet Obadiah has told Edom that God would punish them as well as the nations that had treated Israel badly.

  * **those that escape **- The word "those" refers to those that escape God's wrath in the day of Yahweh's wrath.
  * **the house of Jacob shall possess their own possessions**  - whatever God gave as a heritage to the children of Abraham, he will restore to them when they return from this last exile.
  * **The house of Jacob will be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame**  - 1) These phrases liken the descendants of Jacob and his son Joseph to a fire that will destroy the Edomites. 2) The phrases show that God would avenge the cruelty caused by the house of Esau on the descendants of Jacob. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and the house of Esau will be stubble **- The Edomites are likened to stubble that is easily burned and destroyed.
  * **stubble**  - The word "stubble" refers to stumps of grain and other stalks left in the ground when the crop is cut.
