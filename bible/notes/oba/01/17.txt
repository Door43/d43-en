\v 17 But in Mount Zion there will be those that escape, and it will be holy; and the house of Jacob shall possess their own
possessions.
\v 18 The house of Jacob will be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau will be stubble, and they will burn them, and consume them. There will be no survivors to the house of Esau, for Yahweh has spoken it.

  * **and it** - The word "it" refers to "mount Zion."
  * **house of Jacob ... Joseph a flame** - Yahweh compares the houses of Jacob and Joseph to fire because they will destroy Esau like a fire that quickly and completely burns up straw. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **stubble** - "straw" or "chaff." The dry pieces of plant that are left after grain is harvested.
  * **and they** - The word "they" refers to the house of Jacob and the house of Joseph.
  * **will burn them** - The word "them" refers to the descendants of Esau, who are the nation of Edom.
