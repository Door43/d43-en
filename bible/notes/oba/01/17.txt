\v 17 But in Mount Zion there will be those that escape, and it will be holy; and the house of Jacob shall possess their own
possessions.
\v 18 The house of Jacob will be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau will be stubble, and they will burn them, and consume them. There will be no survivors to the house of Esau, for Yahweh has spoken it.
