=== What is the Book of Obadiah about? ===

After Jerusalem was destroyed, the Edomites captured fleeing people and gave them to Babylon. The Edomites came under Yahweh's judgment for mistreating the children of Israel. The book was intended to give comfort to the people of Judah in exile.

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may decide to translate this traditional title, "The Book of Obadiah," in a way that is more clear to the readers. They may decide to call it, "The Sayings of Obadiah." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]) 

=== Who wrote the Book of Obadiah? ===

Obadiah probably wrote this book. We know nothing more about the writer than that his name in Hebrew means, "Servant of Yahweh."

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====
===What was Edom's relationship to Israel?===

Obadiah refers to Edom as Israel's brother. This is because the Edomites were descendants of Esau, while the Israelite's were descendants of Jacob (Esau's brother). This made Edom's betray of Israel much worse.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== How do I translate the concept of "pride"? ===

Pride is a major issue in Obadiah. This word is usually used in reference to people. When Obadiah speaks about the "pride" of Edom, this means that the nation thought they were more powerful than Yahweh and that he would not or was not able to punish them.
