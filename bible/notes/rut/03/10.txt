\v 10 Boaz said, "My daughter, may you be blessed by Yahweh. You have showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, because you have not gone after any of the young men, whether poor or rich.
\v 11 And now, my daughter, do not be afraid! I will do for you all that you say, because all the city of my people knows that you are a worthy woman.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **my daughter** - Boaz used this expression as a sign of respect toward Ruth as a younger woman.
  * **more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning** - "even more kindness now than before"
  * **more kindness in the latter end** - This refers to Ruth asking Boaz to marry her. By marrying Naomi's relative, Ruth would provide for Naomi and demonstrate great kindness to Naomi.
  * **at the beginning** - This refers to the way Ruth had earlier provided for her mother-in-law by staying with her and gleaning grain for food for them.
  * **because you have not gone after** - "you have not pursued marrying" Ruth could have ignored Naomi's need and looked for a husband for herself outside of Naomi's relatives. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
