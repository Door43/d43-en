  * **more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning**  - "even more kindness now than before"
  * **more kindness in the later end**  - This refers to Ruth asking Boaz to marry her. By marrying Naomi's relative, Ruth would provide for Naomi and demonstrate great kindness to Naomi.
  * **because you have not gone after **- "instead of goin after." Ruth could have ignored Naomi's need and looked for a husband for herself outside of Naomi's relatives.
  * **at the beginning**  - This refers to the way Ruth had earlier provided for her mother-in-law by staying with her and gleaning grain for food for them.
