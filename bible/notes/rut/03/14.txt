\v 14 So she lay at his feet until morning. But she got up and left before it was light enough that people would be able to recognize her, because Boaz said, "It would be best if no one knows that a woman was here."
\v 15 He also said to her, "Bring to me your cloak and spread it out." When she did that, he poured into it a generous amount of barley and put it on her back. Then he went into town.

\v 14 So she lay at his feet until the morning. But she rose up before anyone could recognize another. For he had said, "Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor."
\v 15 Then he said, "Bring your shawl, and hold it out." And when she did, he measured six large measures of barley into it, and put it on her. And he went into the city.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **six large measures of barley**  - The Hebrew does not specify the weight or volume, but as the dynamic version implies, it was enough to show that Boaz was being generous to her. It could likely have been almost as much as she was strong enough to carry.
  * **And he went into the city**  - Most manuscripts have "he went", but some have "she went". English versions are divided. The preferred choice is "he went".
  * **put it on her **  - That is Boaz gave Ruth the barley to carry home
  * **shawl - **  a piece of fabric worn over the shoulders.
  * **recognize - ** identify.
  * **bold words**  - explanation
