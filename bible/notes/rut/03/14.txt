\v 14 So she lay at his feet until morning. But she got up and left before it was light enough that people would be able to recognize her, because Boaz said, "It would be best if no one knows that a woman was here."
\v 15 He also said to her, "Bring to me your cloak and spread it out." When she did that, he poured into it a generous amount of barley and put it on her back. Then he went into town.

\v 14 So she lay at his feet until the morning. But she rose up before anyone could recognize another person. For Boaz had said, "Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor."
\v 15 Then Boaz said, "Bring your shawl and hold it out." When she did so, he measured six large measures of barley into it, and put the load on her. Then he went into the city.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **before anyone could recognize another person**  - AT: "while it was still dark."
  * **shawl**  - a piece of cloth worn over the shoulders.
  * **six large measures of barley**  - The actual amount is not stated. It was enough to be considered generous, yet small enough for Ruth to carry alone. Some think it was about 30 kilograms.
  * **put it on her**  - The amount of grain was so great that Ruth needed help picking it up to carry it.
  * **Then he went into the city**  - Most manuscripts have "he went," but some have "she went". English versions are divided. The preferred choice is "he went."
