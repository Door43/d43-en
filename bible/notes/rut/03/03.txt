\v 3 Therefore, clean up, put on your perfume, change your clothes, and go down to the threshing floor. But do not make yourself known to the man, until he finishes eating and drinking.
\v 4 And make sure, when he lies down, that you remember the place where he lies down so that later you can go to him, uncover his feet, and lie down there. Then he will tell you what to do."
