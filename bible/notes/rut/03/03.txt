\v 3 Therefore, clean up, put on your perfume, change your clothes, and go down to the threshing floor. But do not make yourself known to the man until he finishes eating and drinking.
\v 4 And make sure, when he lies down, that you remember the place where he lies down so that later you can go to him, uncover his feet, and lie down there. Then he will tell you what to do."
\v 5 Ruth said to Naomi, "I will do everything you say."

  * **uncover his feet**  - to remove the cloak or blanket covering his feet so that they would be exposed to the cold.
  * **Lie down there**  - "lie down at his feet"
  * **Then he will tell you what to do.** - The specific custom of that time is unclear, but this is usually understood as culturally acceptable way for a woman to tell a man that she was willing to marry him. Boaz would understand the custom and accept or reject her offer. 
  * **Then he will** - "When he wakes up, he will"
