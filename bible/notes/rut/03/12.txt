\v 12 But there is one problem. Although it is true that I am a close relative of your mother's dead husband, there is another man who is an even closer relative than I am, and therefore he is really the one who is responsible for you.
\v 13 You stay here for the rest of the night. Tomorrow morning I will tell this man about you. If he says that he will take responsibility for you, fine, we will let him marry you. But if he is not willing to do that, I solemnly promise that as surely as Yahweh lives, I will marry you and take care of you. So stay here until it is morning."

\v 12 Now it is true that I am a near kinsman; however there is a kinsman nearer than I.
\v 13 Stay here tonight, and in the morning, if he will perform for you the part of a kinsman, good, let him do the kinsman's part. But if he will not do the part of a kinsman for you, then I will do the part of a kinsman for you, by the life of Yahweh. Lie down until the morning."

===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **kinsman nearer than I** - It was the duty of the closest male relative to help the widow.
  * **do the part of a kinsman** - This phrase translates a single Hebrew word. It means "marry you and father children for your dead husband."
  * **by the life of Yahweh** - "as surely as Yahweh lives." This was a common form of a Hebrew vow.
