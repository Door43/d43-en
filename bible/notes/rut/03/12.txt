\v 12 But \add there is one problem\add*. Although it is true that I am a close relative \add of your mother's dead husband\add*, there is another man who is a closer relative \add than I am\add*, and therefore he should be the one to \add marry you and\add* take care of you.
\v 13 You stay here for the rest of this night. Tomorrow morning \add I will tell this man about you\add*. If he says that he will \add marry you and\add* take are of you, fine, \add we will\add* let him do that. But if he is not willing \add to do that\add*, I solemnly promise that as surely as Yahweh lives, I will \add marry you and\add* take are of you. So lie\f + \ft Or: sleep \f* here until it is morning."

\v 12 But there is one problem. Although it is true that I am a close relative of your mother's dead husband, there is another man who is an even closer relative than I am, and therefore he is really the one who is responsible for you.
\v 13 You stay here for the rest of the night. Tomorrow morning I will tell this man about you. If he says that he will take responsibility for you, fine, we will let him marry you. But if he is not willing to do that, I solemnly promise that as surely as Yahweh lives, I will marry you and take care of you. So stay here until it is morning."

\v 12 Now it is true that I am a near kinsman; however, there is a kinsman nearer than I.
\v 13 Stay here tonight, and in the morning, if he will perform for you the duty of a kinsman, good, let him do the kinsman's duty. But if he will not do the duty of a kinsman for you, then I will do it, by the life of Yahweh. Lie down until the morning."
