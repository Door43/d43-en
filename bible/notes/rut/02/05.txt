\v 6 The foreman replied, "She is the woman from Moab who returned from there with her mother-in-law Naomi.
\v 7 She said to me, 'Please let me pick up some grain. I will only walk behind the men who are harvesting the grain and gather what they leave.' I gave her permission, and she has been working in the field from this morning until now. She has only taken a short rest, when she rested in the shelter."

\v 5 Then Boaz said to his servant that was supervising the reapers, "What man does this young woman belong to?"
\v 6 The servant supervising the reapers answered and said, "It is the young Moabite woman who came back with Naomi from the land of Moab.
\v 7 She said to me, 'Please let me glean and gather ears of grain as I follow behind the reapers.' So she came here and has continued from the morning until now, except that she rested a little in the house."
