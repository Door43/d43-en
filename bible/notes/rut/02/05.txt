\v 5 Then Boaz said to his servant who was supervising the reapers, "What man does this young woman belong to?"
\v 6 The servant supervising the reapers answered and said, "It is the young Moabite woman who came back with Naomi from the land of Moab.
\v 7 She said to me, 'Please let me glean and gather after the reapers.' So she came here and has continued from the morning until now, except that she rested a little in the house."
