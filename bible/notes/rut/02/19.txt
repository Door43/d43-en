\v 19 Her mother-in-law asked her, "Where did you gather all this grain today? In whose field exactly did you work? May God do good to the man who was so kind to you." Then Ruth told her about where she had been working. She said, "The name of that field's owner is Boaz."
\v 20 Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, "May Yahweh bless him! He has not stopped acting kindly toward us, who are still living, and to our husbands who have died." Then she added, "That man is a close relative of Elimelech; in fact, he is one of those responsible for taking care of us."

\v 20 Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, "May he be blessed by Yahweh, who has not left off his loyalty to the living and to the dead." Naomi said to her, "That man is near of kin to us, one of our kinsmen-redeemers."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **"Where have you gleaned today. Where did you go to work?**  - The Hebrews often repeated thing in different words as a way of emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]])
  * **who not left off his loyalty**  - "has continued to be loyal." Boaz remembered his obligations to Naomi as a family member. But here, Naomi is probably referring to Yahweh, who was acting through Boaz in order to show his favor and kindness to them in their need.
  * **to the living**  - "to the people who are still living." Naomi and Ruth were the "living."
  * **the dead**  - "the people who have already died." Naomi's husband and sons were the "dead."
  * **near kin to us, one of our kinsmen-redeemers**  - The second phrase repeats and expands the first. This is a Hebrew style of emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]])
  * **kinsmen-redeemers**  - A kinsman-redeemer was a close male relative that could rescue a childless widow from financial ruin by marrying her and having a child with her. He would also reacquire the land his relatives had lost due to poverty and redeem family members who had sold themselves into slavery.
