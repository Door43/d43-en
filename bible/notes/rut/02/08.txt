\v 8 Then Boaz said to Ruth, "Are you listening to me, my daughter? Do not go and glean in another field; do not  leave my field. Instead, stay here and work with my young women workers.
\v 9 Keep your eyes only on the field where the men are reaping and follow behind the other women. Haven't I instructed the men not to touch you? And when you are thirsty, you may go to the waterpots and drink the water that the men have drawn."
