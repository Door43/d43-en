\v 8 Then Boaz said to Ruth, "Are you listening to me, my daughter? Do not go and glean in another field; do not  leave my field. Instead, stay here and work with my young women workers.
\v 9 Keep your eyes only on the field where the men are reaping and follow behind the other women. Haven't I instructed the men not to touch you? And when you are thirsty, you may go to the waterpots and drink the water that the men have drawn."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Are you listening to me**  - AT: "Listen to me" or "Note well what I am telling you." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **my daughter**  - This was a way of respectfully and kindly addressing a younger woman. Ruth was not the actual daughter of Boaz, so make sure the translation of this does not make it sound like she was.

  * **Haven't I instructed the men **- AT: "I have instructed the young men." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **men**  - "young male workers." This term is used three times to refer to the young men who are harvesting in the field. Some languages can say this using one word and they have a different word that means young women workers.
  * **drawn**  - To "draw water" means to pull up water from a well or to take it out of a storage vessel.
