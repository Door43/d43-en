===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **my daughter**  - This was a way of respectfully and kindly addressing a younger woman. Ruth was not the actual daughter of Boaz, so make sure the translation of this does not make it sound like she was.
  * **Haven't I instructed the men **- That is, "I have instructed the young men". (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:rhetoricalquestion|rhetorical question]])
  * **drawn **  - That is, "brought". To "draw water" means to pull up water from a well or to take it out of a storage vessel.
