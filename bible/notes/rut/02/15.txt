===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **And when she rose up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men** - It is ambiguous if Ruth was still present when Boaz gives commands to his servants. "While she rose" implies she heard the Boaz's commands while she was leaving for the field and "After she rose" implies she had left before fully knowing what Boaz commanded his servants. If you must make a choice, use "After". Given the context of the commands, it is more likely Boaz would have waited until Ruth was far enough away not to hear his instructions. 
  * **even among the sheaves** - "even" here denotes "above and beyond what one normally does." Boaz instructs his workers to let Ruth gleam around the bundles of grain. This area of the field is taboo (off limits) for people gleaning to come near.
  * **you must certainly pull out some sheaves for her from the bundles ** - That is, "you must even take some stalks of grain for her out of the bundles."
  * **do not rebuke**  - That is, "cause her shame" or "dishonor her".
