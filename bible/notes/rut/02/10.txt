\v 10 When he said that, she knelt before him, with her face touching the ground. She exclaimed, "Why are you being so kind to me? I didn't think you would pay any attention to me since I am a foreigner!"
\v 11 Boaz replied, "People have told me about everything you have done for your mother-in-law since your husband died. They told me that you left your parents and your homeland, and you came here to live among people whom you did not know.
\v 12 I pray that Yahweh will repay you for what you have done. May you receive full payment for your actions from the God of Israel, because he is the one you have come to and he will protect you!"

\v 10 Then she  bowed down before Boaz, touching her head to the ground. She said to him, "Why have I found favor in your sight, that you should be concerned about me, a foreigner?"
\v 11 Boaz answered and said to her, "It has been reported to me, all that you have done since the death of your husband. You have left your father, mother, and the land of your birth to follow your mother-in-law and to come to a people you do not know.
\v 12 May Yahweh reward you for your deed. May you receive full payment from Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have found refuge."

  * **It has been reported to me**  - AT: "People have reported to me" or "People have told me." The phrase emphasizes the certainty of the statement.
  * **reward you**  - “repay you” or "pay you back"
  * **May you receive full payment from Yahweh**  - This is a poetic expression that is very similar to the previous sentence. AT: "May Yahweh give back to you even more than you have given." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]])
  * **under whose wings you have found refuge**  - Boaz uses the picture of a mother bird gathering her chicks under her wings to protect them to describe God's protection for those who trust in him.
