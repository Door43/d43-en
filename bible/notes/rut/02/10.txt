\v 10 When he said that, she knelt before him, with her face touching the ground. She exclaimed, "Why are you being so kind to me? I did not think you would pay any attention to me since I am a foreigner!"
\v 11 Boaz replied, "People have told me about everything you have done for your mother-in-law since your husband died. They told me that you left your parents and your homeland, and you came here to live among people whom you did not know.
\v 12 I pray that Yahweh will repay you for what you have done. May you receive full payment for your actions from the God of Israel, because he is the one you have come to and he will protect you!"

\v 10 Then she bowed down before Boaz, touching her head to the ground. She said to him, "Why have I found favor in your sight, that you should be concerned about me, a foreigner?"
\v 11 Boaz answered and said to her, "It has been reported to me, all that you have done since the death of your husband. You have left your father, mother, and the land of your birth to follow your mother-in-law and to come to a people you do not know.
\v 12 May Yahweh reward you for your deed. May you receive full payment from Yahweh the God of Israel, under whose wings you have found refuge."

  * **foreigner** - Ruth had pledged her loyalty to the God of Israel in private, but she was known publicly as "the Moabitess."

  * **for your deed** - The act of faith, choosing to live with Naomi in Bethlehem and trusting Naomi's God.
