\v 10 When he said that, she knelt down in front of him \add in respect\add*, with her face touching the ground. She exclaimed, "Why are you acting so kindly toward me, by paying attention to me? \add I am not even a Jew; I am\add* a foreigner!"
\v 11 Boaz replied, "People have told me all about what you have done for your mother-in-law. They told me that you left your parents and your homeland, and you came here to live among people whom you did not know before.

\v 10 When he said that, she knelt before him, with her face touching the ground. She exclaimed, "Why are you being so kind to me? I didn't think you would pay any attention to me since I am a foreigner!"
\v 11 Boaz replied, "People have told me about what you have done for your mother-in-law. They told me that you left your parents and your homeland, and you came here to live among people whom you did not know.
\v 12 I hope that Yahweh will repay you for what you have done. May you receive full payment for your actions from the God of Israel, because he is the one you have come to and he will protect you!"

\v 10 Then she  bowed down before Boaz, touching her head to the ground. And she said to him, "Why have I found favor in your sight, that you should be concerned about me, a foreigner?"
\v 11 And Boaz answered and said to her, "It has been reported to me, all that you have done since the death of your husband. You have left your father, mother, and the land of your birth to follow your mother-in-law and come to a people you do not know.
\v 12 May Yahweh reward you for your deed and pay you back fully. May you receive payment from Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have found refuge."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **It has been reported**  - The Hebrew does not specify who did the reporting; the important thing is the content of the message. This could be translated "They have told me" or even "I have heard." The Hebrew uses a construction (like "you will surely die" in Gen 2:17) that emphasizes the truth of the statement: not only had Boaz heard, he believed what he had heard.
  * **foreigner**  - Ruth had pledged her loyalty to the God of Israel in private, but she was known publically as "the Moabitess." The Israelites regarded non-Israelites, especially people from Moab (Deut 23:3), as outside the covenant and therefore not entitled to its benefits.
