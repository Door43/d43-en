===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **at mealtime**  - That is, the evening meal.
  * **dip your morsel in the wine vinegar**  - When eating meals like this one, the people would sit on the ground around a cloth that had a bowl of wine vinegar (see next note) and plates of broken bread. The diners would dip their bread in the vinegar bowl to wet it and add flavor before they ate it.
  * **wine vinegar**  - A sauce that bread was dipped in. The Israelites preserved fruit juices by fermenting them to make wine, which was used as a beverage. Some of the wine was fermented further to make vinegar, a sour, acidic liquid used in sauces (as here), in cooking, and for cleaning.
  * **the toasted grain**  - That is, grain roasted on the fire to make it edible.
  * **they reached the toasted grain for her**  - That is, "they offered her toasted grain."
