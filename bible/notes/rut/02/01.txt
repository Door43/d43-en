  * **a mighty man of wealth**  - That is, "a prominent, wealthy man". This means that Boaz was prosperous and well-known in his community, with a good reputation. Being wealthy also implied that God was blessing him.
  * **glean among the ears of grain **- That is, "gather or pick up kernels of grain left behind by the harvesters."
  * **ears **- That is, "heads" or "stalks". The "ears" are the parts of a grain plant that contain the grain.
