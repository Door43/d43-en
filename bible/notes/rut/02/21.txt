===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Indeed, he said to me**- "he even said to me." This indicates that what follows is the most important part of Boaz's words to Ruth.
  * **go out with** - "work with"
  * **come to harm**  - Possible meanings are 1) other workers might abuse Ruth physically or sexually or 2) in another field, the owner might interfere or stop her from gleaning until the end of the harvest.
