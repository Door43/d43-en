  * **keep close to my young men** - Boaz was referring to the physical protection his men can provide her.
  * **go out with** - "work with"
  * **come to harm** - Possible meanings are 1) other workers might abuse Ruth or try to seize her and sleep with her or 2) in another field, the owner might interfere or stop her from gleaning until the end of the harvest.
