===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **keep close**  -
  * **come to harm**  - Most interpreters take Naomi’s words to mean that she is concerned that other workers might abuse Ruth physically or sexually. However, it might be that Naomi is concerned that in another field, the owner would interfere or stop her from gleaning until the end of the harvest (see note on 1:22).
