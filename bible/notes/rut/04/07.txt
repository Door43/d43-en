\v 7 Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging of anything. To confirm all things, a man took off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor; and this was the manner of making legal agreements in Israel.
\v 8 So the near kinsman said to Boaz, "Buy it for yourself." And he took off his shoe.
