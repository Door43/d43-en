\v 7 At that time, it was the custom in Israel that when two people agreed to redeem or exchange anything between them, one man would take off one of his sandals and give it to the other man. That was the way they finalized transactions in Israel.
\v 8 So the relative said to Boaz, "You buy the field yourself!" And he took off one of his sandals and gave it to Boaz.

\v 7 Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning redeeming and the exchange of anything. To confirm all things, a man took off his shoe and gave it to his neighbor; this was the manner of making legal agreements in Israel.
\v 8 So the near kinsman said to Boaz, "Buy it for yourself." And he took off his shoe.
