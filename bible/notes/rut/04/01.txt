  * **called to him by name**  - This is the translator's way of showing that Boaz knows the name of the kinsman, but the writer of Ruth is hiding it from the reader. This is important to the story because in verse 5, Boaz tells the kinsman that whoever marries Ruth will be responsible to keep Elimelech's name alive. The kinsman refuses to keep Elimelech's name alive, so the writer lets the kinsman's name die out while Elimelech's name lives on. If your language has a "name" like "So-and-So," which shows that the speaker and the person the speaker is quoting know someone's name but the speaker does not want the hearer to know that name, another possible translation is, 'Boaz said, "Hey, So-and-So, come over here and sit down."' See also 2 Ki 6:8, where the King of Aram tells the name of a place ("such-and-such a place" or "a certain place") to his servants, but the writer does not tell the name to the reader.
