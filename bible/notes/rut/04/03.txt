\v 4 I thought that I should tell you about that, and suggest that you buy it, while these elders who are sitting here are listening. If you are willing to buy the property, do that. But if you do not want to buy it, tell me, so that I will know. I am suggesting this to you because you are the one who has the first right to buy it, and I am the one who has the second\f + \ft Or: next \f* right to buy it." The man replied, "I will buy it!"

\v 3 And he said to the near kinsman, "Naomi, who has come again out of the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land which was our brother Elimelech’s.
\v 4 And I thought to inform you, saying, 'Buy it in the presence of those that sit here, and in the presence of the elders of my people.' If you will redeem it, redeem it. But if you will not redeem it, then tell me, so that I may know, for there is no one to redeem it besides you, and I am after you." And he said, "I will redeem it."
