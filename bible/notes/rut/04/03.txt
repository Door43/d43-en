\v 3 he said to the man who had the responsibility to take care of Naomi, "Naomi has returned from Moab \add region\add*. She wants to sell the field that belonged to our relative Elimelech.
\v 4 I thought that I should tell you about that, and suggest that you buy it, while these elders who are sitting here are listening. If you are willing to buy the property, do that. But if you do not want to buy it, tell me, so that I will know. I am suggesting this to you because you are the one who has the first right to buy it, and I am the one who has the second\f + \ft Or: next \f* right to buy it." The man replied, "I will buy it!"

\v 3 Boaz said to the near kinsman, "Naomi, who has returned from the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land that was our brother Elimelechâ€™s.
\v 4 I thought to inform you and say to you, 'Buy it in the presence of those who are sitting here, and in the presence of the elders of my people.' If you wish to redeem it, redeem it. But if you do not wish to redeem it, then tell me, so that I may know, for there is no one to redeem it besides you, and I am after you." Then the other man said, "I will redeem it."

    * **in the presence of** - This would make the transaction legal and binding. 
    * **Redeem it**  - This meant to buy the land to keep it within their family.
    *  **I am after you** - Boaz was the next kinsman in line to redeem the land.
