\v 9 Then Boaz said to the elders and to all the people, "You are witnesses today that I have bought all that was Elimelek's and all that was Kilion's and Mahlon's from the hand of Naomi.
\v 10 Also Ruth the Moabite woman, the wife of Mahlon, I have acquired to be my wife, in order that I might raise up the name of the dead man on his inheritance, so that his name will not be cut off from among his brothers and from the gate of his place. Today you are witnesses!"

  * **in order that I might raise up the name of the dead man on his inheritance** - The first son that Ruth bore would be legally considered Mahlon's son and would inherit the land that Boaz bought from Naomi. AT: "so that I might give her a son who will inherit the dead man's property" 
  * **so that his name will not be cut off from among his brothers and from the gate of his place** - Being forgotten is spoken of as if one's name were being cut off from a list of people who had lived earlier.

  * **the gate of his place** - The gate of the town is where important legal decisions were made, such as decisions about who owns a piece of land.
