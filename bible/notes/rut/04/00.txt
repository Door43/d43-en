====== Ruth 04 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== King David ==
Despite being a Moabitess, Ruth became an ancestor of David. David was Israel's greatest king. It is shocking a Gentile would become a part of such an important lineage. She had great faith in Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:obe:kt:faith]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "You must also take Ruth the Moabitess" ==
Because Naomi had no son, her daughter-in-law Ruth needed to be provided for. Therefore, the relative who wanted to use her land had to help also Ruth have a son who would come to provide for her. 

== "This was the custom in former times" ==
This is a comment made by the writer of the text. He functions as a narrator in this instance. It indicates that they was a considerable period of time between when the events occurred and when they were written.
