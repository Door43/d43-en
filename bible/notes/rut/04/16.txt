===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Naomi took the child**  - This refers to Naomi holding the child. Make sure it does not sound like she took him away from Ruth.
  * **laid him in her bosom**  - "held him close against her chest." This is a statement of love and affection for the child.
  * **A son has been born to Naomi **  - "The child is like a son to Naomi." It was understood that the child was Naomi's grandson, not her physical son.
  * **father of David**  - "father of King David". Though "king" is not stated, it was clear to the original audience that David was the King David. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Explicit and Implicit]])
