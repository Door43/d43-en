===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **daughters-in-law**  - "son's wives" or "sons' widows".
  * **each of you**  - Naomi was talking to two people, so languages that have a dual form of "you" would use that throughout her talk. (See: [[:en:ta:vocabulary:formsofyou]])
  * **your mother's house**  - This could be translated as, "to the home of each of your mothers".
  * **loyalty**  - The Hebrew word here includes the ideas of love, kindness, and faithfulness.
  * **shown loyalty**  - This could be translated as, "demonstrated that you are loyal".
  * **toward the dead and to me**  - "to your husbands who died, and to me". (See: talink [[:en:ta:vocabulary:adjectivalnoun]])
  * **grant you**  - "give you" or "allow you to have".
  * **rest**  - "Rest" here includes security in marriage.
  * **in the house of another husband**  - their new husbands, not someone else's.
  * **they raised their voices and cried**  - means that they cried out loud or wept bitterly. (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:idiom]])
  * **we want to return with you**  - 1) When Orpah and Ruth said "we", they were referring to themselves and not Naomi. So languages that have inclusive and exclusive "we" would use the exclusive form here. (See: [[:en:ta:vocabulary:exclusive]]). 2) "you" used here is the singular form referring to Naomi.
