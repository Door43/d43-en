===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **daughters-in-law**  - "son's wives" or "sons' widows"
  * **each of you**  - Naomi was talking to two people, so languages that have a dual form of "you" would use that throughout her talk. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you|Forms of 'You']])
  * **your mother's house**  - AT: "to the home of each of your mothers."
  * **shown loyalty**  - AT: "demonstrated that you are loyal."
  * **loyalty**  - The Hebrew word here includes the ideas of love, kindness, and faithfulness.
  * **toward the dead**  - "to your husbands who died"
  * **grant you**  - "give you" or "allow you to have"
  * **rest**  - "Rest" here includes security in marriage.
  * **in the house of another husband**  - with their new husbands, not someone else's.
  * **they raised their voices and cried**  - means that they cried out loud or wept bitterly. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom|Idiom]])
  * **we will return**  - When Orpah and Ruth said "we", they were referring to themselves and not Naomi. So languages that have inclusive and exclusive "we" would use the exclusive form here. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive|Exclusive]])
  * **with you**  - "you" used here is the singular form referring to Naomi.
