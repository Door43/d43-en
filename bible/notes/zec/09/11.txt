\v 11 As for you also, because of the blood of your covenant I have set free your prisoners from the pit wherein is no water.
\v 12 Turn you to the stronghold, you prisoners of hope: even today do I declare that I will render double to thee.
\v 13 For I have bent Judah for me, I have filled the bow with Ephraim; and I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons,
O Greece, and will make you as the sword of a mighty man.
