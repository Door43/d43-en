<usfm>
\v 11 As for you, my people of Jerusalem,
 because of the blood that flowed when I made my covenant with you,
 I will free your people whom they took to other countries,
 where it was as though they were prisoners in a waterless pit.
\v 12 You people who were prisoners in those countries who still believe that I will help you,
 return to Judah, for I will defend you there.
 Today I declare that I will give you two blessings
 for each of the troubles that you have experienced.
\v 13 I will cause Judah to be like my bow,
 and I will cause Israel to be like my arrow.
 I will enable you young men of Jerusalem to fight against the soldiers of Greece;
 you will be like  a warrior's sword."

<usfm>
\p
\v 11 And you—because of the blood of my covenant with you—I have set free your prisoners from the pit where there is no water.
\v 12 Return to the stronghold, prisoners of hope! Even today I am declaring that I will return double to you,
\v 13 for I have bent Judah as my bow. I have filled my quiver with Ephraim. I have roused your sons, Zion, against your sons,
Greece, and have made you, Zion, like a warrior's sword!"
