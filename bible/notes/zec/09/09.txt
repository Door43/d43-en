\q
\v 9 Shout with great joy, daughter of Zion! Cheer, daughter of Jerusalem! 
\q Behold! Your king is coming to you with righteousness
\q and is bringing salvation. He is humble and rides on a donkey, on the colt of a donkey.
\q
\v 10 Then I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the horse from Jerusalem, and the bow will be cut off from battle; for
he will speak peace to the nations, and his dominion will be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth!
