\q
\v 9 Shout with great joy, daughter of Zion! Shout with happiness, daughter of Jerusalem!
\q Behold! Your king is coming to you with righteousness
\q and is rescuing you. He is humble and is riding on a donkey, on the colt of a donkey.
\q
\v 10 Then I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the horse from Jerusalem, 
\q and the bow will be cut off from battle; for he will speak peace to the nations, 
\q and his dominion will be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth!

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh appears to be the speaker in verses 9-13. 

  * **Shout with great joy, daughter of Zion! Shout with happiness, daughter of Jerusalem!** - These two sentences mean the same thing and intensify the command to rejoice. Yahweh is speaking to the people of Jerusalem as if they were present, but they were not there. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
  * **daughter of Zion ... daughter of Jerusalem** - "Zion" is the same as "Jerusalem." The prophet speaks of the city as if it is a daughter. See how you translated "daughter of Zion" in [[:en:bible:notes:zec:02:10|2:10]].
  * **Behold!** - This alerts the reader to pay special attention to the surprising statement that follows. AT: "Pay attention!" or "Here is a surprising fact!" 
  * **Your king is coming to you with righteousness and is rescuing you** - "Your king is righteous and is coming to rescue you"
  * **on a donkey, on the colt of a donkey** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and refer to one animal. The second phrase clarifies that this is a young donkey. AT: "on a young donkey" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **cut off the chariot from Ephraim** - Here "cut off" is an idiom that means to destroy. AT: "destroy the chariots in Israel that are used for battle"
  * **the horse from Jerusalem** - The references to "chariot" and "bow" means that this refers to horses used in battle. This can be made explicit. AT: "the warhorses in Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the bow will be cut off from battle** - Here the bow represents all weapons used in warfare. AT: "all weapons of war will be destroyed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **for he will speak peace to the nations** - Here the action of announcing peace represents the action of making peace. AT: "for your king will bring peace to the nations" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]]}
  * **his dominion will be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth!** - The phrases "sea to sea" and "from the River to the ends of the earth" mean the same thing and can be combined. AT: "his kingdom will be over all the earth!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **the River** - This probably refers to the Euphrates River.
