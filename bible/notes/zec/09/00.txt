====== Zechariah 09 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter is written mainly in prose about the cities and peoples around where Israel stood as a country until the exile. 

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 9:9-10, which are extended quotations.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

The first two verses show that the prophecy is concerning neighboring countries. Hamath, Damscus, Tyre and Sidon are cities in areas that were next to Israel. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

The different names for places and peoples will present a challenge. Please refer to [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]].
