<usfm>
\v 3 The people in Tyre have built a high wall around their city.
 They piled up huge amounts of silver and gold
 like other people pile up soil when they dig in the streets.
\v 4 But I, Yahweh, will make them lose everything, including their ships in which their men fight on the sea. Their city will burn to the ground.
</usfm>
