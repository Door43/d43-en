\v 14 One day Yahweh will appear in the sky above his people,
 and the arrows that he shoots will be like lightning bolts.
 Yahweh our Lord will blow his trumpet,
 and he will march with the powerful storms that come from the land of Teman in the south.
\v 15 Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies, will protect his people;
 the soldiers of Judah will attack and defeat their enemies who attack them using slings and stones.
 Those soldiers of Judah will drink and celebrate and shout like people who are drunk;
 they will be as full of wine as the bowl that holds the blood of the animals priests kill at the altar—
 the blood that the priests sprinkle on the corners of the altar.

<usfm>
\v 14 Yahweh will appear to them, and his arrows will shoot out like lightning! For my Lord Yahweh will blow the
trumpet and will advance with the storms from Teman.
\v 15 Yahweh of hosts will defend them, and they will devour them and defeat the stones of the slings. Then they will drink 
and shout like men drunk on wine, and they will be filled with wine like bowls at the altar, like the corners of the altar.

===== Translation Notes: =====

This part of the prophecy continues with Hosea's words, instead of with Yahweh's words spoken through him.

  * **will appear to them** -  The word "them" refers to God's people. AT: "will be seen in the sky by his people" or "will come to his people"
  * **will be like lightning bolts**  - The Israelites sometimes thought of lightning bolts as arrows that God shot.
  * **blow the trumpet** - The trumpets were rams' horns. People will blow into them to give signals in battle and on other occasions.
  * **will advance with the storms from Teman ** - The Israelites sometimes thought of God as traveling on violent storms coming from the south.
  * **will devour** - AT: "will completely defeat" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **defeat the stones of the slings** - The Israelites will defeat the soldiers who fight with slingshots. These soldiers represent all the enemies of Israel, no matter what weapons they are carrying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Then they will drink and shout like men drunk on wine **- AT: " They will shout and celebrate their victory as loudly as if they were drunk" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **and they will be filled with wine like bowls at the altar **- AT: "and they will be as full of wine as basins that catch blood at the altar"
  * **like the corners of the altar**  - Altars had projecting corners where animal blood collected. AT: "as the corners of the altar are full of blood"
