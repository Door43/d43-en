\v 14 One day Yahweh will appear in the sky above his people,
 and the arrows that he shoots will be like lightning bolts.
 Yahweh our Lord will blow his trumpet,
 and he will march with the powerful storms that come from the land of Teman in the south.
\v 15 Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies, will protect his people;
 the soldiers of Judah will attack and defeat their enemies who attack them using slings and stones.
 Those soldiers of Judah will drink and celebrate and shout like people who are drunk;
 they will be as full of wine as the bowl that holds the blood of the animals priests kill at the altar—
 the blood that the priests sprinkle on the corners of the altar.
