\v 1 This is another message that I received from Yahweh about the region of Hadrach and the city of Damascus.
For Yahweh carefully watches what everyone does, including the people of the tribes of Israel.
\v 2 This message is also about the people in the region of Hamath near to Damascus, people who think they are very wise.
