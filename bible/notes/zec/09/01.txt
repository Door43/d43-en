<usfm>
\v 1 This is another message that I received from Yahweh about the region of Hadrach and the city of Damascus.
For Yahweh carefully watches what everyone does, including the people of the tribes of Israel.
\v 2 This message is also about the people in the region of Hamath near to Damascus, and about the people in the cities of Tyre and Sidon, people who think they are very wise.
