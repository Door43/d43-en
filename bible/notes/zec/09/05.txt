\v 5 The people in the city of Ashkelon will see that happen,
 and they will become very afraid.
 The people in the city of Gaza will shake because of being terrified,
 and the people in the city of Ekron city will shake too,
 because they will no longer expect to prosper.
The king of Gaza will die;
 No one will live any longer in Ashkelon.
\v 6 Foreigners will occupy the city of Ashdod.
 I will cause the people in all those cities of Philistia to no longer have anything to be proud about.
\v 7 I will no longer allow them to eat meat that still has blood in it,
and I will forbid them to eat food like pork, or anything that they offered to idols.
 At that time, the people in Philistia who survive will worship me,
 and they will become my people,
 like the people of Jebus did when the Israelites conquered them.

\v 5 Ashkelon will see and be afraid! Gaza also will tremble greatly! Ekron, her hope will be confounded!
The king will perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall no longer be inhabited!
\v 6 Strangers will make their homes in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.
\v 7 For I will remove his blood from his mouth and his abominations from between his teeth; then he will become a
remnant for our God like a clan in Judah, and Ekron will be like the Jebusites.
