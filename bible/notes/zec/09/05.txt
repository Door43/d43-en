\v 5 The people in the city of Ashkelon will see that happen,
 and they will become very afraid.
 The people in the city of Gaza will shake because they are terrified,
 and the people in the city of Ekron will shake too,
 because they no longer hope to escape enemies.
The king of Gaza will die;
 No one will live any longer in Ashkelon.
\v 6 Yahweh says, "Foreigners will occupy the city of Ashdod.
 I will no longer allow the people in all those cities of Philistia to be proud.
\v 7 I will no longer allow them to eat meat that still has blood in it,
and I will forbid them to eat food that they offered to idols.
 At that time, the people in the region of Philistia who survive will worship me;
 they will become like a clan in Judah. The people of the city of Ekron will become part of my people, as the people of the city of Jebus did when the Israelites conquered them.

\v 5 Ashkelon will see and be afraid! Gaza also will tremble greatly! Ekron, her hopes will be disappointed!
The king will perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall no longer be inhabited!
\v 6 Yahweh says, "Strangers will make their homes in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.
\v 7 For I will remove their blood from their mouths and their abominations from between their teeth." Then they will become a
remnant for our God like a clan in Judah, and Ekron will become like the Jebusites.
