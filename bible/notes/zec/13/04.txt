\v 4 At that time, the false prophets will be ashamed \add that they claimed to have received messages from me in\add* their visions and prophesies \add that they told to people\add*. They will no longer \add deceive people by\add* wearing the clothes \add that prophets usually wear\add*, clothes made of \add animals'\add* hair.
\v 5 So each of them will say, 'I am not really a prophet; I am a farmer, and I have been a farmer on my land ever since I was a boy!'
\v 6 But others, \add seeing the wounds on his body\add* will \add suspect that he injured himself during rituals to worship idols\add*, and they will ask, 'Why are those wounds on your body?' And each of them \add will lie and\add* reply, 'I was injured when I was at my friend's house.'~"

\v 4 At that time, the false prophets will be ashamed to announce that he has received any vision at all. They will no longer put on cloaks made with animal hair that prophets normally wear, because they will want the people to think that they were never really prophets at all.
\v 5 So each of them will say, 'I am not really a prophet; I am a farmer, and I have been a farmer on my land ever since I was a boy!'
\v 6 But others will see scars on their bodies and think that they cut themselves in order to please idols while they were worshiping them. So they will ask, 'Why do you have those scars?' And they will tell a lie: 'I was injured in a quarrel at my friend's house.'"

\v 4 On that day each prophet will be ashamed of his vision when he is about to prophesy. These prophets will no longer wear a hairy cloak, in order to deceive the people.
\v 5 For each will say, 'I am not a prophet! I am a man who works the soil, for the land became my work while I was still a young man!'
\v 6 But someone will say to him, 'What are these wounds between your arms?' and he will answer, 'I was wounded with those in my friends' house.'"
