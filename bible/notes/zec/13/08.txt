<usfm>
\v 8 Yahweh also says, "Two thirds of the people in Judah will die;
Only one third of the people in Judah will remain alive.
\v 9 I will test the ones that remain alive by causing them to experience great difficulties, to find out if they will continue to worship me.
I will purify them as someone purifies gold or silver by putting it into a very hot fire.
Then my people will call to me  for help,
and I will answer them.
I will tell them that they are my people,
and they will say that I, Yahweh, am the God they worship and obey.

<usfm>
\q
\v 8 Then it will come about that throughout all the land"—this is Yahweh's declaration—
\q " that two thirds of it will be cut off! Those people will perish;
\q only one third will remain there.
\q
\v 9 I will bring that third through the fire 
\q and refine them as silver is refined;
\q I will test them as gold is tested. 
\q They will call on my name, 
\q and I will answer them and say,
\q 'This is my people!' 
\q and they will say, 'Yahweh is my God!'"

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **This is Yahweh's declaration** - This phrase is often translated as "Yahweh says" in the UDB. You can translate this concept whichever way is best in your language. This phrase is used many times in Zechariah.
  * * **I will bring that third through the fire** - Metal is passed through fire in order to purify or harden it. This expression serves here as a metaphor for exposing the people to suffering in order that they may become more faithful to God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **refine them as silver is refined, and I will test them as gold is tested** - Refining refers to making precious metals such as silver more pure. Metals such as silver and gold are tested in order to discover how pure or strong they are. Both refining and testing are here metaphors for making the people more faithful to God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
