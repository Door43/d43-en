\q
\v 8 Then it will come about that throughout all the land"--this is Yahweh's declaration--
\q "two portions of it will be cut off! They will perish;
\q only a third will remain there.
\q
\v 9 I will bring that third through the fire 
\q and refine them as silver is refined, 
\q and I will test them as gold is tested.

\q and I will answer them and say,
\q 'This is my people!' 
\q and they will say, 'Yahweh is my God!'"
