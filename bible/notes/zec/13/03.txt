So if someone prophesies \add like that\add*, his own father and mother must stab him \add and kill him\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 If someone continues to prophesy falsely, his own parents, even though he is their own son, will say to him, 'You have told lies saying that Yahweh gave those messages to you, so you must die.' Then they will stab him and kill him.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 If any man continues to prophesy, his father and mother who bore him will tell him, 'You will not live, for you speak lies in the name of Yahweh!'
Then the father and mother who bore him will pierce him when he prophesies.
