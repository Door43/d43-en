\v 4 From Judah will come rulers who will be very important.
From Judah will come leaders who will hold the people together, like a tent peg keeps a tent up.
From Judah will come leaders who will take the soldiers into war, like a king holding his own bow for battle.
From them will come every one of their own leaders.
\v 5 They will all be like mighty warriors
who trample their enemies into the mud during battle.
I, Yahweh, will be with them,
so they will defeat and shame their enemies who ride on horses.

those who ride warhorses.
