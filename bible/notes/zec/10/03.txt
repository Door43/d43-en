===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - It is unclear whether Yahweh is speaking, or if Zechariah is speaking for Yahweh in verses 3-5.

  * **My wrath burns against the shepherds** - Here "the shepherds" represent the leaders of God's people. The intensity of Yahweh's anger is spoken of as if it was a blazing fire. AT: "My anger toward the shepherds of my people is as intense as a fire" or "I am very angry with the leaders of my people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **it is the male goats—the leaders—that I will punish** - Male goats are typically more dominant than female goats. Here "male goats" represents the oppressive leaders of God's people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Yahweh of hosts will also attend to his flock, the house of Judah** - Here Yahweh's care for his people is spoken of as a shepherd cares for his sheep. AT: "Yahweh of hosts will take care of the house of Judah as a shepherd cares for his sheep"
  * **the house of Judah** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house. In this case it refers to the people of Judah, which included the descendants of Judah and Benjamin. AT: "Judah" or "the people of Judah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **make them like his warhorse in battle** - Yahweh changes the metaphor for his people from defenseless sheep to a mighty war horse. He speaks of his people as if they were a strong horse in battle. AT: "will cause them to be strong like war horses in battle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
