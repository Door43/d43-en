====== Zechariah 10:1-2 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Ask Yahweh to cause rain to fall in the springtime\f + \ft Or: before the hot season starts \f*,
\q2 because he is the one who makes the clouds \add from which the rain falls\add*.
\q1 He causes showers to fall on us,
\q2 and he causes crops to grow well in the fields.
\q1
\v 2 What people think that the idols in their houses suggest is only nonsense,
\q2 and people who \add say that they can\add* interpret dreams tell only lies.
\q1 When they tell people things to comfort them, what they say is useless,
\q2 so the people \add who consult\f + \ft Or: trust in \f* them\add* are like lost sheep;
\q1 they are attacked because they have no \add one to protect them \add*
\q2 like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a shepherd \add protects his sheep\add*.
\q1

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Ask Yahweh to cause rain to fall in the springtime, because he is the one who makes the clouds from which the rain falls in storms. He causes showers to fall on us, and he causes crops to grow well in the fields.
\v 2 What people think that the idols in their houses say is only nonsense, and people who say that they can interpret dreams tell only lies. When they tell people things to comfort them, what they say is useless, so the people who consult them are like lost sheep; they are in danger because they have no one to protect them like sheep with no shepherd.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\c 10
\m
\q
\v 1 Ask for rain from Yahweh in the season of the spring rain—
\q Yahweh who makes thunderstorms—
\q and he gives rain showers to everyone
\q and vegetation in the field.
\q
\v 2 For household idols speak falsely; the diviners envision a lie;
\q they tell deceitful dreams and give empty comfort,
\q so they wander like sheep and suffer because there is no shepherd.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Zechariah continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **makes thunderstorms** - "makes the clouds from which the rain falls in storms" 
  * **and vegetation in the field** - "and causes plants to grow in the field"
  * **idols speak falsely** - "idols give false messages." Zechariah is not suggesting that idols actually speak. He is referring to the messages people say they hear from idols. The UDB makes this explicit.
  * **diviners envision a lie** - "diviners see false visions"
  * **they tell deceitful dreams** - It is implied that they know these dreams are false. This can be made explicit. AT: "diviners lie about their dreams in order to deceive people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **empty comfort** - This refers to words that sooth temporarily, but do not provide any longterm help.
  * **they wander like sheep** - The people who do not have true prophets who tell the truth are spoken of as sheep who do not have a shepherd to tell them where to go. AT: "the people who listen to the false prophets are like sheep who do not know which way to go" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **they ... suffer because there is no shepherd** - The people who do not have true prophets are spoken of as sheep who suffer because they do not have a shepherd to tell them where to go. AT: "the people who listen to the false prophets ... are suffering like sheep who do not have a shepherd to guide them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
