<usfm>
\v 1 Ask Yahweh to cause rain to fall in the springtime\f + \ft Or: before the hot season starts \f*,
\q2 because he is the one who makes the clouds \add from which the rain falls\add*.
\q1 He causes showers to fall on us,
\q2 and he causes crops to grow well in the fields.
\q1
\v 2 What people think that the idols in their houses suggest is only nonsense,
\q2 and people who \add say that they can\add* interpret dreams tell only lies.
\q1 When they tell people things to comfort them, what they say is useless,
\q2 so the people \add who consult\f + \ft Or: trust in \f* them\add* are like lost sheep;
\q1 they are attacked because they have no \add one to protect them \add*
\q2 like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a shepherd \add protects his sheep\add*.
\q1

<usfm>
\v 1 Ask Yahweh to cause rain to fall in the springtime,
because he is the one who makes the clouds from which the rain falls in storms.
He causes showers to fall on us,
and he causes crops to grow well in the fields.
\v 2 What people think that the idols in their houses say is only nonsense,
 and people who say that they can interpret dreams tell only lies.
When they tell people things to comfort them, what they say is useless,
so the people who consult them are like lost sheep;
they are in danger because they have no one to protect them 
like sheep with no shepherd.

\q
\v 1 Ask for rain from Yahweh in the time of the spring rain—
\q Yahweh who makes thunderstorms!—and
he will provide rain showers for them, 
\q and plants in the fields for manknd.
\q
\v 2 For household idols speak falsely; the diviners envision a lie; 
\q they tell deceitful dreams and give empty comfort,
\q so they wander like sheep and suffer because there is no shepherd.
