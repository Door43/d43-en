\v 6 I will make the people of Judah strong,
and I will rescue the people of Israel.
I will bring them back from the countries to which they were exiled;
 I will do that because I pity them.
 Then it will be as though I had never abandoned them
because I am Yahweh, their God,
 and I will answer them when they pray for help.
\v 7 The people of Israel will then be like strong soldiers;
 they will be as happy as people who have drunk a lot of wine.
 Their children will see their fathers being very happy,
and they also will be happy because of what I have done for them.

and rejoice. Their heart will rejoice in me!
