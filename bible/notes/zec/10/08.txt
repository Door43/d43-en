\v 8 I will signal for my people to return from far away,
 and I will gather them together in their own country.
 I will rescue them,
and they will become very numerous as they were previously.
\v 9 I have caused them to be scattered among many people groups,
 but in those distant countries they will think about me again.
They and their children will remain alive and return to Judah.
\v 10 I will bring them back from Egypt and from Assyria;
I will bring them back to the regions of Gilead and Lebanon,
 but there not be enough space for them all to live there.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 8 I will whistle for them and gather them, for I will rescue them, and they will become as great as they previously were!
\v 9 I sowed them among the peoples, but they will remember me in distant countries, so they and their children will live and return.
\v 10 For I will restore them from the land of Egypt and gather them from Assyria. I will bring them to the
land of Gilead and Lebanon until there is no more room for them.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I will whistle** - To whistle is to produce a high, shrill sound with air through narrowed lips. It is often done to give a signal to other people, as here.
  * **until there is no more room for them** - The people will continue to go back to Judah and it will become crowded with no room for any more people to live there.
