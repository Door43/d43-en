<usfm>
\v 11 I will go before them through their sufferings, as if I were walking through a sea, but I will calm those waves and end their sufferings, as if I were drying up the Nile River. I will defeat the proud soldiers of Assyria, and I will cause Egypt to no longer be powerful.
\v 12 I will enable my people to be strong, and they will honor me and obey me. That will surely happen because I, Yahweh, have said it."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 I will pass through the sea of their affliction; I will strike the waves of that sea and will dry up all the depths of the Nile. The majesty of Assyria will be brought down, and the scepter of Egypt will go away from the Egyptians.
\v 12 I will strengthen them in myself, and they will walk in my nameâ€”this is Yahweh's declaration."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In verses 6-12, Yahweh is speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **I will pass through the sea of their affliction** - Scripture often refers to the sea as an image of many troubles and hardships. Here Yahweh speaks of himself accompanying the people to help them go through these afflictions. AT: "I will go with them and help them as they go through their many afflictions" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will strike the waves of that sea** - Here to "strike" the waves is an idiom that means he will stop the waves from forming. Stopping the afflictions of his people is spoken of as calming the waves of that sea. AT: "I will cause the waves of that sea of affliction to stop" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **will dry up all the depths of the Nile** - "I will cause the Nile River to lose all its water"
  * **The majesty of Assyria will be brought down** - Here "the majesty of Assyria" probably refers to the Assyrian army. AT: "I will destroy Assyria's proud army" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the scepter of Egypt will go away from the Egyptians** - Here "the scepter of Egypt" refers to the political power of Egypt. AT: "the power of Egypt to rule other nations will end" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I will strengthen them in myself** - "I will cause them to be strong and to believe in me"
  * **they will walk in my name** - Here "in my name" is an idiom that means they will do what Yahweh wants them to do. AT: "they will honor and obey me as I want them to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:zec:01:04|1:4]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
