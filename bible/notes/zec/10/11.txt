\v 11 They will endure many difficulties
as though they were walking through a sea,
 but I will make them able to calm the waves of the sea,
able to dry up the water in the Nile River.
I will defeat the proud soldiers of Assyria,
and I will cause Egypt to no longer be powerful.

and they will honor me and obey me.
That will surely happen because I, Yahweh, have said it."
