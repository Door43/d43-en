===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Then I turned** - The word "I" refers to Zechariah. 
  * **lifted my eyes**  - This means to look up at something. He says "I lifted my eyes" because that is the part of the body a person sees with. AT: "looked up" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **behold**  - The word "behold" here shows that Zechariah was surprised by what he saw.
