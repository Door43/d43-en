\v 8 The angel said, "This is Wickedness!" And he threw her back inside the barrel, and he threw the lead cover over its opening.
\v 9 I lifted my eyes and saw two women coming forth, and wind was in their wings--for they had wings like a stork's wings. They lifted up the barrel between earth and heaven.
