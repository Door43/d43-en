\v 5 Then the angel who had been talking to me came closer to me and said, "Look up and see what is appearing!"
\p
\v 6 I asked him, "What is it?"
\p He replied, "It is a big basket \add for measuring grain\add*. But it contains \add a record of\add* the sins that everyone in this nation has committed."
\p
\v 7 Then \add the angel\add* lifted the basket's cover, which was made of lead. There was a woman sitting inside the basket!

\v 5 Then the angel who was speaking with me went out and said to me, "Raise your eyes and see what is coming!"
\v 6 I said, "What is it?" He said, "This is a basket containing an ephah that is coming. This is their iniquity in the whole land."
\f + \ft Some ancient and most modern versions have \fqa their iniquity \fqa* . The Hebrew text has \fqa their eye \fqa* , but this is widely thought to be an error. \f*
\v 7 Then a lead covering was lifted off the basket and there was a woman under it sitting in it!

===== translationWords: =====

  * [[:en:obe:kt:angel]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:iniquity]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Raise your eyes** - This phrase commands a person to look up by referring to their eyes. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **a lead covering** - This refers to a heavy cover. Lead is a heavy metal.
  * **there was a woman under it sitting in it** - A woman could not literally fit inside a basket of this size. In Zechariah's vision though, so did fit in the basket. Often in visions the sizes of things are exaggerated. Both the basket and the woman are symbolic and represent other things.
