\p
\v 6 I asked him, "What is it?"
\p He replied, "It is a big basket \add for measuring grain\add*. But it contains \add a record of\add* the sins that everyone in this nation has committed."

\v 5 Then the angel who was speaking with me went out and said to me, "Raise your eyes and see what is coming!"
\v 6 I said, "What is it?" He said, "This is a basket containing an ephah that is coming. This is their iniquity in the whole land."
\f + \ft Some ancient and most modern versions have \fqa their iniquity \fqa* . The Hebrew text has \fqa their eye \fqa* , but this is widely thought to be an error. \f*
\v 7 Then a lead covering was lifted off the basket and there was a woman under it sitting in it!
