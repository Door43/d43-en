====== Zechariah 05 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter contains the next two visions. One is about a flying scroll and one is about the basket filled with iniquity. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:iniquity]])

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 5:4, which are extended quotations.
