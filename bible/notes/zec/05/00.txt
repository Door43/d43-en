====== Zechariah 05 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter contains the next two visions. One is about a flying scroll and the sixth one is about the basket filled with iniquity. 

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 5:4, which are extended quotations.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

It is important for each of these visions to keep their meanings and not be interpreted to mean any specific thing. So please be careful to translate each of the terms in your language.
