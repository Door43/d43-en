===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 You people of Jerusalem will flee through that valley which extends to the other side of the mount, all the way to the village of Azal. It will be just as when people fled when there was an earthquake when Uzziah was king. Then Yahweh my God will come, and his own angels will be with him.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Then you will flee down the valley between Yahweh's mountains, for the valley between those mountains will reach to Azal. You will flee just as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah. Then Yahweh my God will come, and all the holy ones will be with him.

===== Translation Notes: =====

These verses continue the description of the final war for the city of Jerusalem and of how God will save her.

  * **Azal** - This seems to have been a town or village east of Jerusalem.
  * **You will flee from them just** - The word "them" refers to those who attacked Jerusalem. 
  * **the holy ones** - This probably refers to God's angels.
