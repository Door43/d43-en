\v 9 After that time, Yahweh will be the king who rules the entire world. Everyone will know that Yahweh, and only Yahweh, is the true God.
\p
\v 10 At that time, all the land in Judah will be flat, like the plain along the Jordan, from the town of Geba in the north to the town of Rimmon far to the south of Jerusalem. Jerusalem will remain high up, as it has always been. The city will extend northeast from the Benjamin Gate and the Corner Gate, which was the first gate, to the Tower of Hananel, and to the king's winepresses to the southwest.
\v 11 Many people will live there, and God will never again threaten the city with destruction. It will be a completely safe city to live in.

\p
\v 9 Yahweh will be king over all the earth. On that day there will be Yahweh, the one God, and his name alone.
\v 10 All the land will be like the Arabah, from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem. And Jerusalem will continue to be elevated; she will live in her own place, from the Benjamin Gate to the place where the first gate was— now the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king's winepresses.
\v 11 The people will live in Jerusalem, and there will be no more complete destruction from God against them; Jerusalem will live in safety.
