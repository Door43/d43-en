\v 9 Yahweh will be king over all the earth! In that day it will be Yahweh alone and his name alone!
\v 10 All the land will be like the Arabah, from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem. And Jerusalem will be lifted up and
inhabit her place, from Benjamin’s gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananel
to the king’s wine-presses.
\v 11 The people will dwell in Jerusalem, and their consecrated destruction will no longer continue; Jerusalem will dwell securely!
[I went ahead and filled in Jerusalem for the 'her' to clarify the activity. Herem obviously needs to be a keyword. I'm not sure if you had a preferred way of translating it, but I wanted to capture the fullness of it.]
