\v 20 In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, HOLY UNTO JEHOVAH; and the pots in Jehovah’s house shall be like
the bowls before the altar.
\v 21 Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holy to Jehovah of hosts; and all they that sacrifice shall come and
take of them, and boil therein: and in that day there shall be no more a Canaanite in the house of Jehovah of hosts.
