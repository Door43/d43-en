\v 20 But on that day, the bells of the horses will say, "Holy for Yahweh," and the basins in Yahweh's house will be like the bowls before the altar.
\v 21 For every pot in Jerusalem and Judah will be holy for Yahweh of hosts, and everyone who brings a sacrifice will eat from them and boil in them. 
Traders will no longer be in the house of Yahweh of hosts on that day.

===== Translation Notes: =====
These verses continue the description of the final war for the city of Jerusalem and of how God will save her.

  * **will be like the bowls before the altar**  - AT: "will be as sacred as the bowls used at the altar"
  * **every pot in Jerusalem and Judah will be holy to Yahweh of hosts** - Various types of pots and utensils were made especially to be used in the temple for the worship of Yahweh and for the sacrifices. These were considered special, not to be used for anything else.
  * **Traders will no longer exist in the house of Yahweh** - It was the custom for traders to sell the people things they needed in order to make proper sacrifices to Yahweh in the temple. Some versions translated "Canaanites" instead, because the Hebrew text may have a double meaning: "traders" and "Canaanites."
