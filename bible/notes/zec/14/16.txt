\p
\v 16 And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem shall go up from
year to year to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.
\v 17 And it shall be, that whoso of all the families of the earth goes not up to Jerusalem to worship the King,
Jehovah of hosts, upon them there shall be no rain.
\v 18 And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, neither
shall it be upon them; there shall be the plague wherewith Jehovah will strike the nations that go not up to keep the
feast of tabernacles.
