\v 16 The people of other nations who previously came to fight against Jerusalem, all those who are still alive, will return \add to Jerusalem\add* every year to worship the King, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, and to celebrate the Festival of Living in Temporary Shelters.
\v 17 If there are people in those nations who do not go \add to Jerusalem to worship there\add*, rain will not fall on their land.
\v 18 If the people of Egypt \add or any other nation\add* do not go to Jerusalem, they will not have any rain. And Yahweh will cause them to experience the same plague that afflicted the people of other nations that did not celebrate the Festival of Living in Temporary Shelters.

\v 16 Then it will happen that all who remain in those nations that came against Jerusalem will instead go up from year to year to worship the king,
Yahweh of hosts, and to keep the Festival of Shelters.
\v 17 And it will happen that if anyone from all the nations of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the king, Yahweh of hosts, then Yahweh will not bring rain on them.
\v 18 And if the nation of Egypt does not go up, then they will not receive rain. A plague from Yahweh will attack the nations that do not go up to keep the Festival of Shelters.
