\v 6 It will happen that on that day that there will be no light, but no cold or frost, either.  
\v 7 On that day, a day known only to Yahweh, there will no longer be day or night, for the evening will be a time of light.
\v 8 And it will also happen on that day that running water will go flow from Jerusalem. Half of the water will go to the eastern sea, and half of the flow toward the western sea, whether it is summer or winter.

===== Translation Notes: =====
These verses continue the description of the final war for the city of Jerusalem and of how God will save her.

  * **running water** - Some versions translate "living water" or "life-giving water." The Hebrew text says "living water," but this normally means running or flowing water, rather than still or stagnant water. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **the eastern sea** - This refers to the Dead Sea, which is east of Jerusalem.
  * **the western sea** - This refers to the Mediterranean Sea.
