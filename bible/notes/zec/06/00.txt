====== Zechariah 06 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter is written mainly in prose and tells the last vision of the four chariots in the first part of the chapter. 

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 6:12b-15, which are extended quotations.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

The second part of the chapter is about a crown made for the high priest. This is a actual person and so his name needs to be translated as such. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

The visions are stated and even when the prophet asked for an explanation, it is often obscure what the meaning truly is. Please note that should be the goal of your translation as well.
