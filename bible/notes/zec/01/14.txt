\v 14 Then the angel who had been talking with me said to me, "Proclaim this to the people of Jerusalem: Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies, says that he is very concerned about the people who live on Mount Zion and in the other parts of Jerusalem.
\v 15 And he is very angry with the nations that are proud and feel safe. He was only a little bit angry with Judah, but they caused them to suffer much more.

\q "I have been jealous for Jerusalem
and for Zion with a great passion!

\v 15 And I am very greatly angry with the nations that are at ease; 
\q for I was but a little displeased, and they helped
forward the affliction."
