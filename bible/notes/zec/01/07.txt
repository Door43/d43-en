\v 7 On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius' reign, the word of Yahweh came 
to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,
\v 8 "I saw in the night, and, look! a man was riding on a red horse, and he was among the myrtle trees that are in the
valley; and behind him there were red, reddish-brown, and white horses."
\v 9 I said, "What are these things, Lord?" And the angel that talked with me said to me, "I will show you what these things are."
