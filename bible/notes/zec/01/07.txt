\v 7 Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, came the
word of Jehovah to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying,
\v 8 I saw in the night, and, behold, a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle-trees that were in the
bottom; and behind him there were horses, red, sorrel, and white.
\v 9 Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said to me, I will show you what these are.
