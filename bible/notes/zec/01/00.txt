====== Zechariah 01 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter is written in prose mainly with imagery used throughout to portray Zechariah's vision given by the Lord. 

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 1:3b-6a and 14b-17 , which are extended quotations.

Zechariah uses two separate dates in this first chapter. If you compare these with the book of Haggai, you will notice this prophecy was proclaimed just a few weeks after Haggai. However, they were prophesying in two different places: Haggai in Jerusalem, we don't know the place where Zechariah was preaching from. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

It is important for each of these visions to keep their meanings and not be interpreted to mean any specific thing. So please be careful to translate each of the terms in your language. 

== Visions ==
This book contains a number of visions given to Zechariah so the images are not ones Zechariah actually saw but were given to him in a vision or dream.
