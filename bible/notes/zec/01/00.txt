====== Zechariah 01 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter is written in prose mainly with imagery used throughout to portray Zechariah's vision given by the Lord. 

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 1:3-6, 14-17, which are extended quotations.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Visions ==
This book contains a number of visions given to Zechariah, so the images are not ones Zechariah actually saw but were given to him in a vision or dream. It is important for each of these visions to keep their meanings and not be interpreted to mean any specific thing. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Date ==
Zechariah uses two separate dates in this first chapter. When compared to the book of Haggai, Zechariah's prophecy was proclaimed just a few weeks after Haggai. However, they prophesied in two different places: Haggai was in Jerusalem and Zechariah was somewhere outside of Jerusalem. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])
