\v 4 Do not be like your ancestors. Prophets, who have now died, continually proclaimed to your ancestors that they should stop doing the evil things that they were always doing. But they refused to pay attention to what I said.
\v 5 Your ancestors have died and are now in their graves. Even the prophets did not live forever either.
\v 6 But the commands and the decrees that I had instructed my servants the prophets to tell themâ€”your ancestors did not obey them, so I punished them.

So then they repented and said that I, Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies, had done to them what they deserved for their evil behavior, just like I had said I would do.'"

\v 4 Do not be like your fathers to whom the prophets cried out previously, saying, "Yahweh of hosts says this:
turn from your evil ways and wicked practices!" But they would not hear and did not pay attention to me.'" This is Yahweh's declaration.
\q
\v 5 "Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, are they here forever?
\q
\v 6 But my words and my decrees that I commanded my servants the prophets, 
\q have they not overtaken your fathers? 
\m
So they repented and said, 'Yahweh of hosts's plans are made in keeping with his word and practice, and he has carried them out.'"

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **cried out**  - "shouted"
  * **turn** - "change"
  * **But they would not hear and did not pay attention to me**  - Both of these phrases mean that the people of Israel would not obey the commands of Yahweh. AT: "But they would not listen to my commands" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **This is Yahweh's declaration** - This phrase is often translated as "Yahweh says" in the UDB. You can translate this concept whichever way is best in your language. This phrase is used many times in Zechariah.
  * **Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, are they here forever?** - Both of these questions are asked to point out the fact that people die. AT: "Your fathers have died.  The prophets will also die." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **But my words and my decrees that I commanded my servants the prophets, have they not overtaken your fathers?** - This question is used to show the people of Israel that everything that the Lord had told his prophets to warn their ancestors about, had happened. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **my words and my decrees** - These are both ways to refer to what God has said to the prophets. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **overtaken your fathers** - Yahweh speaks about his prophecies like they are running to catch up and pass the ancestors of the people of Israel.  The word "overtaken" means passed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * ** his word and practice** - AT: "his manner" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
