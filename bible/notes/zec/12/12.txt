\v 13 The male descendants of Levi will mourn by themselves, and their wives will mourn by themselves; the male descendants of Shimei will mourn by themselves, and their wives will mourn by themselves.

\v 12 The land will mourn, each clan separate from other clans. The clan of the house of David will be separate, 
and their wives will be separate from the men. The clan of the house of Nathan will be separate, and their wives will be 
separate from the men.
\v 13 The clan of the house of Levi will be separate, and their wives will be separate from the men. The clan of the 
Shimeites will be separate, and their wives will be separate from the men.
\v 14 Every clan of the remaining clans—each clan will be separate, and the wives will be separate from the men."
