\v 1 This is a message from Yahweh concerning Israel—Yahweh, the one who stretched out the sky, who created the earth, and who gave life to human beings. This is what he says:
\v 2 "I will soon cause Jerusalem to be like a cup full of very strong alcoholic drink, and the people of other nations who drink it will stagger around. The people of Judah will drink it, too, for they also will suffer when the enemy besieges Jerusalem.
\v 3 At that time, the armies of all the people groups will gather to attack Jerusalem, but I will cause Jerusalem to be like a very heavy rock, and all who try to lift it will be badly injured. This will happen when the armies of all the world's nations attack Jerusalem.

\v 1 This is a declaration of Yahweh's word concerning Israel—a declaration of Yahweh,
\p who stretched out the skies and laid the foundation of the earth, who fashions the spirit of mankind within man:
\v 2 "See, I am about to make Jerusalem into a cup causing all the peoples surrounding her to stagger about; it will also be like that for Judah during the siege against Jerusalem.
\v 3 It will come about on that day that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples. Anyone trying to lift that stone will hurt himself very much, and all the nations of the earth will gather against that city.
