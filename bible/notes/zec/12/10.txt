===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 "I, Yahweh, will cause the descendants of David to have mercy on others, and to beg me to have mercy on themselves. They will gaze at me, whom they pierced." They will cry bitterly, as people cry for a firstborn son, an only son, who has died.
\v 11 At that time, many people in Jerusalem will be crying bitterly, as people cry at Hadad Rimmon in the plain of Megiddo.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 10 "But I will pour out a spirit of compassion and pleading on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, 
so they will look on me, the one they have pierced. They will mourn for me, as one mourns for an only son; they will bitterly lament  for him like those who lament the death of a firstborn son.
\v 11 On that day the laments in Jerusalem will be like the laments at Hadad Rimmon in the plain of Megiddo.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I will pour out a spirit of compassion and pleading**  - AT: "I will give the people a spirit to have mercy on others and to pray to me for mercy"
  * **the one they have pierced**- AT: "the one whom they stabbed to death"
  * **the laments in Jerusalem will be like the laments at Hadad Rimmon** - Hadad Rimmon may have been the place where the good King Josiah died of battle wounds after the Battle of Megiddo. It appears that the custom arose to hold periodic mourning there for his death. Some people, however, think that Hadad Rimmon was the name of a false god who was believed to die every year, an event for which his worshipers would go into mourning.
  * **Megiddo** - This is the name of a plain in Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]).
