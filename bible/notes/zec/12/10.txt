===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 "I, \add Yahweh\add*, will cause the descendants \f + \ft metonymy \f* of \add King\add* David to act very kindly and mercifully. They will look at me, the one who has been stabbed, and they will cry bitterly, like people cry for a firstborn son \add who has died\add* \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\v 11 At that time, many people in Jerusalem will be crying bitterly, like people cried \add when King Josiah was killed in the battle\add* at Hadad-Rimmon on the Megiddo Plain.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 "I, Yahweh, will cause the descendants of David to have mercy on others, and to beg me to have mercy on themselves. They will gaze at me, whom they pierced." They will cry bitterly, as people cry for a firstborn son, an only son, who has died.
\v 11 At that time, many people in Jerusalem will be crying bitterly, as people cry at Hadad Rimmon in the plain of Megiddo.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 10 But I will pour out a spirit of compassion and pleading on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
so they will look on me, the one they have pierced. They will mourn for me, as one mourns for an only son; they will bitterly lament for him like those who lament the death of a firstborn son.
\v 11 On that day the laments in Jerusalem will be like the laments at Hadad Rimmon in the plain of Megiddo.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I will pour out a spirit of compassion and pleading on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem** - Causing the people to be compassionate and to plead is spoken of as if the spirit were a liquid that Yahweh would pour on them. AT: "I will cause the house of David and inhabitants of Jerusalem to have mercy on others and to pray to me for mercy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a spirit of compassion and pleading** - Here this means to have a characteristic of compassion and pleading.
  * **the house of David** - Here "house" represents descendants. AT: "the descendants of David" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the one they have pierced** - "the one whom they stabbed to death"
  * **for an only son** - It is understood that the "son" has died. AT: "for an only son who has died" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **the laments in Jerusalem will be like the laments at Hadad Rimmon** - Hadad Rimmon may have been the place where the good King Josiah died of battle wounds after the Battle of Megiddo. It appears that the custom arose to hold periodic mourning there for his death. Some people, however, think that Hadad Rimmon was the name of a false god who was believed to die every year, an event for which his worshipers would go into mourning. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Megiddo** - This is the name of a plain in Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]).
