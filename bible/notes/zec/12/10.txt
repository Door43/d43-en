\v 10 "I, Yahweh, will cause the descendants of David to feel very sorry, and to beg me to have mercy upon them; they gaze at me, whom they pierced." They will cry bitterly, like people cry for a firstborn son who has died.
\v 11 At that time, many people in Jerusalem will be crying bitterly, like people cried when King Josiah died in the battle at Hadad-Rimmon on the plain of Megiddo.

\v 10 But I will pour out a spirit of compassion and supplication upon the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, 
so they will look on me, the one they have pierced!" They will mourn for him, as one mourns for an only son, and lament
 for him like those who lament the death of a firstborn son.
\v 11 In that day the laments for Jerusalem will be like the laments of Hadad-Rimmon in the plains of Megiddo.
