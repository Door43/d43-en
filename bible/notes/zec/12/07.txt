\v 7 Yahweh will protect those who live in the other places in Judah before he rescues the people of Jerusalem, in order that people will not honor the descendants of David and those in Jerusalem more than the people in all the rest of Judah.
\v 8 At that time, Yahweh will protect everyone in Jerusalem. The weakest soldiers among them will be as strong as David was, and the descendants of David will be like God; they will lead the others like the angel of Yahweh himself.
\v 9 At that time, I will prepare to destroy all the armies that attack Jerusalem."

while the house of David will be like God, like the angel of Yahweh in front of them.
