\v 6 Then he said to me, "This is the message that Yahweh \add says that you should give\add* to Zerubbabel \add the governor of Judah\add*: 'You will do what I want you to do, but it will not be by your own strength or power. It will be done by \add the power of\add* my Spirit, says the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels.
\p
\v 10 No one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* should think that little things that are done at the beginning of a big project are unimportant. \add When the temple is almost finished being rebuilt\add*, Zerubbabel will use a plumb line\f + \ft Or: string with a stone fastened to it \f* \add to see if the walls they are building are straight\add*, so when the people see that, they will rejoice."
