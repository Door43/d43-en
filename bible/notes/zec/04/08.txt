\v 8 Moreover the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\v 9 The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and you shall know that
Jehovah of hosts has sent me to you.
\v 10 For who has despised the day of small things? for these seven shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of
Zerubbabel; these are the eyes of Jehovah, which run to and fro through the whole earth.
