\v 8 Then Yahweh gave me \add another\add* message.
\v 9 He said to me, "Zerubbabel \f + \ft synecdoche \f* laid the first stone in the foundation of the temple, and he will put the last stone in its place. When that happens, the people will know that it is I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, who have sent you to them.
\p
\v 10 No one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* should think that little things that are done at the beginning of a big project are unimportant. \add When the temple is almost finished being rebuilt\add*, Zerubbabel will use a plumb line\f + \ft Or: string with a stone fastened to it \f* \add to see if the walls they are building are straight\add*, so when the people see that, they will rejoice."

\v 11 Then I asked the angel, "What is the meaning of the two olive trees, one on each side of the lampstand?

\v 8 Then Yahweh gave me another message.
\v 9 He said to me, "Zerubbabel himself laid some of the stones for the foundation of the temple, and he will put some of the last stones in their places." Then I said to the other men with him, "When that happens, the people will know that it is Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, who has sent me to you.

\p
\v 10 The people who are mocking the slow way in which they are building the temple again—these same people will be glad when they see Zerubbabel holding a plumb line in his hand.
\p The seven lamps represent the eyes of Yahweh, who looks back and forth at everything that happens all over the earth."
\v 11 Then I asked the angel, "What is the meaning of the two olive trees, one on each side of the lampstand?

\v 8 The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
\v 9 "The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house and his hands will bring it to completion." 
\q Then you will know that Yahweh of hosts has sent me to you.
\v 10 Who has despised the day of small things? These people will rejoice and will see the plumb stone in the hand of Zerubbabel. (These seven lamps are the eyes of Yahweh that roam over the whole earth.)"
\v 11 Then I asked the angel, "What are these two olive trees that stand on the left and the right of the lampstand?"
