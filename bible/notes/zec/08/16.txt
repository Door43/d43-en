===== translationNotes: =====

  * **that you must do** - "You" refers to the people of Judah.
  * **Speak truth, every person with his neighbor** - The abstract noun "truth" can be translated using the adjective "true." AT: "Everyone must say only true things to his neighbor" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **his neighbor** - Here "neighbor" means any person, not just someone who lives nearby.
  * **Judge with truth, justice, and peace in your gates** - This can be restated to remove the abstract nouns "truth," "justice," and "peace." AT: "When you are making decisions in your gates, judge in a way that is true and just and causes people to live peacefully with each other" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **in your gates** - The assumed knowledge is that this refers to the places where judgment took place. AT: "in your places of judgment" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **do not love false oaths** - The implied information is that this refers to oaths taken in a court of law. AT: "do not approve when people tell lies in court cases" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:zec:01:04|1:4]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
