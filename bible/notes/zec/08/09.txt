\v 9 "Yahweh of hosts says this: 
\q You who now continue to hear the same words 
\q that came from the prophets' mouths
\q when the foundation of my house was laid—this house of mine, Yahweh of hosts:
\q Strengthen your hands so that the temple can be built.

\q
\v 10 For before those days 
\q no crops were gathered in by anyone; there was no profit for either man or beast.
\q And there was no peace from enemies for anyone going or coming.
\q I had set every person each against his neighbor.
