===== translationNotes: =====

  * **If something seems impossible in the eyes of** - The eyes represent seeing, and seeing represents thoughts or judgment. AT: "If something does not appear to be possible to" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **the remnant of this people** - "the people of Judah who survive"
  * **should it also seem impossible in my eyes?** - This question expects a negative answer in order to persuade his people to trust in his promises. It can be translated as a statement. AT: "it will surely be possible for me!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **in my eyes** - The eyes represent seeing, and seeing represents thoughts or judgment. AT: "to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:zec:01:04|1:4]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **I am about to rescue my people** - The implied information is that the people are in exile. "I am about to rescue my people of Judah who went into exile" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **from the land of the sunrise and from the land of the setting sun** - Possible meanings are 1) this is a poetic way of expressing specific countries to which the people were exiled. AT: "From the land to the east and from the land to the west" or 2) this is a merism that means from all directions. AT: "from all lands in every direction" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **I will be their God in truth and in righteousness** - This can be rewritten to remove the abstract nouns "truth" and "righteousness." AT: "I will be their God. I will be faithful to them and act toward them in a just manner" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
