====== Zechariah 02:8-9 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 The \add armies of the\add* nations that \add attacked you and\add* took away your valuable possessions have attacked those who are very precious to the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels [IDI]. So he says this about me: "After I have honored him and sent him to \add rebuke\add* the nations,
\v 9 \add it is as though\add* I will strike them with my fist, with the result that those who were their slaves will now take back those possessions from those who caused them to become slaves." And when that happens, you will know that the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels is the one who sent me.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Yahweh, powerful commander of the angel armies, told me to go to the nations who took everything you owned, for those who harm you harm what is most precious to me!
\v 9 I must tell them that it is though I, a prophet, will raise my hand against them, then their own Jewish slaves will take back those possessions from them, who had captured them. And when that happens, you will know that Yahweh, powerful commander of the angel armies, is the one who sent me.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    Zechariah 2:8 presents many interpretive and text-critical issues making the pronouns in this section very complex.
    * **He**  - This pronouns refers to Yahweh.
    * **I/me/my**  - Some think these pronouns refer to the Messiah, that is Jesus.  Since God and Jesus are one, God is the sender and the one sent.  Others think these pronouns refer to Zechariah being sent by God.  The TFT and UDB are clearly in this last camp, while the ULB could be read either way.
    * **you**  - This pronoun refers to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.
    * **they/them**  - This pronoun refers to the nations that plundered.
    * **plundered**  - This word means to steal things by force.
    * **the apple of God's eye**  - This phrase is an idiom and means "God's favorite", people he cherishes above all others.  See: [[:en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:idiom]]
    * **hand**  - The meaning in this instance refers to God's power.
