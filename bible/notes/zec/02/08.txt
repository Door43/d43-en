====== Zechariah 02:8-9 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 The \add armies of the\add* nations that \add attacked you and\add* took away your valuable possessions have attacked those who are very precious to the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels [IDI]. So he says this about me: "After I have honored him and sent him to \add rebuke\add* the nations,
\v 9 \add it is as though\add* I will strike them with my fist, with the result that those who were their slaves will now take back those possessions from those who caused them to become slaves." And when that happens, you will know that the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels is the one who sent me.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, honored me by telling me to go to the nations who took everything you owned, for those who harm you harm what is most precious to him! After he did that, he said this to me:
\v 9 "Tell them that I, Yahweh, will attack them. Their own slaves will take back their possessions from them, the people who had taken them in the first place." When that happens, you Jewish people will know that Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, is the one who sent me, Zecariah, as a prophet.

<usfm>
\v 8 For after Yahweh of hosts honored me and sent me against the nations that plundered you—
\q for whoever touches you, touches the apple of God's eye!—after Yahweh did this, he said,
\q
\v 9 "I myself will shake my hand over them, and they will be plunder for their slaves."
\q Then you will know that Yahweh of hosts has sent me.
