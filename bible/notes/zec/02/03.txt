  * **The second angel said to him** - "The second angel said to the angel who had talked with me"
  * **Jerusalem will sit in the open country ... beasts within her** - The phrase "will sit in the open country" translates a word that refers to a city that has no walls.

  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:zec:01:04|1:4]].
