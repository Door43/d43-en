===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Sing for joy, daughter of Zion** - "Zion" is the same as "Jerusalem." The prophet speaks of the city as if it is a daughter. Possible meanings are 1) Zechariah personifies the city as a person who can sing. AT: "Sing for joy, Zion" or 2) the phrase "daughter of Zion" is a metonym for the people who live in the city. AT: "Sing for joy, people of Zion" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I myself am about to come and encamp among you** - "I myself am about to come and live among you." To "encamp" means to set up and use a camp.
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:zec:01:04|1:4]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **great nations will join themselves to Yahweh** - Zechariah speaks of the people of great nations becoming Yahweh's people and worshiping him as if they were joining themselves to Yahweh. AT: "the people of great nations will become the people of Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **in that day** - "at that time"
  * **I will encamp in the midst of you** - "I will live among you"
