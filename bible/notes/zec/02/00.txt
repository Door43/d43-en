====== Zechariah 02 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter is introduced in prose with imagery used in the rest of the chapter to portray Zechariah's third vision about measuring lines given by the Lord. 

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 2:4b-13, which are extended quotations.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

It is important for each of these visions to keep their meanings and not be interpreted to mean any specific thing. So please be careful to translate each of the terms in your language. 

== Visions ==

This book contains a number of visions given to Zechariah so the images are not ones Zechariah actually saw but were given to him in a vision or dream. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

"this is Yahweh's declaration" is used a number of times in this chapter. The UDB often translates this as "Yahweh says".
