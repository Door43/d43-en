====== Zechariah 03 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter is introduced in prose and then shares the fourth vision of the priest in filthy clothes. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:priest]]) 

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 3:7-9, which is an extended quotation.

=== Difficult concepts in this chapter ===

== Visions ==
It is important for each of these visions to keep their meanings and not be interpreted to mean any specific thing. So please be careful to translate each of the terms in your language. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== The High Priest ==

This chapter seems to refer to a particular person, Joshua the high priest. However, little is known about him. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:highpriest]])
