\v 1 Then \add Yahweh\add* showed me Joshua, the Supreme Priest, who was standing in front of the angel that Yahweh had sent. And Satan was standing at Joshua's right side, ready to accuse him.
\v 2 But Yahweh said to Satan, "Satan, I am rebuking you! I am the one who has chosen Jerusalem \add to be my special city\add*, and I am rebuking you! This man, \add Joshua\add*, \add has been brought back from Babylonia\add*; he is surely like \f + \ft metaphor, rhetorical question \f* a burning stick that has been snatched from a fire."

\v 2 But the angel of Yahweh said to Satan, "Satan, may Yahweh rebuke you! He has chosen Jerusalem to be his special city, and may he rebuke you! This man, Joshua, has been brought back from Babylonia; he is certainly like a burning stick that someone has snatched from a fire."

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh shows Zechariah a vision.

  * **Is this not a brand pulled from the fire?** - AT: "Joshua is like a stick pulled from a fire" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **a brand pulled from the fire** - A brand is a piece of burning wood that is removed from a fire before it is completely burned up. This refers to Joshua, who was rescued from captivity in Babylon and returned to Jerusalem (see UDB). (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **filthy garments** - In this vision dirty clothes are being used as a symbol to show sinfulness.
