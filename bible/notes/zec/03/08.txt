<usfm>
\v 8 Joshua, you are the high priest, and your associates are sitting in front of you. The fact that they are here means that I will bring a special servant of mine, someone who I will call the Branch."
\v 9 Then the angel of Yahweh placed a stone in front of Joshua and said to him and to the other men with him: "Look at the stone that I have put in front of Joshua. There are seven sides on the stone. I will engrave a message on that stone, and in one day I will remove the guilt of all the people of this country.

\v 8 Listen, Joshua the high priest, you and your companions who live with you! 
\q For these men are a sign, for I myself will bring up my servant the Branch.

\v 9 Now look at the stone that I have set before Joshua. There are seven sides to this single stone,
