\v 8 Joshua, you are the high priest, and your associates are sitting in front of you. The fact that they are here means that I will bring a special servant of mine, someone who I will call the Branch."
\v 9 Then the angel of Yahweh placed a stone in front of Joshua and said to him and to the other men with him: "Look at the stone that I have put in front of Joshua. There are seven sides on the stone. I will engrave a message on that stone, and in one day I will remove the guilt of all the people of this country.

===== Translation Notes: =====

The angel of Yahweh continues to speak to Joshua.

  * **your companions who live with you**  - AT: "the other priest who live with you"
  * **my servant the Branch**  - The title "Branch" should be translated in the same way as the branch of a tree. It means the servant of Yahweh will come from Yahweh like a branch comes from a tree. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **engrave**  - "carve"
  * **inscription**  - words that are written on something or cut into something
  * **this is Yahweh of hosts' declaration** - This phrase is often translated as "Yahweh says" in the UDB. You can translate this concept whichever way is best in your language. This phrase is used many times in Zechariah.
