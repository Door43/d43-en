\v 11 But the people refused to pay attention \add to what Yahweh said\add*. They turned their backs to him, and put their hands over their ears \add in order to not hear what he said\add*.
\v 12 They were very stubborn [IDI], and they would not listen to the laws \add that God gave to Moses\add* or the messages that the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels told his Spirit to give to the former prophets. So the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels was very angry.

\v 11 But the people refused to pay attention to what Yahweh had said. They refused to cooperate with him; they refused to listen to what he said.
\v 12  He had given these messages for his Spirit to repeat to the prophets in earlier times. The prophets were meant to speak these messages to the people. But the people were very stubborn; they would not listen to the law of Moses or to any message from God. So Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies, became very angry with them.

\v 11 But they refused to pay attention and set their shoulders stubbornly; they stopped up their ears so they would not hear.
\v 12 They made their hearts as hard as rock so they would not hear the law or the words  of Yahweh of hosts. He had sent these messages to the people by his Spirit in earlier times, by the mouth of the prophets. But the people refused to listen, so Yahweh of hosts was very angry with them.
