\v 13 The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says, "When I called\f + \ft Or: spoke \f* to them, they would not listen. So when they called\f + \ft Or: prayed \f* to me, I did not listen.
\v 14 And I caused them to be scattered among many nations, where they were strangers. \add It was as though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a whirlwind \add picked them up and carried them away from their country\add*. The country\f + \ft Or: land \f* that they \add were forced to\add* leave was ruined, with the result that no one could \add live there or\add* even travel through it. \add It was previously\add* a delightful land, but they caused it to become desolate\f + \ft Or: like a desert \f*."

\v 13 In those times, when Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies, called to the people, they refused to listen. So he said,  "In exactly the same way, I will refuse to listen when they call to me.
\v 14 And I will scatter them among many nations, where they will be strangers. I will scatter them like a storm scatters leaves. And their land will be forlorn, with no one living there. No one will travel through it, because they will have turned it, their most pleasant land, into a wilderness."

\v 13 It happened that when he called they did no hear. 'In the same way,' said Yahweh of hosts, 'they will cry out but I will not hear!
\v 14 For I will scatter them with a whirlwind to all the nations that they have not known, and the land will be desolate
after them—for no one will pass from or return to the land, since they make the desirable land ionto a wasteland.'"
