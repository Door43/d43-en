<usfm>
\v 13 The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says, "When I called\f + \ft Or: spoke \f* to them, they would not listen. So when they called\f + \ft Or: prayed \f* to me, I did not listen.
\v 14 And I caused them to be scattered among many nations, where they were strangers. \add It was as though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a whirlwind \add picked them up and carried them away from their country\add*. The country\f + \ft Or: land \f* that they \add were forced to\add* leave was ruined, with the result that no one could \add live there or\add* even travel through it. \add It was previously\add* a delightful land, but they caused it to become desolate\f + \ft Or: like a desert \f*."

<usfm>
\v 13 In those times, when Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, called to the people, they refused to listen. So he said, "In exactly the same way, I will refuse to listen when they call to me.
\v 14 And I will scatter them among many nations, nations that they have never been to before. I will scatter them as a storm scatters leaves. After they are gone, their own land will be empty, with no one living there. No one will travel through it and no one will come back to it, because they have turned it, their most pleasant land, into a wilderness."

\v 13 It happened that when he called, they did not listen. In the same way," said Yahweh of hosts, "they will call out to me, but I will not listen.
\v 14 For I will scatter them with a whirlwind to all the nations that they have not seen, and the land will be desolate after them. For no one will pass through the land or return to it since the people have made their delightful land into a wasteland."
