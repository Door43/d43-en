<usfm>
\v 13 Then Yahweh said to me, "\add That is a ridiculously small amount of money that they have paid to you\add*! So throw it to the man who makes clay pots!" So I took the silver to the temple of Yahweh, and I threw it in the chest where the offerings\f + \ft Or: money \f* is kept.
\p
\v 14 Then I broke my second staff, the one that I named 'Union.' That \add indicated that\add* Judah and Israel would no longer be united.

\v 14 Then I broke my second staff, the one that I had named "Union." That indicated that Judah and Israel would no longer be together as brothers.

===== Translation Notes: =====
The parable about shepherds and sheep continues.
  * **treasury** - the storehouses in the temple of Yahweh
  * **the excellent price** - This means to say that this price was very small for a shepherd doing Yahweh's work. See UDB, which removes the irony: "a ridiculously small amount of money." (See: [[[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **the thirty pieces of silver** - 330 grams of silver. A shekel weighed eleven grams. (See: [[en:obe:other:biblicalmoney]])
