===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The parable about shepherds and sheep continues.

  * **treasury** - This is the place in the temple of Yahweh where the priests kept the money. Many versions of the Bible translate this as "potter." This is the person who would melt metal to make vessels out of it. Here Yahweh would mean that the payment is so small that the shepherd should have the silver melted to show how insulted he was.
  * **the excellent price** - Yahweh uses irony to say that this price was very small for a shepherd doing Yahweh's work. AT: "the ridiculously small amount of money" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **between Judah and Israel** - Here "Judah" represents the people of the southern kingdom and "Israel" represents the people of the northern kingdom. AT: "between the people of Judah and the people of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
