\v 15 Then Yahweh said to me, "Take again the things that a foolish shepherd uses,
\v 16 because I am going to appoint a new king for the people, one who will not \add take care of my people. He will be like a foolish shepherd\add*: \f + \ft metaphor \f* He will not take care of those who are dying, those who are very young, those who have been injured, or those who do not have enough food. Instead, he will \add treat them very cruelly, like a shepherd who would\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* kill and eat the best sheep and tear off their hoofs.

\v 15 Then Yahweh said to me, "Take again the things that a foolish shepherd uses,
\v 16 because I am going to appoint a new shepherd for the people, one who will not take care of my people. He will be a foolish shepherd: he will ignore the dying sheep and those that have gotten lost. As for the healthy sheep, he will not feed them; instead, he will butcher them for his own food and will tear off their hooves.

\v 15 Yahweh said to me, "Again, take the equipment of a foolish shepherd for yourself,
\v 16 for see, I am about to set in place a shepherd in the land. He will not care for the perishing sheep. He will not seek out the sheep gone missing, 
nor heal the crippled sheep. He will not feed the sheep that are healthy, but will eat the flesh of the fattened sheep and will tear off their hooves.
