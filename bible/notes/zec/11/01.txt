<usfm>
\v 1 You people of Lebanon must open your gates and allow the fire to burn your cedar trees!
\v 2 Your cypress trees must be like people who are wailing 
because enemies have cut down the cedar.
Those glorious trees are all gone.
 The oak trees in the Bashan region should also be like people who are wailing,
because enemies have cut down the other trees in the dense forest, too.
\v 3 And listen to the shepherds crying
because the fertile pastures have been ruined.
Listen to the lions roar;
they roar because the thick forest where they live near the Jordan River has been ruined.
