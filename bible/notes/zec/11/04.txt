====== Zechariah 11:4-6 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 This is what Yahweh my God said to me: "\add I want you to\add* become a shepherd for a flock of sheep that are about to be slaughtered.
\v 5 The people who are going to buy the sheep will kill the sheep, and they will not be punished. Those who are selling the sheep say, 'I praise Yahweh, because I will become rich!' Even the shepherds do not feel sorry for the sheep.
\v 6 And similarly, I no longer feel sorry for the people of this country. I am going to allow many of them \f + \ft hyperbole \f* to be captured by other people or by their king. Those who capture them will ruin this country, and I will not rescue any of the people."

\v 4 This is what Yahweh my God said to me: "I want you to supervise this flock of sheep until the flock perishes.
\v 5 The dealers in sheep will kill the sheep, and no one will punish them. Those who sell the sheep will say, 'I praise Yahweh, because I will become rich!' And the shepherds whom the owners hire do not feel sorry for the sheep.
\v 6 And similarly, I no longer feel sorry for the people of this country. I am going to allow their fellow countrymen and their king, to oppress them. They will ruin this country, and I will not rescue any of them."

\v 4 This is what Yahweh my God says: "Like a shepherd, watch over the flock destined for slaughter!
\v 5 (The ones who buy them slaughter them and are not punished, and the ones who sell them say, 
'Blessed be Yahweh! I have become rich!' for the shepherds working for the flocks' owners have no pity on them.)
\v 6 For I will no longer pity the inhabitants of the land!"â€”this is Yahweh's declaration. "See! I myself am about to turn over every person into his neighbor's hands and into his king's hands. They will crush the land. I will not rescue Judah from their hand."

===== Translation Notes: =====
Here Yahweh starts to give instructions to Zechariah in the form of a parable about shepherds and sheep.

  * **the inhabitants of the land**  - "the people of the land"
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - This phrase is often translated as "Yahweh says" in the UDB. You can translate this concept whichever way is best in your language. This phrase is used many times in Zechariah.
  * **turn over every person into his neighbor's hands** - AT: "allow each person to be controled by another person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **and into his king's hands** - AT: "and into the unjust control of his king" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **they will crush the land** - AT: "They will have no mercy on the land's people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will not rescue Judah from their hand** - AT: "but I will not rescue the people of Judah from their power" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
