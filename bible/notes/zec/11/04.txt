<usfm>
\v 4 This is what Yahweh my God said to me: "\add I want you to\add* become a shepherd for a flock of sheep that are about to be slaughtered.
\v 5 The people who are going to buy the sheep will kill the sheep, and they will not be punished. Those who are selling the sheep say, 'I praise Yahweh, because I will become rich!' Even the shepherds do not feel sorry for the sheep.
\v 6 And similarly, I no longer feel sorry for the people of this country. I am going to allow many of them \f + \ft hyperbole \f* to be captured by other people or by their king. Those who capture them will ruin this country, and I will not rescue any of the people."

\v 4 Thus said Jehovah my God: Feed the flock of slaughter;
\v 5 whose possessors kill them, and hold themselves not guilty; and they that sell them say, Blessed be Jehovah, for I am
rich; and their own shepherds pity them not.
\v 6 For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, says Jehovah; but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his
neighbor’s hand, and into the hand of his king; and they shall strike the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver them.
