====== Zechariah 11:4-6 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 This is what Yahweh my God said to me: "\add I want you to\add* become a shepherd for a flock of sheep that are about to be slaughtered.
\v 5 The people who are going to buy the sheep will kill the sheep, and they will not be punished. Those who are selling the sheep say, 'I praise Yahweh, because I will become rich!' Even the shepherds do not feel sorry for the sheep.
\v 6 And similarly, I no longer feel sorry for the people of this country. I am going to allow many of them \f + \ft hyperbole \f* to be captured by other people or by their king. Those who capture them will ruin this country, and I will not rescue any of the people."

\v 4 This is what Yahweh my God said to me: "I want you to supervise this flock of sheep until the flock perishes.
\v 5 The dealers in sheep will kill the sheep, and no one will punish them. Those who sell the sheep will say, 'I praise Yahweh, because I will become rich!' And the shepherds whom the owners hire do not feel sorry for the sheep.
\v 6 And similarly, I no longer feel sorry for the people of this country. I am going to allow their fellow countrymen and their king, to oppress them. They will ruin this country, and I will not rescue any of them."

\v 4 This is what Yahweh my God says, "Like a shepherd, watch over the flock destined for slaughter!
\v 5 (The ones who buy them slaughter them and are not punished, and the ones who sell them say,
'Blessed be Yahweh! I have become rich!' for the shepherds working for the flocks' owners have no pity on them.)
\v 6 For I will no longer pity the inhabitants of the land!—this is Yahweh's declaration. See! I myself am about to turn over every person into the hand of his neighbor and into the hand of his king, and they will destroy the land and none of them will I deliver them from their hand."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In 11:4-17 is a story about two shepherds. Possible meanings are 1) Zechariah actually became a shepherd over a flock as a symbolic act showing how Yahweh will treat his people or 2) Zechariah tells a parable that teaches how Yahweh will treat his people. Since it is uncertain which of these meanings is correct, it would be best not to specify either option in the translation. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]])

  * **watch over the flock destined for slaughter** - "take care of a flock of sheep that the owners plan to slaughter"
  * **are not punished** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "no one punishes them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the inhabitants of the land** - "the people of the land"
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:zec:01:04|1:4]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **See!** - "Listen!" or "Pay attention!"
  * **I myself** - The word "myself" is used to emphasize that it is Yahweh who will do these things. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_rpronouns]])
  * **turn over every person into the hand of his neighbor and into the hand of his king** - Here "hand" represents power or control. AT: "allow the people to harm each other and the king will oppress them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **none of them will I deliver them from their hand** - Here "hand" represents power or control. AT: "I will not save them from those who are harming them" or "I will not rescue them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
