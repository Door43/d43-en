\v 10 Then I took the staff that I had named 'Kindness' and I broke it. That \add showed that Yahweh\add* was annulling\f + \ft Or: canceling \f* the agreement that he had made with all the people-groups.
\v 11 So that agreement was ended immediately. And the men who bought and sold sheep who were watching me knew \add by seeing what I was doing\add* that I was giving them a message from Yahweh.
\p
\v 12 I told them, "If you think it is what you should do, pay me \add for taking care of the sheep\add*. If you do not think that is what you should do, do not pay me." So they paid me \add only\add* thirty pieces of silver.

\v 10 And I took my staff Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.
\v 11 And it was broken in that day; and thus the poor of the flock that gave heed to me knew that it was the word of
Jehovah.
\v 12 And I said to them, If you think good, give me my hire; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my hire thirty
pieces of silver.
