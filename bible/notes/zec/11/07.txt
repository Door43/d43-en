<usfm>
\v 7 So I became the shepherd of a flock of sheep that were about to be slaughtered \add for their meat to be sold\add* to the dealers. I took good care of the sheep, even the ones that were the weakest sheep. Then I took two shepherds' staffs\f + \ft Or: walking sticks \f*. I named the one staff 'Kindness' and the other staff 'Union.' And I took good care of the sheep.
\v 8 But the three shepherds detested me, and I became impatient with them. Within one month I dismissed\f + \ft Or: got rid of \f* those shepherds \add who had previously been taking care of the flock\add*.
\p
\v 9 So I said \add to the dealers\add*, "I will no longer be the shepherd. I will allow the ones that are dying to die. I will allow the ones that are getting lost to get lost. And I will not prevent those that remain from destroying each other."

\v 7 So I fed the flock of slaughter, verily the poor of the flock. And I took to me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and
the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.
\v 8 And I cut off the three shepherds in one month; for my soul was weary of them, and their soul also loathed me.
\v 9 Then said I, I will not feed you: that which dieth, let it die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and
let them that are left eat every one the flesh of another.
