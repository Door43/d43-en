<usfm>
\v 7 So I became the shepherd of a flock of sheep that were about to be slaughtered \add for their meat to be sold\add* to the dealers. I took good care of the sheep, even the ones that were the weakest sheep. Then I took two shepherds' staffs\f + \ft Or: walking sticks \f*. I named the one staff 'Kindness' and the other staff 'Union.' And I took good care of the sheep.
\v 8 But the three shepherds detested me, and I became impatient with them. Within one month I dismissed\f + \ft Or: got rid of \f* those shepherds \add who had previously been taking care of the flock\add*.
\p
\v 9 So I said \add to the dealers\add*, "I will no longer be the shepherd. I will allow the ones that are dying to die. I will allow the ones that are getting lost to get lost. And I will not prevent those that remain from destroying each other."

\v 7 So I became the shepherd of a flock of sheep that dealers were going to slaughter and sell the meat of. Then I took two shepherds' staves. I named the one staff 'Kindness' and the other staff 'Union.' And I took good care of the sheep.
\v 8 But the three shepherds who had been with the flock detested me, and I became impatient with the dealers who had hired us all. Within one month I had destroyed those shepherds.
\p
\v 9 So I said to the dealers, "I will no longer be a shepherd for you. I will allow the ones that are dying to die. I will allow the ones that are getting lost to perish. And I will not prevent those that remain from eating each other."

\v 7 So I became the shepherd of the flock meant for the slaughter, for those who dealt in sheep. I took two staves; one staff I called "Favor" and the other I called "Unity." And I shepherded the flock.
\v 8 I destroyed the three shepherds in one month. I grew waery with the sheep dealers—those who had hired me, for  their soul also despised me.
