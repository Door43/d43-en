=== What is the Book of Zechariah about? ===

This book is a collection of messages from Yahweh that Zechariah spoke to the Jews who had returned to Judah from Babylon. In these messages, Zechariah calls on the people to return to Yahwe and to renew the [[:en:obe:kt:covenant|covenant]] with him. Zechariah also encourages the people who were disappointed that the new temple was much smaller than the original temple. He does this by telling them his vision from Yahweh about a temple in the future.

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

"The Book of Zechariah" may also be called the "The book about Zechariah" or "The sayings of Zechariah." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]).

=== Who wrote the Book of Zechariah? ===

The priest Zechariah, son of Berekiah, probably transmitted Yahweh's messages in this book to the Jewish people between 520 BC and 480 BC, following the ministry of Haggai.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

== What is the meaning of the term "Israel"? ===

The name “Israel” is used in many different ways in the Bible. The descendants of Jacob, who was also named Israel, were a people group who became known as Israel. This people group developed into the unified nation of Israel. After the civil war in the nation of Israel, the tribes in the north took the name Israel, while the southern kingdom became known as the Kingdom of Judah. Zechariah uses the term "Israel" to refer to both the nation of Israel as well as the northern kingdom of Israel.

=== What imagery does Zechariah use in reference to the Messiah? ===

Zechariah presents the [[:en:obe:kt:christ|Messiah]] as both a king and a shepherd. The Messiah will come as a deliverer, yet be "pierced" and "lamented." The Messiah will have great power but will still suffer. 

=== What does the phrase "that day" mean? ===

Zechariah often speaks of the [[:en:obe:kt:lastday|last days]] by using the phrase "that day" or "in that day." When referencing a future "day," the translator should be aware that it is possible that the author is speaking about the last days.
