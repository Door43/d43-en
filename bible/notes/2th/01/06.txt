  * **and relief to you**  - This example of ellipsis leaves out the words "for God to return". It can be translated as, "and for God to return relief to you." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis|Ellipsis]])
  * **angels of his power **  - God's powerful messengers
  * **In flaming fire will he take vengeance**  - "Then with blazing fire he will punish" (UDB) or "The Lord Jesus will punish with blazing fire"
