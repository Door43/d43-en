\v 9 Our Lord Jesus will drive them far from himself, where he will destroy them forever, far from where he rules with very great power.
\v 10 The Lord Jesus will do this when he comes back from heaven at the time that God has decided. As a result, all we who are his people will praise him and marvel at him. And you will be there, too, because you believed what we solemnly told you.

<usfm>
\v 9 They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power,
\v 10 when he comes on that day to be glorified by his saints, to be marveled at by all those who believed because our testimony to you was believed.
