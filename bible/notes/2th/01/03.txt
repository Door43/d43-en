\v 3 \add Our\add* fellow believers, we thank God very frequently \f + \ft hyperbole \f* for you because we believers ought \add to thank God for each other, and\add* specifically it is appropriate\f + \ft Or: right \f* \add that we should thank God for you. We thank him\add* that you are trusting in \add the Lord Jesus\add* more and more, and that each one of you is loving \add each of\add* the others more and more.
\v 4 As a result, we keep proudly telling about you to the \add other\add* congregations who \add worship\add* God. \add Specifically, we tell them\add* that you are being steadfast and that you \add continue\add* believing \add in the Lord Jesus\add*, even though you are frequently suffering \f + \ft doublet \f* as a result of people causing you trouble.

\v 3 Our fellow believers, we are always thanking God, and we should do this,   because you are trusting in the Lord Jesus more and more, and because every one of you is loving each of the others more and more.
\v 4 As a result, we keep proudly talking about you to the other groups of believers belonging to God. We tell them how you are being patient and how you continue trusting in the Lord Jesus, even though other people frequently cause you much trouble.


\p
\v 5 Since you are enduring all that trouble, we clearly know that God will judge all people justly. In your case, he will declare to everyone that you are worthy for him to rule forever, because you accept to suffer as you trust in him.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 3 We should give thanks to God always for you, brothers, for it is appropriate, because your faith is growing very much, and the love of each one of you abounds toward one another.
\v 4 So we ourselves speak proudly about you among the churches of God concerning your patience and faith in all your persecutions and afflictions that you endure.
\v 5 This is an obvious sign of the righteous judgment of God, with the result that you will be counted worthy of the kingdom of God for which you also suffer.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **We should**  - "we" refers to Paul, Silas, and Timothy but not to the Thessalonian audience. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **give thanks to God always**  - "give thanks to God frequently" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **for it is appropriate**  - "for it is the right thing to do" or "for it is good"
  * **toward one another** - "towards your fellow believers"
  * **for you**  - This refers to the believers at Thessalonica. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **We ourselves**  - "ourselves" is a reflexive pronoun used here to emphasize Paul's boasting. Some translations just state "we".
  * **persecutions and afflictions** - These words mean basically the same thing. Paul uses them to emphasize how severely they were suffering. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **that you will be counted worthy**  - that God would consider you valuable for Him to have you in His kingdom
