\v 8 It is then that God will allow this man, who rejects God's laws completely, to show himself to everyone in the world. Then the Lord Jesus will speak a single command that will destroy him. Just by showing himself to everyone when he returns, Jesus will cause that man to become completely powerless.


\p
\v 9 But before Jesus destroys him, Satan will give that man very great power. As a result, he will do all kinds of supernatural miracles and amazing deeds, and many people will believe that God was making him able to do those things.
\v 10 And by doing wicked deeds, that man will completely deceive those who are doomed to perish. He will be able to deceive them because they did not agree to love the true message about how Jesus could save them.

\v 8 Then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth, and bring to nothing by the revelation of his coming.
\v 9 The lawless one's coming will be due to the work of Satan with all power, signs, and false wonders,
\v 10 and with all deceit of unrighteousness for those who are perishing, because they did not receive the love of the truth that they might be saved.
