\v 3 Do not allow anyone to persuade you to believe such a message.



\p The Lord will not come immediately. First, many people will rebel against God. They will accept and obey a certain man who will sin very greatly against God, the one who will destroy everything that God has done.
\v 4 He will be the supreme enemy of God. He will proudly work against everything that people consider to be God and everything that people worship. As a result, he will even enter God's Temple and sit down there to rule! He will publicly proclaim that he himself is God!

\v 3 Let no one deceive you in any way. For it will not come until after the falling away comes, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction.
\v 4 This is he who opposes and exalts himself against all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he sits in the temple of God and he portrays himself as God.
