===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 Our fellow believers, you whom our Lord Jesus loves, we should always  thank God for you. We should do this because he chose you to be among the first people to believe in the truth about Jesus, among the first people that God would save, and to set you apart for himself by means of his Spirit.
\v 14 We thank God that he chose you as a result of our proclaiming the message about Christ to you, in order that God might honor you in some of the same ways that he honors our Lord Jesus Christ.


\p
\v 15 So, our fellow believers, continue to strongly believe in Christ. Continue believing the true things that we have taught you when we spoke to you and wrote a letter to you.

\p
\v 13 But we should always give thanks to God for you, brothers loved by the Lord, because God chose you as the first fruits for salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief in the truth,
\v 14 to which he called you through our gospel to obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
\v 15 So then, brothers, stand firm, and grasp the traditions that you were taught, whether by word or by our letter.
