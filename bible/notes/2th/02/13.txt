\v 13 Our fellow believers, you whom our Lord Jesus loves, we should always  thank God for you. We should do this because he chose you to be among the first people to believe in the truth about Jesus, among the first peope that God would save and set you apart for himself by means of his Spirit.
\v 14 We thank God that he chose you as a result of our proclaiming the message about Christ to you, in order that God might honor you in some of the same way that he honors our Lord Jesus Christ.
