=== What is the Book of 2 Corinthians about? ===

2 Thessalonians was written by Paul shortly after 1 Thessalonians. Paul was still in Corinth, and he was with Silas and Timothy. This letter seems to be written because of new information about events that were affecting the church in Thessalonica. 2 Thess. 2:2 implies that there was a false letter written in the name of Paul that was received by the church in Thessalonica, and that the teaching in that letter led to some confusion. You will note that Paul signs his own signature at the end of the letter, to ensure the validity of this letter.
 
There were two main themes in 2 Thessalonians. The first matter is the confusion that arose about the Second Coming, called the “Parousia” or the “arrival” of Jesus Christ. Some had said that Christ had already come back to earth from heaven, and that the Christians in Thessalonica had been excluded (in some ways) from the promise of the return of Christ. This led to considerable confusion, not only about the future of Christ’s return, but about the condition of those Christians who had already died. The second matter Paul addresses was the issue of idleness, or laziness (see 3:6-15). Paul reminded them of the diligence and hard work that he and his associates demonstrated before them. Whatever the cause for the laziness or “idleness” of some, Paul teaches them, “If one is unwilling to work, let them not eat.”

=== Who wrote the Book of 2 Corinthians? ===

The second letter to the Thessalonians was written by the Apostle Paul (1:1).  He wrote this letter shortly after 1 Thessalonians, around 51 years after the birth of Christ.  Paul was still in Corinth when he wrote this letter to the church in Thessalonica, a church which he had founded on his second missionary journey (Acts 17:1-10).  It says in the book of Acts that the church was made up of some Jews and many Greeks.
