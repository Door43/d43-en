\v 6 \add Our\add* fellow believers, we command you, with the authority \f + \ft metonymy \f* that our Lord Jesus Christ \add has given to us\add*, that you stop associating with every fellow believer who is lazy and refuses to work. That is, you must stay away from those who are not \add conducting their lives\add* in the manner that we taught you.
\v 7 \add We tell you this\add* because you yourselves know that you should \add behave\add* like we \add behaved\add*. We did not just sit \add around\add* without working\f + \ft Or: were never lazy \f* \add while we were living\add* among you.
\v 8 Specifically, we did not eat anyone's food if we did not pay \add that person\add* for it. Instead, we worked very hard \add to support ourselves\f + \ft Or: to earn the money to buy what we needed\add* \f*. We worked hard \f + \ft doublet \f* during the day and the night, in order that we would not have to depend on any of you \add to supply what we needed\add*.
\v 9 We have always had the right \add to depend on you for money, but instead we worked hard in order to make ourselves\add* examples for you, in order that you should behave like we behave.

\v 6 Our fellow believers, we command you—and it is as if the Lord Jesus Christ himself were saying this—that you stop associating with every fellow believer who is lazy and refuses to work. That is to say, you must stay away from those who are not conducting their lives in the manner that others taught us and that we in turn taught you.
\v 7 We tell you this because you yourselves know that you should behave like we behaved. We did not merely sit around without working while we were living among you.
\v 8 That is to say, we did not eat anyone's food if we did not pay for it. Instead, we worked very hard to support ourselves during the day and the night, in order that we would not have to depend on any of you for what we needed.
\v 9 We have always had the right to depend on you for money because I am an apostle, but instead, we worked hard in order to be good examples for you, in order that you should behave like we behave.

\p
\v 6 Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you avoid every brother who lives idly and not according to the traditions that you received from us.
\v 7 For yourselves know how you ought to imitate us. We did not behave in a lazy manner among you,
\v 8 nor did we eat anyone's food without paying. Instead, in labor and toil we worked night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you.
\v 9 It is not that we do not have authority, but that we should be an example to you, so that you may imitate us.
