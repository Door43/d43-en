\v 1 As for the other matters, our fellow believers, pray for us that more and more people will hear our message about our Lord Jesus and honor it, just as you have done.
\v 2 Pray also for us that God will keep wicked and evil people from harming us, for not everyone believes in the Lord.


\p
\v 3 Nevertheless, the Lord Jesus is trustworthy! So we are sure that he will cause you to continue to be strong. We are also sure that he will protect you from Satan, the evil one.

\v 1 And now, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be glorified, even as it also is with you,
\v 2 and that we may be delivered from wicked and evil people, for not all have faith.
\v 3 But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard you from the evil one.
