<usfm>
\v 10 Remember that when we were \add there\add* with you, we kept commanding you that if any \add fellow believer\add* refuses to work, \add you should not give\add* him food to eat.
\v 11 \add We command you this\add* again now, because someone has told to us that some of you are lazy and not working at all! Not only that, some of you are interfering \add with what other people are doing!\add*


\p
\v 12 We command those fellow believers who are not working, and urge \add them\add* by the authority \f + \ft metonymy \f* of our Lord Jesus Christ, that they settle down and support themselves by working\f + \ft Or: work to earn money to buy what they need \f*.

\v 10 Remember that when we were there with you, we kept commanding you that if any fellow believer refuses to work, you should not give him food to eat.
\v 11 Now we tell you this again, because someone has told us that some of you are lazy and not working at all. Not only that, some of you are interfering with what other people are doing.


\p
\v 12 We command those fellow believers who are not working, and urge them, just as if the Lord himself were speaking, that they they should mind their own business, earn what they need to live on, and support themselves.

\v 10 When we were with you we commanded you, "If any one does not want to work, he should not eat."
\v 11 For we hear that some walk idly among you; they do not work but are instead meddlers.
\v 12 Now such ones we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they should work and eat their own food.
