\v 4 When the Year of Celebration comes, \add when all the land that has been bought by someone is returned to its original owners\add*, the land that belonged to Zelophehad will belong to the tribes of the men that his daughters marry. So some of our land, the land that we received from our fathers, will be taken from us, \add and we will never own it again\add*."

\v 4 And when the jubilee of the descendants of Israel comes, then their portion will be added to the portion of the tribe to which they will belong. So their portion will be taken away from the portion of the tribe of our fathers.”
