\v 4 When the Year of Celebration comes, \add when all the land that has been bought by someone is returned to its original owners\add*, the land that belonged to Zelophehad will belong to the tribes of the men that his daughters marry. So some of our land, the land that we received from our fathers, will be taken from us, \add and we will never own it again\add*."

\v 3 But if his daughters marry men in another tribe among the people of Israel, then their share of land will be removed from our ancestor’s share. It will be added to the share of the tribes that they join. In that case, it will be removed from the assigned share of our inheritance.  
 
\v 4 In that case, when the jubilee of the people of Israel comes, then their share will be joined to the share of the tribe that they have joined. In this way, their share will be taken away from the share of our ancestors’ tribe.”
