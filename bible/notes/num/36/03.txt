\v 4 When the Year of Celebration comes, \add when all the land that has been bought by someone is returned to its original owners\add*, the land that belonged to Zelophehad will belong to the tribes of the men that his daughters marry. So some of our land, the land that we received from our fathers, will be taken from us, \add and we will never own it again\add*."
