\v 3 When a young woman living in her father's house makes a vow to Yahweh and binds herself with a promise,

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **has bound herself with a promise** - Here Moses speaks of a woman promising to do something as if her promise were a physical object the she ties to herself. AT: "commits herself to fulfilling a promise" or "promises to do something" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **by which she has bound herself** - Here Moses speaks of how a woman has committed herself to fulfilling a promise as if her promise were a physical object that she had bound to her body. AT: "which she has committed herself to fulfill" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to reverse her** - "to cancel what she has said"
  * **then all her vows will remain in force. Every promise by which she has bound herself will remain in force** - These two statements said basically the same thing meaning and emphasize that she must keep all of her vows. AT: "then she must fulfill every vow and promise she has made" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
