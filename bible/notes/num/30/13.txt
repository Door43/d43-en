\v 13 Every vow or oath a woman takes that binds her to deny herself something may be confirmed or canceled by her husband. 
\v 14 But if he says nothing at all to her day after day, then he confirms all her vows and binding promises that she has made. He has confirmed them because he has said nothing to her at the time that he heard about them.
