\v 6 If her father overrules her on the day he hears all the vows she made and her solemn promises with which she has bound herself, then they will stand. Yahweh will forgive her because her father had overruled her.

\v 6 However, if her father hears all the vows she made and her solemn promises with which she has bound herself, and if he overrules her on that same day, then they will not remain in force. Yahweh will forgive her because her father had overruled her.
\v 7 If she marries a man while she is under those vows, or if she makes rash promises with which she obligates herself, those obligations will remain in force.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **her solemn promises with which she has bound herself** - Here Moses speaks of how a woman has committed herself to fulfilling a promise as if her promise were a physical object that she had bound to her body. AT: "her solemn promises which she has committed herself to fulfill" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **will not remain in force** - This phrase means that her vows will not remain in effect, that is, she will be not required to fulfill them. See how you translated this phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:num:30:03|30:4]]. AT: "she will not be obligated to fulfill" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])

  * **If she marries a man while she is under those vows** - "If she gets married after she makes her vows"
  * **she makes rash promises with which she obligates herself** - Here "rash" is an idiom means doing something without thinking about it. AT: "she promises something without thinking carefully about it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
