===== translationNotes: =====

  * ** the vow that she has made ... the rash talk of her lips** - These two phrases refers to the same thing. The second phrase describes the vow that the woman made. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **the rash talk of her lips** - The phrase "the rash talk" refers to the rash promise that she made. The woman is referred to as "her lips" because lips are related to speech. AT: "the rash things she has said" or "her rash promise" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **with which she has bound herself** - Here Moses speaks of how a woman has committed herself to fulfilling a promise as if her promise were a physical object that she had bound to her body. AT: "which she has committed herself to fulfill" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
