===== translationNotes: =====

  * **her vow and her promise** - These two phrases have very similar meaning. They emphasize what she has promised to do. AT: "her vow" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **she took on herself** - Here the woman committing herself to fulfilling her vows is spoken of as if her vows were a garment that she placed on herself. AT: "that she committed herself to" or "that she made" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **will remain in force** - This phrase means that her vows will remain in effect, that is, she will be required to fulfill them. See how you translated this phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:num:30:03|30:4]]. AT: "she will be obligated to fulfill" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
