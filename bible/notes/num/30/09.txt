\v 10 If a woman made a vow in her husband's house or obligates herself by taking an oath,
\v 11 and her husband hears of it, but he says nothing to her and he does oppose her, then all her vows must stand and the obligations she made must remain in force.

  * **will remain in force against her** - This is an idiom. It means that her vows will remain in effect and she will be required to fulfill them.
