\v 9 But the vow of a widow, or of her that is divorced, even everything wherewith she has bound her soul, will stand against her.
\v 10 And if she vowed in her husband’s house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath,
\v 11 and her husband heard it, and if he held his peace at her, and disallowed her not, then all her vows will stand, and every bond with which she bound her soul will stand.
