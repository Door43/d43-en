===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Please heal her, God, please** - Here the word "please" is repeated for emphasis.
  * **If her father had spit in her face** - This describes something that could have happened but did not. Spitting in someone's face was an act of insult and made the person who was spit upon unclean. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **Miriam was shut outside the camp** - AT: "Moses shut Miriam outside the camp" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
