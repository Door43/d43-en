===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Has Yahweh spoken only with Moses? Has he not spoken also with us?** - Miriam and Aaron ask these questions to emphasize that Yahweh has spoken to them also and that they should have authority like Moses. This rhetorical question can be expressed as a statement. AT: "Yahweh has not spoken only with Moses. He has also spoken with us." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Now Yahweh heard** - Here "now" does not mean "at this moment," but it draws attention to the important point that follows.
  * **Now the man Moses** - Here the word "now" is used to mark a break in the main storyline. The narrator tells background information about Moses' character. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
