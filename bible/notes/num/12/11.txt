===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Please do not let her be like a dead newborn whose flesh is half consumed when it emerges from its mother’s womb** - Aaron compares Miriam to a stillborn baby whose body is already decaying because the leprosy would cause her body to decay until she dies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
