\v 18 I have taken the Levites from among the people of Israel instead of all the firstborn.
\v 19 I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons. I have taken them from among the people of Israel to do the work of the people of Israel in the tent of meeting. I have given them to atone for the people of Israel so that no plague will harm the people when they come near to the holy place."

  * **I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons** - Yahweh appointing the Levites to help Aaron and his sons is spoken of as if they were a gift that Yahweh were giving to Aaron and his sons. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I have taken them ... I have given them** - Here "them" refers to the Levites.
  * **instead of all the first-born** - The missing words may be added to make the meaning clear. AT: "instead taking all of the first-born" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
