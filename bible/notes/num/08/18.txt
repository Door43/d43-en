\v 18 I have taken the Levites from among the people of Israel instead of all the firstborn.
\v 19 I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons. I have taken them from among the people of Israel to do the work of the people of Israel in the tent of meeting. I have given them to atone for the people of Israel so that no plague will harm the people when they come near to the sanctuary."
