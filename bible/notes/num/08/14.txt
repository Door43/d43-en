\v 14 In this way you must separate the Levites from among the people of Israel. The Levites will belong to me.
\v 15 After that, the Levites must go in to serve in the tent of meeting. You must purify them. You must lift them up to me as an offering.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **You must purify them. You must lift them up** - Yahweh repeats these thing to emphasize their importance. These things must happen before the Levites go to serve at the tent of meeting. AT: "But first, you must purify them. You must lift them up" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **You must lift them up to me as an offering** - Aaron was to present the Levites to Yahweh as if he were lifting up a sacrifice to offer it to him. AT: "You must dedicate them to me, as if you were lifting them up to me as an offering" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
