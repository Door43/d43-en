=== What is the Book of Numbers about? ===

Numbers is the story of the people of Israel as they traveled from Mount Sinai in the wilderness to the Jordan River. After many hardships, the Israelites were very discouraged, and they rebelled against the leaders whom God had given them. It was at the Jordan River that the people of Israel refused to enter the Promised Land. Because the Israelites were afraid to follow Yahweh's guidance, he delayed Israel's entry for forty years (13:1–14:45). (See: [[:en:obe:kt:promisedland]])

=== How should the title of this book be translated? ===

The title of this book, "Numbers," refers to the census that was to be taken of the Israelites. Unless the people of the project language are already familiar with the name "Numbers" from other Bible versions, the translator should consider creating a modified name, such as "The Counting of the People of Israel." (See: [[:en:obe:other:census]])

=== Who wrote the Book of Numbers? ===

The writers of both the Old and New Testament present Moses as being very involved with writing the Book of Numbers. However, later scribes and priests probably put the book into its present form; they included material from other sources such as eyewitness accounts and books of history (21:14). One such book was "The Book of the Wars of Yahweh," which may have been completed after Moses' death and which was known to later scribes who worked on the book of Numbers. 

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== What importance does collective or group responsibility play in the Book of Numbers? ===

The tendency was to assume that the entire community of Israel would suffer God's punishment if some of them rebelled against him. Indeed, divine punishment often did fall across the entire nation. This would, in fact, have been the expectation among all peoples in the Ancient Near East. At the same time, the Moses and Aaron, the leaders of Israel, are shown as praying to God for him to punish only the guilty.



===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== Why does Moses speak using third person pronouns about himself? ===

When an author wrote about something he was involved in, it was common for him to use the pronoun "he" instead of "I," or "they" instead of "we." The translator may decide to use the project's normal pronouns instead.
