\v 7 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, 
\v 8 "Take your staff and assemble the community, you, and Aaron your brother. Speak to the rock before their eyes, and command it to flow with water. You will produce water for them out of that rock, and you must give it to the community and their cattle to drink."
