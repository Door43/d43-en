  * [[:en:obe:other:eleazar]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:priest]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:death]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - God continues speaking to Moses.

  * **must die and be gathered to his people** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. They mean that it is time for Aaron to die and for his spirit to go to the place where his ancestors are. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
