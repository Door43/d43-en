===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Must we bring water out of this rock for you?** - Moses asks this question out of frustration to rebuke the people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Must we bring** - Here the word "we" refers to Moses and Aaron and may include Yahweh, but does not include the people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
