\v 22 So the people journeyed from Kadesh. The people of Israel, the whole community, came to Mount Hor.
\v 23 Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron at Mount Hor, on Edom's border. He said,
\v 24 "Aaron must be gathered to his people, for he will not enter the land that I have given to the people of Israel. This is because you both rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah.
