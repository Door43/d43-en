===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues speaking to Moses about Joshua.

  * **You must put some of your authority on him** - AT: "You should give him some of your authority" or "Let him decide what the people should do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Urim** - This was a sacred stone that the High Priest wore on his chest plate. He used it to determine God's will.
  * **will go out and come in** - AT: "will know all they should do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **both he and all the people of Israel with him, the whole community ** - Both of these phrases mean the same thing, and they are used together for emphasis.  AT:  "both he and the entire nation of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
