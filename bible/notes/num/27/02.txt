===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **They stood** - "The daughters of Zelophehad stood"
  * **Eleazar** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:num:03:01|3:2]].
  * **He died in his own sin; instead, it was because of his own sin that he died** - This statement is repeated to emphasize that their father died in the wilderness along with his generation, but not because he rebelled with Korah. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
