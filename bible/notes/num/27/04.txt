===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Why should our father’s name be taken away from among his clan members because he had no son**  - This means that their father's name would be removed from the clan members because only a son will continue the family name; daughters do not continue a family name.
  * **Why should our father’s name be taken away from among his clan members because he had no son**  - The women are asking this question because they are amazed that they have not received land as an inheritance when their father died. AT: "Our father's name should not be taken away from among his clan members because he had no son."
