===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Why should our father’s name be taken away from among his clan members  because he had no son?** - At that time, only sons received land as an inheritance. The daughters use this question to suggest that they should receive the inheritance and continue the family clan. AT: "You should not remove our father's name from the clan members just because he did not have a son."  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
