  * **during the first month, leaving on the fifteenth day of the first month** - Here "first" is the ordinal number one and "fifteenth" is the ordinal number fifteen. This is the first month of the Hebrew calendar. The fifteenth day is near the beginning of April on Western calendars. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_hebrewmonths]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **the people of Israel left openly, in the sight of all the Egyptians** - "the Israelites left in plain view of the Egyptians"
  * **their firstborn** - This refers to the firstborn sons. AT: "their firstborn sons" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **he also inflicted punishment on their gods** - Yahweh proving that he is more powerful than all of the false gods that the Egyptians worshiped is spoken of as if Yahweh punished those false gods. AT: "he also proved that he is greater than their gods" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
