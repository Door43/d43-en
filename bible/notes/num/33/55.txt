\v 55 If you do not force the people who live there to leave, they will cause you to have much trouble. They will be like sharp hooks in your eyes, and like thorns in your sides. And they will bring trouble to you, in that land where you will be living.
\v 56 And then I will punish you, as I had planned to punish them.'~"

\v 55 But if you will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then shall those that you let remain of them be as pricks in your eyous, and as thorns in your sides, and they shall vex you in the land wherein you dwell.
\v 56 And it shall come to pass, that, as I thought to do to them, so will I do to you.
