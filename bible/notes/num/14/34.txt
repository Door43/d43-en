\v 34 Just as the number of the days during which you examined the land—forty days, you must likewise bear the consequences of your sins for forty years—one year for every day, and you must know what it is like to be my enemy.
\v 35 I, Yahweh, have spoken. I will certainly do this to all this evil community that is gathered together against me. They will be consumed in this wilderness. Here they will die.' "
