<usfm>
\v 34 Just as the number of the days during which you examined the land—forty days, you must likewise bear the consequences of your sins for forty years—one year for every day, and you must know what it is like for me to oppose you.
\v 35 I, Yahweh, have spoken. I will certainly do this to all this evil community that is gathered together against me. They will be completely cut off, and here they will die.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **bear the consequences of your sins** - "suffer the consequences of your sins" or "suffer because of your sins"
  * **They will be completely cut off** - This probably means that they will no longer exist. AT: "they will come to an end" or "they will all be destroyed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
