\v 23 Because of that, not one of them will see the land that I promised their ancestors \add that I would give to them\add*. No one who rejected me will see that land.
\v 24 But Caleb, who serves me \add well\add*, is different from the others. He obeys me completely. So I will bring him into that land that he has already seen, and his descendants will inherit\f + \ft Or: possess \f* some of it.
\v 25 So, since the descendants of Amalek and Canaan who are living in the valleys \add in Canaan are very strong\add*, when you leave here tomorrow, \add instead of traveling toward Canaan\add*, go back along the road through the desert towards the Red Sea."

\v 23 So I say that they will certainly not see the land about which I made an oath to their ancestors. Not one of them who despised me will see it, 
\v 24 except for my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit. He has followed me fully; I will bring him into the land which he went to examine. His descendants will possess it.
\v 25 (Now the Amalekites and Canaanites lived in the valley.) Tomorrow turn and go to the wilderness by the way of the Sea of Reeds."
