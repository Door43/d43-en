\v 13 Moses said to Yahweh, "If you do this, then the Egyptians will hear about it, because you rescued this people from them by your power.
\v 14 They will tell it to this land's inhabitants. They have heard that you, Yahweh, are present with this people, because you are seen face to face. Your cloud stands over our people. You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night.

AT: "they have seen you"  or 2) Moses speaks of the intimate relationship between him and God as if Moses could see God's face when God spoke to him. This can be stated in active form.
