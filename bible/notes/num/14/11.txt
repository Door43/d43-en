===== translationNotes: =====

  * **How long must this people despise me? How long must they fail to trust me, despite all the signs ... them?** - Yahweh asks these questions because he has lost patience with the people. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "This people has despised me for too long. They have failed to trust me for too long, despite all the signs ... them." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **disinherit them** - Possible meanings are 1) "reject them from being my people" or 2) "destroy them."
  * **make from your own clan** - Here "your" is singular and refers to Moses. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
