\v 17 So Yahweh, now show that you are very powerful. You said,
\v 18 'I do not quickly become angry; instead, I love people greatly, and I forgive people for having sinned and having disobeyed my laws. But I will always punish \f + \ft litotes \f* people who are guilty of doing what is wrong. When parents sin, I will punish them, but I will also punish their children and their grandchildren and their great-grandchildren and their great-great-grandchildren.'
\v 19 So, because you love people like that, forgive these people for the sins that they have committed, just like you have continued to forgive them ever since they left Egypt."

\v 17 Now, I beg you, use your great power. For you have said,
\v 18 'Yahweh is slow to anger and abundant in covenant faithfulness. He forgives iniquity and transgression. He will  by no means clear the guilty when he brings the punishment of the ancestors’ sin on their descendants,to the third and fourth generation.'
\v 19 Pardon, I plead with you, this people’s sin because of the greatness of your covenant faithfulness, just as you have always forgiven this people from the time they were in Egypt until now."
