  * **to die by the sword** - Here "sword" is to kill by the sword. AT: "to die in battle" or "to have people kill us with swords" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Is it not better for us to return to Egypt?** - This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement, if necessary. AT: "It is better for us to return to Egypt than to try to conquer Canaan." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
