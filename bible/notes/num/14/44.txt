  * **they presumed to go up into the hill country** - "they dared to go up into the hill country even though God did not approve"
  * **into the hill country** - Much of the land of Israel is elevated. When the Israelites crossed the Jordan River valley to attack the Canaanites, there were hills that they had to climb in order to go farther into the land of Canaan.
