===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **they presumed to go up** - "they dared to go up without Yahweh's approval"
  * **into the hill country** - Much of the land of Israel is elevated. When the Israelites crossed the Jordan River valley to attack the Canaanites, there were hills that they had to climb in order to go farther into the land of Canaan.
