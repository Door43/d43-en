\v 38 "Tell this to the Israelite people: 'You and all your descendants must \add twist threads together to\add* make tassels, and then attach them with blue cords to the bottom edges of your clothes.
\v 39 When you look at the tassels, you will remember all the instructions that I gave to you, and you will obey them, instead of doing what you desire and as a result causing yourselves to become unacceptable to me.

\v 37 Again Yahweh spoke to Moses. He said,
\v 38 "Speak to the descendants of Israel and command them to make for themselves tassels to hang from the borders of their garments, to hang them from each border by a blue cord. They must do this throughout their people's generations.
\v 39 It will be a special reminder to you, when you may look at it, of all my commandments, to carry them out so that you do not follow after your own heart and your own eyes, after which you used to act like spiritual prostitutes.
