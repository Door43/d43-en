\v 37 Yahweh also said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*,
\v 38 "Tell this to the Israelite people: 'You and all your descendants must \add twist threads together to\add* make tassels, and then attach them with blue cords to the bottom edges of your clothes.
\v 39 When you look at the tassels, you will remember all the instructions that I gave to you, and you will obey them, instead of doing what you desire and as a result causing yourselves to become unacceptable to me.

\v 37 Again Yahweh spoke to Moses. He said,
\v 38 "Speak to the descendants of Israel and command them to make for themselves tassels to hang from the borders of their garments, to hang them from each border by a blue cord. They must do this throughout their people's generations.
\v 39 It will be a special reminder to you, when you may look at it, of all my commandments, to carry them out so that you do not look to your own heart and your own eyes and prostitute yourselves to them.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the descendants of Israel** - Israel was another name for Jacob. The people of Israel were his descendants. AT: "the people of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **to carry them out** - "to obey them"
  * **so that you do not look to your own heart and your own eyes** - "Look to" here is a metaphor for think about. The heart represents what a person wants, and the eyes represent what a person sees and wants.  AT  "so that you do not think about whatever you want" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **prostitute yourselves to them** - Being unfaithful to God by choosing to do whatever they want is spoken of as if they were women who were unfaithful to their husband by choosing to have sinful relationships with other men. It can be stated clearly that this was a shameful thing to do. AT: "be shamefully unfaithful to me" and "do those things instead of obeying me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
