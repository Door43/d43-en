\v 14 If any foreigners visit you or live among you, if they also want to bring a sacrifice that will be pleasing to me when it is burned on the altar, they must obey these same instructions.
\v 15 I consider that those who have always been Israelites and those who are foreigners are equal, and so they must all obey the same instructions. All of your descendants must also continue to obey these instructions.

\v 14 If a foreigner is staying with you, or whoever may live among you throughout your people’s generations, he must make an offering made by fire, to produce a sweet aroma for Yahweh. He must act as you act.
\v 15 There must be the same law for the community and for the foreigner who stays with you, a permanent law throughout your people’s generations. As you are, so also must be the traveler staying with you. He must act as you act before Yahweh.
\v 16 The same law and decree must apply to you and to the foreigner who is staying with you.' "
