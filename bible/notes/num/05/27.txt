\v 27 When he gives her the water to drink, if she is defiled because she has committed a sin against her husband, then the water that brings the curse will enter her and become bitter. Her abdomen will swell and her thigh will waste away. The woman will be cursed among her people.
\v 28 But if the woman is not defiled and if she is clean, then she must be free. She will be able to conceive children.
