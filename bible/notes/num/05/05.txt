\v 5 Again Yahweh spoke to Moses. He said,
\v 6 "Speak to the people of Israel. When a man or woman commits any sin such as people do to one another, and is unfaithful to me, that person is guilty.
\v 7 Then he must confess the sin that he has done. He must completely pay back the price of his guilt and add to the price one fifth more. He must give this to the one he has wronged.
