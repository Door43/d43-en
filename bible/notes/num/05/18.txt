\v 18 The priest must place the woman before Yahweh. The woman must uncover her head and untie her hair. The priest must put into her hands the grain offering as an indicator. This is the grain offering of jealousy. The priest must hold in his hand the bitter water with the dust in it that can bring a curse on her.
\v 19 The priest must cause her to swear an oath. He must say to the woman, "If no man has slept with you, and if you have not gone astray and committed impurity, then you will certainly be free from this bitter water that can bring a curse.
