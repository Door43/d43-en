\v 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses. He said,
\v 2 "Command the people of Israel to send away from the camp everyone with an infectious skin disease, and everyone who has an oozing sore, and whoever is unclean through touching a dead body.
\v 3 Whether male or female, you must send them out of the camp. They must not defile the camp, because I live in it."
\v 4 The people of Israel did so. They sent them out of the camp, as Yahweh commanded Moses. The people of Israel obeyed Yahweh.
