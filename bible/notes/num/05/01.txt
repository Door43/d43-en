\v 1 Again, Yahweh spoke to Moses. He said,
\v 2 "Command the children of Israel to put out of the camp every leper, and every one that has an oozing sore, and whoever is unclean through touching a dead body.
\v 3 Whether male and female, you will put them out of the camp. They should not defile the camp because I dwell in it."
\v 4 The people of Israel did so. They put them out of the camp as Yahweh spoke to Moses. The people of Israel did this.
