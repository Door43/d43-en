\v 8 But if the wronged person has no close relative to receive the payment, he must pay the price for his guilt to me through a priest, along with a ram to atone for himself.
\v 9 Every offering of the people of Israel, the things that are set aside and brought to the priest by the people of Israel, will belong to him.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But if the wronged person has no close relative to receive the payment** - Usually the wronged person would receive the payment but if that person has died the payment goes to the closest relative. AT: "But if the wronged person has died and has no close relative to receive the payment" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **if the wronged person** - This can be stated in active form.  AT: "if the person whom the guilty person has wronged" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **he must pay the price for his guilt to me through a priest** - If a person made a payment to a priest to pay for his guilt it was the same as if the person had made the payment to Yahweh. 
  * **to atone for himself** - The atonement is made for the man's sin. Here Yahweh refers to the man's sin as "himself." AT: "to atone for his sin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the things that are set aside and brought to the priest by the people of Israel** - This can be stated in active form.   AT: "the things that the people of Israel set aside and bring to the priest" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **The offerings of every person will be for the priest; if anyone gives anything to the priest, it will belong to him** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and may be combined to state that the offerings that someone gives belong to the priest to whom they have been given. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
