  * **if the wronged person** - AT: "if the person whom the guilty person has wronged" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **he must pay the price for his guilt...to atone for himself** - Here the words "he," "his," and "himself" refer to the guilty person.
  * **Every offering presented** - AT: "Every offering that people present" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the things set aside for me by the people of Israel** - AT: "the things that the people of Israel set aside for me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Every man’s holy things will belong to the priest. Whatever a man gives to the priest will belong to that priest** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
