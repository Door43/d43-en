===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Nadab ... Abihu ... Ithamar** - Translate these men's names the say way that you did in [[:en:bible:notes:num:03:01|3:2]].
  * **they offered before Yahweh unacceptable fire** - Here the word "fire" is used to refer to "burning incense." See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:num:03:03|3:4]]. AT: "they burned an incense offering to Yahweh in a way that he did not approve of" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **who were counted** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "whom the leaders counted" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **twenty-three thousand** - Standard practice is to write large numbers as numerals. "23,000" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **one month** - "1 month"
  * **because no inheritance was given to them** - "because Yahweh said they would not receive any land as an inheritance"
