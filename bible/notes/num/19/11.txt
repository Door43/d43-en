<usfm>
\v 11 All those who touch a corpse will be unacceptable to me for seven days.
\v 12 On the third day and on the seventh day \add after touching a corpse\add*, in order to become acceptable to me again, \add they must sprinkle on themselves\add* some of that water for removing the guilt of their sin. If they do not do that on both of those days, they will continue to be unacceptable to me.
\v 13 All those who touch a corpse, and do not perform in the correct way the ritual to become acceptable to me again, defile Yahweh's Sacred Tent. They will no longer belong to the Israelite people. The water to remove the guilt of sin was not sprinkled on them, so they continue to be unacceptable to me.

\v 11 Whoever touches the dead body of any man will be unclean for seven days.
\v 12 Such a person must purify himself on the third day and on the seventh day. Then he will be clean. But if he does not purify himself the third day, then he will not be clean on the seventh day.
\v 13 Whoever touches a dead person, the body of a man who has died, and does not purify himself—this person defiles Yahweh’s tabernacle. That person must be cut off from Israel because the water for impurity was not sprinkled on him. He will remain unclean; his uncleanness will remain on him.
