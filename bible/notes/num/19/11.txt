===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 All those who touch a corpse will be unacceptable to me for seven days.
\v 12 On the third day and on the seventh day \add after touching a corpse\add*, in order to become acceptable to me again, \add they must sprinkle on themselves\add* some of that water for removing the guilt of their sin. If they do not do that on both of those days, they will continue to be unacceptable to me.
\v 13 All those who touch a corpse, and do not perform in the correct way the ritual to become acceptable to me again, defile Yahweh's Sacred Tent. They will no longer belong to the Israelite people. The water to remove the guilt of sin was not sprinkled on them, so they continue to be unacceptable to me.

\v 11 He that touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days:
\v 12 the same shall purify himself therewith on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.
\v 13 Whosoever touches a dead person, the body of a man that has died, and purifieth not himself, defiles the tabernacle of Jehovah; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water for impurity was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him.
