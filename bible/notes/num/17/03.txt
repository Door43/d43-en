\v 3 There must be one stick for the leader of each tribe, so you must carve Aaron's name on the stick for the tribe of Levi.
\v 4 Put those sticks inside the Sacred Tent, in front of the sacred chest that has in it the tablets on which the Ten Commandments are written. That is the place where I always talk with you.
\v 5 Buds will sprout on the stick of the man whom I have chosen \add to be the priest\add*. \add When the people see that\add*, they will stop their constantly complaining about you \add because they will realize that he is the one whom I have chosen\add*."

\v 3 You must write Aaron's name on Levi's staff. There must be one staff for each leader from his ancestors' tribe.
\v 4 You must place the staffs in the tent of meeting in front of the covenant decrees, where I meet with you.
\v 5 It will happen that the staff of the man whom I choose will bud. I will cause the complaints from the people of Israel to stop, which they are speaking against you."
