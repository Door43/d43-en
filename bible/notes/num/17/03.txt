\v 3 There must be one stick for the leader of each tribe, so you must carve Aaron's name on the stick for the tribe of Levi.
\v 4 Put those sticks inside the Sacred Tent, in front of the sacred chest that has in it the tablets on which the Ten Commandments are written. That is the place where I always talk with you.
\v 5 Buds will sprout on the stick of the man whom I have chosen \add to be the priest\add*. \add When the people see that\add*, they will stop their constantly complaining about you \add because they will realize that he is the one whom I have chosen\add*."

\v 3 You will write Aaron’s name on the rod of Levi for there will be one rod for each head of their fathers’ houses.
\v 4 And you will lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you.
\v 5 And it will be that the rod of the man whom I will choose will bud. I will make to cease from me the complaints of the descendants of Israel, which they complain against you.
