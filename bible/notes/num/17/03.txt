\v 5 Buds will sprout on the stick of the man whom I have chosen \add to be the priest\add*. \add When the people see that\add*, they will stop their constantly complaining about you \add because they will realize that he is the one whom I have chosen\add*."

\v 3 You must write Aaron's name on Levi's staff. There must be one staff for each leader from his ancestors' tribe.
\v 4 You must place the staffs in the tent of meeting in front of the covenant decrees, where I meet with you.
\v 5 It will happen that the staff of the man whom I choose will bud. I will cause the complaints from the people of Israel to stop, which they are speaking against you."
