===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **he lay face down** - This was a posture of submission and indicates that Moses was praying to Yahweh and fearful of how he might react to the people's rebellion.
  * **who is reserved for Yahweh** - AT: "whom Yahweh has reserved for himself" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **bring him up to himself** - Here the word "him" refers to the man whom Yahweh chooses and "himself" refers to Yahweh.
