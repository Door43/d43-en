\v 8 Again, Moses said to Korah, "Hear now, you sons of Levi,
\v 9 is it a small thing to you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of Yahweh, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them?
\v 10 He has brought you near, and all your brethren the sons of Levi with you and seek you the priesthood also!
\v 11 Therefore you and all your company are gathered together against Yahweh. And Aaron, what is he that you murmur against him?"
