\v 9 The God of us Israelites has chosen all of you to be close to him in order that you can work for him at his Sacred Tent and serve the people. Does that seem to be unimportant\f + \ft Or: mean nothing \f* to you \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?
\v 10 Yahweh has brought you, \add Korah\add*, and your fellow descendants of Levi, near to himself. Now are you demanding to become priests also?

\v 8 Again, Moses said to Korah, "Now listen, you descendants of Levi:
\v 9 is it a small thing for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the community of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do work in Yahwehâ€™s tabernacle, and to stand before the community to serve them?
\v 10 He has brought you near, and all your kinfolk, the descendants of Levi, with you, yet you are seeking the priesthood also!
\v 11 That is why you and all your group have gathered together against Yahweh. So why are you complaining about Aaron, who obeys Yahweh?"

  * **you are seeking the priesthood also** - Moses uses this phrase as a rebuke, since this is something that they should not be doing. AT: "you want to be priests also"
