\v 39-40 So Eleazar the priest collected the 250 pans for burning incense that had been used by the men who died in the fire. He hammered the pans very thin to make a covering for the altar, as Yahweh told Moses should be done. That warned the Israelites that only those who were descendants of Aaron were permitted to burn incense as an offering to Yahweh. If anyone else did that, the same thing would happen to him as happened to Korah and those with him.

\v 39-40 Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers that had been used by the men who were burned up. He hammered them out as a covering over the altar, as Yahweh had spoken to him through Moses. They would become a reminder to the people of Israel, so that no person not descended from Aaron would come up to burn incense before Yahweh. In this way, no person would become like Korah and his group.
