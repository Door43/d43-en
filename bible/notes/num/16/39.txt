\v 40 That warned the Israelite people that only those who were descendants of Aaron were permitted to burn incense for an offering to Yahweh. If anyone else did that, the same thing that happened to Korah and those who were with him would happen to them.

\v 39 Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers that had been used by the men that were burnt, and he beat them out for a covering of the altar,
\v 40 to be a memorial to the descendants of Israel, so that no stranger, that is not of the seed of Aaron, would come near to burn incense before Yahweh, that he be not as Korah, and as his company as Yahweh spoke to him by Moses.
