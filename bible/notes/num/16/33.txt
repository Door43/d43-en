\v 33 They and everyone in their families went down alive into sheol. The earth closed over them, and in this way they perished from the midst of the community.
\v 34 All Israel around them fled from their cries. They exclaimed, "The earth may swallow us up also!"
\v 35 Then fire flashed out from Yahweh and devoured the 250 men who had offered incense.
