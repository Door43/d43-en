\v 36 Again Yahweh spoke to Moses and said,
\v 37 "Speak to Eleazar son of Aaron the priest and tell him to take the censers out of the smoldering remains, for the censers are holy, reserved for me. Then they must scatter the embers.
\v 38 Take the censers of those who lost their lives because of their sin. Let them be made into hammered plates as a covering over the altar. Those men did offer them before me, so they are holy, reserved for me. They will be a sign of my presence to the people of Israel.”
