\v 36 Again Yahweh spoke to Moses and said,
\v 37 "Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning and scatter the fire, for they are holy.
\v 38 Take the censers of these sinners against their own lives. Let them be made into beaten plates for a covering of the altar, for they offered them before Yahweh, therefore they are holy. They will be a sign to the descendants of Israel.
