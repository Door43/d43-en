\v 1 Now Korah son of Izhar, son of Kohath, son of Levi, along with Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth, descendants of Reuben, gathered some men.
\v 2 They rose up against Moses, along with other men from the people of Israel, two hundred and fifty leaders of the community who were well-known members in the community.
\v 3 They assembled themselves together to confront Moses and Aaron. They said to them, "You take too much on yourselves. All the community are holy, reserved for Yahweh, every one of them, and Yahweh is among them. Why do you lift up yourselves above the rest of Yahweh’s community?"
