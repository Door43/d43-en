===== translationNotes: =====

  * **from among this community** - Here "community" refers to the 250 men whom Korah gathered at the tabernacle.
  * **lay facedown** - This indicates that Moses and Aaron are humbling themselves before God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **the God of the spirits of all humanity** - Here "spirits" is a metonym that refers either to breath or life-force. AT: "the God who gives life to all humanity" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **if one man sins, must you be angry with all the community?** - This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "please do not be angry with all the community because one man sins." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
