===== Translation Notes: =====
Balaam continues the prophecy under the control of the Spirit of God.

  * **He speaks** - Here Balaam refers to himself as "he."
  * **with his eyes open** - This means Balaam has received the spiritual power to know and understand God's will. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **How beautiful are your tents, Jacob, the place where you live, Israel!** - Both of these statements mean the same thing. They emphasize the Israelite camp was beautiful to Balaam. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
