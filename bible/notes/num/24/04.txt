===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Balaam continues to prophesy under the control of the Spirit of God.

  * **He speaks ... He sees ... he bows** - Here Balaam refers to himself as "He." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **he bows down** - This is an act of humility. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **with his eyes open** - Here "eyes open" is an idiom that means Balaam has received the ability to know what God wants to say. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **How beautiful are your tents, Jacob, the place where you live, Israel!** - Both of these statements mean the same thing. They emphasize the Israelite camp was beautiful to Balaam. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
