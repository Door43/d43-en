===== Translation Notes: =====
Balaam continues the prophecy under the control of the Spirit of God.

  * **Water flows from their buckets, and their seed is well-watered** - This refers to God's blessing on his people when they enter the land he has promised them. They will have plenty of water and healthy crops.
  * **Their king will be higher than Agag** - This means the future king of Israel will have more honor and will be more powerful than Agag. Agag was king of the Amalekites. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **their kingdom will be honored** - AT: "other people will give honor to their kingdom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
