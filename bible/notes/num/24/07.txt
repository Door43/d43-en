===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Balaam continues to prophesy under the control of the Spirit of God.

  * **Water flows from their buckets** - Abundant water is associated with God's blessing on the crops of the land. AT: "God will bless Israel with plenty of water for their crops" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **their seed is well-watered** - Well-watered seed refers to God's blessing on his people so that they will have abundant crops. AT: "They will have plenty of water for their seed to grow healthy crops" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Their king is to be higher ... their kingdom will be honored** - These two phrases have similar meaning, emphasizing how much God will bless them compared to other nations. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Their king is to be higher than Agag** -  Here "higher" refers to greater honor and power. This means the future king of Israel will have more honor and will be more powerful than Agag. Agag was king of the Amalekites. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **their kingdom will be honored** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "other people will give honor to their kingdom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
