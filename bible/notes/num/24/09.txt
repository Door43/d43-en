===== Translation Notes: =====
Balaam finishes the prophecy under the control of the Spirit of God.

  * **He crouches down like a lion, like a lioness** - Balaam compares the Israelites to both male and female lions. This means they are dangerous and always ready to attack. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Who dares disturb him?** - Balaam uses a question to warn all the people to not provoke the Israelites. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **May everyone who blesses him be blessed; may everyone who curses him be cursed** - AT: "May God bless those who bless the Israelites; may he curse those who curse the Israelites" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
