\v 12 And Balaam said to Balak, "Did I not also speak to your messengers that you sent to me? I said,
\v 13 'If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of Yahweh to do either good or
bad of mine own mind. What Yahweh speaks, that will I speak.'
\v 14 And now, behold, I go to my people. Come, and I will inform you what this people will do to your people
in the latter days."
