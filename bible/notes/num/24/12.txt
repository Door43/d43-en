\v 12 Then Balaam replied to Balak, "I said to the messengers that you sent to me,
\v 13 'Even if Balak gave me his palace full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond Yahwehâ€™s word and anything bad or good, or anything at all that I might want to do. I can say only what Yahweh tells me to say.' Did I not say this to them?
\v 14 So now, look, I will go back to my people. But first let me warn you what this people will do to your people in the days ahead."
