===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the blood avenger** - AT: "the relative seeking vengeance"
  * **The community must rescue the accused** - This means if the community judges that the death was accidental then they must save the accused man from the relative who wants to kill him. If the community judges that the death was not accidental, then the relative must execute the accused man. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the one who was anointed with the holy oil**  - AT: "the one you anointed with holy oil" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
