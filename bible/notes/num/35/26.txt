\v 26 But if the manslayer will at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge, to which he has fled,
\v 27 and the avenger of blood finds him outside the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood kills the manslayer, the avenger will not be guilty of blood,
\v 28 because the manslayer should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest. After the death of the high priest, the manslayer may return into the land of his possession.
