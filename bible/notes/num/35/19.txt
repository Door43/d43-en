===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 The blood avenger may himself put a murderer to death. When he meets him, he may put him to death.
\v 20 And if an accused man manhandles anyone in hatred or throws something at him, while hiding to ambush him, so that the victim dies, 
\v 21 or if he strikes him down in hatred with his hand so that the victim dies, then the accused who struck him must surely be put to death. He is a murderer. The blood avenger may put the murderer to death when he meets him.
