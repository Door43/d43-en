\v 33 Do not pollute in this way the land where you live, because blood from murder pollutes the land. No atonement can be made for the land when blood has been shed on it, except  by the blood of the one who shed it.
\v 34 So you must not defile the land in which you live because I am living in it. I, Yahweh, live among the people of Israel.' "
