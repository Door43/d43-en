\v 22 But if an accused man suddenly hits a victim without premeditated hate, or, without lying in wait, throws something that hits the victim,
\v 23 or if he throws a stone that could kill a victim, but if he did not see the victim, then the accused was not the victim's enemy; he was not trying to hurt the victim. But suppose that the victim dies anyway.
