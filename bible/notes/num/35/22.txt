\v 22 But someone might accidentally shove someone else, or he might accidentally throw something at another person and hit him, but not because he hates that person.
\v 23 Or he might drop a rock on someone that he could not see. There is a law for the one who does that did not plan to hurt anyone and did not hate the person who was killed.

\v 22 But if an accused man suddenly hits a victim without premeditated hate or throws something that hits the victim without lying in wait
\v 23 or if he throws a stone that could kill a victim without seeing the victim, then the accused was not the victim's enemy; he was not trying to hurt the victim. But this is what to do if the victim dies anyway.
