\v 5 He sent messengers to Balaam son of Beor, at Pethor which is by the Euphrates River, in the land of his nation and his people.   He called him and said, "Look, a nation has come here from Egypt. They cover the face of the earth and they are right now next to me.
\v 6 So please come now and curse this nation for me,because they are too strong for me. Perhaps then I can manage to attack them and drive them out of the land.  I know that whomever you bless will be blessed, and whomever you curse will be cursed."
