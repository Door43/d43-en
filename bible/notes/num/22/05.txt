\v 5 He sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor which is by the River, the land of the descendants of his people.   He called him and said,  "Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt. They cover the face of the earth and they abide over against me.
\v 6 Come now therefore, I pray you, curse for me this people because they are too mighty for me. Perhaps I will prevail that we may strike them and that I may drive them out of the land.  I know that whomever you bless is blessed and whomever you curse is cursed.
