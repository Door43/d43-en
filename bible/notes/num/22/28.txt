\v 28 Then Yahweh enabled the donkey to speak! It said to Balaam, "What bad thing have I done to you that caused you to strike me three times?"
\p
\v 29 Balaam shouted, "I struck you because you have caused me to appear to be foolish! If I had a sword with me, I would kill you!"
\p
\v 30 But the donkey answered, "I am your own donkey \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*, the one that you have always ridden! Have I ever done anything like this previously?"

\v 28 Then Yahweh opened the donkey's mouth so she could talk. She said to Balaam, "What have I done to you that induced you to strike me these three times?"
\v 29 Balaam replied to the donkey, "It was because you acted so stupidly with me. I wish there were a sword in my hand. If there were, by now I would have killed you."
\v 30 The donkey said to Balaam, "Am not I your donkey on which you have ridden all your life long to this present day? Have I ever been in the habit of doing such things to you before?" Balaam said, "No."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **opened the donkey's mouth so she could talk** - Opening the mouth is associated with the ability to speak. AT: "Then Yahweh gave the donkey the ability to speak like a human would speak" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **She said to Balaam** - "The donkey said to Balaam"
  * **Am not I your donkey on which you have ridden all your life long to this present day** - This rhetorical question was used to convict Balaam that his judgment of the donkey was unfair. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "I am your donkey on which you have ridden all your life, right up to the present moment." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Have I ever been in the habit of doing such things to you before** - This rhetorical question was used to further convict Balaam that his judgment of the donkey was unfair. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "I have never been in the habit of doing such things to you!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
