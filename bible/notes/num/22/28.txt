\v 28 Then Yahweh opened the donkey’s mouth so she could talk. She said to Balaam, "What have I done to you that induced you to strike me these three times?"
\v 29 Balaam replied to the donkey, "It was because you acted so stupidly with me. I wish there were a sword in my hand. If there were, by now I would have killed you."
\v 30 The donkey said to Balaam, "Am not I your donkey on which you have ridden all your life long to this present day? Have I ever been in the habit of doing such things to you before?"  Balaam said, "No."
