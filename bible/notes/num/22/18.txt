\v 18 Balaam answered and said to Balak’s men, "Even if Balak would give me his palace full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of Yahweh, my God, and do less or more than what he tells me.
\v 19 Now then, please wait here tonight too, so that I may learn anything further that Yahweh says to me."
\v 20 God came to Balaam at night and said to him, "Since these men have come to summon you, get up and go with them. But only do what I tell you to do."

  * **I cannot go beyond the word of Yahweh...and do less or more than what he tells me** - This means Balaam cannot disobey Yahweh in any way.
