\v 18 Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, "If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of Yahweh, my God, to do less or more.
\v 19 Now therefore, I pray you, wait you also here this night so that I may know what Yahweh will speak to me more."
\v 20 And God came to Balaam at night and said to him, "If the men come to call you, rise up and go with them but only the word that I speak to you will you do."
