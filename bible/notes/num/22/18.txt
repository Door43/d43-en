\v 18 Balaam answered and said to Balakâ€™s men, "Even if Balak would give me his palace full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of Yahweh, my God, and do less or more than what he tells me.
\v 19 Now then, please wait here tonight too, so that I may learn anything further that Yahweh says to me."
\v 20 God came to Balaam at night and said to him, "Since these men have come to summon you, get up and go with them. But only do what I tell you to do."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Even if Balak would give me his palace full of silver and gold** - Balaam is describing something that would never happen. He is emphasizing that there is nothing that could make him disobey Yahweh. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **I cannot go beyond the word of Yahweh...and do less or more than what he tells me** - This means Balaam cannot disobey Yahweh in any way.
