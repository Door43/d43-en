===== translationNotes: =====

  * **God came to Balaam** - "God appeared to Balaam"
  * **Who are these men who came to you?** - Yahweh uses a question to introduce a new topic of conversation. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "Tell me about these men who came to you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Look, the people ... drive them out** - Balaam restates the message that Balak sent to him. See how you translated many of these phrases in [[:en:bible:notes:num:22:05|22:5-6]].
  * **drive them out** - "chase them away"
