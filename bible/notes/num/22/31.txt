\v 31 Then Yahweh opened the eyes of Balaam and he saw the angel of Yahweh who stood in the way with his sword drawn in his hand. Balaam bowed his head and fell on his face.
\v 32 The angel of Yahweh said to him, "Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come as an adversary because your way is perverse before me.
