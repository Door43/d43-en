\v 21 Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with the leaders of Moab.
\v 22 But because he went, God's anger was kindled. The angel of Yahweh placed himself in the road as someone hostile to  Balaam, who was riding on his donkey. Balaam's two servants were also with him.
\v 23 The donkey saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the road with his drawn sword in his hand. The donkey turned off the road and went into a field. Balaam struck the donkey to turn her back to the road.
