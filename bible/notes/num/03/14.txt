  * **Count the descendants** - Yahweh was commanding Moses to only count the male descendants. AT: "Count the male descendants" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **in their ancestor's houses** - Here their "ancestor's houses" means their "ancestor's households." This is a metonym for their "clans." AT: "by their clans" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **following the word of Yahweh, just as he was commanded to do** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and are used together to emphasize that he obeyed Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
