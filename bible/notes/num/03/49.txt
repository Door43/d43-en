===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **1,365 shekels** - AT: "about 15 kilograms of silver" (See [[en:obe:other:biblicalweight]] and [[en:obe:other:biblicalmoney]])
  * **and to his sons** - Here the word "his" refers to Aaron
  * **he was told to do by Yahweh’s word, as Yahweh had  commanded him** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **he was told to do by Yahweh’s word** - AT: "that Yahweh had told him to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
