===== translationNotes: =====

  * **his separation** - - Here "separation" means "dedication." Also, this abstract noun may be written as a verb. AT: "his dedication" or "for having dedicated himself to Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **he must keep the obligations of the vow he has taken, to keep the promise indicated by the law for the Nazirite** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **the promise indicated by the law for the Nazirite** - This can be stated in active form.  AT: "the promise that the law for the Nazirite indicates" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
