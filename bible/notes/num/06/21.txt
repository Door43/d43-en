  * **he must keep the obligations of the vow he has taken, to keep the promise indicated by the law for the Nazirite** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **the promise indicated by the law for the Nazirite** - AT: "the promise that the law for the Nazirite indicates" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
