====== Numbers 06:12 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 The amount of time that you were set apart for me the previous time does not count, because you had become unacceptable to me \add by coming close to a corpse\add* during the time that you were a Nazir-man. So you must again make a solemn promise to dedicate yourself to me for the entire amount of time that you indicated the previous time. And you must also sacrifice a one year-old lamb to take away your guilt.

\v 12 He must rededicate himself to Yahweh for the time of his separation. He must bring a male lamb one year old as a guilt offering. The days before he defiled himself must not be counted, because he was defiled while he was separate for God.
