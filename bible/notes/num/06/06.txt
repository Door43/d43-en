\v 6 And you must not go near a corpse during the time that you are a Nazir-man.
\v 7 Even if the person who died is your father or your mother or your brother or your sister, you must not cause yourself to become unacceptable to me \add by coming close to the corpse\add*. Your long hair \f + \ft metonymy \f* shows that you belong to me in a special way, so you must do what you have solemnly promised \add and not cut your hair\add*.

\v 6 During all the time that he separates himself to Yahweh, he must not come near a dead body.
\v 7 He must not make himself unclean even for his father, mother, brother, or sister, if they die. This is because he is separated to God, as everyone can see by his long hair.
\v 8 During all the time of his separation he is holy, reserved for Yahweh.
