\v 1 On the day that Moses completed the tabernacle, he anointed it and sanctified it for Yahweh's use, together with all of its furnishings. He sanctified and anointed the altar and all its utensils. He anointed them and sanctified them.
\v 2 On that day, the leaders of Israel, the heads of their ancestor's families, offered sacrifices. These men were leading the tribes. It was they who had overseen the counting of the men in the census.
\v 3 They brought their offerings before Yahweh. They brought six covered carts and twelve oxen. They brought one cart for every two leaders, and each leader brought one ox. They presented these things in front of the tabernacle.
