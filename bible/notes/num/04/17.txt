\v 17 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron. He said,
\v 18 "Do not allow the Kohathite tribal clans to be removed from among the Levites.
\v 19 Protect them, that they may live and not die, by doing this. When they approach the most holy things 
\v 20 they must not go in to see the sanctuary even for a moment, or they must die. Aaron and his sons must go in, and then Aaron and his sons must assign each of the Kohathites to his work, to his special tasks."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **to be removed from among the Levites** - This phrase refers to the death of the Kohathites. AT: "to perish from among the Levites" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **by doing this** - This phrase refers to what is said next. (i.e. "they must not go in to see...")
  * **to his work, to his special tasks** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
