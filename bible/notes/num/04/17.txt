\v 17 Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron. He said,
\v 18 "Do not cause the death of the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites.
\v 19 but do this to them, that they may live and not die. When they approach the most holy things 
\v 20 they will not go in to see the sanctuary even for a moment or they will die.  Aaron and his sons will go in. Aaron and his sons will appoint every one of Kohathites to his service and to his special tasks."
