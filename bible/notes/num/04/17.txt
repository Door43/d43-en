\v 17 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron. He said,
\v 18 "Do not allow the Kohathite tribal clans to be removed from among the Levites.
\v 19 Protect them, that they may live and not die, by doing this. When they approach the most holy things
\v 20 they must not go in to see the holy place even for a moment, or they must die. Aaron and his sons must go in, and then Aaron and his sons must assign each of the Kohathites to his work, to his special tasks."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Kohathites** - This refers to the descendants of Kohath. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:num:03:27|3:27]].
  * **to be removed from among the Levites** - This phrase refers to the death of the Kohathites. This can be stated in active form. AT: "to do anything that will cause me to completely remove them from among the Levites" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **by doing this** - This phrase refers to what Yahweh says next. Moses will protect the Kohathites by not allowing them to go in and see the holy place.
  * **to his work, to his special tasks** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
