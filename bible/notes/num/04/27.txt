===== translationNotes: =====

  * **direct** - "supervise" 
  * **This is the service of the clans of the descendants of the Gershonites for the tent of meeting** - Here the word "service" is an abstract noun that can be expressed by a verb.  Here the word "This" refers to what Yahweh just said. AT: "This is how the clans of the descendants of the Gershonites will serve in the tent of meeting" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Ithamar** - See how you translated this man's name in [[:en:bible:notes:num:03:01|1:2]].
