\v 17 Moses sent them to spy on the land of Canaan. He said to them, "Approach from the Negev and go up into the hill country.
\v 18 See the land, what it is and see the people that dwell there, whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many.
\v 19 See what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities are there that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds.
\v 20 See what the land is, whether it is fat or lean, whether there is wood there, or not. You be of good courage, and bring back of the fruit of the land." Now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes.
