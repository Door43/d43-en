\v 17 Moses sent them to examine the land of Canaan. He said to them, "Approach from the Negev and go up into the hill country.
\v 18 Examine the land to see what it is like. Observe the people who live there, whether they are strong or weak, and whether they are few or many.
\v 19 See what the land is like where they live. Is it good or bad? What cities are there? Are they like camps, or are they fortified cities?
\v 20 See what the land is like, whether it is good for growing crops or not, and whether there are trees there or not. Be brave and bring back samples of the land's produce." Now the time was the season for the first ripe grapes.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Is it good or bad? What cities are there? Are they like camps, or are they fortified cities?** - Moses asks these questions to explain the kind of information that the men were to report back to him. AT: "See if the land is good or bad, what kind of cities are there, and whether those cities are only camps, or whether they have defensive walls around them." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
