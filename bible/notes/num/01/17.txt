  * **Then each man...identified his ancestry. He had to name the clans and families descended from his ancestors** - The second sentence means basically the same thing as the first and is added for clarification. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **He had to name** - AT: "Each man had to say" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
