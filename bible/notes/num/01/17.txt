===== translationNotes: =====

  * **took these men** - "gathered these men together"
  * **who were recorded by name** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "whose names they had recorded" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the first day of the second month** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:num:01:01|1:1]].
  * **Then each man ... identified his ancestry. He had to name the clans and families descended from his ancestors** - The second sentence means basically the same thing as the first and is added for clarification. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **He had to name** - "Each man had to say" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
