\v 20 So Moses replied to them, "If you do what you say, if you arm yourselves to go before Yahweh to war,
\v 21 then every one of your armed men must cross over the Jordan before Yahweh, until he has driven out his enemies from before him
\v 22 and the land is subdued before him. Then afterward you may return. You will be guiltless toward Yahweh and toward Israel. This land will be your possession before Yahweh.
