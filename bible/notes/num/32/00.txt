== Reuben and Gad's inheritance ==

Reuben and Gad were given the land conquered east of the Jordan River. This land had good pastures, and suited these tribes because they had many sheep, goats and cattle. They had not yet entered into the Promised Land, and it would have been sinful to not fight with the rest of Israel. So they promised to enter the land to fight with the other tribes, and then return to their own land. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sin]], [[:en:obe:kt:promisedland]] and [[:en:obe:kt:promise]])
