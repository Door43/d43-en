\v 13 So Yahweh's anger was kindled against Israel. He made them wander around in the wilderness for forty years until all the generation who had done evil in his sight was destroyed.
\v 14 Look, you have risen up in your fathers' place, like just more sinful men, to add to Yahweh's burning anger toward Israel.
\v 15 If you turn away from following him, he will again leave Israel in the wilderness and you will have destroyed all this people."
