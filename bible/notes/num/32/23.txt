===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Be sure that your sin will find you out** -  This means Yahweh will hold them responsible for their sin and he will punish them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **Your servants** - The people of Gad and Reuben refer to themselves as "your servants." This is a polite way of speaking to someone with greater authority.
