===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Should your brothers...Yahweh has given them?** - Moses uses questions to emphasize that the people from Gad and Reuben need to help the other tribes take the land that Yahweh has promised them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **discourage the hearts of the people of Israel from going** - AT: "cause the people of Israel to lose confidence about going" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
