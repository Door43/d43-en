\v 10 So Yahweh became very angry with them, and he solemnly declared this:
\v 11-12 'From all the people who came out of Egypt, the only ones who are at least twenty years old who will see the land that I promised to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, are Jephunneh's son Caleb and Nun's son Joshua, because they trusted me completely. None of the other people who came out of Egypt will even see that land, because they have not completely believed in my \add power\add*.'

\v 10 Yahweh’s anger was kindled in that day, and he sware, and said,
\v 11 ‘Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, will see the land that I sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, because they have not wholly followed me, except for
\v 12 Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun.’ Caleb and Joshua have wholly followed Yahweh.”
