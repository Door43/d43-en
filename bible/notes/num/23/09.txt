===== translationNotes: =====

  * **from the top of the rocks I see him ... from the hills I look at him** - These two phrases mean the same thing. Balaam viewed Israel from the top of a hill. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **I see him ... I look at him** - Here "him" is a metonymy that refers to the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
