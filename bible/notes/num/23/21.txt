===== translationNotes: =====

  * **hardship in Jacob ... trouble in Israel** - These two phrases mean the same thing. Possible meanings are 1) God has given Israel only good things or 2) there is no sin in Israel that would cause him to judge them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **shouts for their king are among them** - "they shout with joy because Yahweh is their king"
  * **with strength like that of a wild ox** - This simile says that Yahweh's great strength is equal to an ox. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
