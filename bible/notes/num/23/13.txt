\v 13 So Balak said to him, "Please come with me to another place where you can see them. You will only see the nearest of them, not all of them. There you will curse them for me."
\v 14 So he took Balaam into the field of Zophim, to the top of Mount Pisgah, and built seven more altars. He offered up a bull and a ram on each altar.
\v 15 Then Balaam said to Balak, "Stand here by your burnt offering, while I meet with Yahweh over there."
