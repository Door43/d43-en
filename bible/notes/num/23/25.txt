\v 25 Then Balak said to Balaam, "Do not curse them or bless them at all."
\v 26 But Balaam answered and said to Balak, "Did I not tell you that I must say all that Yahweh tells me to say?"
\v 27 So Balak replied to Balaam, "Come now, I will take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God for you to curse them there for me."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Balak** - This is the king of Moab. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:num:22:02|22:2]].
  * **Did I not tell you that I must say all that Yahweh tells me to say?** - Balaam uses this rhetorical question to reminds Balak that Balaam refused to disobey God even before he came to Balak. It can be translated as a statement. AT: "I told you before that I must say all that Yahweh tells me to say." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
