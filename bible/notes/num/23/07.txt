===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Balak has brought me from Aram ... the king of Moab from the eastern mountains** - These phrases mean the same thing.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **'Come, curse Jacob for me,' ... 'Come, defy Israel.'** - Both of these statements mean the same thing. They emphasize that Balak wants Balaam to curse the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **How can I curse those whom God has not cursed? How can I oppose those whom Yahweh does not oppose?** - These rhetorical questions emphasize Balaam's refusal to disobey God. They can be translated as statements. AT: "But I cannot curse those whom God has not cursed. I cannot fight against those against whom Yahweh does not fight!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
