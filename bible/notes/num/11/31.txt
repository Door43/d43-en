\v 31 Then a wind came from Yahweh and brought quail from the sea. They fell near the camp, about a day’s journey on one side and a day’s journey on the other side. The quail surrounded the camp about two cubits above the ground.
\v 32 The people were busy gathering quail all that day, all the night, and all the next day. No one gathered less than ten homers of quail. They shared the quail all through the camp.
