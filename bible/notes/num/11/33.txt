\v 33 While the meat was still between their teeth, while they were chewing it, Yahweh became angry at them. He attacked the people with a very great disease.
\v 34 That place was named Kibroth Hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had craved meat.
\v 35 From Kibroth Hattaavah the people traveled to Hazeroth, where they stayed.
