\v 18 Say to the people, 'Dedicate yourselves to Yahweh for tomorrow. You will indeed eat meat, for you have wept in Yahweh's hearing. You said, "Who will give us meat to eat? It was good for us in Egypt." So Yahweh will give you meat, and you will eat it.
\v 19 You will not eat meat for only one day, two days, five days, ten days, or twenty days,
\v 20 but you will eat meat for a whole month until it comes out of your nostrils. It will disgust you because you have rejected Yahweh, who is among you. You have wept before him. You said, "Why did we leave Egypt?"'"
