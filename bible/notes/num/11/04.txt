\v 4 Some foreign people began to camp with Israelâ€™s descendants. They wanted better food to eat. Then the people of Israel began to weep and say, "Who will give us meat to eat?
\v 5 We remember the fish that we ate freely in Egypt, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic.
\v 6 Now we are weak. We see nothing to eat but manna."
