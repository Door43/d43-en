\v 11 Moses said to Yahweh, "Why have you treated your servant so badly? Why are you not pleased with me? You make me carry the load of all these people.
\v 12 Did I conceive all these people? Have I given them birth so that you should say to me, 'Carry them closely to your chest as a father carries a baby?' Should I carry them to the land that you swore to their ancestors to give them?

===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses complains to Yahweh using several rhetorical questions. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

  * **Why have you treated your servant so badly? Why are you not pleased with me?**  - AT: "What have I done wrong to deserve to be treated like this?" or "I have done nothing wrong to deserve this." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **carry the load of all these people** - Moses is complaining that it is too difficult to be responsible for all these people.
  * **Did I conceive all these people? Have I given them birth so that you should say to me** - AT: "I am not the father of all these people, so it is not fair that you should say to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Carry them closely to your chest as a father carries a baby** - This means that Moses is to be responsible for the people who cannot take care of themselves, like a parent must care for an infant. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Should I carry them...to give them?** - AT: "I am not able to carry them...to give them." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
