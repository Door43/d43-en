\v 13 Where can I find meat to give to all this people? They are weeping in front of me and are saying, 'Give us meat to eat.'
\v 14 I cannot bear all these people alone. They are too much for me.
\v 15 Since you are treating me this way, kill me now, if you are kind to me, and take away my misery."
