\v 21 Then Moses said, "I am with 600,000 people, and you have said, 'I will give them meat to eat for a whole month.'
\v 22 Will we kill flocks and herds to satisfy them? Will we catch all the fish of the sea to satisfy them?"
\v 23 Yahweh said to Moses, "Is my hand short? Now you will see whether or not my word is true."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **600,000 people** - AT: "six-hundred thousand people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **Will we kill flocks and herds to satisfy them? Will we catch all the fish of the sea to satisfy them?** - Moses asks these questions to express his doubt that there could be enough meat to feed all of the people. AT: "We would have to kill entire flocks and herds and catch all the fish of the sea to satisfy them!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **flocks and herds** - These two words mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **to satisfy them** - "to satisfy their hunger"
  * **Is my hand short?** - Here the word "hand" refers to power. AT: "Do you think that I am not powerful enough to do this?" or "I am more than strong enough to do this" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
