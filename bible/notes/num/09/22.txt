\v 22 Whether the cloud stayed on the tabernacle for two days, a month, or a year, for as long as it stayed there, the people of Israel would stay in their camp and not travel. But whenever the cloud was taken up, they would set out on their journey.
\v 23 They would camp at Yahweh's command, and they would travel at his command.  They obeyed Yahweh's command given through Moses.
