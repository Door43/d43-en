\v 21 Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites saying,
\v 22 "Let us pass through your land. We will not turn into any field or vineyard. We will not drink the water from your wells. We will travel by the king’s highway until we have crossed your border.”
\v 23 But king Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through their border. Instead, Sihon gathered all his army together and attacked Israel in the wilderness. He came to Jahaz, where he fought against Israel.
