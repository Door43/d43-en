===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Make a snake** - Since it is impossible for Moses to make a real snake, it is implied that he was to make a model of a snake. This can be stated. AT: "Make a model of a snake" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **everyone who is bitten** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "everyone whom a snake bites" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **a bronze snake** - "a snake out of bronze"
  * **if he looked at the bronze snake, he survived** - Here "he" refers to "any person" whom a snake bites.
