=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Ungrateful ==

The Israelites said, "Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? There is no bread, no water, and we hate this miserable food." After all Yahweh had done, they were very ungrateful. This showed their lack of faith and trust in Yahweh. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:faith]] and [[:en:obe:kt:trust]])
