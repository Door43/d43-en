\v 29 Woe to thee, Moab!
\q You are undone, O people of Chemosh.
\q He has given his sons as fugitives,
\q And his daughters into captivity,
\q To Sihon king of the Amorites.
\q
\v 30 We have shot at them. Heshbon is perished even to Dibon,
\q And we have laid waste even to Nophah,
\q Which reaches to Medeba."
