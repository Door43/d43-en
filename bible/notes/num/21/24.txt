\v 24 But the Israelites completely defeated them and occupied their land, from the Arnon \add River in the south\add* to the Jabbok \add River in the north\add*. They stopped at the border of the land where the Ammon people-group lived, because \add the Ammon army was defending\add* the border strongly.
\v 25 So the Israelites occupied all the cities and towns where the Amor people-group lived, and some of the Israelites began to live in them. They occupied Heshbon \add city\add* and the nearby villages.
\v 26 Heshbon was the capital of the country. It was the city where King Sihon ruled. His army had previously defeated the army of the king of Moab, and then his people had begun to live in all of the land of Moab as far as the Arnon \add River in the south\add*.
