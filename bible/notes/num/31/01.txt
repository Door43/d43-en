===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Avenge the people of Israel against the Midianites** - Yahweh was punishing the Midianites for convincing the Israelites to worship idols.
  * **you will die and be gathered to your people** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. They emphasize that it is time for Moses to die and for his spirit to go to the place where his ancestors are.
