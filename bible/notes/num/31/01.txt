===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Take vengeance on the Midianites for what they did to the Israelites** - Yahweh was punishing the Midianites for convincing the Israelites to worship idols.
  * **you will die and be gathered to your people** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. This is a polite way to emphasize that it is time for Moses to die and for his spirit to go to the place where his ancestors are.
