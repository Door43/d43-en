\v 21 Then Eleazar said to the soldiers who had returned from the battle, "This is what Yahweh has instructed Moses:
\v 22 You must put into a fire any gold or silver or bronze or iron or tin or lead things \add that you brought back from the battle\add*.
\v 23 Put everything that will not burn into the fire, and then they will be acceptable for you to use. But also sprinkle those things with the water that causes things and people to become acceptable to God. The things that \add would burn if you put them\add* in a fire, sprinkle them with that water.
\v 24 On the seventh day, wash your clothes, and then you will become acceptable to God again. After you do that, you may return to the camp."

\v 21 Eleazar the priest said to the men of war that went to the battle, “This is the statute of the law that Yahweh has commanded Moses.
\v 22 The gold, the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
\v 23 and everything that may withstand fire, you will make to go through the fire, and it will be clean. You will purify it with the water. All that remains from the fire you will make to go through the water.
\v 24 And you will wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you will be clean. Afterward you will come into the camp.”
