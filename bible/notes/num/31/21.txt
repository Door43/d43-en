\v 21 Then Eleazar said to the soldiers who had returned from the battle, "This is what Yahweh has instructed Moses:
\v 22 You must put into a fire any gold or silver or bronze or iron or tin or lead things \add that you brought back from the battle\add*.
\v 23 Put everything that will not burn into the fire, and then they will be acceptable for you to use. But also sprinkle those things with the water that causes things and people to become acceptable to God. The things that \add would burn if you put them\add* in a fire, sprinkle them with that water.
\v 24 On the seventh day, wash your clothes, and then you will become acceptable to God again. After you do that, you may return to the camp."

\v 21 Eleazar the priest said to the soldiers who had gone to war, "This is a decreed law that Yahweh has given to Moses:
\v 22 The gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, and lead,
\v 23 and everything that resists fire, you must put it through the fire, and it will become clean. You must then purify those things with the water of cleansing. Whatever cannot go through the fire you must cleanse with that water.
\v 24 And you must wash your clothes on the seventh day, and then you will become clean. Afterward you may come into Israel's camp."
