\v 18 But take for yourselves all the young girls who have never slept with a man.
\v 19 You must camp outside the camp of Israel for seven days. All of you who have killed anyone and or have touched any dead person—you must purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day—you and your prisoners.
\v 20 And purify for yourselves every garment, everything made of animal hide and goats' hair, and everything made of wood."

===== Translation Notes: =====
Moses continues speaking to the commanders of the Israelite army.

  * **All of you** - Moses is referring to anyone who fought in battle, not just the commanders.
  * **everything made of animal hide and goats' hair, and everything made of wood** - AT: "everything that someone has made of animal hide, goats' hair, or wood" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
