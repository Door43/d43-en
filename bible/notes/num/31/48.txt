  * **the commanders ... over hundreds** - Standard practice is to write large numbers as numerals. AT: "the men who commanded 100 soldiers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]])
  * **Your servants have counted** - The commanders refer to themselves as "your servants." This is a polite way to speak to someone with greater authority.
