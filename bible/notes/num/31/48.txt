===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the commanders over thousands** - AT: "the men who commanded 1,000 men" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **the commanders over hundreds** - AT: "the men who commanded 100 men" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **Your servants have counted** - The commanders refer to themselves as "your servants." This is a polite way to speak to someone with greater authority.
