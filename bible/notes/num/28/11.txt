\v 11 At the beginning of each month, you must offer a burnt offering to Yahweh. You must offer two young bulls, one ram, and seven male lambs a year old without blemish.
\v 12 You must also offer three tenths of an ephah of fine flour as a grain offering mixed with oil for each bull, and two tenths of fine flour as a grain offering mixed with oil for the one ram.
\v 13 You must also offer a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering for each lamb. This is to be the burnt offering, to produce a sweet aroma, an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
