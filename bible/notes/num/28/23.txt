\v 23 You must offer these in addition to the regular burnt offering required each morning.
\v 24 As described here, you must offer these sacrifices daily, for the seven days of the Passover, the food of the offering made by fire, a sweet aroma for Yahweh. It must be offered in addition to the regular burnt offering and the drink offering with it.
\v 25 On the seventh day you must have a holy assembly to honor Yahweh, and you must do no normal work on that day.
