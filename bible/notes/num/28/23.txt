\v 23 You will offer these besides the burnt offering of the morning, which is for a continual burnt offering.
\v 24 After this manner you will offer daily, for seven days, the food of the offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh. It will be offered besides the continual burnt-offering and the drink-offering with it.
\v 25 And on the seventh day you will have a holy convocation. You will do no servile work.
