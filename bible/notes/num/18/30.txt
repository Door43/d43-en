\v 30 Therefore you will say to them, 'When you heave the best of them from it, then it will be reckoned to the Levites as the increase of the threshing-floor and as the increase of the wine-press.
\v 31 You will eat it in every place, you and your households, for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting.
\v 32 You will bear no sin by reason of it when you have heaved from it the best of them. You will not profane the holy things of the descendants of Israel, that you die not.'"
