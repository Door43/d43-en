\v 30 Also, tell this to the descendants of Levi: 'When you present those best portions of grain and wine as your offering to me, I will consider that those gifts are as though they came from your own grain and wine.
\v 31 You descendants of Levi and your families are permitted to eat \add the rest of\add* that food, and you may eat it wherever \add you want to\add*, because it is your payment for the work that you do at the Sacred Tent.
\v 32 If you give to the priests the best portions of what you receive, you will not be punished \add by me\add* for accepting one tenth of the gifts that the people bring to me. But you must consider those gifts to be sacred\f + \ft Or: holy \f*.

\v 30 Therefore you must say to them, 'When you present the best of what you have received, then it must be considered by the Levites like the produce from the threshing floor and the winepress.
\v 31 You may eat the rest of your gifts in any place, you and your families, because it is your pay in return for your work in the tent of meeting.
\v 32 You will not incur any guilt by eating and drinking it, if you have presented to Yahweh the best of what you have received. But you must not profane the holy offerings of the people of Israel, or you will die.' "
