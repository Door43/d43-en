\v 17 But the firstborn of a cow, or the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn of a goatâ€”you must not buy back these animals. They are holy, reserved for me. You must splash their blood on the altar and burn their fat as an offering made by fire, to produce a sweet aroma for me.
\v 18 Their meat will be yours. Like the raised breast and the right thigh, their meat will be yours.
