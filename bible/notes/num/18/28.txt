  * **give his contribution to Aaron** - Here "his" refers to Yahweh. It was Yahweh's contribution in the sense that they had to give it to Yahweh. AT: "You must give Aaron the priest the contribution that you owe Yahweh"
  * **that have been given to you** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "that the people of Israel give to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
