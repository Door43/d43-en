\v 10 It is as something most holy, solemnly reserved for me, that you must eat these offerings. Every male among you must eat these offerings. They must be regarded by you as reserved for me.
\v 11 These are the offerings that will belong to you: their gifts that are set apart from all the raised offerings of the people of Israel, offerings that have been raised high before me and presented to me. I have given them to you, your sons, and your daughters, as your ongoing share. Everyone who is ritually clean in your family may eat any of these offerings.
