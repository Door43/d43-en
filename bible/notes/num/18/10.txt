\v 10 These offerings are very holy; every male must eat it, for they are holy to you.
\v 11 These are the offerings that will belong to you: their gifts that are set apart from all the raised offerings of the people of Israel, offerings that have been raised high before me and presented to me. I have given them to you, your sons, and your daughters, as your ongoing share. Everyone who is ritually clean in your family may eat any of these offerings.
