\v 23 Only the descendants of Levi are permitted to work at the Sacred Tent, and they will be punished if anything bad happens to it. That is a law that will never be changed. You descendants of Levi will not receive any land among the other Israelite people,
\v 24 because I will give you one tenth of all the \add crops and animals\add* that the Israelites bring to be offerings to me. That is why I said that you will not receive any land like the other Israelites will receive."

\v 23 But the Levites will do the service of the tent of meeting and they will bear their iniquity. It will be a statute for ever throughout your generations. But among the descendants of Israel they will have no inheritance.
\v 24 For the tithe of the descendants of Israel, which they offer as a presented offering to Yahweh, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance. Therefore I have said to them, 'Among the children of Israel they will have no inheritance.'"
