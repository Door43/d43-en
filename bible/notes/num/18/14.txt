\v 14 Everything devoted in Israel will be yours.
\v 15 Everything that opens the womb, of all flesh which they offer to Yahweh, both of man and beast will be yours. Nevertheless the firstborn of man will you surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts will you redeem.
\v 16 Those that are to be redeemed of them, from a month old, will you redeem, according to your estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary (the same is twenty gerahs).
