\v 14 Everything devoted in Israel shall be thine.
\v 15 Everything that opens the womb, of all flesh which they offer to Jehovah, both of man and beast shall be thine: nevertheless the firstborn of man shall you surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shall you redeem.
\v 16 And those that are to be redeemed of them from a month old shall you redeem, according to your estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary (the same is twenty gerahs).
