**What is Numbers about?**\\

The title of this book, “Numbers” refers to the [[:en:obe:other:census]] that was to be taken of the children of Israel. While Numbers contains a great deal of census information,lists of numbers, this is only part of the book. It has the longest narrative about the people of Israel of any book of the Pentateuch, except Genesis. The account begins at Mt. Sinai, and ends forty years later at the southern border of Canaan. It is the story of the defeats and disappointment of the people of Israel. The nation of Israel, after many defeats, was very discouraged, and they rebelled against the leaders God had given them. The was great tragedy in Kadesh Barnea because the people of Israel failed to enter the [[:en:obe:kt:promisedland|Promised Land]]. They were so frightened by the report of some of the spies that they refused to go into the Promised Land and Yahweh delayed Israel’s entry for forty years (13:1–14:45). No one except Joshua and Caleb, were permitted to enter the Promised Land. This book is also a study on the faults, frailty, and courage of their leader Moses. 

**Who wrote Numbers?**\\

The Bible tells us that Moses composed the book of Numbers. The writers of both the Old and New Testament confirm his part in the composition of the book of Numbers. However, later scribes and priests put the book in its present form, including material from other sources such as eyewitness accounts, and books of history (21:14), “The Book of the Wars of the LORD,” is a book that may have been completed after Moses’ death, and was known by later scribes, who worked on the book of Numbers. Ultimately, one can say that God is the author of Genesis because he inspired Moses’s writings.

**What are the different parts of Numbers?**\\

Numbers has three major parts. The first part covers the account of Israel at Sinai,  the account of the preparation of the journey to the Promised Land (1:1–10:10), and the journey from Sinai to Kadesh (10:11–12:16). The second part covers the account of Israel at Kadesh, the delay related to Israel’s rebellion (13:1–20:13), and the journey to the plains of Moab (20:14–22:1). The third part covers the account of Israel in the plains of Moab, and the hope for the land of promise (22:2–32:42).  


===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

**Does God punish Israel as a whole?**\\
Because Israel has a special relationship with Yahweh, who was their God and king, they experienced divine punishment for their sin. Their disobedience was corporate or as a whole. 

**What is the relationship between the Jewish religion and the religion of the nations?**\\
In Exodus, we are told that Israel was to be a "holy nation."  They were to be different than the other nations around them and not worship the [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod|false gods]] of these nations.  Their idolatry and worship of the god Baal begins in Numbers. While Israel is [[:en:obe:kt:  unfaithful|unfaithful]] and lost out on divine blessings, Yahweh remained [[:en:obe:kt:faithful|faithful]] to them. Additionally, [[:en:obe:kt:avenge|vengenence]] was prevalent in many Ancient Near East cultures, but the Law of Moses protects people and prohibits the enacting of vengeance. 

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

**Why does Moses speak using third person pronouns?**\\
When an author wrote about something he was involved in, it was common for him to use the pronoun "he" instead of "I" or "they" instead of "we." 

**What is the literary genre of Numbers?**\\
There are many different literary genres that occur in different parts of the book.  Often these literary genres will lack easily defined transitions.  This will pose a challenge for translators, smooth transitions may not be possible.
