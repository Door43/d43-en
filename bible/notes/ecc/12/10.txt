===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 I searched for words that would be pleasing to hear\f + \ft Or: read \f*, and what I have written is reliable and true.
\p
\v 11 The things that \add I and other\add* wise people say \add teach people what they should do\add*; they are like \f + \ft simile \f* goads\f + \ft Or: sharp sticks that people use to strike animals to direct where they should go \f*. They are like \f + \ft simile \f* nails that stick out of pieces of wood. They are given to us by \add God, who is like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* our shepherd.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 I searched for words that would be pleasing to hear, and what I have written is reliable and true.
\p
\v 11 The things that I and other wise people say give directions, and they are like nails that fix things together and last a long time. When people follow clear and understandable directions, they know what is right, and, so then they can do it. The sayings of the wise are like our shepherd who guides us where we need to go.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 The Teacher sought to write using vivid, upright words of truth.
\v 11 The words of wise people are like goads. Like nails driven deeply are the words of the masters in collections of their proverbs, which are taught by one shepherd.
