===== translationNotes: =====

  * **A mist of vapor ... everything is vanishing vapor** - The Teacher speaks of things as being useless and meaningless as if they were "vapor". Just as vapor disappears and does not last, the author speaks of things having no lasting value.  See how you translated "vapor" in [[:en:bible:notes:ecc:01:12|1:14]]. AT: "Temporary and useless ... everything is temporary and useless" or "Meaningless ... everything is meaningless" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the Teacher** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ecc:01:01|1:1]].
  * **contemplated and set in order** - "thought much about and arranged" or "thought much about and wrote down"
