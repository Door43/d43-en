  * [[en:obe:other:time]]
  * [[en:obe:other:palace]]
  * [[en:obe:other:tremble]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

The writer describes a house in which various activities stop. This appears to be a metaphor for the human body as it becomes old. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **the women who grind cease because they are few** - "the women who grind grain stop grinding grain because there are few of them"
