===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **wearies them** - "causes them to feel tired"
    * **so they do not even know the road to town** - Possible meanings are 1) that the foolish person becomes so tired from working too hard that he is unable to find his way anywhere, or 2) that the foolish person becomes tired from working too hard because he does not know enough to go home.
