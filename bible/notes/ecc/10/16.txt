===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Woe to you, land ... blessed are you, land** - In these verse, the writer is speaking to the nation as if it were a person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
  * **if your king is a young boy** - This means that the king is inexperienced or immature. Some modern versions, however, interpret the Hebrew word as "a servant."
  * **begin feasting in the morning** - This implies that the leaders are more concerned with having a good time than with leading the nation.
  * **king is the son of nobles** - This implies that the son has been trained by his elders in the customs of being a good king.
