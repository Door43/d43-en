<usfm>
\v 20 Do not even think about cursing the king,
\q2 or cursing rich people, even when you are \add alone\add* in your bedroom,

<usfm>
\v 20 Do not even think about cursing the king,

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q1
\v 20 Do not curse the king, not even in your mind,
\q2 and do not curse rich people in your bedroom.

\q2 whatever has wings can spread the matter.

  * [[:en:obe:kt:curse]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:mind]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:heaven]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:word]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **not even in your mind** - "not even in your thoughts" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **rich people in your bedroom** - "rich people when you are in your bedroom." This means that you should not curse rich people even when you are in a private place where no one else will hear.
  * **For a bird of the sky ... can spread the matter** - These two lines mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. The writer uses the metaphor of a bird to say that people will find out what you have said, one way or another. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
