===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **not even in your mind** - AT: "not even in your thoughts" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **the rich in your bedroom** - "the rich when you are in your bedroom." This means that you should not curse rich people even when you are in a private place where no one else will hear.
    * **For a bird of the sky. . .can spread the matter** -  These two lines mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. The writer uses the metaphor of a bird to say that people will find out what you have said, one way or another. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
