====== Ecclesiastes 09 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of chapter 9, which is an extended quotation. Some lines are indented twice to further set them apart. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Judgment ==
This chapter explains that there is one thing that awaits all people. It is judgment. When people die, they will all face Yahweh's judgment. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:judge]])
