\v 2 But \add we know that some time in the future\add* we will all die;
\q1 it does not matter whether we act righteously or wickedly,
\q2 whether we are good or whether we are bad,
\q1 whether we are acceptable for \add worshiping God\add*
\q2 or whether \add we have done things to cause us to be\add* unacceptable;
\q1 it does not matter if we offer sacrifices \add to God\add* or if we do not;
\q1 it does not matter if we do what we have promised God that we will do or if we do not;
\q2 \add we all die\add*.
\q1 The same thing will happen to good people and to sinful people,
\q2 to those who solemnly promise \add to do things for God\add* and to those who are afraid to make such promises.

<usfm>
\v 2 All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean and to the unclean; to him that sacrifices and to him that sacrifices not; as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that swears, as he that fears an oath.
