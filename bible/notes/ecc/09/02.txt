\v 2 But \add we know that some time in the future\add* we will all die;
\q1 it does not matter whether we act righteously or wickedly,
\q2 whether we are good or whether we are bad,
\q1 whether we are acceptable for \add worshiping God\add*
\q2 or whether \add we have done things to cause us to be\add* unacceptable;
\q1 it does not matter if we offer sacrifices \add to God\add* or if we do not;
\q1 it does not matter if we do what we have promised God that we will do or if we do not;
\q2 \add we all die\add*.
\q1 The same thing will happen to good people and to sinful people,
\q2 to those who solemnly promise \add to do things for God\add* and to those who are afraid to make such promises.

<usfm>
\v 2 Everyone has the same fate. The same fate awaits
\q1 righteous people and wicked,
\q1 the good,
\f + \ft Some modern versions copy ancient versions which have \fqa the good and the bad \fqa* . In this way, they make the phrase complete. Translators may decide to imitate them. \f*
\q1 the clean and the unclean,
\q1 and the one who sacrifices and the one who does not sacrifice.
As good people will die,
\q1 so also will the sinner.
As the one who swears will die,
\q1 so also will the man who fears to make an oath.
</usfm>
