====== Ecclesiastes 09:11-12 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 I have seen something else here on the earth:
\q1 The person who runs fastest does not always win the race,
\q1 the strongest soldiers do not always win the battle,
\q1 the wisest people do not always have food,
\q1 the smartest people do not always become rich,
\q1 and the people who have studied a lot are not always honored\f + \ft Or: treated very specially \f* by others;
\q1 we cannot always control what things will happen to us and where they will happen.
\p
\v 12 No one knows when he will die \f + \ft euphemism \f*;
\q1 fish are cruelly caught in a net,
\q2 and birds are caught in snares\f + \ft Or: traps \f*;
\q1 similarly \f + \ft simile \f*, people experience disasters
\q2 at times when they do not expect them to happen.

<usfm>
\v 11 I have observed some interesting things under the sun. 
\q2 The race does not belong to the swift. 
\q2 The battle does not belong to the strong. 
\q2 Bread does not belong to the wise. 
\q2 Riches do not belong to men of understanding. 
\q2 Favor does not belong to men of knowledge.
\q1 But time and chance affects them all.
\q1 
\v 12 For man does not know his time,
\q2 just like fish trapped in a net of death, 
\q2 or just like  birds caught in a snare. 
\q1 Like animals the sons of men are imprisoned in a time of evil 
\q2 that falls suddenly upon them.
