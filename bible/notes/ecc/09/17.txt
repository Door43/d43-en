===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 Speaking quietly what is very wise is much more sensible
\q2 than a king shouting to foolish people.
\q1
\v 18 Being wise is more useful
\q2 than a lot of weapons;
\q1 but if you do one foolish thing,
\q2 it is possible that because of doing that you will ruin all the good things that you have done.
</usfm>

<usfm>
\v 17 A wise man who speaks quietlyâ€”people hear him better 
\q2 than they hear a king who is shouting to a foolish crowd.
\q1
\v 18 Being wise is more useful
\q2 than having a lot of weapons;
\q1 however, if a person does just one foolish thing,
\q2 he might ruin many good things that others have done.
