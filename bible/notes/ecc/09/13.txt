====== Ecclesiastes 09:13-15 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 Once I saw here on this earth something that a wise man did that impressed me.
\v 14 There was a small town, where only a few people lived. The army of a great king came to that town and surrounded it. They built dirt ramps up against the walls in order to climb up and attack the town.
\v 15 In that town there was a man who was poor but very wise. Because of what that man \add suggested\add*, the town was saved; but people soon forgot about him.

\v 13 I have also seen wisdom under the sun in a way that seemed great to me.
\v 14 There was a small city with only a few men in it, and a great king came against it and besieged it and built great siege ramps against it.
\v 15 Now in the city was found a poor, wise man, who by his wisdom saved the city. Yet later, no one remembered that same poor man.
