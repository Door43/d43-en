<usfm>
\v 9 Live joyfully with the wife whom you love all the days of your life of vapor, which he has given you under the sun, all your days of vapor: for that is your portion in life, and in your labor that  you labor under the sun.
\v 10 Whatsoever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor
wisdom, in Sheol, where  you are going.
