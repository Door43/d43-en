====== Ecclesiastes 02:11-12 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 But then I thought about all the hard work that I \f + \ft synecdoche \f* had done \add to get all those things\add*,
\q2 and none of it seems to bring any lasting benefit \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\q1 It was all like chasing the wind.

\q1
\v 12 Then I started to think about being wise, and also about being foolish \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\q2 \add I said to myself, "I certainly do not think that\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* the next king will be able to do anything better than I can."

\v 11 But then I thought about all the hard work that I had done to obtain all those things.
\q2 I saw that none of my work brought me any lasting benefit.
\q1 It was all like trying to control the wind.

\q1
\v 12 Then I started to think about being wise, and also about being foolish.
\q2 I said to myself, "I certainly do not think that anybody  will be able to do anything better than I can."

\q1 
\v 11 Then I looked on all the deeds that my hands had accomplished, 
\q2 and on the work that I had done, 
\q1 but again, everything was vapor and an attempt to shepherd the wind.
\q2 There was no profit under the sun in it.
\q1 
\v 12 Then I turned to consider wisdom, 
\q2 and also madness and folly. 
\q1 For what can the next king do who comes after the king,  
\q2 which has not already been done?
</usfm>

  * [[:en:obe:kt:foolish]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **all the deeds that my hands had accomplished** - "all that I had accomplished" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **vapor and an attempt to shepherd the wind** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:ecc:01:12|1:14]].
  * **madness and folly** - These two words mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **For what can the next king do...which has not already been done?** - The writer uses this question to emphasize his point that the next king will not be able to do anything more valuable that what he had already done."For the next king can do nothing...which has not already been done." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the next king...who comes after the king** - "the king...who succeeds the current king." This was probably written by the current king, so "after the king" could also be translated as "after me" (UDB).
