====== Ecclesiastes 02:26 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 26 God enables those who please him to be wise, to know many things, and to enjoy many things. But if sinful people work hard and become rich, God can take their money away from them and give it to those who please him. But that also is something that is difficult for me to understand. Their working hard seems useless, like chasing the wind.

\v 26 God enables those who please him to be wise, to know many things, and to enjoy many things. But if sinful people work hard and become rich, God can take their money away from them and give it to those who please him. However, the reason for that is also something that is difficult for me to understand. It seems useless that they worked so hard; it is like trying to control the wind.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 26 For to anyone who pleases him, God gives wisdom and knowledge and joy. However, to the sinner he gives the work of gathering and storing up so that he may give it away to someone who pleases God. This also amounts to vapor and an attempt to shepherd the wind.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **so that he may give it away to someone who pleases God** - Possible meanings for the word "he" are 1) God or 2) the sinner. This also can be translated without making it clear who it is that gives the things that the sinner stored. AT: "so that the one who pleases God may have it" 
  * **vapor ... an attempt to shepherd the wind** - These two phrases are both metaphors that emphasize the idea of things being useless and futile. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **vapor** - "mist." The author speaks of useless and meaningless things as if they were "vapor." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ecc:01:12|1:14]]. AT: "as useless as vapor" or "meaningless" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **an attempt to shepherd the wind** - The author speaks of everything that people do as being useless as if they were trying to control the wind. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ecc:01:12|1:14]]. AT: "are as useless as trying to control the wind" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
