<usfm>
\v 7 I purchased male slaves and female slaves; I had slaves born in my palace. I also had large herds and flocks of livestock, much more than any king who ruled before me in Jerusalem.
\v 8 I accumulated for myself silver and gold, the treasures of kings and provinces. I had male and female singers for myself; by means of numerous wives and concubines, I did things that would bring pleasure to any man on earth.
