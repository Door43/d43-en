===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 I purchased male slaves and female slaves; I had slaves born in my palace. I also had large herds and flocks of livestock, much more than any king who ruled before me in Jerusalem.
\v 8 I also accumulated for myself silver and gold, the treasures of kings and provinces. I got male and female singers for myself—the delights of the children of humanity—and many concubines.
\f + \ft Modern versions interpret the last part of this verse in different ways: \fqa everything that pleases people \fqa* , \fqa concubines and everything that pleases men \fqa* , etc. \f*
