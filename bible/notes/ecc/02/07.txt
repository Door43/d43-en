\v 7 I bought male servants and maid-servants, and had servants born in my house. Also I had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all that were before me in Jerusalem.
\v 8 I also gathered for myself silver and gold, and the treasure of kings and of the provinces; I organized men-singers and women-singers for myself, and organized for myself the delights of the sons of men, and that of all sorts.
