\v 17 So I hated being alive, because all the work that we do here on the earth distressed me. It all seemed to be useless, like trying to control the wind.

<usfm>
\v 17 So I detested life because all the work done under the sun was evil to me. This was because everything is vapor and an attempt to shepherd the wind.
\v 18 I hated all my accomplishments for which I had worked under the sun because I must leave them behind to the man who comes after me.
