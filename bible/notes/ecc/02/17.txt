\v 17 So I hated being alive, because all the work that we do here on the earth distressed me. It all seemed to be useless, like trying to control the wind.


\p
\v 18 I also began to hate all the hard work that I had done here on the earth, because when I die, everything that I have acquired will belong to the one who inherits it after me.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 So I detested life because all the work done under the sun was evil to me. This was because everything is vapor and an attempt to shepherd the wind.
\v 18 I hated all my accomplishments for which I had worked under the sun because I must leave them behind to the man who comes after me.
