\v 1 Then I said to myself, "Okay, I will try to do everything that I enjoy. I will find out whether doing what I enjoy can truly enable me to be happy." But I found out that doing that was also useless\f + \ft Or: senseless \f*.
\v 2 So I said \add to myself\add*, "It is foolish to laugh all the time, and continually doing what I enjoy does not seem to bring any lasting benefit."
