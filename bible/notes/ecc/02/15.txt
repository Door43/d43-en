\q1 
\v 15 Then I said in my heart, 
\q2 "What happens to the fool, 
\q2 will also happen to me. 
\q1 So what difference does it make if I am very wise?" 
\q2 I concluded in my heart, 
\q2 "This too is only vapor."
\q1 
\v 16 For the wise man, like the fool, is not remembered for very long. 
\q2 In the days to come everything will have been long forgotten. 
\q1 The wise man dies just like the fool dies.
