\v 15 Then I said in my heart, "As it happenes to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise?" Then I said in my heart, "This also is vapor."
\v 16 For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance for ever; seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. The wise man dies even as the fool!
