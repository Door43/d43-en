====== Introduction to Ecclesiastes======

===== Part 1: General Introduction =====

=== Outline of the Book of Ecclesiastes ===

  - Questions about the emptiness of life and the limits of human wisdom (1:1–6:12)
  - Teaching about making wise choices in how one lives (7:1–12:7)
  - The conclusion and epilogue (12:8–14)

=== What is the Book of Ecclesiastes about? ===

Ecclesiastes is a group of short teachings that try to answer the question "What is life?" This book speaks about the futility of seeking a purpose in the things of this world. From the book's viewpoint, any work we perform or any knowledge and skill we gain are useless. Ecclesiastes is a series of thoughts about a variety of subjects, all of them about the purpose and worth of various actions and events.

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

The traditional title "Ecclesiastes" is another name for "assembly" and carries no meaning as a title. Tranlsators might decide on a better title such as "Thoughts of a Teacher" or "Thoughts of a Wise Man."

=== Who wrote the Book of Ecclesiastes? ===

The author appears to be Solomon, "the Teacher, the descendant of David and king in Jerusalem." This matches evidence in the book pointing to Solomon which are consistent with the status and reputation of Solomon: his wisdom (see 1:16 and twenty-six other references to wisdom); his vast wealth (see 2:8), and the pain that comes from wealth (see 5:13-14; 4:8; and 9:11); the large number of servants (see 2:7 and 10:7); the limitless opportunities for worldly pleasures (see 2:1, 2, 10; 3:13; 4:8; 5:4; and 12:1); and the wide range of his many construction projects (see 2:4-6). The book appears to be written near the end of Solomon's reign as he reflects on how he wasted much of his life.

=== Why are there so many contradictions in the Book of Ecclesiastes? ===

Some people have viewed the author as a faithful man, while others see him as a tragic figure. The apparent contradictions in the book may be a reflection of Solomon's wavering faith, but it is also possible that the teachings in the book differ from each other in order to suit various circumstances in the reader's life.

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== What is the book's teaching about God's retribution? ===

In the Ancient Near East, people were concerned with the reason they were being punished or [[:en:obe:kt:bless|blessed]]. They often attributed these acts of [[:en:obe:kt:justice|justice]] or retribution to their [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod|gods]]. Ecclesiastes explains that Yahweh will bless the [[:en:obe:kt:righteous|righteous]] and punish the [[:en:obe:kt:evil]], but this might not happen in this life.

=== What value did the Israelites place on Ecclesiastes? ===

The Israelites have often questioned the value of this book. This is due in large part to its unusual wording and theology. At times, it appears to disagree with the rest of Scripture. While many have questioned its authority, it has ultimately been affirmed to be Scripture because it gives valuable lessons concerning the uselessness living apart from Yahweh and of pursuing any goal other than his glory.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== What is the meaning of "under the sun?" ===

"Under the sun" is another way of saying "on the earth." When the author says that there is "nothing new under the sun," this means that there is nothing that has not happened before on earth. While the referenced event may not have specifically occurred before, there has been something similar that has happened.

=== How do I translate harsh or shocking passage? ===

There are parts of the book that can be shocking or surprising to read in Scripture. For example, "If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but if his heart is not satisfied with good and he is not buried with honor, then I say that a baby that is born dead is better off than he is" (6:3). The translator should allow these difficulties to remain and not try to "soften" them.
