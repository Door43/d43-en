===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 23 I said \add to myself\add* that I would use my wisdom to study all the things \add that I have written about\add*,
\q1 but I was not able to do it successfully.
\q1
\v 24 Wisdom seems to be far from me;
\q2 there is no one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* who can truly understand everything.
\q1
\v 25 But I decided to investigate things and
\q2 by my wisdom try to understand the reason for everything.
\q1 I also wanted to understand why people act wickedly
\q2 and why they act very foolishly.

\v 23 All this have I proven by wisdom. I said,
\q1 "I will be wise,"
\q2 but it was more than I could be.
\q1
\v 24 Wisdom is far off and very deep.
\q2 Who can find it?
\q1
\v 25 I turned my heart to learn and examine
\q2 and seek wisdom and the explanations of reality,
\q1 and to understand that evil is stupid
\q2 and that folly is madness.
