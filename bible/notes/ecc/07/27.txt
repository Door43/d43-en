====== Ecclesiastes 07:27-28 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 27 This is what I have learned:
\q1 I tried to learn more and more about things
\q2 to try to find out the reason for everything,
\q2
\v 28 and I continued to try to learn more,
\q1 but I could not find all that I was searching for.
\q2 But one thing that I found out was that among one thousand people I found one righteous man,
\q1 but I did not find even one righteous woman.
\q1

\v 27 "Consider what I have discovered," says the Teacher. I have been adding one discovery to another in order to find an explanation of reality.
\v 28 This is what I am still looking for in my mind, but I have not found it. I did find one righteous man among a thousand, but a woman among all those I did not find.
