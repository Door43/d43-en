===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 27 This is what I have learned:
\q1 I tried to learn more and more about things
\q2 to try to find out the reason for everything,
\q2
\v 28 and I continued to try to learn more,
\q1 but I could not find all that I was searching for.
\q2 But one thing that I found out was that among one thousand people I found one righteous man,
\q1 but I did not find even one righteous woman.

\v 27 Behold, this have I found, says the Teacher, laying one thing to another, to find out the account;
\v 28 which my soul still seeks, but I have not found: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.
