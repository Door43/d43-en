\q2 and I have seen wicked people remain alive for a very long time
\q2 in spite of their continuing to be wicked.
\q1

<usfm>
\v 15 All this have I seen in my days of vanity: there is a righteous man that perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongs his life in his evil-doing.
\v 16 Be not righteous too much; neither make yourself  too wise: why should you destroy yourself?
