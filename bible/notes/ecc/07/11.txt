===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **those who see the sun** - AT: "those who are alive" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom gives life** - Possible meanings are 1) that "knowledge" and "wisdom" mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis, or 2) "the advantage of knowing wisdom is that it gives life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **gives life to whoever has it** - "it" refers to wisdom. Knowledge and wisdom "gives life" in different ways. Choosing good investments, making good friends, choosing healthy life styles, living at peace with others are just some ways of how wisdom "gives life".
