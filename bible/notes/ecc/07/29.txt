===== translationNotes: =====

  * **they have gone away looking for many difficulties** - Possible meanings are 1) "they have made many sinful plans" or 2) "they have made their own lives difficult."
  * **they have gone away** - Here the word "they" refers to "humanity." This speaks of humanity changing from being upright to not being upright as if they were going from one place to another. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
