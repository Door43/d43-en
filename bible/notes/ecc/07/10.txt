===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Why were the days of old better than these?** - The person asks this question in order to complain about the present time. AT: "Things were better in the past than they are now" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **it is not because of wisdom that you ask this question** - The person making this statement is not comparing the present and past logically, but subjectively. AT: "if you were wise you would not ask this question" or "asking this question shows that you are not wise"
