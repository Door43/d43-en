====== Ecclesiastes 03:19-20 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 because what happens to people happens to animals. Animals die, and people die. We all must breathe \add to remain alive\add*. People have no advantage over animals \add in that\add*, so I have a difficult time in understanding that.
\v 20 People and animals all die and are buried. We are all made of soil, and \add when we die\add*, our corpses become soil again.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 What happens to people happens to animals. Animals die, and people die. We all must breathe to remain alive. People have no advantage over animals in that way. Everything disappears so quickly.
\v 20 People and animals all die and are buried. We are all made of soil, and when we die, our corpses become soil again.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 For the same fate happens to human beings that happens to animals. Like animals, people all die. They all must breath the same air, so in that way mankind has no advantage over the animals. Is not everything just a rapid breath?
\v 20 Everything is going to the same place. Everything comes from the dust, and everything returns to the dust.
</usfm>
