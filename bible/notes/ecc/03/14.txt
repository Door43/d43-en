===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 I also know that what God does endures forever. No one can add to what God does, and no one can take away from the things that God does. God does those things in order that people would revere him.
\q1
\v 15 Things that exist now have already existed previously,
\q2 and things that will happen in the future have already happened previously;
\q2 God causes the same things to happen many times.

\v 14 I know that whatever God does will last forever. Nothing can be added to it or taken from it, because it is God who has done it so that people will approach him with respect and honor.
\v 15 Whatever is has already been and whatever is to be has already been. God understands what men have done.
