\v 5 That baby does not live to see the sun or know anything. But even so, it finds more rest than rich people do who are alive.
\v 6 Even if people should live for two thousand years, if they do not enjoy the things that God gives to them, it would have been better for them never to have been born.
\q1 All people who live a long time certainly all go to the same place—to the grave.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Although this child does not see the sun or know anything, it has rest even though that man did not.
\v 6 Even if a man should live for two thousand years but does not learn to enjoy good things, he goes to the same place as everyone else.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * ** it has rest even though that man did not** - A still born child never experienced hardship, it remained at rest. Whereas the man who lived many years without satisfaction lacks rest.
  * **Even if a man should live for two thousand years** - This is an exaggeration to show that it does not matter how long a person lives if he does not enjoy the good things in life. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **two thousand years** - AT: "2,000 years" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **but does not learn to enjoy good things** - This is the point, that man needs to learn to enjoy the good things life offers him.
