====== Ecclesiastes 06:11-12 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 The more that we talk,
\q2 the more often we say things that are senseless,
\q2 so it certainly does not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* benefit us to talk a lot.
\p
\v 12 We live for only a short time; we disappear like \f + \ft simile \f* a shadow disappears \add in the sunlight\add*. No one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* knows what is best for us while we are alive, and no one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* knows what will happen to us after we die \f + \ft euphemism \f*.

\v 11 The more that we talk,
\q2 the more often we say things that are senseless,
\q2 so it certainly does not benefit us to talk a lot.
\p
\v 12 No human being can know everything that is good for himself in this life. People live for a few seemingly meaningless days. Life passes by quickly, like a shadow, and no one know what is coming after we die. We live for only a short time, and then we disappear like a vapor.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q1 
\v 11 The more words that are spoken, the more futility increases, 
\q2 so what advantage is that to a man?
\v 12 For who knows what is good for man in his life during his futile, numbered days through which he passes like a shadow? Who can tell a man what will come under the sun after he passes?

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The more words that are spoken** - AT: "The more words that people speak" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the more futility increases** - When there is much talk, the chances for idle, non-encouraging words to be spoken is greater than if only a few words are spoken. AT: "the more meaningless those words are"
  * **what advantage is that to a man?** - There is no advantage for a man to talk a lot. AT: "that is no advantage to a man." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **For who knows what is good for man...he passes like a shadow?** - AT: "No one knows what is good for man...he passes like a shadow." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **numbered days through which he passes like a shadow** - Life is compared to a shadow that passes quickly. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Who can tell a man what will come under the sun after he passes?** - AT: "No one can tell a man what will come under the sun after he passes." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **what will come under the sun** - This is another way of expressing what will happen in the future. AT: "what will happen on earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **after he passes** - This is a polite expression for death. AT: "after he dies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
