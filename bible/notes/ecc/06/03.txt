<usfm>
\v 3 If a man fathers a hundred children, and live many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul be not filled with good, and moreover he has no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is better than he:
\v 4 for it comes as a vapor, and departs in darkness, and the name thereof is covered with darkness;
