====== Ecclesiastes 06:3-4 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Someone might have a hundred children and live for many years. But if he is not able to enjoy the things that he has acquired, and if he is not buried \add properly after he dies\add*, \add I say that\add* a child that is dead when it is born is more fortunate.
\v 4 That dead baby's birth is meaningless; it does not even have a name. It goes directly to the place where there is only darkness.

\v 3 Someone might have a hundred children and live for many years. But if he is not able to enjoy the things that he has acquired, and if he is not buried properly after he dies, I say that a child that is dead when it is born is more fortunate.
\v 4 This is true, even though that dead baby's birth is meaningless—even though it does not have a name, and its brief life becomes only a sad memory in the future.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but if his heart is not satisfied with good and he is not buried with honor, then I say that a baby that is born dead is better off than he is.
\v 4 Even such a baby is born in futility and passes away in darkness, and its name remains hidden.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **fathers a hundred children** - "fathers 100 children." This is a hypothetical situation. This is also an exaggeration and is applicable to people with fewer than 100 children. AT: "fathers many children" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **lives many years, so that the days of his years are many** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. AT: "lives many years" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **his heart is not satisfied with good** - This refers to a man by his "heart" to emphasize his feelings. AT: "he is not content with good things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **he is not buried with honor** - This can be stated in active form. Possible meanings are 1) "no one buries him" or 2) "no one buries him properly." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **such a baby is born in futility** - "such a baby is born for nothing"
  * **passes away in darkness** - This speaks of the death of the baby being as unexplainable as "darkness." AT: "dies unexplainably" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **its name remains hidden** - This speaks of no one knowing the baby's name as if it were a hidden object. AT: "no one knows its name" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
