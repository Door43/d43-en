====== Ecclesiastes 06:3-4 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Someone might have a hundred children and live for many years. But if he is not able to enjoy the things that he has acquired, and if he is not buried \add properly after he dies\add*, \add I say that\add* a child that is dead when it is born is more fortunate.
\v 4 That dead baby's birth is meaningless; it does not even have a name. It goes directly to the place where there is only darkness.

\v 3 Someone might have a hundred children and live for many years. But if he is not able to enjoy the things that he has acquired, and if he is not buried properly after he dies, I say that a child that is dead when it is born is more fortunate.
\v 4 This is true, even though that dead baby's birth is meaninglessâ€”even though it does not have a name, and its brief life becomes only a sad memory in the future.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but if his heart is not satisfied with good and he is not buried with honor, then I say that a baby that is born dead is better off than he is.
\v 4 Even such a baby is born in futility and passes away in darkness, and its name remains hidden.
</usfm>
