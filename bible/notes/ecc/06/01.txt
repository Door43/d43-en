====== Ecclesiastes 06:1-2 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 I have seen something else here on this earth that troubles people.
\v 2 God enables some people to get a lot of money and possessions and to be honored; they have everything \f + \ft litotes \f* that they want. But God \add sometimes\add* does not allow them to continue to enjoy those things. Someone else gets them and enjoys them. That seems senseless and unfair.

\v 1 There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, and it is severe for men.
\v 2 God might give riches, wealth, and honor to a man so that he lacks nothing that he desires for himself, but then God gives him no ability to enjoy it. Instead, someone else uses his things. This is vapor, an evil affliction.
