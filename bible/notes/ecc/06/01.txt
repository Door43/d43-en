<usfm>
\v 1 I have seen something else here on this earth that troubles people.
\v 2 God enables some people to get a lot of money and possessions and to be honored; they have everything \f + \ft litotes \f* that they want. But God \add sometimes\add* does not allow them to continue to enjoy those things. Someone else gets them and enjoys them. That seems senseless and unfair.

\c 6
\p
\v 1 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is heavy upon men:
\v 2 a man to whom God gives riches, wealth, and honor, so that he lacks nothing for his soul of all that he desires, yet
God gives him no power to enjoy it, but an alien eats it; this is vapor, and it is an evil disease.
