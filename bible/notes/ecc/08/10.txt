\v 10 So I saw the wicked buried publicly. They were taken from the holy area and buried and were praised by people in the city where they had done their wicked deeds. This also is uselessness.
\v 11 When a sentence against an evil crime is not executed quickly, it entices the hearts  of the human beings to do evil.
