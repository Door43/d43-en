\p
\v 11 If evil people are not immediately punished, it causes other people \f + \ft synecdoche \f* to also want to do evil things.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 So I saw the wicked buried publicly. They were taken from the holy area and buried and were praised by people in the city where they had done their wicked deeds. This also is uselessness.
\v 11 When a sentence against an evil crime is not executed quickly, it entices the hearts of human beings to do evil.
