===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 Even though a sinner does evil a hundred times, and prolongs his days, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, that fear before him:
\v 13 but it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong
his days, which are as a shadow; because he does not fear before God.
