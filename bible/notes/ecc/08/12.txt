===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 Even if a sinner does evil a hundred times and still lives for a long time, yet I know that it will be well with those who respect God, who honor his presence with them.
\v 13 But it will not go well for the wicked; his life will not be prolonged. His days are like a fleeting shadow because he does not honor God.
