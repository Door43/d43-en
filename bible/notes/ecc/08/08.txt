\q1 Soldiers are not permitted to go home during a battle,
\q2 and evil people will not be saved by \add doing what is\add* evil.
\p
\v 9 I thought about all those things, and I thought about all \f + \ft hyperbole \f* the other things that happen on this earth. I saw that \add sometimes\add* people cause those whom they control to suffer.

<usfm>
\v 8 We cannot control our breathing,
\q2 and we cannot control when we will stop breathing and die.
\q1 Soldiers are not permitted to go home during a battle,
\q2 and evil people will not be saved by doing what is evil.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q1
\v 8 No one is ruler over his breath so as to stop the breath,
\f + \ft Some versions have \fqa No one is ruler over the wind so as to stop the wind \fqa* . \f*
\q2 and no one has power over the day of his death.
\q1 No one is discharged from the army during a battle,
\q2 and wickedness will not rescue those who are its slaves.
\q1
\v 9 I have realized all this; I have applied my heart to every kind of work that is done under the sun.
There is a time when a person oppresses another person to that person's hurt.
\f + \ft Some modern versions have \fqa to his own hurt \fqa* . The Hebrew passage can be interpreted either way. \f*
