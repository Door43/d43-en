====== Ecclesiastes 08:8-9 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 We cannot control the wind,
\q2 and we cannot control when we will die.
\q1 Soldiers are not permitted to go home during a battle,
\q2 and evil people will not be saved by \add doing what is\add* evil.
\p
\v 9 I thought about all those things, and I thought about all \f + \ft hyperbole \f* the other things that happen on this earth. I saw that \add sometimes\add* people cause those whom they control to suffer.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 We cannot control our breathing,
\q2 and we cannot control when we will stop breathing and die.
\q1 Soldiers are not permitted to go home during a battle,
\q2 and evil people will not be saved by doing what is evil.
\p
\v 9 I thought about all those things, and I thought about all the other things that happen on this earth. I saw that sometimes people are able to do severe harm to others.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q1 
\v 8 No one has power over the breath of life to stop breathing, 
\q2 and no one has power over the day of his death. 
\q1 No one is discharged from the army during a battle, 
\q2 and wickedness will not rescue those who are its slaves.
\v 9 I have realized all this; I have applied my heart to every kind of work that is done under the sun.
There is a time when a person has power to do evil to others.
</usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **No one has power over the breath of life to stop breathing, and no one has power over the day of his death** - Just as no one has the ability to control the wind, no one can continue living when it is their time to die. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **power over the breath of life to stop breathing** - possible meanings are 1) no one can control the wind, 2) This means that no one is able to hold on to life when it is time to die.
  * **wickedness will not rescue those who are its slaves** - The writer speaks of wickedness as if it is a master who owns slaves. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **applied my heart** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:ecc:01:16|1:17]].
  * **every kind of work that is done** - AT: "every kind of work that people do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
