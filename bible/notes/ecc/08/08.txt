<usfm>
\v 8 There is no man that has power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither has he power over the day of death; and
there is no discharge in war: neither shall wickedness deliver him that is given to it.
\v 9 All this have I seen, and applied my heart to every work that is done under the sun:
there is a time when one man has power over another to his hurt.
