\v 2 You solemnly promised God that you would obey what the king commands, so do that.
\v 3 Do not quickly disobey the king. And do not join with those who want to rebel against him, because the king will do what he wants to do.
\v 4 We need to obey what the king says more than we need to obey what anyone else says; no one can say to the king, "Why are you doing that?\f + \ft Or: You should not be doing that. \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*"
