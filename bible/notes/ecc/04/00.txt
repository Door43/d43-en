====== Ecclesiastes 04 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of chapter 4, which is an extended quotation. Some lines are indented twice to further set them apart. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Irony ==
The teacher looks at the oppression in the world and is saddened by it, but he is the king and has the power to change things. He also laments being alone, even though he has many wives, children and concubines. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
