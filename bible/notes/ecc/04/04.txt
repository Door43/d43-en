====== Ecclesiastes 04:4 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 I also thought about all the hard work that people do and the skills that they have. And I thought about how they compete with each other because they are envious of others, and I concluded that this also is something that is not accomplishing anything useful, like chasing the wind.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 I also thought about all the hard work that people do and the things they are able to accomplish. And I thought about how someone who works hard sometimes makes his neighbor jealous. I decided that this also is something that is not accomplishing anything useful. It is like trying to control the wind.


\q1
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 Then I saw that every act of labor and every skillful work became the envy of one's neighbor. This also is vapor and an attempt to shepherd the wind.

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **became the envy of one's neighbor** - The word "envy" may be expressed as an adjective. AT: "made one's neighbor envious" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **the envy of one's neighbor** - possible meanings are 1) The neighbor envies the object his neighbor made, or 2) the neighbor envies the skills his neighbor has.
  * **vapor ... an attempt to shepherd the wind** - These two phrases are both metaphors that emphasize the idea of things being useless and futile. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **vapor** - "mist." The author speaks of things as being useless and meaningless as if they were vapor. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ecc:01:12|1:14]]. AT: "as useless as vapor" or "meaningless" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **an attempt to shepherd the wind** - The author speaks of everything that people do as being useless as if they were trying to control the wind. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ecc:01:12|1:14]]. AT: "are as useless as trying to control the wind" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
