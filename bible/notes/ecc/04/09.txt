\q2 If you have a friend, he can help you to do your work.
\q1
\v 10 If you fall down, he can help you get up again.
\q2 But if you fall down when you are alone, you will have trouble,
\q2 because there is no one to help you stand up.
\q1
\v 11 Similarly, if two people sleep together,
\q2 they can help each other to remain warm.
\q But someone who sleeps alone will certainly not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* be warm.

\q1 
\v 9 Two people work better than one;
\q2 together they can earn a good pay for their labor.
\q1 
\v 10 For if one falls, the other can lift up his friend. 
\q2 However, sorrow follows the one who is alone when he falls 
\q2 if there is no one to lift him up.
\q1 
\v 11 And if two lie down together, they can be warm, 
\q2 but how can one be warm alone?
