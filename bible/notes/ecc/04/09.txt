<usfm>
\v 9 Having someone \add work\add* with you is better than being by yourself \add all the time\add*.
\q2 If you have a friend, he can help you to do your work.
\q1
\v 10 If you fall down, he can help you get up again.
\q2 But if you fall down when you are alone, you will have trouble,
\q2 because there is no one to help you stand up.
\q1
\v 11 Similarly, if two people sleep together,
\q2 they can help each other to remain warm.
\q But someone who sleeps alone will certainly not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* be warm.

<usfm>
\v 9 Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor.
\v 10 For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him that is alone when he falls, and there is no one else to lift him up.
\v 11 Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one be warm alone?
