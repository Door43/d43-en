\v 7 Then I returned and saw vapor under the sun.
\v 8 There is one that is alone, and he does not have a second son nor brother; there is no end of all his labor, neither are his eyes satisfied with riches. "For whom then", says he, "do I labor, and deprive my soul of good?" This also is vapor, yes, it is an evil task.
