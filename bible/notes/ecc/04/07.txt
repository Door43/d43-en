====== Ecclesiastes 04:7-8 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 I thought about something else that happens on the earth \f + \ft metonymy \f* that seems senseless.
\q1
\v 8 There are men who live alone;
\q2 they do not have a wife or children or any brothers living with them;
\q1 every day they work \add very hard\add*, without stopping, to get a lot of money,
\q2 but they are never satisfied with the things that they have.
\q1 They never ask themselves,
\q2 "Why am I working very hard to earn more money?
\q1 Why am I not doing things that would cause me to be happy?"
\q2 What they do also seems senseless.

\v 7 I thought about something else that happens on the earth that seems useless.
\q1
\v 8 There are people who live alone;
\q2 they do not have a family nor even children or any brothers or sisters living with them.
\q1 Every day they work very hard without stopping; they make a lot of money,
\q2 but they are never satisfied with the things that they get.
\q1 They ask themselves,
\q2 "Why am I working so hard; whom am I actually helping?
\q1 Why am I not doing things that I would enjoy doing?
\q2 What I have been doing seems useless." This is very bad.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 Then I thought again about more futility, more vanishing vapor under the sun.
\q1 
\v 8 There is the kind of man who is alone. 
\q2 He does not have anyone, no son or brother. 
\q1 There is no end to all his work, 
\q2 and his eyes are not satisfied with gaining wealth. 
\q1 He wonders, "For whom am I toiling 
\q2 and depriving myself of pleasure?" 
\q1 This also is vapor, a bad situation.
