\q1 
\v 5 The fool folds his hands and does not work, 
\q2 so his food is his own flesh.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **folds his hands and does not work** - To fold the hands is a gesture of laziness and is another way of saying that the person refuses to work. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **so his food is his own flesh** - AT: "as a result, he causes his own ruin." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **work that tries to shepherd the wind** - Not all work is profitable. Some work is not profitable like trying to control the wind. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
