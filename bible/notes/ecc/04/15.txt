\v 15 But then some other young man becomes king, and everyone starts to support him.
\v 16 Large crowds of people crowd around him. But after a few years, they will be tired of him, too. So it is all senseless, like trying to control the wind.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 However, I saw everyone who was alive and walking around under the sun submitting themselves to another young man who rose up as king.
\v 16 There is no end to all the people who want to obey the new king, but later many of them will no longer praise him. Surely this situation is vapor and an attempt to shepherd the wind.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Instead of choosing the wise youth, the people choose the king's son, who may not be any wiser.

  * **alive and walking around** - The words "alive" and "walking around" mean basically the same thing and are combined to emphasize living people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **under the sun** - This refers to things that are done on earth. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ecc:01:01|1:3]]. AT: "on the earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **There is no end to all the people** - This is an exaggeration used to emphasize a large number of people. AT: "There are very many people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **vapor ... an attempt to shepherd the wind** - These two phrases are both metaphors that emphasize the idea of things being useless and futile. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **vapor** - "mist." The author speaks of things as being useless and meaningless as if they were vapor. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ecc:01:12|1:14]]. AT: "as useless as vapor" or "meaningless" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **an attempt to shepherd the wind** - The author speaks of everything that people do as being useless as if they were trying to control the wind. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ecc:01:12|1:14]]. AT: "are as useless as trying to control the wind" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
