====== Ecclesiastes 01:12-15 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 I, the Religious Teacher, have been the king of Israel \add for many years, ruling\add* in Jerusalem.
\v 13 By using my wisdom, I concentrated on understanding everything that was being done on the earth \f + \ft metonymy \f*. But I found out that God causes all of us to experience things that cause us to be unhappy\f + \ft Or: miserable \f*.
\v 14 It seems that nothing that happens on the earth really enables us to do anything useful. It is like \f + \ft metaphor \f* chasing the wind.
\b
\q1
\v 15 \add Many things\add* that are crooked cannot be caused to become straight;
\q2 we cannot count things that do not exist.

\v 12 I, the Teacher, have been the king of Israel for many years, ruling in Jerusalem.
\v 13 By using my wisdom, I concentrated on understanding everything that was being done on the earth. It is a task that wears me out, just like anyone else who tries it.
\v 14 It seems that nothing that happens on the earth really enables us to do anything useful. It is like trying to control the wind.

\q1
\v 15 Many things that are crooked cannot be caused to become straight.
\q2 We cannot count things that we cannot see.

<usfm>
\v 12 I am the Teacher, and I have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.
\v 13 I applied my mind to study and to search out by wisdom everything that is done under heaven. That search is a burdensome task that God has given to the sons of men to be busy with.
\v 14 I have seen all the deeds that are done under the sun, and look, they all amount to vapor and an attempt to shepherd the wind.
\q1
\v 15 The twisted cannot be straightened!
\q1 The missing cannot be counted!

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I applied my mind** - AT: "I determined" or "I made up my mind"
  * **to study and to search** - These two phrases mean the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **sons of men** - AT: "human beings" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **all the deeds that are done** - AT: "everything that people do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **vapor** - "mist" or "breath." It does not last. AT: "temporary" or "worthless." What people do is like vapor because it does not last and is worthless. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **an attempt to shepherd the wind** - The Teacher says that the things that people do are like trying to catch the wind or to keep the wind from blowing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
