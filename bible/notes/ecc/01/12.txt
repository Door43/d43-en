====== Ecclesiastes 01:12-15 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 I, the Religious Teacher, have been the king of Israel \add for many years, ruling\add* in Jerusalem.
\v 13 By using my wisdom, I concentrated on understanding everything that was being done on the earth \f + \ft metonymy \f*. But I found out that God causes all of us to experience things that cause us to be unhappy\f + \ft Or: miserable \f*.
\v 14 It seems that nothing that happens on the earth really enables us to do anything useful. It is like \f + \ft metaphor \f* chasing the wind.
\b
\q1
\v 15 \add Many things\add* that are crooked cannot be caused to become straight;
\q2 we cannot count things that do not exist.

\v 12 I, the Teacher, have been the king of Israel for many years, ruling in Jerusalem.
\v 13 By using my wisdom, I concentrated on understanding everything that was being done on the earth. It is a task that wears me out, just like anyone else who tries it.
\v 14 It seems that nothing that happens on the earth really enables us to do anything useful. It is like trying to control the wind.
\q1
\v 15 Many things that are crooked cannot be caused to become straight.
\q2 We cannot count things that we cannot see.

<usfm>
\v 12 I am the Teacher, and I have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.
\v 13 I applied my mind to study and to search out by wisdom everything that is done under heaven. That search is a burdensome task that God has given to the children of mankind to be busy with.
\v 14 I have seen all the deeds that are done under the sun, and look, they all amount to vapor and an attempt to shepherd the wind.
\q1
\v 15 The twisted cannot be straightened!
\q1 The missing cannot be counted!

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I applied my mind** - Here the author refers to himself by his "mind" to emphasize his thoughts. AT: "I determined" or "I applied myself" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **to study and to search out** - These two phrases mean the same thing and emphasize how diligently he studied. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **under heaven** - This refers to things that are done on earth. AT: "on the earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **children of mankind** - "human beings" 
  * **all the deeds that are done** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "everything that people do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **under the sun** - This refers to things that are done on earth. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ecc:01:01|1:3]]. AT: "on the earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **look** - The author uses this word to draw attention to what he says next. AT: "indeed" or "really" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]) 
  * **amount to vapor ... an attempt to shepherd the wind** - These two phrases are both metaphors that emphasize the idea of things being useless and futile. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **amount to vapor** - "are only mist." The author speaks of useless and meaningless things as if they were "vapor." Just as vapor disappears and does not last, things have no lasting value. AT: "are as useless as vapor" or "are meaningless" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **an attempt to shepherd the wind** - The author says that everything that people do is as useless as if they were trying to control the wind. AT: "are as useless as trying to control the wind" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **The twisted cannot be straightened! The missing cannot be counted** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "People cannot straighten things that are twisted! They cannot count what is not there" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
