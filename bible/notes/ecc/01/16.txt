====== Ecclesiastes 01:16-18 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 I said to myself, "Hey, I am wiser than any of the kings that ruled in Jerusalem before I \add became the king\add*. I am wiser and I know more than any of them!"
\v 17 So I determined to learn \add more\add* about being wise and to learn about knowing about many things, and also to learn about \add doing things that are\add* very foolish \f + \ft doublet \f*. But I found out that trying to understand those things was also \add useless\add*, like chasing the wind.
\q1
\v 18 The wiser I became, the more disappointed I became.
\q2 The more things I knew about, the sadder I became.

\v 16 I said to myself, "I am wiser than any of those who ruled in Jerusalem before me. I am wiser and know more than any of them!"
\v 17 So I determined to learn more about being wise, and also to learn about doing things that are very stupid and foolish. But I found out that trying to understand those things was also useless, like trying to control the wind.
\v 18 Anyone who becomes very wise also becomes very frustrated. The more one knows, the sadder he becomes.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 I have spoken to my heart saying, "Look, I have acquired greater wisdom than all who were before me in Jerusalem. My mind has seen great wisdom and knowledge."
\v 17 So I applied my heart to know wisdom and also madness and folly. I came to understand that this also was an attempt to shepherd the wind.
\v 18 For in the abundance of wisdom there is much frustration, and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.
