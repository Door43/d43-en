\q1
\v 10 Sometimes people say, "Look at this! This is something new \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*!"
\q2 But it has existed previously;
\q1 it existed before we were born.
\q1
\v 11 People do not remember the things \add that happened\add* long ago,

\q1
\v 9 Whatever has been is what will be,
\q2 and whatever has been done is what will be done.
\q1 There is nothing new under the sun.
\q1
\v 10 Is there anything about which it may be said,
\q2 'Look, this is new'?
\q1 Whatever exists has already existed for a long time,
\q2 during ages which came long before us.
\q1
\v 11 No one seems to remember the things that happened in ancient times,
\q2 and the things that happened much later
\q2 and that will happen in the future
\q1 will not likely be remembered either."
