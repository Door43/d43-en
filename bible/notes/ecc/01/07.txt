\v 7 All the streams flow into the sea,
\q2 but the sea is never full.
\q1 The water returns \add to the sky\add*, and \add when it rains\add*, the water returns to the rivers,
\q2 and it flows again to the sea.
\q1
\v 8 Everything is boring,
\q2 with the result that we do not even want to talk about it.
\q1 We \f + \ft synecdoche \f* see things,
\q2 but we always want to see more.
\q1 We \f + \ft synecdoche \f* hear things,
\q2 but we always want to hear more.

\v 7 All the streams flow into the sea,
\q2 but the sea is never full.
\q1 The water returns under the earth and comes up again into the rivers;
\q2 then it flows to the sea again.
\q1
\v 8 Everything is so unsatisfactory
\q2 that we do not even want to talk about it.
\q1 We see the same things,
\q2 and we become bored with them.
\q1 We hear the same things,
\q2 but we want to hear something more.

\v 7 All the rivers flow into the sea, 
\q2 but the sea is never full. 
\q1 To the place where the rivers go, 
\q2 there they go again.
\q1
\v 8 Everything becomes wearisome, 
\q2 and no one can explain it. 
\q1 The eye is not satisfied by what it sees, 
\q2 nor is the ear fulfilled by what it hears.

===== Translation Notes: =====
Writer continues with natural order observations.

  * **Everything becomes wearisome**- Since man is unable to explain these things, it becomes futile to try. AT: "everything becomes tiring" 
  * **The eye is not satisfied by what it sees** - One can not simply deduce to a simple explanation what one sees. AT: "A person is not satisfied by what his eyes see" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **nor is the ear fulfilled by what it hears** - One can not simply deduce to a simple explanation what one hears. AT: "nor is a person content by what his ears hear"
