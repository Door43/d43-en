  * **The sleep of a working man is sweet** - a man who does good or honest work can be content with himself knowing He did a good day's work regardless of his pay.
  * **whether he eats little or a lot** - "whether he eats a little bit of food or a lot of food"
  * **does not allow him to sleep well** - a rich person is never satisfied with his wealth. He stays awake at night being concerned about his money. AT: "keeps him awake at night"
