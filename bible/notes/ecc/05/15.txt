====== Ecclesiastes 05:15-17 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 When we are born,
\q2 we do not bring anything with us,
\q1 and when we die,
\q2 we take nothing with us
\q1 from all that we have earned by our working hard.
\p
\v 16 That also seems senseless.
\q1 People bring nothing \add into the world when they are born\add*,
\q2 and they leave \add this world\add* taking nothing with them.
\q1 They have worked hard,
\q2 but they receive no lasting benefit \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\q1
\v 17 Furthermore, \add rich people\add* are always miserable \f + \ft metaphor \f* and sad,
\q2 and depressed\f + \ft Or: discouraged \f* and often sick and resentful\f + \ft Or: thinking that what has happened to them is unfair \f*.

<usfm>
\q1 
\v 15 As a man is born naked from his motherâ€™s womb, 
\q2 so also he will leave this life naked. 
\q1 He can take in his hand nothing from his work.
\v 16 Another severe evil is 
\q1 that exactly as a person came, so also he must go away. 
\q1 So what profit does anyone get in working for the wind?
\q1 
\v 17 During his days he eats with darkness 
\q2 and is greatly distressed with sickness and anger.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **a man is born naked...he will leave this life naked** - In addition to being without clothing, here the word "naked" emphasizes that people are born without any possessions. AT: "a man is naked and owns nothing when he is born...he will leave this life the same way" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **he will leave this life** - AT: "he will die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
    * **He can take in his hand nothing** - AT: "He can take nothing with him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
    * **as a person came, so also he must go away** - This refers to the birth and death of a person and expresses the same idea as the previous verse.
    * **So what profit does anyone get in working for the wind?** - The writer uses this question to emphasize his point that there is no benefit in working for the wind. AT: "No one gets any profit in working for the wind." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **working for the wind** - Possible meanings are 1) "trying to catch the wind" or 2) "working for the air he breathes"
    * **During his days he eats with darkness** - Here the word "darkness" refers to sad circumstances. Possible meanings are 1) "During his life he eats in mourning" or 2) "His life is spent in mourning" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
    * **and is greatly distressed with sickness and anger** - AT: "and suffers greatly, being sick and angry" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
