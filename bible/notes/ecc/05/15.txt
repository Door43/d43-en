<usfm>
\v 15 When we are born,
\q2 we do not bring anything with us,
\q1 and when we die,
\q2 we take nothing with us
\q1 from all that we have earned by our working hard.
\p
\v 16 That also seems senseless.
\q1 People bring nothing \add into the world when they are born\add*,
\q2 and they leave \add this world\add* taking nothing with them.
\q1 They have worked hard,
\q2 but they receive no lasting benefit \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\q1
\v 17 Furthermore, \add rich people\add* are always miserable \f + \ft metaphor \f* and sad,
\q2 and depressed\f + \ft Or: discouraged \f* and often sick and resentful\f + \ft Or: thinking that what has happened to them is unfair \f*.

<usfm>
\v 15 As he came forth from his mother’s womb, naked shall he go again as he came, and shall take nothing for his labor, which he may carry away in his hand.
\v 16 And this also is a grievous evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit has he that he labors for the wind?
\v 17 All his days also he eats in darkness, and he is very angry, and has sickness and wrath.
