====== Ecclesiastes 05:15-17 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 When we are born,
\q2 we do not bring anything with us,
\q1 and when we die,
\q2 we take nothing with us
\q1 from all that we have earned by our working hard.
\p
\v 16 That also seems senseless.
\q1 People bring nothing \add into the world when they are born\add*,
\q2 and they leave \add this world\add* taking nothing with them.
\q1 They have worked hard,
\q2 but they receive no lasting benefit \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\q1
\v 17 Furthermore, \add rich people\add* are always miserable \f + \ft metaphor \f* and sad,
\q2 and depressed\f + \ft Or: discouraged \f* and often sick and resentful\f + \ft Or: thinking that what has happened to them is unfair \f*.

<usfm>
\q1
\v 15 As a man is born naked from his mother's womb,
\q2 so also he will leave this life naked.
\q1 He can take in his hand nothing from his work.
\v 16 Another severe evil is
\q1 that exactly as a person came, so also he must go away.
\q1 So what profit does anyone get in working for the wind?
\q1
\v 17 During his days he eats with darkness
\q2 and is greatly distressed with sickness and anger.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **a man is born naked ... he will leave this life naked** - In addition to being without clothing, here the word "naked" emphasizes that people are born without any possessions. AT: "a man is naked and owns nothing when he is born ... he will leave this life the same way" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he will leave this life** - This refers to dying. AT: "he will die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **He can take in his hand nothing** - Here a person's "hand" represents his possession. AT: "He can take nothing with him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **as a person came, so also he must go away** - This refers to the birth and death of a person and expresses the same idea as the previous verse. AT: "as people bring nothing into the world when they are born, so they take nothing with them when they die and leave this world" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **So what profit does anyone get in working for the wind?** - The writer uses this rhetorical question to emphasize that there is no benefit in working for the wind. This question can be written as a statement. AT: "No one gets any profit in working for the wind." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **working for the wind** - Possible meanings are 1) This speaks of the person receiving no lasting profit as if he were trying to control the wind. AT: "trying to shepherd the wind" or "work that is as useless as trying to shepherd the wind" or 2) This implies that the person only receives the air that he breaths as his profit. AT: "working to receive the air he breathes" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **During his days he eats with darkness** - This speaks of a person mourning throughout his life as if he always ate in darkness. Here "darkness" represents sadness and mourning. AT: "He spends his life in mourning and sadness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **his days** - Here a person's "days" represent his life. AT: "his life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **is greatly distressed with sickness and anger** - The words "sickness" and "anger" can be expressed as adjectives. AT: "suffers greatly, being sick and angry" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
