===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 Everyone who tries to \add get as much\add* money as they can
\q2 will never think that they have enough.
\q1 They will never be satisfied with the money that they have.
\q2 That also is senseless.
\b
\q1
\v 11 The more money that we have,
\q2 the more people want us to spend our money to buy things for them.
\q1 So people who have a lot of money do not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* benefit from it;
\q2 they see \f + \ft metonymy \f* it when they get it, but it soon disappears\f + \ft Or: is completely spent \f*.

\v 10 Everyone who tries to get as much money as they can
\q2 will never think that they have enough.
\q1 They will never be satisfied with the money that they have.
\q2 That fact also makes no sense.
\q1
\v 11 The more money that people have,
\q2 the more they want to spend it.
\q1 People who have a lot of money do not benefit from it,
\q2 except to look at it and admire it.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q1
\v 10 Anyone who loves silver will not be satisfied with silver,
\q2 and anyone who loves wealth always wants more.
\q1 This, too, is vapor.
\q1
\v 11 As prosperity increases, so also do the people who consume it.
\q1 What advantage in wealth is there to the owner
\q2 except to watch it with his eyes?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **vapor** - "mist." The author speaks of things as being useless and meaningless as if they were vapor. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ecc:01:12|1:14]]. AT: "as useless as vapor" or "meaningless" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **As prosperity increases** - The word "prosperity" may be expressed as a verb. AT: "As a person becomes more prosperous" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]]) 
  * **so also do the people who consume it** - Possible meanings are 1) "so also the person spends more money" or 2) "so also there will be more people who use his wealth."
  * **who consume it** - This speaks of people spending wealth as if they were "eating" it. AT: "who use it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **What advantage in wealth is there to the owner except to watch it with his eyes?** - The author uses this rhetorical question to emphasize that the wealthy do not benefit from their wealth. This question can be written as a statement. AT: "The only benefit that the owner has from wealth is that he can look at it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
