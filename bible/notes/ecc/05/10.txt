===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q1 
\v 10 Anyone one who loves silver will not be satisfied with silver, 
\q2 and anyone who loves wealth always wants more. 
\q1 This, too, is vapor.
\q1 
\v 11 As prosperity increases, so also do the people who consume it. 
\q1 What advantage in wealth is there to the owner
\q2 except to watch it with his eyes?

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **This, too, is vapor** - Just as a vapor has no substance, so there is no satisfaction in desiring money. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **As prosperity increases** - AT: "As a person becomes more prosperous" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]]) 
  * **so also do the people who consume it** - Possible meanings are 1) "so also the person spends more money" or 2) "so also there will be more people who use his wealth."
  * **What advantage in wealth is there to the owner except to watch it with his eyes?** - AT: "The only benefit that the owner has from wealth is that he can look at it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
