<usfm>
\v 2 Do not speak too quickly without thinking about the words you say;
\q2 and do not be too quick in your heart to complain about something to God.
\q1 Remember that God is very different from you and he is in heaven. 
\q2 You, however, are very limited and you must live all your life here on earth.
\q1 So think carefully about what you say to God, and do not speak without thinking about how you should speak to him.

\v 3 If you are continually thinking and worrying about things,
\q2 you will have bad dreams about them and not rest well.
\q1 And the more you talk,
\q2 the more likely it will be that you will say things that are foolish.

\v 3 If you have too many things to do and worry about, you will probably have bad dreams.
