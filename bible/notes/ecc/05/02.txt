\q1 
\v 2 Do not be too quick to speak with your mouth,

\q2 so let your words be few.

    * **Do not be too quick...do not let your heart be too quick** - These two phrases mean the same thing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
    * **let your words be few** - AT: "do not say too much"
