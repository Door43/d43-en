====== Ecclesiastes 05:6-7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 Do not let the things that you promise to do cause you to sin by not doing them. And \add when you promise God to do something and do not do it\add*, do not say to God's priest that is was a mistake for you to promise to do that. If you do that, God will certainly \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* become very angry with you, and he will take from you everything that you \f + \ft synecdoche \f* have worked to acquire.
\v 7 Promising to do something and not doing it is like \f + \ft simile \f* a dream that has no value; instead, revere God \add by doing what you promised him that you would do\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 Do not let the things that you promise to do cause you to sin by not doing them. And if you promise God that you will do something but then do not do it, do not say to God's priest that it was a mistake for you to promise to do that. If you do that, God can destroy everything you have worked to accomplish.
\v 7 Promising to do something and not doing it is like having a useless dream. Instead, honor God by doing what you promised him that you would do.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 Do not allow your mouth to cause your flesh to sin. Do not say to the priest's messenger, "That vow was a mistake." Why make God angry by vowing falsely, provoking God to destroy the work of your hands?
\v 7 For in many dreams, as in many words, there is meaningless vapor. So fear God.
