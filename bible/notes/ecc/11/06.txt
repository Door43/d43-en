<usfm>
\v 6 Start planting your seeds in the morning,
\q2 and do not stop planting them until the evening,
\q1 because you do not know which ones will grow better,
\q2 the ones you plant in the morning or the ones you plant later in the day,
\q2 or whether both will grow well.

\q1
\v 7 It is very delightful to be alive
\q2 and see \f + \ft metonymy \f* the sun rise every morning.
\q1
\v 8 Even if people live for many years,
\q2 they should enjoy all of them.
\q1 But they should not forget that \add some day they will die\add*
\q2 and then they will never be able to see any light again,
\q2 and we do not know what will happen to us after we die.

\v 6 In the morning plant your seed;
\q2 until the evening, work with your hands as needed, 
\q1 for you know not which will prosper, 
\q2 whether morning or evening, or this or that, 
\q2 or whether they will both alike be good.
\q1 
\v 7 Truly the light is sweet, 
\q2 and it is a pleasant thing for the eyes to see the sun.
\q1 
\v 8 If someone lives many years, 
\q2 let him be happy in all of them, 
\q1 but let him think about the coming days of darkness, 
\q2 for they will be many. 
\q1 Everything to come is vanishing vapor.
