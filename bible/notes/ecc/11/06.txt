<usfm>
\v 6 Start planting your seeds in the morning,
\q2 and do not stop planting them until the evening,
\q1 because you do not know which ones will grow better,
\q2 the ones you plant in the morning or the ones you plant later in the day,
\q2 or whether both will grow well.

\q1
\v 7 It is very delightful to be alive
\q2 and see \f + \ft metonymy \f* the sun rise every morning.
\q1
\v 8 Even if people live for many years,
\q2 they should enjoy all of them.
\q1 But they should not forget that \add some day they will die\add*
\q2 and then they will never be able to see any light again,
\q2 and we do not know what will happen to us after we die.

\v 6 In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening withhold not your hand; for you know not which shall prosper, whether
this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.
\v 7 Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun.
\v 8 Yea, if a man lives many years, let him rejoice in them all; but let him remember the days of darkness, for they shall be many. All that comes is vapor.
