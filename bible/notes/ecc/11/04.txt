\v 4 Anyone who watches the wind might not plant, 
\q2 and anyone who watches the clouds might not harvest.
\q1 
\v 5 As you do not know from where the wind will come, 
\q2 nor how a baby's bones grow in the womb of its mother, 
\q1 so also you cannot comprehend the work of God, 
\q2 who created everything.
