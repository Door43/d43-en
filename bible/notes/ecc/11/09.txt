===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Take joy, young man, in your youth, and let your heart be joyful in the days of your youth** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and are combined to emphasize that the man should be happy while he is young. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **let your heart be joyful** - Here the word "heart" represents the emotions. AT: "be joyful" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Pursue the good desires of your heart** - Here the word "heart" may represent the mind or emotions. AT: "Pursue the good things that you desire" or "Pursue the good things that you have determined to pursue" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **whatever is within the sight of your eyes** - Here "eyes" represent the whole person. AT: "whatever you see that you desire" or "whatever you see to be best" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **God will bring you into judgment for all these things** - The abstract noun "judgment" can be stated as "judge" or "make you account" AT: "God will judge you for all these things" or "God will make you account for all of your actions" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Drive anger away from your heart** - Refusing to be angry is spoken of as if anger were something that can be forced away. Also, "heart" represents a person's emotions. AT: "Refuse to be angry" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **because youth and its strength are vapor** - The authors speaks of things as being useless and meaningless as if they were "vapor" Just as vapor disappears and does not last, the author speaks of things having no lasting value.  See how you translated "vapor" in [[:en:bible:notes:ecc:01:12|1:14]]. AT: "because youth and its strength will not last forever" or "because you will not be young and strong forever" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
