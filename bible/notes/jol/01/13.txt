===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Put on sackcloth and mourn, you priests! Wail, you servants of the altar. Come, lie all night in sackcloth, you servants of my God.** - These three statements are saying basically the same thing in slightly different ways. They all refer to the priests of Israel. They are repeated for emphasis, to make sure that they specifically are listening. Alternate translation: "all the priest of Israel mourn and become humble." (See:[[en:ta:translate:parallelism]])
  * **the house of your God** - This refers to the temple in Jerusalem.
