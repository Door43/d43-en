\v 15 Alas for the day!
\q For the day of Yahweh is almost here.
\q With it will come destruction from the Almighty.
\q
\v 16 Has not food been cut off from before our eyes,
\q and joy and gladness from the house of our God?
\q
\v 17 The seeds rot under their clods,
\q the granaries are desolate,
\q and the barns have been broken down,
\q for the grain has withered.

===== Translation Notes: =====
This is what God is telling the priests to say.

  * **Has not food been cut off before our eyes, and joy and gladness from the house of our God?**  - AT: "We have seen our supplies of food used up, and they have cut off joy and gladness from the house of our God." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **from our eyes** - "from us." This refers to all of the nation of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **joy and gladness**  - If your language only has one word for "joy" and "gladness" you may translate these as one word. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **clods** - lumps of dirt
