===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **swarms of locusts** - large groups of animals like grasshoppers that fly together and eat large areas of food crops (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
    * **swarming locust...great locust...grasshopper...caterpillar** - These are, respectively, an adult locust that can fly, a locust too large to fly easily, a locust with wings too young to fly, and a newborn locust that has not yet developed wings. Use names that would be understood in your language.
