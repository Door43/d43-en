===== Translation Notes: =====
God continues to tell the priests how they should pray for Israel.

  * **groan** - make a deep sound because of pain
  * **fire has devoured ... flames have burned ...** - These two similar phrases work together to show that all the land, whether cultivated or not, was destroyed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **brooks** - small streams
