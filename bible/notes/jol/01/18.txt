\v 18 How do the animals groan!
The herds of cattle are perplexed
because they have no pasture
Also, the flocks of sheep suffer.
\v 19 O Yahweh, I cry to you
For the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness
And the flame has burned all the trees of the field.
\v 20 Also, the animals of the field pant for you
For the water brooks are dried up
And the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.
