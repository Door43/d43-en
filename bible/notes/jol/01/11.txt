\q
\v 11 Be ashamed, you farmers,
\q and wail, you vine growers,
\q for the wheat and the barley.
\q For the harvest of the fields has perished.
\q
\v 12 The vines have withered and the fig trees have dried up,
\q the pomegranate trees, also the palm trees, and the apple treesâ€”
\q all the trees of the field have withered.
\q For joy has withered away from the descendants of mankind.
