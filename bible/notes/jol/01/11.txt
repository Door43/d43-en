\v 11 Be ashamed, you farmers,
\q And wail, you vinedressers,
\q For the wheat and the barley.
\q For the harvest of the fields has perished.

\q For joy has withered away from the descendants of mankind.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **you farmers… you vinedressers**  - The word "you" refers to these specific groups of people within the nation of Israel. (See:[[:en:ta:translate:formsofyou|Forms of 'You']])
  * **barley** - This is a type of grass.  The seeds of barley can be used to make bread.  It is similar to wheat but produces seeds during warmer months instead of the cooler months like wheat. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **harvest of the fields has perished… The vines have withered… All the trees of the field have withered...joy has withered away from the descendants of mankind** - The "joy" of the "children of man" which has "withered away" is compared to all the food providing plants no longer providing food. Alternate translation: "all the food producing vines and trees have dead fruit and no long produce and their fruit, like this the joy of Israel is dead and will remain so." (See:[[:en:ta:translate:parallelism|Parallelism]])
