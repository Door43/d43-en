===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 Be ashamed, you farmers
Wail, you vinedressers
For the wheat and for the barley.
For the harvest of the field has perished.
\v 12 The vine is withered and the fig tree is dried up
The pomegranate tree, also the palm tree, and the apple tree,
Even all the trees of the field are withered.
For joy is withered away from the sons of men.
</usfm>
