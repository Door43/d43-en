\v 5 Wake up, you drunkards, and weep! 
\q Wail, all you drinkers of wine,
\q because the sweet wine has been cut off from you.
\q
\v 6 For a nation has come up upon my land,
\q strong and without number.
\q His teeth are the teeth of a lion,
\q and he has the teeth of a lioness.
\q
\v 7 He has made my vineyard into a terrifying place
\q and has stripped my fig tree bare.
\q He has stripped its bark and thrown it away;
\q the branches are bare white.

===== Translation Notes: =====
God warns the people of Israel about the coming locust army.
  * **you drunkards, and weep! Wail, all you drinkers of wine** - If your language has only one word for "weep" and "wail," you can combine the lines: "you people who love wine should cry out in sorrow" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **a nation** - The locust swarm is like an invading army. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **His teeth...he has the teeth...he has made...he has stripped** - The locusts are like a nation which is like one person. You can refer to the nation as "it," or to the locusts as "they" (see UDB), or to the invader as one person (ULB).
  * **my land...my vineyard...my fig tree** - Yahweh's land, vineyard, and fig tree
  * **terrifying**  - Those who see the land are appalled or horrified because it is completely destroyed.
