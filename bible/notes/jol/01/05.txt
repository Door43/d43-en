\v 5 Wake up, you drunkards, and weep!
\q Wail, all you drinkers of wine,
\q because the sweet wine has been cut off from you.
\q
\v 6 For a nation has come up upon my land,
\q strong and without number.
\q His teeth are the teeth of a lion,
\q and he has the teeth of a lioness.
\q
\v 7 He has made my vineyard into a terrifying place
\q and has stripped my fig tree bare.
\q He has stripped its bark and thrown it away;
\q the branches are bare white.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - God warns the people of Israel about the coming locust army.

  * **you drunkards, and weep! Wail, all you drinkers of wine** - If your language has only one word for "weep" and "wail," you can combine the lines: "you people who love wine should cry out in sorrow" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **a nation** - The locust swarm is like an invading army. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **His teeth ... he has the teeth ... He has made ... He has stripped** - The locusts are like a nation which is like one person. You can refer to the nation as "it," or to the locusts as "they," or to the invader as one person (ULB).
  * **His teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he has the teeth of a lioness.** - These two lines share similar meanings. The reference to the locusts' teeth being as sharp as lions' teeth emphasizes the ferocity with which they completely devour all of the crops of the land. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **my land ... my vineyard ... my fig tree** - Yahweh's land, vineyard, and fig tree
  * **terrifying** - Those who see the land are appalled or horrified because it is completely destroyed.
