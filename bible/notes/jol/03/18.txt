\q
\v 18 It will come about on that day
\q that the mountains will drip with sweet wine,
\q the hills will flow with milk,
\q all the brooks of Judah will flow with water,
\q and a fountain will come from the house of Yahweh
\q and water the Valley of Shittim.
\q
\v 19 Egypt will become an abandoned devastation,
\q and Edom will become an abandoned wilderness,
\q because of the violence done to the people of Judah,
\q because they shed innocent blood in their land.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - God continues to speak about the day of the Lord.

  * **It will come about on that day that the mountains** - "This is what will happen on that day: the mountains" Translate "It will come about" as in [[:en:bible:notes:jol:02:28|2:28]].
  * **the mountains will drip with sweet wine** - "sweet wine will drip from the mountains." This is an exaggeration to show that the land is very fertile. AT: "On the mountains there will be vineyards that produce plenty of sweet wine" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **the hills will flow with milk** - "milk will flow from the hills." The land being very fertile is spoken of as if the hills would flow with milk. AT: "on the hills your cattle and goats will produce plenty of milk" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **all the brooks of Judah will flow with water** - "water will flow through all the brooks of Judah"
  * **water the Valley of Shittim** - "will send water to the Valley of Shittim"
  * **Shittim** - the name of a place on the east side of the Jordan River. It means "Acacia Trees." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Egypt will become an abandoned devastation** - "Everyone will leave Egypt and no one will live there"
  * **Edom will become an abandoned wilderness** - "Everyone will leave Edom and it will look like no people have ever lived there"
  * **because of the violence done to the people of Judah** - "because of the violent things Egypt and Edom did to the people of Judah"
  * **because they shed innocent blood in their land** - The word "they" refers to "Edom" and "Egypt" and is a metonym for the people of Egypt and Edom. The words "innocent blood" are a metonym for innocent people whom they have killed. AT: "because the people of Egypt and the people of Edom killed innocent people in the land of the people of Judah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
