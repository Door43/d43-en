\v 18 It will come about on that day
\q that the mountains will drip with sweet wine,
\q the hills will flow with milk,
\q all the brooks of Judah will flow with water,
\q and a fountain will come from the house of Yahweh
\q and water the Valley of Acacia.
\q
\v 19 Egypt will become an abandoned devastation,
\q and Edom will become an abandoned wilderness,

\q because they shed innocent blood in their land.
