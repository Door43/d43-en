\v 18 It will come about on that day
\q that the mountains will drip with sweet wine,
\q the hills will flow with milk,
\q all the brooks of Judah will flow with water,
\q and a fountain will come from the house of Yahweh
\q and water the Valley of Acacia.
\q
\v 19 Egypt will become an abandoned devastation,
\q and Edom will become an abandoned wilderness,
\q because of the violence done to the people of Judah,
\q because they shed innocent blood in their land.

===== Translation Notes: =====
God continues to speak about the day of the Lord.

    * **the mountains will drip with sweet wine** - "sweet wine will drip from the mountains." This is an exaggeration to show that the land is very fertile. AT: "On the mountains there will be vineyards that produce plenty of sweet wine" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
    * **the hills will flow with milk** - "milk will flow from the hills." AT: "on the hills your cattle and goats will produce plenty of milk"
    * **all the brooks of Judah will flow with water** - "water will flow through all the brooks of Judah"
    * **and water the Valley of Acacia** - AT: "and will send water to the Valley of Acacia"
    * **Egypt will become an abandoned devastation** - AT: "Egypt will be destroyed and people will leave it" or "Enemy nations will destroy Egypt and the people of Egypt will leave their country"
    * **Edom will become an abandoned wilderness** - "Edom will become a wilderness and people will leave it"
    * **because of the violence done to the people of Judah** - "because of the violent things Egypt and Edom did to the people of Judah"
    * **because they shed innocent blood in their land** - "Innocent blood" refers to innocent people who were killed. AT: "because Egypt and Edom killed innocent people in their land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
