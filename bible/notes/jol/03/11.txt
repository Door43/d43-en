    * [[:en:obe:kt:yahweh]]
    * [[:en:obe:other:mighty]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **gather yourselves together** - "gather yourselves together for battle." (See:  [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Make your mighty warriors go down there, Yahweh** - In the middle of this message to Israel's enemies, this sentence is addressed to Yahweh.  Perhaps this was to make their enemies afraid of Yahweh's army. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
