===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues the speech he began in [[:en:bible:notes:jol:02:24|2:25]], promising good things for the people of Israel.

  * **Hurry and come ... together there** - These words continue the ironic call to battle that begins in [[:en:bible:notes:jol:03:09|3:9]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **gather yourselves together** - The purpose of the gathering is for battle. This can be stated explicitly. AT: "gather yourselves together for battle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Yahweh, bring down your mighty warriors** - Possible meanings are 1) Joel is telling the people of Judah that this is what they are to "proclaim among the nations" ([[:en:bible:notes:jol:03:09|3:9]]) or 2) Joel interrupts the words of Yahweh and prays a short prayer.
