====== Joel 03 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

There is a change in focus in this chapter from the people of Israel to her enemies. The events of this chapters also contain many prophecies about the events of the end of this world. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Israel ==
The mention of Israel in this chapter is probably a reference to the people of Judah and not the northern kingdom of Israel. It is also possible this is a reference to the people of Israel as a whole.
