There is a change in focus in this chapter from the people of Israel to her enemies. The events of this chapters also contains many [[:en:obe:kt:prophet|prophecies]] about the events of the end of this world.

== Israel ==
The mention of Israel in this chapter is probably a reference to the people of Judah and not the northern kingdom of Israel. It is also possible that this is a reference to the people of Israel as a whole.
