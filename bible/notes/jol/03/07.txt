===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Look, I will soon set them**  - The word "look" here alerts the captors to pay attention to what is going to happen.  "I" refers to Yahweh, and "them" refers to the people of Judah who were in exile. 
    * **leaving from the place where you sold them**  - "come back from the places where you had sold them" or "return from the places to which you sold them" (UDB).  The word "you" here refers to the captors.
    * **recompense**  - "payment for" or "reward" for something done
    * **return your recompense on your head**  - This means that the people of Tyre, Sidon, and Philistia will suffer the same terrible things they had done to God's people.  Yahweh will allow the people of Judah to retaliate by selling the children of their captors to foreigners from the faraway land of Sabea.
    * **Yahweh has spoken**  - This affirms that what was said in the preceding verses are the words of Yahweh.
