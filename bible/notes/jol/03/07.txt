<usfm>
\v 7 Look, I will rouse them up out of the place where you have sold them
And will return your recompense on your own head
\v 8 and I will sell your sons and your daughters by the hand of the children of Judah
And they will sell them to the Sabeans
to a nation far off
For Yahweh has spoken it.
