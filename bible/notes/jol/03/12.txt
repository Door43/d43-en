(See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Put in the sickle** - "Swing the sickle to cut the grain"
  * **sickle** - a long curved knife that people use for cutting grain
  * **the harvest is ripe** - "the grain is ready to be harvested"
  * **the vats overflow, for their wickedness is enormous** - Vats are large containers used to store grape juice. The vats are not large enough to hold the amount of juice that represents their sin.
