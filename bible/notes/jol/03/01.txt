===== Translation Notes: =====
God continues to speak of future events.

  * **Behold** - The word "behold" here adds emphasis to what follows.
  * **in those days, and at that time**  - These two phrases point to a future time (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]]).
  * **when I return the exiles of Judah and Jerusalem** - AT: "When I send the exiles back to Judah and Jerusalem"
  * **my people, and my inheritance Israel**  - These two phrases emphasize how Yahweh views Israel as his own precious people (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]]).
  * **traded a boy for a prostitute and sold a girl for wine, so they could drink** - This is only an example of the kinds of things they did. This is not what they did to two particular children. AT: "and did things like traded a boy for a prostitute and sold a girl for wine, so they could drink".
