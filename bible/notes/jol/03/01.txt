===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - God continues to speak of future events.

  * **Behold** - The word "Behold" here adds emphasis to what follows.
  * **in those days and at that time** - The phrase "at that time" means the same thing as, and intensifies the phrase "in those days." AT: "in those very days" or "at that very time." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **when I return the exiles of Judah and Jerusalem** - AT: "When I send the exiles back to Judah and Jerusalem"
  * **my people and my inheritance Israel** - These two phrases emphasize how Yahweh views Israel as his own precious people. AT: "the people of Israel, who are my inheritance." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **traded a boy for a prostitute, and sold a girl for wine so they could drink** - This is only an example of the kinds of things they did. This is not what they did to two particular children. AT: "and did things like traded a boy for a prostitute and sold a girl for wine, so they could drink".
