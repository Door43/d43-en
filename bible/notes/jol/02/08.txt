\v 9 They swarm over the city walls and enter our houses;
\q2 they enter through our windows like \f + \ft simile \f* thieves do.

\q
\v 8 Neither does one thrust another aside;
\q they march, each in his path;
\q they break through the defenses
\q and do not fall out of line.
\q
\v 9 They rush on the city,
\q they run on the wall,
\q they climb in the houses,
\q and they go through the windows like thieves.
