Description of the Army of Yahweh continues

    * **They**  - This refers to the members of the army.
    * **Neither does one thrust another aside;
They march, each in his path... break through the defenses... do not fall out of line.**  - The locust of the army act like well trained soldiers would. (See: [[en:ta:translate:personification]])
    * **go through the windows like thieves** - The locust are compared to thieves who are able to enter even homes even when people try to stop them. Alternate translation: "no barrier is able to stop the locust from entering homes." (See: [[en:ta:translate:simile]])
