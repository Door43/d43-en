<usfm>
\q
\v 3 A fire is consuming everything in front of it,
\q and behind it a flame is burning.
\q The land is like the garden of Eden in front of it,
\q but behind it there is a ruined wilderness.
\q Indeed, nothing will escape from it.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Joel's description of the coming army continues.

  * **land is like the garden of Eden** - The garden of Eden was a beautiful place. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **The land is like the garden of Eden in front of it, but behind it there is a ruined wilderness** - This is showing a contrast to highlight the destruction the fire is producing.
