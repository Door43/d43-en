\p
\v 1 Blow you the trumpet in Zion
And sound an alarm in my holy mountain!
Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble in fear
For the day of Yahweh comes
Indeed, it is near. at hand
\v 2 It is a day of darkness and gloom
A day of clouds and thick darkness
As the dawn spreads upon the mountains
A large and mighty army approaches.
There has never been an army like them
Neither will there be any more after
Even after years of many generations.
