\q
\v 1 Blow the trumpet in Zion,
\q and sound an alarm on my holy mountain!
\q Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble in fear,
\q for the day of Yahweh is coming;
\q indeed, it is near.
\q
\v 2 It is a day of darkness and gloom,
\q a day of clouds and thick darkness.
\q Like the dawn that spreads on the mountains,
\q a large and mighty army is approaching.
\q There has never been an army like it,
\q and there never will be again,
\q even after many generations.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Joel continues poetry that began in the previous chapter. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **Blow the trumpet ... sound an alarm** - Joel is emphasizing the importance of calling Israel together in preparation for the destruction that is coming. 
  * **day of darkness and gloom** - The words "darkness" and "gloom" share similar meanings and emphasize that the darkness will be very dark. Both words refer to a time of disaster or divine judgment. AT: "day that is full of darkness" or "day of terrible judgment" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **gloom** - total or partial darkness
  * **day of clouds and thick darkness** - This phrase means the same thing as, and intensifies the idea of the previous phrase. Like that phrase, both "clouds" and "thick darkness" refer to divine judgment. AT: "day full of dark storm clouds" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Like the dawn that spreads on the mountains, a large and mighty army is approaching** - When direct sunlight shines on a mountain at dawn, it begins at the top and spreads to the bottom. When an army comes over a mountain range, it comes over the top and spreads out as it comes down. AT: "A large, mighty army comes over the mountains into the land. They spread over the land like the light from the rising sun" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **a large and mighty army** - The words "large" and "mighty" share similar meanings here and emphasize that the army will be very strong. The word "army" could possibly be 1) a metaphor for a swarm of locusts or 2) referring to a human army. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
