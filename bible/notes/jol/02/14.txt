  * **Will he perhaps turn ... God?** - This can be translated as a statement. AT: "Perhaps Yahweh will turn from his anger ... God." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **leave a blessing behind him, a grain offering and a drink offering** - "leave behind him a blessing—that is, a grain offering and a drink offering." The blessing is that plenty of grain and grapes will ripen, and so the people will be able to offer grain and drink offerings.
