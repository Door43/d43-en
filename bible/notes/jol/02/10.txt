<usfm>
\v 10 The earth quakes before them
The heavens tremble
The sun and the moon are darkened
And the stars stop shining.
\v 11 And Yahweh raises his voice before his army
For his warriors are very numerous
For he is strong who executes his word
For the day of Yahweh is great and very terrible
and Who can survive it?
