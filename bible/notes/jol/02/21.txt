\v 21 Do not fear, O land, be glad and rejoice
For Yahweh has done great things.
\v 22 Do not fear, you beasts of the field
For the pastures of the wilderness sprout
for The tree bears its fruit
The fig tree and the vine do yield their full yield.
\v 23 Be glad then, you children of Zion
And rejoice in Yahweh your God.
For he gives you the autumn rain for justice
And he brings down showers for you
The autumn rain and the spring rain as before.
</usfm>
