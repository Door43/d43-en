====== Galatians 03:13-14 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 Even though we humans have not continuously and completely obeyed God's laws, Christ rescued us from \add God\add* punishing us eternally. Christ rescued us by his being \add the one God condemned\add* instead of God condemning us. What is written \f + \ft Or:\add someone, Or: Moses\add* wrote \f* \add in the Scriptures\add* shows that this is true. It is written \f + \ft Or:\add He\add* wrote \f*, "\add God has already\add* decided that he will punish eternally anyone \add whom people execute for his crimes and whose body they\add* hang on a tree."
\v 14 Christ rescued us in order that as a result of what Christ Jesus \add has done, God might bless the non-Jews, in a way similar to the way\add* God blessed Abraham. He also desired that as a result of our trusting \add Christ\add*, we \add all\add* might receive the Spirit \add whom God\add* promised to \add give to\add* us.

\v 13 Christ stopped God from having to curse us as they wrote in the Law he must. This happened when God cursed Christ in our place. It is like they wrote in the scriptures, "God curses everyone whom they hang on a tree."
\v 14 God cursed Christ in order to bless the non-Jews who believe in Christ just as he blessed Abraham. And he blessed the non-Jews so that we might receive the Spirit, whom he promised to all who trust in Christ.

<usfm>
\v 13 Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law when he became a curse for us, for it is written, "Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree."
\v 14 The purpose was that the blessing that was upon Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
