\v 19 So, \add if someone should ask\add*, "Why \add did God later give\add* his laws \add to Moses?" I would reply that\add* it was in order that \add people might realize\add* how sinful they were. \add Those laws were valid\add* until \add Jesus came. He was\add* the descendant that God \add was referring to when he made\add* the promises to Abraham. \add The laws\add* were given \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* gave \add his laws\add* \f* \add to Moses\add* by God's causing angels to \add speak to him. Moses was the\add* mediator, \add the one who told the laws to the people\add*.
\v 20 Now, \add when\add* a mediator \add functions\add*, one \add person\add* is not \add speaking with another\add* directly; but God himself \add made his promises directly to Abraham\add*.

\v 19 So why did God later give his Law to us Jews? God gave us his Law to teach us that we all deliberately break it. This Law was in force until the descendant about whom he spoke—Jesus himself—came to us Jews. Until that time, the Law that God's angels gave to us Jews by the hand of Moses, the man who stood between God and the people, was in force.
\v 20 When there is a person to go between others, then there are always two persons who are acting: in this case, God and the Israelites. But God acted by himself, without a go-between, when he promised to bless Abraham. Therefore, the Abrahamic promise is greater than the Law because there was no mediator involved.

<usfm>
\v 19 Why then was there the law? Because of transgressions it was added, until the descendant of Abraham would come to those to whom he had been promised, and the law was put into force through angels by the hand of a mediator.
\v 20 Now a mediator implies more than one person, yet God is only one.
