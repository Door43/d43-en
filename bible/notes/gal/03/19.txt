\v 19 So, \add if someone should ask\add*, "Why \add did God later give\add* his laws \add to Moses?" I would reply that\add* it was in order that \add people might realize\add* how sinful they were. \add Those laws were valid\add* until \add Jesus came. He was\add* the descendant that God \add was referring to when he made\add* the promises to Abraham. \add The laws\add* were given \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* gave \add his laws\add* \f* \add to Moses\add* by God's causing angels to \add speak to him. Moses was the\add* mediator, \add the one who told the laws to the people\add*.
\v 20 Now, \add when\add* a mediator \add functions\add*, one \add person\add* is not \add speaking with another\add* directly; but God himself \add made his promises directly to Abraham\add*.

\v 19 So why did God later give his law to us? God gave his law to teach us that we all deliberately break it. And looking forward, God gave the law for the time when a descendent of Abraham would come. That descendent is the one who receives the promise that was made before to Abraham. The angels protected and applied the law by the authority of the one who would stand between God and people.
\v 20 Now, when one person speaks directly with another, there is no mediator. And God himself made his promises directly to Abraham.

\v 19 What, then, was the purpose of the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the descendant of Abraham would come to whom the promise had been made. The law was put into force through angels by a mediator.
\v 20 Now a mediator implies more than one person, but God is one.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul tells the believers in Galatia why God gave the law.

  * **What, then, was the purpose of the law? ** - Paul uses a rhetorical question to introduce the next topic he wants to discuss. It can also be translated as a statement. AT: "I will tell you what the purpose of the law is" or "Let me tell you why God gave the law" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **It was added** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God added it" or "God added the law" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **The law was put into force through angels by a mediator** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God issued the law with the help of angels, and a mediator put it into force" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **a mediator** - "a representative"
  * **Now a mediator implies more than one person, but God is one** - God gave his promise to Abraham without a mediator, but he gave the law to Moses with a mediator. As a result, Paul's readers may have thought that the law somehow made the promise to no effect. Paul is stating what his readers might have thought here, and he will respond to them in the verses that follow.
