\v 1 You fellow believers there in Galatia are very foolish! Someone must have bewitched you with their evil eye! I told you exactly how they had crucified Jesus Christ, did I not?
\v 2 So I want you to tell me only one thing: when the Holy Spirit came to you, did he come because you were obeying the Law of Moses? Or did the Spirit come to you because you had heard the good news and trusted in Christ? Certainly this is what happened.
\v 3 You are very foolish! You first became Christians because God's Spirit enabled you. But now you think you will continue until you die by trying as hard as possible to obey the Law.

\c 3
\p
\v 1 Foolish Galatians, whose evil eye has harmed you? Was not Jesus Christ depicted as crucified before your eyes?
\v 2 I only want to learn this from you. Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law or by believing in what you heard?
\v 3 Are you so foolish? Did you begin in the Spirit but now  finish in the flesh?

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **whose evil eye has harmed you?**  - Paul is using irony and a rhetorical question to say that the Galatians are acting as though someone has put a spell on them. He does not really believe that someone has put a spell on them. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony|Irony]], [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **evil eye** - This term is related to witchcraft and the casting of spells. It is used in a figurative sense here. If your language has a different way to express the placing of a spell on someone, you may want to use it here. 
  * **Was not Jesus Christ depicted as crucified before your eyes?**  - This is another rhetorical question: "I told you exactly how they had crucified Jesus Christ" (UDB).
  * **I only want to learn this from you**  - This continues the irony from verse 1. Paul knows the answers to the rhetorical questions he is about to ask. As you translate, emphasize **this**  and **only,**  as these are the most important words in the sentence.
  * **this**  - refers to the three questions that follow
  * **Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law or by believing in what you heard**  - "You received the Spirit, not by doing what the law says, but by believing what you heard." Translate this rhetorical question as a question if you can, because the reader will be expecting a question here. Also, be sure that the reader knows that the answer to the question is "by believing what you heard," not "by doing what the law says."
  * **Are you so foolish?**  - This rhetorical question not only says "You(plural) are very foolish!" (UDB), it also shows that Paul is surprised and even angry that the Galatians are foolish.
  * **in the flesh**  - "by your own work"
