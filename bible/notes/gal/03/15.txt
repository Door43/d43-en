===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 My fellow believers, I will now \add illustrate\add* by referring to human \add relationships. After an agreement is confirmed by two people\add* \f + \ft Or:\add two people have signed\add* an agreement \f*, no one can reject it or add to it.
\v 16 \add God\add* declared to Abraham and his descendant that he was promising \add to give blessings to Abraham\add*. \add The words that God spoke were not "and your\add* descendants." \add He was not\add* referring to many persons. Instead, he was referring to one person, who is Christ, \add because the words that God spoke were\add*, "and your descendant."
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 My fellow believers, God's promise is like a contract between two people. After they sign it, no one can add anything to it, nor can they cancel it.
\v 16 God promised to bless Abraham and his descendant. The scriptures do not say, "your descendants," that is, many people, but instead "your descendant," meaning just one person, Christ.

\v 15 Brothers, I speak in human terms. Like an irrevocable human contract, no one voids it or adds to it, so also
\v 16 The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his special descendant. It does not say, "... to his descendants," referring to many, but instead to only one, "... to your descendant," who is Christ!
