====== Galatians 03:15-16 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 My fellow believers, I will now \add illustrate\add* by referring to human \add relationships. After an agreement is confirmed by two people\add* \f + \ft Or:\add two people have signed\add* an agreement \f*, no one can reject it or add to it.
\v 16 \add God\add* declared to Abraham and his descendant that he was promising \add to give blessings to Abraham\add*. \add The words that God spoke were not "and your\add* descendants." \add He was not\add* referring to many persons. Instead, he was referring to one person, who is Christ, \add because the words that God spoke were\add*, "and your descendant."
</usfm>

<usfm>
\v 15 My fellow believers, God's promise is like a contract between two people. After they sign it, no one can cancel it, nor can they add anything to it.
\v 16 God promised to bless Abraham and his special descendant. The scriptures do not say, "your descendants," that is, many people, but instead "your descendant," meaning just one person, Christ.

\v 15 Brothers, let me speak in human terms. In a man-made contract, no one can set it aside or add to it, once it is established by law.
\v 16 Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his descendant. It does not say, "to descendants," referring to many, but instead to only one, "and to your descendant," who is Christ.
