\v 23 Before \add God revealed the good message about\add* trusting \add in Christ\add*, the laws \f + \ft personification \f* that God gave to Moses were \add confining\f + \ft Or: imprisoning \f* us Jews\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add as\add* a prisoner \add in jail is\add* confined. \add We\add* were unable to escape \add obeying those\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add laws\add*. This happened in order that \add we might believe\add* the good message \add concerning Christ, the message that God would\add* reveal \add later\add*.
\v 24 \add Like a father supervises his immature son by appointing a\add* servant to take care of him \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add God\add* was supervising us \add by\add* his laws \f + \ft metaphor, personification \f* until Christ came. \add He did this\add* in order that he might erase the record of our sins \add only\add* because we trust \add Christ\add*.
\v 25 But \add now that God\add* has revealed the message \add about trusting in Christ\add*, the laws \add that God gave to Moses\add* are no longer supervising us \add Jews\add* \f + \ft personification, metaphor \f*.


\p
\v 26 Now all of you \add Jews and\add* non-Jews are \add as though you are\add* God's children because you trusted Christ Jesus.

\v 23 Before God revealed the Good News about how people should trust in Christ, his law was like a soldier who kept us in prison, unable to move about.
\v 24 Like a father protects his small child by telling a slave to take care of him, God was supervising us by his law until Christ came. He did this so that he might now declare us good in his sight, if we trust in Christ.
\v 25 But now that we can trust in Christ, we do no longer need God's law to supervise us .


\p
\v 26 I say this because you are all God's children because you have trusted in Christ Jesus.

\p
\v 23 But before faith in Christ came, we were imprisoned and confined by the law until the revelation of faith.
\v 24 So then the law became our childminder to bring us to the time of Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
\v 25 Now that faith has come we are no longer under a childminder.
\v 26 For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
