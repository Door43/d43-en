<usfm>
\v 27 That is, you who \add began a relationship\add* with Christ when you were baptized identified yourselves \f + \ft metaphor \f* with Christ.
\v 28 \add If you are believers, it does\add* not \add matter to God if you are\add* Jews or non-Jews; slaves or ones \add who are\add* not slaves; males or females, because all of you are \add as\add* one \add sort of person because of your relationship\add* with Christ Jesus.
\v 29 Furthermore, since you belong to Christ, you are \add like\add* Abraham's descendants \add because you trust God as Abraham did\add*, and you will possess\f + \ft Or: receive \f* all that God has promised \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 27 All you who trust in Christ and were baptized so that you could join with him now have become the same sort of person as he is.
\v 28 If you are believers, it does not matter to God if you are Jews or non-Jews, slaves or free persons, males or females, because all of you are together joined to Christ Jesus.
\v 29 Furthermore, since you belong to Christ, he makes you into descendants of Abraham, and you will receive everything that God has promised him and us.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 27 For as many of you as were baptized into Christ, you have received Christ.
\v 28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
\v 29 Then if you are Christ's, you are Abraham's descendants, and heirs according to promise.
