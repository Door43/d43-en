\v 21 \add If someone should ask, "When God gave his\add* laws \add to Moses\add* long \add after he told Abraham\add* what he was promising \add to give to him, was he\add* changing his mind?" \add I would reply that God\add* certainly did not \add change his mind when he did that!\add* If God had given a law that could enable people to live \add eternally\add*, then it actually would be because of people \add obeying that\add* law that God would erase the record of their sins.
\v 22 But instead, \add what we read in\add* the Scriptures \f + \ft personification \f* is that God \add caused all people to be unable to escape being punished for\add* their \add sins\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, just like \add people\add* in prison \add are unable to escape\add* \f + \ft personification, metaphor \f*. \add God did that in order that he might give what he promised to those who trust Jesus Christ, just\add* because they trust him.

\v 21 So do the words of the Law speak against what God promises? Certainly not. If we could obey the Law and then live forever with God, then he certainly would have regarded us as good in his sight.
\v 22 But that was impossible. Instead, because we sin, the Law in the scriptures controls us--and all things!, just as if we were in prison. So when God promised to free us from that prison, he was speaking about anyone who believes in Jesus Christ.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 21 So is the law against the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that was able to give life, righteousness would certainly have come by that law.
\v 22 But instead, scripture imprisoned all things under sin. So God's promise to save us by faith in Jesus Christ was given to those who believe.
