====== Galatians 03:4-5 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 Keep in mind that \add if what God has done for you was because of your obeying the laws that God gave to Moses and\add* not because of trusting in Christ, when others caused you to suffer, you suffered many things needlessly!\f + \ft Or: did you not suffer many things needlessly? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add I certainly hope that you did not suffer like that\add* needlessly.
\v 5 \add When God now\add* generously gives to you his Spirit and performs miracles among you, \add do you think that it is\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* because you obey the laws \add that God gave to Moses? Surely you know that\add* it is because when you heard \add the good message about Christ\add*, you trusted in him \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*!

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 All the things you experienced after you believed in Christ--whether good things or bad things--they would have been of no value at all if you had not been trusting in him.
\v 5 When God now generously gives to you his Spirit and performs miracles among you, do you think that it is because you obey God's Law? Surely you know it is because when you heard the Good News about Christ, you trusted in him!

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 Did you suffer so many things for nothing, if indeed they were for nothing?
\v 5 Therefore, does he who gives the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do it by the works of the law or by the hearing with faith?

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * (Paul asks two more [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:rhetoricalquestion|rhetorical questions]].)
    * **suffer so many things**  - This can be translated as 1) "experience so many good and bad things" (see UDB) or 2) "suffer so much" persecution because of their original commitment to Christ or 3) "work so hard" to keep the law  
    * **if indeed they were for nothing**  - This can be translated as 1) "they would have been of no value at all if you had not been trusting in him" (UDB) or 2) assuming the Galatians were working hard to keep the law, "if the work you did were only for nothing," meaning that they were depending on works, not on Christ, and God would not count them as believers.
    * **does he ... do it by the works of the law or by the hearing with faith?**  - "he ... does not do it by the works of the law; he does it by the hearing with faith"
    * **by the works of the law**  - "when we do what the law tells us to do"
    * **by the hearing with faith**  - "when we listen to the message and put our trust in Jesus"
    * **bold words**  - explanation
