====== Galatians 03:17-18 ======

\v 17 This is what I am saying: \add Since God\add* gave the laws \add to the Jews\add* 430 years after \add he declared to Abraham what he was promising to do for Abraham\add*, those laws do not cancel that agreement \add with\add* Abraham that God himself had previously agreed about \f + \ft personification \f*.
\v 18 Remember that if it is because \add we obey God's\add* laws \add that he gives to us\add* what \add he has\add* promised \add to give to us\add*, then it is not \add just\add* because he \add has\add* promised \add that he would give those things to us\add*. God freely gave to Abraham \add what he had promised to give to him, just\add* because \add God had\add* promised \add that he would give it to him. Similarly, it is not because we obey God's laws that God gives to us what he has promised to give to us\add*.

\v 17 This is what I am saying. God established an agreement with Abraham that the law which he gave to Moses 430 years later could not cancel.
\v 18 This is because if what God is giving to us forever comes because we keep his law, then he would not be giving it because he had promised to do so. In reality, however, God gave Abraham this gift because he had freely promised to give it.

\v 17 Now what I mean is this: The law, which came 430 years afterward, does not set aside the covenant previously established by God.
\v 18 For if the inheritance comes by the law, then it no longer comes by promise. But God gave it to Abraham by a promise.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For if the inheritance comes by the law, then it no longer comes by promise.** - Paul is speaking of a situation that did not exist (that it was impossible for the great promises of redemption and salvation to come by obeying the law) to emphasize that the inheritance came only by means of the promise. AT: "the inheritance came to us by means of the promise, because we could not keep the demands of God's law" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **inheritance** - Receiving what God has promised believers is spoken of as if it were an inheritance of property and wealth from a family member, and eternal blessings and redemption. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
