====== Galatians 03:17-18 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 This is what I am saying: \add Since God\add* gave the laws \add to the Jews\add* 430 years after \add he declared to Abraham what he was promising to do for Abraham\add*, those laws do not cancel that agreement \add with\add* Abraham that God himself had previously agreed about \f + \ft personification \f*.
\v 18 Remember that if it is because \add we obey God's\add* laws \add that he gives to us\add* what \add he has\add* promised \add to give to us\add*, then it is not \add just\add* because he \add has\add* promised \add that he would give those things to us\add*. God freely gave to Abraham \add what he had promised to give to him, just\add* because \add God had\add* promised \add that he would give it to him. Similarly, it is not because we obey God's laws that God gives to us what he has promised to give to us\add*.

\v 17 This is what I am saying. God established an agreement with Abraham that the law which he gave to Moses 430 years later could not cancel.
\v 18 This is because what God is giving to us--if he gives it because we keep his law, then he would not be giving it because he had promised to do so. In reality, however, God gave Abraham this gift because he had kindly promised to give it.

\v 17 Now I say this. The covenant confirmed beforehand by God does not have its promise voided by the law that came 430 years later.
\v 18 For if the inheritance came by means of the law, it would no longer be by means of the promise, but God freely gave grace to Abraham by a promise.
