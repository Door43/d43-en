\v 3 Once again I solemnly declare to every man whom they have circumcised, that he must obey the Law perfectly, for God to declare him good in his sight.
\v 4 If you expect God to declare you good in His sight because you  try to keep the Law, you have separated yourself from Christ; God will no longer act kindly toward you.
