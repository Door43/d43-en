====== Galatians 05:3-4 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Instead, I solemnly declare again to every man who is circumcised \f + \ft Or:has someone circumcise him \f* \add in order for God to accept him\add*, that you must \add perfectly\add* obey all of the laws \add that God gave Moses, in order for God to save you\add*.
\v 4 Those of you who are sure that God will erase the record of your sins because you obey the laws \add that God gave to Moses\add*, you have separated yourselves from Christ. You have abandoned\f + \ft Or: rejected \f* \add God's true method of saving you, which was\add* by kindly erasing the record of your sins, in a way that you did not deserve.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Once again I solemnly declare to every man whom they have circumcised, that he must obey the law perfectly, for God to declare him good in his sight.
\v 4 If you expect God to declare you good in His sight because you  try to keep the law, you have separated yourself from Christ; God will no longer act kindly toward you.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Again, I testify to every man who is circumcised that he becomes obliged to do the whole law.
\v 4 You are alienated from Christ, all you who seek to be justified by the law; you have fallen away from grace.
</usfm>

  * **to do** - AT: "to obey"

  * **you have fallen away from grace** - Paul is comparing a person who decides that he does not need or want the grace of Christ to someone who falls from a good high place to a bad lower place. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
