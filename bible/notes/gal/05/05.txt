====== Galatians 05:5-8 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 But we who have a relationship with Christ and who trust in Christ are eagerly waiting to receive what God's Spirit assures us that we can expect. We can expect to receive it because God has erased the record of our sins.
\v 6 As for us who have a relationship with Christ Jesus, God is not concerned whether we are circumcised or not circumcised. Instead, God is concerned about whether we trust \add in\add* Christ, with the result that we love \add other people\add*.


\p
\v 7 You were progressing well \add spiritually\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. You should not have let someone influence you so that \add now you\add* are not believing the true \add message about Christ\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*!
\v 8 \add God\add*, the one who chose you, is not the one who is persuading you to think like this!

\v 5 We whom God's Spirit enables us to trust in Christ are confidently waiting for the time when God will declare us good in His sight.
\v 6 God is not concerned whether we are circumcised or not circumcised. Instead, God is concerned about whether we trust in Christ, with the result that we love others because we trust in him.
\p
\v 7 You were following Christ so well! Who stopped you from obeying his true message?
\v 8 God, the one who chose you, is not the one who is persuading you to think like this!

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 For through the Spirit, by faith, we eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness.
\v 6 In Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but only faith working through love.
\v 7 You were running well. Who prevented you from obeying the truth?
\v 8 This persuasion does not come from him who calls you!
