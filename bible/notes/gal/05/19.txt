===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 Now what normal human beings want to do is easy to see. They commit evil sexual actions, sexual actions that even go against what is natural, and they desire things that are against good laws.
.
\v 20 They also worship false gods and things that represent those gods. They try get evil spirits to act for them. People are hostile to others. People quarrel with each other. People are jealous. People behave angrily. People try to get others to think highly of them and do not consider what others want. People do not associate with others. People associate only with those who agree with them.
\v 21 People want what others have. People get drunk. People get drunk and riot. And they do other things like these. I warn you now, just like I warned you previously, that the ones who constantly act and think like this will not receive what God has for his own people when he reveals himself to everyone as king.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 Now the works of the flesh are visible. They are sexual immorality, impurity, lustfulness,
\v 20 idolatry, sorcery, hostility, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, rivalry, dissention, sectarian division,
\v 21 envy, drunkenness, drunken riots, and things like these about which I warn you, as I already forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.
