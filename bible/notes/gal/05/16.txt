<usfm>
\v 16 \add So\add* I tell you this: Constantly let \add God's\add* Spirit direct you. \add If you do that\add*, you will certainly not do the things that your self-directed nature wants \add you to do\add*.
\v 17 Your self-directed nature opposes \add God's\add* Spirit\f + \ft Or: does not \add want you to do what\add* God's Spirit \add wants you to do\add* \f*, but also his Spirit opposes your self-directed nature. These two are always fighting with\f + \ft Or: opposing \f* each other. The result is that you do not \add constantly\add* do the \add good\add* deeds that you truly desire \add to do\add*.
\v 18 But when you are led by God's Spirit \f + \ft Or:when God's Spirit directs you \f*, you \add can do what pleases God\add*, now that you are no longer obligated \add to obey all\add* the laws \add that God gave Moses\add*.

<usfm>
\v 16 So I tell you this: Always let God's Spirit lead you. If you do that, you will not sin, as normal human beings want to do.
\v 17 When you want to sin, you go against God's Spirit. And God's Spirit goes against what normal humans want. These two are always fighting against each other. The result is that you do not always do the good things that you truly desire to do.
\v 18 But when God's Spirit leads you, the law does not control you.

\p
\v 16 But I say, walk by the Spirit and you will not carry out the desires of the sinful nature.
\v 17 For the desires of the sinful nature are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the sinful nature. For these are in conflict with each other, so that you cannot do the things you want. 
\v 18 But if you are led by the Spirit you are not under the law.
