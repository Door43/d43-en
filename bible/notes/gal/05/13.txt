====== Galatians 05:13-15 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 My fellow believers, \add God\add* chose you in order that \add you might live\add* without having to \add obey rules and rituals\add*. But \add do not assume that because\add* you are free \add from having to obey rules and rituals\add*, \add God\add* permits you to \add do what your\add* self-directed nature \add desires\add*. Instead, constantly, as you love \add each other\add*, serve each other.
\v 14 Keep in mind that we can sum up all of the laws \add that God has\add* given us in one law, which is: "You must love each person you come in contact with, just like \add you love\add* yourself."
\v 15 Since you are attacking and injuring \f + \ft metaphor \f* each other \add by the things that you say\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, I warn you that \add if you continue doing that\add*, you will totally ruin each other \add spiritually\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 My fellow believers, God has called you to set you free. But do not think he set you free so you could sin. Instead, love and serve each other, because you are now free to do that!
\v 14 Remember something that Jesus said. He said all the Law means this--"Love each person like you love yourself."
\v 15 So if you attack and harm each other like wild animals, you might completely destroy each other.

\p
\v 13 For God called you, brothers, to freedom. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but instead through love serve one another.
\v 14 For the whole law stands fulfilled in one commandment, in this, "You must love your neighbor as yourself."
\v 15 But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another.
