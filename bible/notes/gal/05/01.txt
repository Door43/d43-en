\v 1 Christ set us free from the Law so that it may control us no longer. So stop anyone who says you are still slaves to the Law, and do not let the Law control you like slaves again.
\v 2 Consider very carefully what I, Paul, an apostle, now tell you. If you let anyone circumcise you,  what Christ has done for you will not help you at all!
