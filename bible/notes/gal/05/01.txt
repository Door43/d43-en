So, firmly \add reject the false teaching that someone must circumcise you, and\add* do not \add live like\add* slaves again \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add by letting others force you to obey those rules and rituals again\add*.
\v 2 Consider very carefully what I, Paul, \add an apostle\add*, now tell you: If you are permitting yourself to be circumcised \f + \ft Or:someone to circumcise you \f*, what Christ \add has done for you\add* will not benefit you at all.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Christ set us free from the Law so that it may control us no longer. So stop anyone who says you are still slaves to the Law, and do not let the Law control you like slaves again.
\v 2 Consider very carefully what I, Paul, an apostle, now tell you. If you let anyone circumcise you,  what Christ has done for you will not help you at all!

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **It is for freedom**  - The translation needs to emphasize "freedom" in contrast with the slavery talked about in the previous verses.
  * **for **- "to provide us with"
  * **stand firm **- "stay where you are," even though people are trying to force you to move
  * **if you become circumcised**  - "if you return to the Jewish religion." Paul is using circumcision as metonymy for Judaism. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
