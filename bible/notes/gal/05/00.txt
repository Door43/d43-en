====== Galatians 05 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Paul continues talking about the Law of Moses as something which traps or enslaves a person. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|Law of Moses]]) 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Fruit of the Spirit ==
Many scholars have observed that the phrase "the fruit of the Spirit" is singular and not plural, even though it begins a list of several things. The singular form should remain in translation in a singular form if possible. Do not translate: "the fruits of the spirit are" in attempt to force agreement. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:fruit|Fruit]])

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Illustrations ==
Paul uses several metaphors to illustrate his points. Running a race and yeast are two metaphors he uses in this chapter to help explain complicated issues. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphors]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Flesh ==

This is a complex issue and it is possible that "flesh" is a metaphor for a person's sinful nature. It is not the physical part of man that is sinful and it appears that Paul is teaching that while man remains alive ("in the flesh"), he will remain sinful regardless of his effort, but his new nature will be fighting against his old nature. Flesh is used in this chapter to contrast with that which is spiritual. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:flesh|Flesh]])

== "You are separated from Christ, all you who are "justified" by the law. You have fallen away from grace." ==
Some scholars believe Paul teaches this type of action causes a person to lose their salvation. It is more probable that Paul is saying these people have walked away from [[:en:obe:kt:grace|grace]] as a rule and exchange it for the law. 

The authors of the ULB have also chosen to place "justified" in quotation marks to indicate that this is a hypothetical situation and that no one is able to be justified by the law. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:justify|Justified]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo|hypothetical situation]])
