\v 11 But, my fellow believers, \add although someone claims that I am proclaiming that men must be circumcised, I certainly am not still proclaiming that. Remember that the Jews are still\add* \add persecuting me\f + \ft Or: causing me to suffer\add* \f*. If I were still proclaiming that men must be circumcised \add in order for God to accept them\add*, the Jews would not be persecuting me.\f + \ft Or: why would the Jews be persecuting me? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add They would\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* not be \add persecuting me\add*, Or: causing me to suffer \add because\add* then \add the Jews\add* would no longer be offended. \add They\add* \add are offended\f + \ft Or: do not want to accept what I teach\add* \f* \add because I proclaim that Christ, the Messiah, died on\add* the cross \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 12 I \add would even\add* wish that those who are disturbing you \add by insisting that men be circumcised\add* would also emasculate \f + \ft euphemism \f* themselves, \add with the result that they would be expelled from your congregations\add*!

\v 11 But, my fellow believers, maybe someone is saying that I still teach that you must let them circumcise you. I certainly taught that before I followed Christ, but I am not teaching that any longer. But what they are saying cannot be true; otherwise, no one would be persecuting me now. No, I tell you that if people think they have to be circumcised to follow Christ, then the fact that Christ died on the cross no longer make any difference to them.
\v 12 I wish that those who are confusing you would go all the way and castrate themselves!

\v 11 Brothers, if I still proclaim circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross would be destroyed.
\v 12 I wish that those who mislead you would go ahead and also castrate themselves.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Brothers, if I still proclaim circumcision, why am I still persecuted**  - "But as for me, brothers, if I still taught that men must be circumcised to be saved, they would no longer be persecuting me." Paul is strongly claiming that he ("as for me"), unlike those he mentions in the previous verses, is not telling the Galatians to become circumcised.
  * **Brothers**  - "Brothers and sisters." If your language has a word that includes males and females, use it here.
  * **Then the stumbling block of the cross would be destroyed**  - This can be stated in active form: "Then circumcision would destroy the stumbling block of the cross." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the stumbling block of the cross** - This metaphor states that the message about the cross prevents some people from believing just as a stumbling block can prevent a person from successfully walking down a path. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you**  - plural
  * **castrate themselves**  - This can mean 1) physically cutting their male organs so as to become eunuchs or 2) spiritually cutting themselves off from God's people.
