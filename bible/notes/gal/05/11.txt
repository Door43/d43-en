===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 11 But, my fellow believers, maybe someone is saying that I still teach that you must let them circumcise you. I certainly taught that before I followed Christ, but I am not teaching that any longer. But what they are saying cannot be true; otherwise, no one would be persecuting me now. No, I tell you that if people think they have to be circumcised to follow Christ, then the fact that Christ died on the cross no longer make any difference to them. \v 12 I wish that those who are confusing you would go all the way and castrate themselves!

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 11 Brothers, if I still proclaim circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross would be destroyed. \v 12 I wish that those who mislead you would go ahead and also castrate themselves. </usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Brothers, if I still proclaim circumcision, why am I still persecuted**  - "But as for me, brothers, if I still taught that men must be circumcised to be saved, they would no longer be persecuting me." Paul is strongly claiming that he ("as for me"), unlike those he mentions in the previous verses, is not telling the Galatians to become circumcised.
  * **Brothers**  - "Brothers and sisters." If your language can include males and females in one word, use it.
  * **Circumcision destroys the stumbling block of the cross**  - "Stumbling block," something that makes people fall, is a metaphor here for Paul's message that God saves people who trust Jesus, even if they do not follow the Law of Moses. "Teaching that circumcision is necessary would make my preaching about Jesus' death on cross no longer offensive to Jews."
  * **you**  - plural
  * **castrate themselves**  - This can mean 1) physically cutting their male organs so as to become eunuchs or 2) spiritually cutting themselves off from God's people.
