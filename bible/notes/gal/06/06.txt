===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 If fellow believers teach you the truth about God, then you should share your possessions with them.
\v 7 You should not deceive yourselves. Remember that no one can deceive God. Just like a farmer will harvest exactly the kind of crop that he plants, God will pay back people according to what they have done.
\v 8 God will punish eternally those who commit the sins that they wish to. But those who please God's Spirit will live forever with God because of what God's Spirit does for them.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 6 The one who is taught the word must share all good things with the one who teaches.
\v 7 Do not be deceived. God is not mocked, for whatever a man plants, that he will also gather in.
\v 8 For he who plants seed to his own sinful nature, from the sinful nature will gather in destruction. The one who plants seed to the Spirit, from the Spirit will gather in eternal life from the Spirit.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The one** - "The person"
  * **word** - Here this means everything God has said or commanded, as in "the word of God" or "the word of truth."
  * **for whatever a man plants, that he will also gather in** - Planting represents doing things that end in some kind of result, and gathering in represents experiencing the results of what one has done. AT: "for just as a farmer gathers in the fruit of whatever kind of seeds he plants, so everyone experiences the results of whatever he does" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **man ... his** - Paul is not specifying males here. "person ... that person"
  * **plants seed to his own flesh** - The word "flesh" is a metonym that represents a person's sinful nature. AT: "plants seed according to what his sinful nature wants" or "does the things his sinful nature wants to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **will gather in destruction** - "will receive punishment for what his sinful flesh did" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **plants seed to the Spirit** - "does the things God's Spirit loves" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **will gather in eternal life from the Spirit** - "will receive eternal life as a reward from God's Spirit"
