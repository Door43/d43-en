===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 If fellow believers teach you the truth about God, then you should share your possessions with them.
\v 7 You should not deceive yourselves. Remember that no one can deceive God. Just like a farmer will harvest exactly the kind of crop that he plants, God will pay back people according to what they have done.
\v 8 God will punish eternally those who commit the sins that they wish to. But those who please God's Spirit will live forever with God because of what God's Spirit does for them.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 6 The one who is taught the word must share all good things with the one who teaches.
\v 7 Do not be deceived. God is not mocked, for whatever a man plants, that he will also gather in.
\v 8 For he who plants seed to his own sinful nature, from the sinful nature will gather in destruction. The one who plants seed to the Spirit, from the Spirit will gather in eternal life from the Spirit.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The one** - "The person"
  * **word** - Here this means everything God has said or commanded, as in "the word of God" or "the word of truth."
  * **for whatever a man plants, that he will also gather in** - Planting represents doing things that end in some kind of result, and gathering in represents experiencing the results of what one has done. AT: "for just as a farmer gathers in the fruit of whatever kind of seeds he plants, so everyone experiences the results of whatever he does" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **whatever a man plants** - Paul is not specifying males here. AT: "whatever a person plants" or "whatever someone plants" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_gendernotations]])
  * **plants seed to his own sinful nature** - Planting seeds is a metaphor for doing deeds that will have consequences later. In this case, the person is doing sinful actions because of his sinful nature. AT: "plants seed according to what he wants because of his sinful nature" or "does the things he wants to do because of his sinful nature" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **will gather in destruction** - God punishing the person is spoken of as if the person were harvesting a crop. AT: "will receive punishment for what he did" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **plants seed to the Spirit** - Planting seeds is a metaphor for doing deeds that will have consequences later. In this case, the person is doing good actions because he is listening to God's Spirit. AT: "does the things God's Spirit loves" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **will gather in eternal life from the Spirit** - "will receive eternal life as a reward from God's Spirit"
