====== Galatians 06 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Overall, this chapter serves as a conclusion to Paul's letter. It contains some concluding thoughts, that may not be as connected to the rest of the material contained in the letter but some other issues that Paul wished to address in the church in Galatia. 

== Brothers ==
This chapter is addressed to Christians and this should be seen as a reference to Paul's Christian and not his Jewish brothers.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== New Creation ==

This is a concept related to being [[:en:obe:kt:bornagain|born again]]. Those who are born again are said to be a new creation in Christ. To Paul, this is more significant that a person's ancestry. It also is related to the idea that the Christian has been given new life in Christ and have a new nature in them after they come to faith in Christ. 


=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Flesh ==

This is a complex issue and it is possible that “flesh” is still a subject used in distinction to the "spirit." The person of the flesh is controlled by their sinful desires while the spiritual is controlled by the Spirit. Flesh is also use to refer to the physical body in this chapter.
