<usfm>
\v 1 My fellow believers, if you discover that a brother or sister is doing wrong, those of you whom God's Spirit is directing should gently correct that person. Furthermore, as you correct another person, you should be very careful so that you do not sin either.
\v 2 When there are brothers or sisters who have problems, you should help each other. By doing that, you will do what Christ commands.
</usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **if a man **- "if someone" or "if anyone among you(plural)"
  * **is caught in some transgression **- This can mean that 1) someone found that person in the act, "is discovered in an act of sin," or 2) that person committed the sin without intending to do evil, "gave in and sinned."
  * **you who are spiritual **- "those of you(plural) who are guided by the Spirit" or "you(plural) who are living in the guidance of the Spirit"
  * **restore that person**  - "correct the person who sinned" or "exhort the person who sinned to return to the correct path" or to a correct relationship with God
  * **in a spirit of gentleness**  - This can mean that the Spirit is directing the one offering correction (see UDB) or 2) "with an attitude of gentleness" or "in a kind way."
  * **Look out for yourself … you may not be tempted**  - These words treat the Galatians as though they are all one person to emphasize that he is talking to each of them. AT: "yourselves … you(plural)" (see UDB) or "I say to each one of you, 'Look out for yourself ….'"
  * **so you may not be tempted **- "for fear that you should be tempted to sin too" or "in order that you should not be tempted to sin." If you need to use active voice, it would be best not to mention "Satan" or "the devil," since they are not mentioned anywhere in this letter. AT: "so that the tempter does not tempt you." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
