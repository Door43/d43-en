<usfm>
\v 1 My fellow believers, if you discover that a brother or sister is doing wrong, those of you whom God's Spirit is directing should gently correct that person. Furthermore, as you correct another person, you should be very careful so that you do not sin either.
\v 2 When there are brothers or sisters who have problems, you should help each other. By doing that, you will do what Christ commands.
</usfm>

\v 1 Brothers, if someone is caught in any trespass, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Be concerned about yourself, so you also may not be tempted.
\v 2 Carry one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.
