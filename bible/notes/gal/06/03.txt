====== Galatians 06:3-5 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Keep in mind that those who \add refuse to help others because they think that they are more important than other people, although they are\add* not really more important, are deceiving themselves.
\v 4 Instead, each \add of you\add* should \add constantly\add* test\f + \ft Or: judge \f* \add and decide if you can approve what you yourself are doing and thinking\add*. Then you can boast because of what you yourself \add are doing and thinking\add*, and not because what you are doing is superior to what other persons \add are doing\add*.
\v 5 Keep in mind that you must each perform your own \add individual\add* tasks.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 I say this because people who think more highly of themselves than they should merely fool themselves.
\v 4 Instead, each of you should constantly test and decide if you can approve what you yourself are doing and thinking. If you can, then you can be proud of what you yourself have done, and not because what you have done is bettewr than what anyone else has done.
\v 5 I say this because you must each perform your own individual tasks.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.
\v 4 Each one should examine his own work, and then he will have something in himself alone to be proud of, without comparing himself to anyone else.
\v 5 For each one will carry his own load.
