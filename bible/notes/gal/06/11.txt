====== Galatians 06:11-13 ======

<usfm>
\v 11 I am now writing this last part of this letter to you in my own handwriting. Notice the large letters with which I am now writing. I am doing this in order that I might emphasize this:
\v 12 Some Jewish believers are trying to force you to perform certain rituals so that other Jews will think highly of them. They are insisting that you be circumcised \f + \ft Or:that someone must circumcise you \f*. They are doing that only in order that other Jews would no longer persecute them\f + \ft Or: cause them to suffer \f* for proclaiming that God will save us because of our trusting in what Christ accomplished when he died on the cross \f + \ft metonymy, metaphor \f*.
\v 13 The reason that I say that is that the ones who are insisting that you be circumcised \f + \ft Or:that someone circumcise you \f* do not themselves fully obey the laws that God gave to Moses. Instead, they desire that you let someone circumcise you in order that they might boast to those Jews who would persecute them\f + \ft Or: cause them to suffer \f* that you did that because they insisted \f + \ft metonymy \f* that you do it.

\v 11 I am now writing this last part of this letter to you in my own handwriting. Notice the large letters with which I am now writing.
\v 12 Some Jewish believers want to circumcise you so that the other Jews will think highly of them for making converts to Judaism. But they are doing this just so that the others will not persecute them for believing that Christ died on the cross to save us.
\v 13 The reason that I say this is that not even those people keep the Law of God; instead, they want to circumcise you so they can boast that they have made more converts to the Jewish faith.

\v 11 See what large letters I write to you in my own handwriting.
\v 12 Those who want to make a good impression in the flesh compel you to be circumcised, only so that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.
\v 13 For not even those who are circumcised themselves keep the law, but they want you to be circumcised that they may boast in your flesh.
