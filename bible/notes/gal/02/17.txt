====== Galatians 02:17-19 ======

\v 17 Furthermore, because we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f* Jews\add* desired that \add God\add* would erase the record of our sins because of our relationship with Christ, \add it means that\add* we realized that we ourselves were sinners \add like non-Jews, whom we called\add* sinners, \add because we\f + \ft exclusive \f* also were not obeying the Jewish rituals and laws\add*. \add But\add* \add we\f + \ft inclusive \f* certainly cannot conclude\add* that it is Christ who causes us to sin.\f + \ft Or: \add should we conclude\add* that it is Christ who causes us to sin? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add No, Christ\add* certainly does not \add cause anyone to sin\add*.
\p
\v 18 So if I should again believe \add that God would erase the record of my sins because of my obeying the laws that he gave to Moses\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add I would be like a man who\add* rebuilds an old building that he tore down. It would \add soon\add* be clear that I am one who disobeys those same laws \add that God gave to Moses\add*.
\v 19 When \add I realized that I could not earn God's favor\add* by \add obeying\add* the laws \add that he gave to Moses, I decided not\add* to \add respond to what those laws demanded\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add just like\add* a dead person \add does not respond to anything\add*. Now I live to \add honor\f + \ft Or: serve \f*\add* God.

\v 17 But when we asked God to make us right in his sight by trusting in Christ, we stopped trying to obey the Law, so the Law proved us to be sinners for doing that. But this certainly does not mean that Christ is in favor of sin. Certainly not!

\p
\v 18 If I again believed that God would make me right in his sight because I obey his Law, I would be like a man who rebuilds a shaky old building that he had once torn down. Everyone would see that I was breaking God's Law.
\v 19 As I was trying to obey God's Law, I became like a dead man; it was as if the Law had killed me. This happened so that I might live to worship God.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 But if when we seek God to justify us in Christ we also find ourselves to be sinners, does Christ become a servant of sin? Absolutely not!

\v 18 For if I build back up my reliance on keeping the law again, a reliance that I had torn down, I show myself to be a law breaker.
\v 19 Through the law I died to the law, so that I might live for God.
