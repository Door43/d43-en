Now Christ \add is directing how\add* I\add behave. And whatever I do\add* now while I live, I do it trusting in God's Son. He is the one who loved me and offered himself \add as a sacrifice\add* for me.
\v 21 I am not rejecting \add as useless\add* what God \add did for me\add* \add kindly\f + \ft Or: that I did not deserve\add* \f*, \add as my opponents are doing. I fully accept that God saved me by acting kindly towards me\add*. If it is because people \add obey the\add* laws \add that God gave to Moses\add* that God erases the record of their sins, then Christ died for nothing\f + \ft Or: needlessly \f*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 It is as though my old way of life ended when Christ died on the cross. I no longer direct my life. Christ who lives in my heart now directs how I live. And whatever I do now while I live, I do it trusting in God's Son. He is the one who loved me and offered himself as the sacrifice to provide God's forgiveness to me.
\v 21 I do not set aside God's kindness, as if keeping the Law could make us right with God. Otherwise, Christ would have died on the cross for nothing.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me, and the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.
\v 21 I do not negate the grace of God, for if righteousness existed through the law, then Christ would have died for nothing.
