====== Galatians 02:6-8 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 The \add leaders in Jerusalem\add*, whom your new teachers respect, did not add anything to what I preach. \add And I would add that\add* what status those leaders had did not influence me, because God does not favor certain\f + \ft Or: important \f* persons \f + \ft idiom \f* more than others.
\v 7 Instead of those leaders adding to the message that I tell people, they understood that I had been given the good message \f + \ft Or:God had given the good message to me \f* so that I might proclaim it to the non-Jews \f + \ft metonymy \f*, just like \add God\add* had given the good message to Peter so that he might tell it to those who are Jews \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 8 That is, just like \add God\add* had empowered\f + \ft Or: authorized \f* Peter in order that he might be an apostle \add to bring God's message\add* to the Jews \f + \ft metonymy \f*, he also had empowered\f + \ft Or: authorized \f* me in order that I might be an apostle to \add bring his message to\add* the non-Jews.

\v 6 But the leaders in Jerusalem did not add anything to what I proclaim. Those leaders are important men, but they do not matter to me, because God does not favor certain persons more than others.
\v 7 Instead, the leaders understood that God was trusting me to proclaim the good news to the non-Jews, just as Peter was proclaiming the good news to the Jews.
\v 8 That is, just as God had empowered Peter to go as an apostle to take God's message to the Jews, he also empowered me to go as an apostle to take his message to the non-Jews.

\v 6 But those who others said were the leaders  contributed nothing to me. Whatever they were does not matter to me. God does not accept man’s favorites.
\v 7 Instead, they saw that I had been entrusted to proclaim the gospel to those who are uncircumcised, just as Peter was to proclaim the gospel to those who are circumcised,
\v 8 for God, who worked in Peter for the apostleship to those who are circumcised also worked in me to the Gentiles.
