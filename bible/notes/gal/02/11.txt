\v 11 But later while I was in the city of Antioch, after Peter came there, I looked into his eyes and told him that what he was doing was wrong.
\v 12 This is what happened. Peter went to Antioch and started eating regularly with non-Jewish believers there. Later there were certain Jewish believers who came to Antioch who claimed that James, the leader of the believers in Jerusalem, had sent them. And when those men came, Peter stopped eating with the non-Jewish believers and would not associate with them. He was afraid that the Jewish believers from Jerusalem would criticize him for associating with non-Jews.

\v 11 Now when Cephas came to Antioch I resisted him to his face because he was wrong.
\v 12 Before certain men came from James, Cephas was eating together with the Gentiles. But when these men came, he stopped and kept away  from the Gentiles, in fear of these men who have been circumcised.
