\v 3 But \add even though the leaders of the believers usually insisted that when non-Jews trusted in Christ someone must circumcise them\add*, they did not even insist that Titus be circumcised, even though he was a Greek man who was with me.
\v 4 \add I talked to them privately\add* because some people \add successfully\add* pretended that they were fellow believers and associated with the true believers. They did that in order that they might observe closely what we do because we are free \add from having to obey all the Jewish laws and rituals\add* because of our close relationship with Christ Jesus \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Those people wanted to make us \add like\add* slaves \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add of those rituals by convincing us that we cannot trust Christ solely but that we must also obey all the Jewish rituals\add*.
\v 5 But not even briefly did we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* do what they wanted \add about circumcision. We\f + \ft exclusive \f* resisted them\add* in order that the truth of the message about Christ might continue to \add benefit\add* you.

\v 3 But those leaders did not even require Titus, who was with me and was an uncircumcised Gentile, to be circumcised.
\v 4 The people who would have required him to be circumcised were not true believers, but they pretended that they were fellow believers. They watched us closely to see how we obey God without following all the Jewish laws and rituals, since we know that Christ Jesus has freed us from those things. These false believers would like to make us like slaves to the law.
\v 5 But not even briefly did we agree with them about circumcision. We resisted them in order that the true good news about Christ might continue to benefit you.

\v 3 But not even Titus, who was with me and who was a Greek, was forced to be circumcised.
\v 4 The false brothers came in secretly to spy on the liberty we have in Christ Jesus. They desired to make us slaves,
\v 5 but we did not yield in submission to them for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel would remain with you.
