====== Galatians 02 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter continues the discussion of Paul's qualifications that began in [[:en:bible:notes:gal:01:11|1:11]].

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Freedom and slavery ==

These two concepts are used in contrast to each other. The Christian has freedom in Christ to be able to do many different things, but the Christian who attempts to follow the Law of Moses]], even one point, is under obligation to follow the whole of the law. This attempt to follow the law, enslaves the Christians to have to follow it all. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|Law of Moses]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "I do not negate the grace of God" ==

Paul teaches that if a Christian attempts to follow the law of Moses, they fail to understand the grace God has \ shown to them. This is a fundamental error, but Paul uses this statement as a type of [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo|hypothetical situation]]. The purpose of this statement could be seen as, "if you could be saved by following the law, then it would negate the grace of God." (See: [[:en:obe:kt:grace|Grace]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo|hypothetical situation]])
