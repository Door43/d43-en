\v 13 Also, the other Jewish \add believers who were in Antioch\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* acted insincerely\f + \ft Or: in a way that they knew was not right \f* along with \add Peter\add*. The result was that they convinced even Barnabas to \add stop associating with the non-Jewish believers!\add*
\v 14 But when I realized that they were not acting according to the truth of the message about Christ, \add when\add* all \add the fellow believers there\add* were present, I told Peter \add the following\add*: "Although you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* are a Jew, \add you often conduct yourself\add* like non-Jews \add do by disregarding Jewish laws about food. When you are among non-Jews\add*, you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* do not customarily conduct yourself at all like Jews \add do\add*. So, now it is wrong that you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* are causing non-Jews \add to think that they must obey all\add* the Jewish rituals and customs!\f + \ft Or: why are you\add ( singular )\add* causing non-Jews \add to think that they must obey all\add* the Jewish rituals and customs? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*"

\v 13 Also, the other Jewish believers in Antioch joined in Peter's hypocrisy  by separating themselves from the non-Jewish believers. Even Barnabas thought he had to stop associating with the non-Jews!
\v 14 But when I realized that they were not following the truth of the good news about Christ, and when all the fellow believers had come together, I said to Peter in front of them all, "You are Jewish, but you have been living like a non-Jew who does not follow the Law. So how can you possibly persuade the non-Jews to live like Jews?"

\v 13 Also the rest of the Jews joined in this hypocrisy with Cephas, so that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy.
\v 14 But, when I saw that they were not following the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in front of all of them, "If you are Jewish but are living in the Gentile manner instead of in the Jewish manner, how can you force the Gentiles to live like Jews?"
