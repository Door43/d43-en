\v 15 Some of us \add believers\add* were born as Jews. We\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* were \bd not born as non-Jews.\bd* \add We Jews have always considered non-Jews to be\add* \bd 'sinners'\bd* \add because they do not obey the Jewish rituals and laws\add*.
\v 16 But we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* now know that it is not because some person obeys the laws \add that God gave to Moses\add* that \add God\add* erases the record of that person's sins. \add God erases the record of a person's sins only if that person trusts in what Jesus Christ has done\add*. Even we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* Jews trusted \bd Christ Jesus.\bd* We\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* did that in order that \add God\add* would erase the record of our sins because of our trusting Christ, and not because of our obeying the laws \add that God gave to Moses.

\v 15 We were born as Jews, not as non-Jewish sinners who know nothing about God's law.
\v 16 But we now know that it is not because a person obeys the law that God gave to Moses that God makes a person right in his sight. God does that only if that person trusts in Jesus Christ. Even some of us Jews have trusted Christ Jesus. We did that so God would declare us good in his sight, because we trust Christ, and not because we try to obey the law that God gave to Moses. God has said that he will not declare anyone good in his sight just because they obey the law.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 We ourselves are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners;
\v 16 yet we know that no person is justified by the works of the law but through faith in Christ Jesus. We also came to faith in Christ Jesus so that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law. For by the works of the law no flesh will be justified.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul tells the believers that Jews who know the law, as well as Gentiles who do not know the law, are saved only by faith in Christ and not by keeping the law.

  * **not Gentile sinners** - "not those whom the Jews call Gentile sinners"
  * **We also came to faith in Christ Jesus** - "We believed in Christ Jesus" 
  * **we** - This probably refers to Paul and others but not to the Galatians. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **no flesh** - The word "flesh" is a synecdoche for the whole person. AT: "no person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
