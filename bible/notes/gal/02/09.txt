\v 9 Those leaders understood that God had kindly given to me this special mission. So James, Peter, and John, the leaders of the believers in Christ, leaders who many people knew and honored, shook hands with us because we were fellow-workers with them. We agree that God had sent us to the non-Jews, who were not circumcised, and that God had sent them to Jews, who were circumcised.
\v 10 They only urged us to still remember to help the poor among the fellow believers who live in Jerusalem. That is exactly what I have been eager to do.

\v 9 When they realized the grace that had been given to me, James, Cephas, and John, who are recognized as leaders, gave to Barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship, so that we should go to the Gentiles and they to those who are circumcised.
\v 10 They also wanted us to remember the poor, the very thing I was also eager to do.
