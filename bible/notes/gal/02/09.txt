\v 9 And \add those leaders\add* knew that God had kindly given to me this special work. So James, Peter, and John, the ones whom your new teachers \add respect because they are\add* leaders \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add of the believers\add*, shook hands with us \f + \ft idiom \f* \add to show that they agreed that Barnabas and I are serving the Lord just like they are, and that we are preaching the same message that they are preaching\add*. They also agreed that we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* are the ones whom God was sending to \add tell his message to\add* non-Jews, but that God is sending them to \add tell his message to\add* Jews \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 10 They merely urged that we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* still remember to help the poor \add fellow believers who live in Jerusalem\add*. That is exactly what I have been eager to do.

\v 9 Those leaders understood that God had kindly given to me this special mission. So James, Peter, and John, the leaders of the believers in Christ, leaders who many people knew and honored, shook hands with us because we were fellow workers with them. We agree that God had sent us to the non-Jews, who were not circumcised, and that God had sent them to Jews, who were circumcised.
\v 10 They only urged us to still remember to help the poor among the fellow believers who live in Jerusalem. That is exactly what I have been eager to do.

\v 9 When they realized the grace that had been given to me, James, Cephas, and John, who are recognized as leaders, gave to Barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship, so that we should go to the Gentiles and they to those who are circumcised.
\v 10 They also wanted us to remember the poor, the very thing I was also eager to do.
