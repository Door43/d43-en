\v 1 Now, I will further discuss children and heirs. An heir is a son who will later possess all that his father has. But as long as that heir is a child, he is like a slave whom others control.
\v 2 Until the day that his father has previously determined, other persons supervise the child and manage his property.

\v 1 I am saying that as long as the heir is a child, he is no different than a slave, even though he is owner of the whole estate.
\v 2 Instead, he is under guardians and trustees until the time set by his father.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul continues to remind the Galatian believers that Christ came to redeem those that were under the law, and he made them no more slaves but sons.

  * **as long as the heir is a child, he is no different than a slave, even though he is owner of the whole estate** - While the father is alive, the heir must obey the father. When the father dies, the heir must obey those whom the father has commanded to take care of the heir. Make sure your readers understand that "heir" is a metaphor for those to whom the living God will give everything. They should not think that God has died. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **no different than** - "the same as"
