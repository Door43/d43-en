\v 1 Now, I will further discuss children and heirs. An heir is a son who will later possess all that his father has. But as long as that heir is a child, he is like a slave whom others control.
\v 2 Until the day that his father has previously determined, other persons supervise the child and manage his property.

\v 1 I am saying that as long as the heir is a child he is no different than a slave, even though he is owner of the whole estate,
\v 2 but he is under guardians and trustees until the time set by his father.
