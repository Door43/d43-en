\v 3 Likewise, when we were like young children, we were under the evil rules that everyone in this world live by. Those rules controlled us like masters control their slaves.
\v 4 But when the time that God had determined arrived,  he sent Jesus, his Son, into the world. Jesus was born to a human mother, and he had to obey the Law.
\v 5 God sent Jesus to rescue us from the Law controlling us. He did this to adopt us as his own children.

\v 3 So also we, when we were children, we were held in bondage to the elemental principles of the universe.
\v 4 But when the right time came, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,
\v 5 that he might redeem those who were under the law, that we might experience adoption as sons.
