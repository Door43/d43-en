\v 6 Furthermore, we know that we are God's children because God sent the Spirit, who is intimately related to his Son, to live in our inner beings\f + \ft Or: hearts \f*. \add The Spirit enables us to\add* pray fervently, "Daddy, Father!" \add This shows that we are God's children\add*.
\v 7 So, \add because of what God has done\add*, no longer is \add each of\add* you \add like\add* a slave. Instead, \add each of you is\add* a child \add of God\add*. Furthermore, since \add each of you is God's\add* child, God has also made you one who will receive all that he has promised.

<usfm>
\v 6 Because you are now God's children, he sent the Spirit of his Son to live in each of us. It is his Spirit who enables us to call God, "Father, our dear Father!" This shows that we are God's children.
\v 7 So, because of what God has done, no longer is each of you like a slave. Instead, each of you is a child of God. Since each of you is now God's child, God will also give you all that he has promised. God himself will do it!

<usfm>
\v 6 Because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, who calls, "Abba, Father."
\v 7 For this reason you are no longer a slave but a son, and if you are a son, then you are also an heir through God.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, who calls, "Abba, Father."** - God the Father sent the Spirit of the Son of God into the hearts of his believers. Now they know God always loves them like a kind father loves his children. Translate these words for God clearly in your language.
  * **Abba**  - This is the way a young child would address his father in Paul's home language, but not in the language of the Galatian readers. To keep the sense of a foreign language, translate this as a word that sounds as much like "Abba" as your language allows.
  * **sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts**  - AT: "sent his Son's Spirit to show us how to think and act"
  * **who calls**  - the Spirit is the one who calls
  * **sons … son … son**  - Paul uses the word for male child here because the subject is inheritance. In his culture and that of his readers, inheritance passed most commonly, but not always, to male children. He was neither specifying nor excluding female children here.
