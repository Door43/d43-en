\v 6 Furthermore, we know that we are God's children because God sent the Spirit, who is intimately related to his Son, to live in our inner beings\f + \ft Or: hearts \f*. \add The Spirit enables us to\add* pray fervently, "Daddy, Father!" \add This shows that we are God's children\add*.
\v 7 So, \add because of what God has done\add*, no longer is \add each of\add* you \add like\add* a slave. Instead, \add each of you is\add* a child \add of God\add*. Furthermore, since \add each of you is God's\add* child, God has also made you one who will receive all that he has promised.

\v 6 Because you are now God's sons, he sent the Spirit of his Son to live in each of us. It is his Spirit who enables us to call God, "Father, our dear Father!" This shows that we are God's sons.
\v 7 So, because of what God has done, no longer is each of you like a slave. Instead, each of you is a child of God. Since each of you is now God's child, God will also give you all that he has promised. God himself will do it!

<usfm>
\v 6 And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, who calls out, "Abba, Father."
\v 7 So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then you are also an heir through God.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **you are sons ... you are no longer a slave, but a son** - Paul uses the word for male child here because the subject is inheritance. In his culture and that of his readers, inheritance passed most commonly, but not always, to male children. He was neither specifying nor excluding female children here.
  * **God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, who calls out, "Abba, Father."** - By calling out "Abba, Father" the Spirit assures us that we are God's children and he loves us.
  * **sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts** - The heart is metonym for the part of a person that thinks and feels. AT: "sent his Son's Spirit to show us how to think and act" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **his Son** - This is an important title for Jesus, the Son of God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **who calls** - The Spirit is the one who calls.
  * **Abba, Father** - This is the way a young child would address his father in Paul's home language, but not in the language of the Galatian readers. To keep the sense of a foreign language, translate this as a word that sounds as much like "Abba" as your language allows.
  * **you are no longer a slave ... you are also an heir** - Paul is addressing his readers as though they are one person, so "you" here is singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **heir** - The people to whom God has made promises are spoken of as if they were to inherit property and wealth from a family member. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
