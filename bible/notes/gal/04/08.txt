\v 8 When you did not know God, you worshiped gods that really did not really exist. You were their slaves.
\v 9 But now you do know God as your God. Perhaps it would be better, however,  to say that now God knows  each of you.  So why are you returning again to follow the weak and worthless evil rules of this world?  You do not really want to become their slaves all over again, do you?

\v 8 Yet before, when you did not know God, you were slaves to the ones who are by nature not gods at all.
\v 9 But now that you do know God, or rather, now that you are known by God, why are you returning again to weak and worthless elemental principles? Do you want to be slaves all over again?
