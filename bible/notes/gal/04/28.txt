<usfm>
\v 28 Now, \add my\add* fellow believers, you have become children \add of God as a result of believing God's\add* promise to us, as Isaac \add was born as a result of Abraham believing what God promised to him\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\p
\v 29 \add Also, long ago Abraham's son\add* Ishmael, the one who was conceived naturally, caused trouble for \add Abraham's son\add* Isaac, who \add was conceived\add* supernaturally \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Similarly, now \add those who think that we must obey the laws that God gave Moses in order that God will save us are causing trouble for those who are trusting Abraham's descendant, Christ\add*.

<usfm>
\v 28 Now, my fellow believers, you have become children of God because you believed in what God promised to give to us. You are like Isaac, who was born because Abraham had believed in what God promised to give to him.
\v 29 But long ago Abraham's son Ishmael, who was born naturally, caused trouble for Abraham's son Isaac, who was born because the Holy Spirit made it happen. It is the same way now the people who are slaves to God's law persecute those of us who trust in what Christ has promised to give us.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise.
\v 29 At that time the one who was born according to the flesh persecuted the one who had been born according to the Spirit. It is the same now.

===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **brothers** - Here this means fellow Christians, including both men and women, since all believers in Christ are members of one spiritual family, with God as their heavenly Father.
  * **according to the flesh** - This refers to Abraham becoming Ishmael's father by taking Hagar as a wife. AT: "by means of human action" or "because of what people did" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **according to the Spirit** - AT: "because of something the Spirit did"
