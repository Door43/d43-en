====== Galatians 04:28-29 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 Now, \add my\add* fellow believers, you have become children \add of God as a result of believing God's\add* promise to us, as Isaac \add was born as a result of Abraham believing what God promised to him\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\p
\v 29 \add Also, long ago Abraham's son\add* Ishmael, the one who was conceived naturally, caused trouble for \add Abraham's son\add* Isaac, who \add was conceived\add* supernaturally \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Similarly, now \add those who think that we must obey the laws that God gave Moses in order that God will save us are causing trouble for those who are trusting Abraham's descendant, Christ\add*.

<usfm>
\v 28 Now, my fellow believers, you have become children of God because you believed in what God promised to give to us. You are like Isaac, who was born because Abraham had believed in what God promised to give to him.
\v 29 But long ago Abraham's son Ishmael, who was born naturally, caused trouble for Abraham's son Isaac, who was born because the Holy Spirit made it happen. It is the same way now. The people who are slaves to God's law persecute those of us who trust in what Christ has promised to give us.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 But you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise.
\v 29 At that time the one who was born according to the flesh persecuted the one born according to the Spirit. It is the same now.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **brothers** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gal:01:01|1:2]].
  * **children of promise** - Possible meanings are that the Galatians have become God's children 1) by believing God's promise or 2) because God worked miracles to fulfill his promises to Abraham, first by giving Abraham a son and then by making the Galatians children of Abraham and thus sons of God.
  * **according to the flesh** - This refers to Abraham's becoming Ishmael's father by taking Hagar as a wife. AT: "by means of human action" or "because of what people did" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **according to the Spirit** - "because of something the Spirit did"
