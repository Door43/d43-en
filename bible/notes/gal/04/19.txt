===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **I am suffering labor pains for you again, until Christ will have been formed in you**  - Just as a pregnant woman is in pain when her baby is being born, Paul will be concerned about the Galatians until they are like Christ. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
