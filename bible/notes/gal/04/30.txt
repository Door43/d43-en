\v 30 But these are \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* the words in the Scriptures \f + \ft personification \f*: "The son of the \add woman\add* who was not a slave will inherit \add what his father has\add*. The female slave's son will certainly not inherit those things. So send away from \add this place\add* the female slave and her son \f + \ft metaphor \f*!" \add That means that you should certainly expel from your groups those who insist that we obey all the laws God gave Moses\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 31 \add My\add* fellow believers, \add Hagar symbolizes the laws that God gave to Moses. But we are not those who must obey all the laws that God gave to Moses\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add So\add* we are not \add the\add* female slave \add Hagar's spiritual\add* descendants \f + \ft metaphor \f*. But \add Sarah's descendants are those who were born as a result of believing what God promised to Abraham. So we are\add* the \add spiritual\add* descendants of \add Sarah, the woman\add* who was not a slave \f + \ft metaphor \f*.

\v 30 But these are the words in the scriptures: "The son of the woman who was not a slave will inherit what his father owns. The slave boy will inherit nothing. So send away from this place the female slave and her son!"
\v 31 My fellow believers, we are not children who have a slave woman as our mother, but we are the children who are born from a woman who was free, and so are we are free too!

\v 30 But what does the scripture say? "Send away the slave girl and her son. For the son of the slave girl will not share in the inheritance with the son of the free woman."
\v 31 Therefore, brothers, we are not children of a slave girl, but of the free woman.
