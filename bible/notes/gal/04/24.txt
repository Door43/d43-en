====== Galatians 04:24-25 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 24 \add I am telling you this\add* as an illustration. These \add two women\add* symbolize two agreements. \add God made\add* the first \add agreement, which involved obeying the laws that God gave to Moses\add* at \add Sinai\add* Mountain. \add Because that agreement forces those who accept it to keep obeying all its rules\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add it is like a slave mother who\add* gives birth to slaves. \add So\add* Hagar, \add the female slave, symbolizes\add* this \add agreement\add*.
\v 25 Also, the \add word\add* 'Hagar' is \add associated with\add* Sinai Mountain, \add which is\add* in Arabia \add land. Hagar, the female slave, also\add* represents Jerusalem \add city\add* as it is today. Jerusalem \add city\add* is \add like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a slave \add mother, and those who live there\add* \f + \ft personification \f* \add are like\add* her slave children \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add because they all must obey the laws that God gave to Moses\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 24 Now these two women symbolize two covenants. God made the first covenant with the people of Israel at Mount Sinai. That covenant requires the Israelites to live like a slave to the Law. So Hagar, the female slave, symbolizes this covenant.
\v 25 So Hagar symbolizes Mount Sinai, in the land of Arabia. But Hagar also symbolizes the city of Jerusalem as it is today. This is because Jerusalem is like a slave mother; she and all her children, that is, her people, are like slaves,  because they all must obey the Law that God gave to Israel at Mount Sinai.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 24 These things can be explained allegorically. For these women are like two covenants, one from Mount Sinai who gives birth to bondage, which is Hagar.
\v 25 Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and symbolizes the present Jerusalem, for she is in bondage with her children.
