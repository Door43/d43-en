===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **carefully observe** - Paul is speaking of feasts and fasts. AT: "keep" or "celebrate" 
  * **labored over you** - "Labor" can refer to childbirth in some languages, but the word used for "labor" here is never used that way in the New Testament. AT: "worked hard to teach you about Jesus" 
  * **in vain** - AT: "with no effect" or "to no purpose"
  * **you** - plural (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
