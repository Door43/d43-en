\v 26 But there will be a \add new\add* Jerusalem in heaven \f + \ft metonymy \f*, and we \add who will go there\add* are free \add from having to obey Jewish laws\add*. We \add who belong to that city consider it to be\add* our mother \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add city because we are God's true children\add*.
\v 27 \add Our new city will have more people than those who live in Jerusalem now. It will be just like\add* Isaiah foretold about \add the people whom he expected would come back to Jerusalem from exile. He expected that they would be more numerous than those who\add* were taken into exile. He wrote:
\q \add You who live in Jerusalem, you will\add* rejoice! Now you have no children, like a barren \add woman\add* who does not give birth to \add children! But some day you will\add* shout \add with joy\add*, without restraint\f + \ft Or: as loudly as you can \f*, \add even though now you are few, like a woman who\add* cannot give birth \add to children, and you\add* feel deserted\add . You will be very happy\add* because \add you will have many children who will come to you. Those children will be\add* more than\add the children\add* any woman with a husband \add could have borne\add*.

\v 26 But there is a new Jerusalem in heaven, and that city is like a mother of all us who believe in Christ, and that city is free!
\v 27 That new Jerusalem will have many more people than the old Jerusalem. This is because the prophet Isaiah wrote, 
\q "You who live in Jerusalem, you must rejoice! 
\q Now you have no children, 
\q2 like a woman who cannot have children! 
\q But one day you will shout with joy 
\q2 even though you have no children now. 
\q Like a woman who cannot give birth to children, 
\q2 and you feel deserted.
\q You will have more children than 
\q2 any woman with a husband could have borne."

\v 26 But the Jerusalem that is above is free, that is, our mother.
\v 27 For it is written,
\q "Rejoice, you barren woman, you who do not give birth;
\q Break out and shout for joy, you who do not experience child bearing;
\q For many are the children of the barren, more than those of her who has a husband."
