\v 21 Some of you desire \add to obey all the laws\add* that God gave Moses. \add I say that\add* you \add should\add* consider \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add the implications of what Moses wrote in\add* the Scriptures.
\v 22 \add He\add* wrote that Abraham became the father of two sons. His female slave, \add Hagar\add*, bore one son, and his \add wife Sarah\add*, who was not a slave, bore the other.
\v 23 Also, \add the sons differed. Ishmael\add*, the \add son born by\add* the female slave, was conceived naturally. But \add Isaac\add*, the \add son born by\add* his wife who was not a slave, was conceived \add miraculously\add* as a result of what \add God\add* had promised \add Abraham\add*.

\v 21 Let me try to explain this again. Some of you desire to obey all the law of God, but do you really pay attention to what the law says?
\v 22 In the law we read that Abraham became the father of two sons. His female slave, Hagar, bore one son, and his wife Sarah, who was not a slave, bore the other.
\v 23 Ishmael, the son born by Hagar, the female slave, was conceived naturally. But Isaac, the son born by Sarah, who was not a slave, was conceived miraculously because God had promised Abraham that he would have a son.

\p
\v 21 Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not listen to the law?
\v 22 For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave girl and one by the free woman.
\v 23 But the one was born by the slave girl according to the flesh, but the other was born by the free woman through promise.
