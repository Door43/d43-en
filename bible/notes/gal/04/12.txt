====== Galatians 04:12-14 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 My fellow believers, I strongly urge you that you do as I do. \add Stop thinking that you have to obey Jewish rules and rituals\f + \ft Or: ceremonial laws\add* \f*. \add When I was with you\add*, I \add did not obey all the Jewish rules and rituals\add*, just like you \add did not obey them\add*.
\p \add At that time\add* you treated me entirely as you should have \f + \ft litotes \f*.
\v 13 You know that the first time I told the good message to you, \add I went to your area to regain my health, because I was physically weak\add*.
\v 14 \add Although\add* you might have \add despised me because\add* I was physically weak, you did not despise me or act contemptuously\f + \ft Or: disrespectfully \f* toward me. Instead, you welcomed me like \add you would welcome\add* an angel from God. \add You welcomed me\add* like \add you would welcome\add* Christ Jesus!

\v 12 My fellow believers, I strongly urge you to become like me, because I do not let the Law control me.  I became like you non-Jews when I became free from the Law, so you too should free yourselves from the gods. When I first went to you, you did not harm me at all, but now you are making me worry about you very much. 
\p
\v 13 You remember that the first time I told you the Good News, I did it because I was sick.
\v 14 Although you might have despised me because I was sick, you did not reject me. Instead, you welcomed me like you would welcome an angel that came from God. You welcomed me like you would welcome Christ Jesus himself!

\p
\v 12 I beg you, brothers, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. You did me no wrong,
\v 13 but you know that it was because of a weakness of the flesh that I proclaimed the gospel to you the first time.
\v 14 What was a trial to you in my flesh you did not despise or reject, but instead you received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus.
