<usfm>
\v 3 I pray that God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ will kindly help you and give you peace.
\v 4 Christ sacrificed himself to God for our sins, in order to take us away from this world in which people act in such evil ways. He did this because God, our Father, wanted him to.
\v 5 Because that is true, let us now praise God forever and ever.
