\v 1-2 Dear brothers and sisters in the province of Galatia. I am Paul, the apostle. I am not an apostle because a group of people made me one or because God told anybody to make me one. Instead, I am an apostle because Jesus Christ and God the Father have sent me as one—yes, God the Father, who made Christ live again after he had died! I and all the fellow believers who are here with me greet you all in the churches in the province of Galatia.
