<usfm>
\v 1-2 I, Paul, am writing to my dear brothers and sisters in the province of Galatia. I am Paul, the apostle. No group of people made me an apostle, and God did not tell anybody to make me one. Instead, I am an apostle because Jesus Christ and God the Father have sent me as one—yes, God the Father, who made Christ live again after he had died! I and all the fellow believers who are here with me greet you all in the churches in the province of Galatia.

\c 1
\p
\v 1 This is Paul the apostle. I am not an apostle from men nor through a man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead.
\v 2 With all the brothers with me, I am writing to the churches of Galatia.
