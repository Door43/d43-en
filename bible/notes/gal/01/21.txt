\v 21 After I left Jerusalem, I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
\v 22 At that time believers in the Christian congregations who were in the province of Judea still had never seen me.
\v 23 They only heard others keep saying, "Paul, the one who in the past was doing violent things to us, is now proclaiming the same good news that we believe and he had been trying to stop!"
\v 24 So they kept praising God because of what had happened to me.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 21 Then I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
\v 22 I was still not personally known to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.
\v 23 They only heard it being said, "The man who once persecuted us is now proclaiming the faith he once tried to destroy."
\v 24 So they glorified God because of me.
