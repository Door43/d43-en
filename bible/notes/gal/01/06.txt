I am also disappointed that so soon you are believing a different \add message which some say is\add* "good news."
\v 7 Their message is not a true message. \add What is happening is that\add* certain persons are confusing your \add minds\add*. They are desiring to change the good message that Christ \add revealed\f + \ft Or: about\add* Christ \f* \add and are creating another message\add*.

\v 6 As you know, Christ called you in his kindness to trust in him. But now 
I am amazed that you have stopped trusting in him! Now you believe a different message, which some people say is the true good news about God.
\v 7 Christ never told us another good news, but other people are confusing you. They want to change the good news about Christ; they want you to believe that Christ actually said something different.
