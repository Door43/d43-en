\v 6 I am very disappointed \f + \ft irony \f* that so soon \add after you trusted in Christ\add* you have turned away from \add God\add*. He chose you in order that \add you might have what\add* Christ freely\f + \ft Or: kindly \f* gives. I am also disappointed that so soon you are believing a different \add message which some say is\add* "good news."
\v 7 Their message is not a true message. \add What is happening is that\add* certain persons are confusing your \add minds\add*. They are desiring to change the good message that Christ \add revealed\f + \ft Or: about\add* Christ \f* \add and are creating another message\add*.

\v 6 As you know, Christ called you in his kindness to trust in him. But now I am amazed that you have stopped trusting in him! Now you believe a different message, which some people say is the true good news about God.
\v 7 Christ never told us another good news, but other people are confusing you. They want to change the good news about Christ; they want you to believe that Christ actually said something different.

\p
\v 6 I am amazed that you are turning so quickly to a different gospel. I am amazed that you are turning away from him who called you by the grace of Christ.
\v 7 There is no other gospel, but there are some men who cause you trouble and want to distort the gospel of Christ.
