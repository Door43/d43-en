\v 11 For I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I proclaimed is not man's gospel.
\v 12 I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it. Instead, it was by revelation of Jesus Christ to me.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul explains that he did not learn the gospel from others; he learned it from Jesus Christ.

  * **brothers** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gal:01:01|1:2]].
  * **not man's gospel** - By using this phrase, Paul was not trying to say that Jesus Christ is not himself human. Because Christ is both man and God, however, he is not a sinful human being. Paul is writing about where the gospel came from; that it did not come from other sinful human beings, but it came from Jesus Christ.
  * **it was by revelation of Jesus Christ to me** - Possible meanings are 1) "Jesus Christ himself revealed the gospel to me" or 2) "God made me know the gospel when he showed me who Jesus Christ was."
