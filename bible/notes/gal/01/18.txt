\v 18 Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and I stayed with him fifteen days.
\v 19 But I saw none of the other apostles, except James the Lord's brother.
\v 20 Look, before God, in the things I write to you I do not lie.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Look, before God**  - Paul wants the Galatians to understand that Paul is completely serious and that he knows that God hears what he says and will judge him if he does not tell the truth.
  * **in the things I write to you I do not lie** - AT: "I am not lying to you in the messages I write to you"
