\v 14 I practiced the Jewish religion more thoroughly than many \add other Jews\add* who were my age practiced it. I much more enthusiastically tried to get others to obey the traditions that my ancestors \add kept\add*.

\v 13 People have told you about what I did in the past when I worshiped God in the Jewish way. I often did violent things to the groups of believers that God had established. I tried to destroy those believers and their groups.
\v 14 I honored God in the Jewish way more thoroughly than any other Jew my own age. I was very angry when I saw other Jews neglecting to obey the traditions that our ancestors had kept.

\v 13 You have heard about my former life in Judaism, how I was violently persecuting the church of God and devastating it.
