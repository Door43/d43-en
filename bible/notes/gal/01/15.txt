<usfm>
\v 15 Nevertheless, before I was born \add God\add* set me apart\f + \ft Or: selected me \f*. He chose me \add to live eternally\add*, something that I did not deserve.
\v 16 He wanted me to know that Jesus is his Son, so that I would tell others the message about his Son in regions where non-Jews live. But I did not immediately go to any human beings \f + \ft synecdoche \f* in order to gain \add an understanding of that message. I received it directly from Christ!\add*
\v 17 I did not \add immediately\add* leave Damascus and go to Jerusalem \add for that purpose\add* to those who were apostles before I was. Instead, I went away to Arabia \add region, a desert area\add*. Later I returned once more to Damascus \add city\add*.

\v 15 However, I was still in my mother's womb when God chose me to serve him, and he did this because it pleased him to do so.
\v 16 He showed me that Jesus is his Son; he did this so that I would tell others the good news about his Son in regions where the non-Jews live. But I did not immediately go to any mere humans in order to understand that message better.
\v 17  And I did not immediately leave Damascus and go to Jerusalem to see the apostles there, the men who had become apostles before I became one. Instead, I went away into the region of Arabia, a region of wilderness. Later I returned once more to the city of Damascus.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 But God was pleased to choose me from my mother’s womb, and he called me through his grace
\v 16 to reveal his Son in me, so that I would proclaim him among the Gentiles. I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood,
\v 17 nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who had  become apostles before me, but instead I went to Arabia and then returned to Damascus.
