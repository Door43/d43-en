====== Galatians 01:8-10 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 But even if we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f* apostles\add* or an angel from heaven would tell you a message that is different from the good message that we told you \add before\add*, I \add appeal to God\add* that \add he\add* punish such a person \add forever\add*.
\v 9 As I told you previously, so now I tell you this once more: Someone is telling you \add what he says is\add* a good message, but it is a message that is different from \add the good message\add* that I gave you. So I \add appeal to God\add* that \add he\add* severely punish that person.
\v 10 \add I said that\add* because \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* I do not desire that people approve me, \add contrary to what some have said about me\add*. It is God whom I desire to approve me. \add Specifically, I do not say and do\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* things just to please people. If it were still people whom I was trying to please, then I would not be one who \add willingly and completely\add* serves Christ.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 But even if we apostles or an angel from heaven should tell you a good news that is not the same as what we told you before, God should punish that person forever.
\v 9 As we have already told you, so now I say to you again that someone is telling you a form of the good news that he says is good, but it is not the same as what you believed. So I ask God that he condemn that person forever.
\v 10 I do not need people to like me, because it is God who approves of me. I am not trying to please people. If I were still trying to please people, then I would not really be serving Christ.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should proclaim to you a gospel other than the one we proclaimed to you, he should be cursed.
\v 9 As we have said before and now I say again, "If someone proclaims to you a gospel other than the one you accepted, he should be cursed."
\v 10 For am I now seeking the approval of men or God? Or am I seeking to please men? If I am still trying to please men, I am not a servant of Christ.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **should proclaim**  - "would proclaim" or "were to proclaim." This is describing something that has not happened and should not happen. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo|Hypothetical Situations]])
  * **other than the one**  - "different from the gospel" or "different from the message"
  * **he should be cursed**  - "God should punish that person who preached a false gospel forever" (see UDB). If your language has a common way of calling a curse down on someone, you should use that.
  * **For do I now want the approval of men or God? Or am I seeking to please men?**  - These rhetorical questions expect the answer "No." AT: "I do not seek the approval of men but instead I seek the approval of God. I am not seeking to please men." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **If I am still trying to please men, I am not a servant of Christ**  - Both the "if" phrase and the "then" phrase are contrary to fact. AT: "I am not still trying to please men; I am a servant of Christ" or "If I were still trying to please men, then I would not be a servant of Christ."
