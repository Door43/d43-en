\v 16 Turn your ear, O Yahweh, and listen. Open your eyes, O Yahweh, and see, and hear the words of Sennacherib, by which he has defied the living God.
\v 17 Truly, Yahweh, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands,
\v 18 and have cast their gods into the fire, for they were not gods but the work of men’s hands, just wood and stone. So the Assyrians have destroyed them.
