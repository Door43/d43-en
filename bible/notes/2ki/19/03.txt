\v 3 He said to them, "Tell this to Isaiah: King Hezekiah says that this is a day when we have great distress\f + \ft Or: trouble \f*. \add Other nations are causing\add* us to be insulted and disgraced. We are like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a woman who is about to give birth to a child, but she does not have the strength that she needs to do it.
\v 4 Perhaps Yahweh our God has heard everything that the official from Assyria said. Perhaps he knows that His boss\f + \ft Or: master \f*, the king of Assyria, sent him to insult the all-powerful God, and that Yahweh will rebuke\f + \ft Or: punish \f* him for what he said. And he requests that you pray for the few of us who are still alive \add here in Jerusalem\add*."

\v 3 He said to them to say these things to Isaiah: "King Hezekiah says that this is a day when we have great distress. Other nations are causing us to be insulted and disgraced like a woman who is about to give birth to a child, but she is not strong enough to do it.
\v 4 Perhaps Yahweh our God has heard everything that the official from Assyria said. Perhaps he knows that his master, the king of Assyria, sent him to insult the all-powerful God and that Yahweh will punish him for what he said. And Hezekiah requests that you pray for the few of us who are still alive here in Jerusalem."

\v 3 They said to him, "Hezekiah says, 'This day is a day of distress, rebuke, and disgrace, for the children have come to the time of birth, but there is no strength to for them to be born.
\v 4 It may be Yahweh your God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Yahweh your God has heard. Now lift up your prayer for the remnant that is still here.'"
