<usfm>
\v 23 The messengers that you sent made fun of me.
\p You said, 'With my many chariots I have gone to the highest mountains,
\p even to the highest mountains in Lebanon.
\p We have cut down its tallest cedar trees
\p and its nicest pine\f + \ft Or: cyprus \f* trees.
\p We have been to the most distant\f + \ft Or: remote \f* peaks
\p and to its densess forests.
\p
\v 24 We have dug wells in other countries and drank water from them.
\p And by marching through \f + \ft metonymy \f* the streams of Egypt,
\p we dried them all up \f + \ft hyperbole \f*!'

\v 23 By your messengers
\q2 you have defied the Lord,
\q and have said,
\q2 'With the multitude of my chariots
\q I have gone up to the heights of the mountains,
\q2 to the highest elevations of Lebanon.
\q I will cut down the tall cedars
\q2 and the choice cypress trees there.
\q I will enter into its farthest parts,
\q2 its most fruitful forest.
\q
\v 24 I have dug wells
\q2 and have drunk foreign waters.
\q I dried up all the rivers of Egypt
\q2 under the soles of my feet.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This continues the message from Yahweh given by Isaiah, the prophet, to King Hezekiah concerning King Sennacherib. It uses parallelism throughout. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **you have defied the Lord** - To "defy" is to openly resist or mock.
  * **I have gone up ... I will cut down ... I will enter** - These boasts made by Sennacherib could only be fulfilled by his army. The pronoun "I" represents himself and his army. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **I dried up all the rivers of Egypt under the soles of my feet** - This is a boast that Sennacherib has so many soldiers that their feet dry up the water when they cross a river. This is an exagerration to emphasize the great number of soldiers he has. AT: "And by marching through the streams of Egypt, we dried them all up!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
