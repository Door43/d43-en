\p
\v 29 And this shall be the sign to thee: you shall eat this youar that which grows of itself, and in the second youar that
which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.
\v 30 And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
\v 31 For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that shall escape: the zeal of Jehovah shall
perform this.
