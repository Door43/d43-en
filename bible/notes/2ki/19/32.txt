\v 32 So this is what I, Yahweh, say about the king of Assyria:
\p "His armies will not enter this city;
\p they will not even shoot any arrows into it!
\p His soldiers will not \add march outside\add* the city gates carrying shields,
\p and they will not even build high mounds of dirt against \add the city walls\add*
\p \add to enable them to attack the city\add*.
\p
\v 33 Their king will return to his own country
\p on the same road on which he came here.
\p He will not enter this city!"
\p \add That will happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it!
\p
\v 34 I will defend this city and prevent it from being destroyed.
\q2 I will do this for the sake of my own reputation and because of what I promised to King David, who served me well.'~"

\v 32 Therefore thus says Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come to this city, nor shoot an arrow there,
neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.
\v 33 By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come to this city, says Jehovah.
\v 34 For I will defend this city to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.
