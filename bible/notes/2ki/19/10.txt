===== Translation Notes: =====

This is the message that King Sennacharib of Assyria sent to King Hezekiah.

  * **Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying**  - AT: "Do not believe your God in whom you trust. He is lying when he says"
  * **given over into the hand of the king of Assyria"**  - The word "hand" here represents control. AT: "given into the control of Assyria" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
  * **See, you have heard**  - AT: "Listen, you have heard" or "You have certainly heard" (UDB). Here "see" was used to draw attention to what he was about to say next.
  * **So will you be rescued?**  - Sennacharib used this question to emphasize that God will not be able to rescue them. AT: "Your God will not rescue you" or "You will not be able to escape either" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
