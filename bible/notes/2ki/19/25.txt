\v 25 \add But I reply\add*, 'Have you never heard that long ago I determined \add that those things would happen\add*?
\p I planned it long ago,
\p and now I have been causing it to occur.
\p I planned that your army \add the power to\add* capture many cities that were surrounded by high walls,
\p and cause them to become piles of rubble.
\p
\v 26 The people who lived in those cities have no power,
\p and as a result they became dismayed and discouraged.
\p They are as frail as plants and grass in the fields,
\p as frail as grass that grows on the roofs of houses
\p and is scorched by the hot east wind.

\v 25 Have you not heard how I 
\q2 determined it long ago, 
\q and worked it out in ancient times?
\q2 Now I am bringing it to pass. 
\q You are here to reduce impregnable cities
\q2 into heaps of ruins.
\q 
\v 26 Their inhabitants, of little strength, 
\q2 are shattered and ashamed. 
\q They are plants in the field, 
\q2 green grass, 
\q the grass on the roof or in the field, 
\q2 burned before it has grown up.
