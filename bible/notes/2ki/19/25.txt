\v 26 The people who lived in those cities have no power,

\v 25 Have you not heard how I 
\q2 determined it long ago, 
\q and worked it out in ancient times?
\q2 Now I am bringing it to pass. 
\q You are here to reduce impregnable cities
\q2 into heaps of ruins.
\q 
\v 26 Their inhabitants, of little strength, 
\q2 are shattered and ashamed. 
\q They are plants in the field, 
\q2 green grass, 
\q the grass on the roof or in the field, 
\q2 burned before it has grown up.
