This continues the message from Yahweh, given by Isaiah, the prophet, for King Hezekiah concerning King Sennecherib. 

    * **raging against me** - AT: "your angry shouting about me," 
    * **because your arrogance has reached my ears** - "because I have heard your proud words," (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
    * **I will put my hook in your nose, and my bit in your mouth** - AT: "I will lead you like an animal."
    * **I will turn you back the way you came** - AT: "I will make you return to your own country the same way you came, without conquering Jerusalem."  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicitinfo]])
