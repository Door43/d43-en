\v 13 Nebuchadnezzar took out from there all the valuable things in the house of Yahweh, and those in the king's palace. He cut into pieces all the golden objects that Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of Yahweh, as Yahweh had said would happen.
\v 14 He took into exile all Jerusalem, all the leaders, and all the fighting men, ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and the smiths. No one was left except the poorest people in the land.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Solomon king of Israel had made** - You might want to translate this so the reader understands that Solomon might have had others help him do this. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **He took into exile all Jerusalem** - Here "Jerusalem" is a metonym for the people who lived there. And, "all" is a generalization. It means all the most important people AT: "Nebuchadnezzar took all the important people away from Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])   
  * **the craftsmen and the smiths** - "the men who knew how to make and repair things that are made from metal"
  * **No one was left except the poorest people in the land** - This can be translated as a positive statement. AT: "Only the poorest people in the land still lived there" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
