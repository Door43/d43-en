===== translationNotes: =====


  * **Riblah** - This is the name of a place. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **passed sentence on him** - "decided what they would do to punish him" 
  * **they slaughtered them before his eyes** - The eyes are synecdoche for the whole person. AT: "they forced king Zedekiah to watch them kill his sons" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **he put out his eyes** - "Nebuchadnezzar put out Zedekiah's eyes." It might be best to translate so that the reader understands that other people might have helped Nebuchadnezzar do this. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
