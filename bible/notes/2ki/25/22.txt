\v 22 As for the people who were left in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, had left behind, Nebuzaradan put Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, in charge of them.
\v 23 Now when some the commanders of soldiers, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they went to Gedaliah at Mizpah. These men were Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah; Johanan, the son of Kareah; Seraiah, the son of
Tanhumeth the Netophathite; and Jaazaniah, the son of the Maacathite—they and their men.
\v 24 Gedaliah made an oath to them and to their men, and said to them, "Do not be afraid of the Chaldean officials. Live in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you."
