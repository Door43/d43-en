\v 4 Elijah said to him, "Elisha, wait here, please, for Yahweh has sent me to Jericho." And Elisha replied, "As Yahweh lives, and as you live, I will not leave you." So they went to Jericho.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The sons of the prophets** - This does not mean that they were the sons of prophets, but rather, that they were a group of prophets. AT: "A group of men who were prophets" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **As Yahweh lives, and as you live, I will not leave you** - "As surely as Yahweh lives and as you live, I will not leave you." Here Elisha compares the certainty that Yahweh and Elijah are alive to the certainty of what he is saying. This is a way of making a solemn promise. See how you translated this phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:2ki:02:01|2:2]]. AT: "I solemnly promise you that I will not leave you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
