===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But when they urged Elisha until he was ashamed** - The sons of the prophets kept asking Elisha until he felt bad about saying "no." AT: "They kept asking Elisha until he felt bad for denying their request, so" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Did I not say to you, 'Do not go'?** - Elisha uses this rhetorical question to emphasize that he had told them previously what would happen. This can be written as a statement. AT: "I told you that you should not go, because you would not find him!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
