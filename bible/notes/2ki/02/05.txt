\v 5 Then the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came to Elisha and said to him, "Do you know that Yahweh will take away your master from you today?" Elisha answered, "Yes, I know it, but do not talk about it."
\v 6 Then Elijah said to him, "Stay here, please, for Yahweh has sent me to the Jordan." Elisha replied, "As Yahweh lives, and as you live, I will not leave you." So the two went on.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Then the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came to Elisha and said to him** - "When Elijah and Elisha came near Jericho, the sons of the prophets who were from there said to Elisha"
  * **The sons of the prophets** - This does not mean that they were the sons of prophets, but rather, that they were a group of prophets. See how you translated this phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:2ki:02:03|2:3]]. AT: "the group of men who were prophets" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **As Yahweh lives, and as you live, I will not leave you** - "As surely as Yahweh lives and as you live, I will not leave you." Here Elisha compares the certainty that Yahweh and Elijah are alive to the certainty of what he is saying. This is a way of making a solemn promise. See how you translated this phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:2ki:02:01|2:2]]. AT: "I solemnly promise you that I will not leave you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
