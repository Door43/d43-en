\v 14 He struck the water with Elijah's cloak that had fallen and said, "Where is Yahweh, the God of Elijah?" When he had struck the waters, they divided on both sides and Elisha crossed over.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **cloak** - The cloak was the otter clothing of a prophet. It was the sign of his job. When Elisha took Elijah's cloak he was saying he was taking Elijah's place as prophet.
  * **Where is Yahweh, the God of Elijah?** - Elisha is asking if Yahweh is with him as he was with Elijah. AT: "Yahweh, the God of Elijah, are you here with me?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **they divided on both sides and Elisha crossed over** - The river separated and Elisha walked to the other side on dry ground, the same way he did previously when he was with Elijah.
  * **on both sides** - "to the right and the left." This refers to the right and the left of where Elijah struck the water.
