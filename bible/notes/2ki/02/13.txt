\v 13 He picked up Elijah's cloak that had fallen off him, and went back to stand by the bank of the Jordan.
\v 14 He struck the water with Elijah's cloak that had fallen and said, "Where is Yahweh, the God of Elijah?" When he had struck the waters, they divided on both sides and Elisha crossed over.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **cloak** - The cloak was the otter clothing of a prophet. It was the sign of his job. When Elisha took Elijah's cloak he was saying he was taking Elijah's place as prophet.
  * **Where is Yahweh, the God of Elijah?** - AT: "Yahweh, the God of Elijah, are you here with me?"
  * **they divided on both sides and Elisha crossed over** - Like before with Elijah, the river separated and Elisha walked to the other side on dry ground.
