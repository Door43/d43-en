Then I will take it back home with me \add and make an altar on this dirt\add*. From now on, I will offer sacrifices to Yahweh \add on that altar\add*. I will not offer sacrifices to any other god.
\v 18 However, when my master, \add the king\add*, goes into the temple of the god Rimmon to worship him\f + \ft Or: it \f* there, and he is leaning on my arm, I hope\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that Yahweh will forgive me because I will have to bow down, too."

\v 17 Then Naaman said, "Very well, but I have one request. This soil here in Israel is Yahweh's soil, so please allow me to take some soil from this place and put it in sacks on two mules. Then I will take it back home with me and make an altar on this soil. From now on, I will offer sacrifices to Yahweh on that altar. I will not offer sacrifices to any other god.
\v 18 However, when my master, the king, goes into the temple of the god Rimmon to worship him, I ask that Yahweh will forgive me because I will have to bow down, too."

\v 19 Elisha replied, "Go home, and do not worry about that." So Naaman and his servants started to travel home.

\v 17 So Naaman said, "If not, then I ask you to let there be given to your servant two mule loads of earth, for from now on, your servant will offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice to any god but Yahweh.
\v 18 In this one thing may Yahweh pardon your servant, that is, when my king goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, when I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, may Yahweh pardon your servant in this matter."
\v 19 Elisha said to him, "Go in peace." So Namaan left.
