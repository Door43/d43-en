  * **there is no God in all the earth except in Israel** - This can be stated in positive form. AT: "The God of Israel is the only true God!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])

  * **before whom I stand** - Here serving Yahweh is spoken of as standing in his presence. AT: "whom I serve" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
