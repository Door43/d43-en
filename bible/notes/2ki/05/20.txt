\v 20 Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God said, "Look, my master has spared this Naaman the Aramean by not receiving from his hands gifts which he brought. As Yahweh lives I will run after him and receive something from him."
\v 21 So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw someone running after him, he jumped down from his chariot to meet him and said, "Is everything alright?"
\v 22 Gehazi said, "Everything is alright. My master has sent me, saying, "Behold, now there have come to me from the hill-country of Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothes."
