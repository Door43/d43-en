\v 13 But his servants came to him, and one of them said, "Sir, if that prophet had told you to do something difficult, you would certainly have done it. So why do you refuse to do such a simple thing he asks, when he says, "Go down seven times in the water and be clean?' "

\v 13 Then Naaman's servants came near and spoke to him, "My father, if the prophet had commanded you do some difficult thing,
would you not have done it? How much rather then, when he says to you to simply, 'Dip yourself and be clean?' "
\v 14 Then went he down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, obeying the instructions of the man of God. His flesh was restored again like the flesh of a little child, and he was healed.
