\v 26 Elisha said to Gehazi, "Was not my spirit with you when the man turned his chariot to meet you? Is this a time to accept money and clothes, olive groves and vineyards, sheep and oxen, and male servants and female servants?
\v 27 Therefore the leprosy of Naaman will be upon you and to your descendants forever." So Gehazi went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.
