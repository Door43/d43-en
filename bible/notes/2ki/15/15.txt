\v 15 As for the other matters concerning Shallum and the conspiracy that he formed, they are written in The Book of the Events of the Kings of Israel.
\v 16 Then Menahem attacked Tiphsah and all who were there, and the borders around Tirzah, because they did not open up the city to him. So he attacked it, and he ripped open all the pregnant women in that village.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the conspiracy that he formed** - The abstract noun "conspiracy" can be translated with the verb "plan." It can be stated clearly what this conspiracy was. AT: "how he planned to murder King Zechariah" or "and how he murdered King Zechariah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **they are written in The Book of the Events of the Kings of Israel** - This can be reworded so that there is no passive "are written." AT: "you can read about them in The Book of the Events of the Kings of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Tiphsah** - This is the name of a city. Some versions have "Tappuah," which is the name of another city. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
