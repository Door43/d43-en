\v 34 And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah; he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done.
\v 35 Howbeit the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places. He built
the upper gate of the house of Jehovah.
\v 36 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
of Judah?
