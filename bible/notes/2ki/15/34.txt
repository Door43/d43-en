===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 34 Jotham did what was right in the eyes of Yahweh. He followed the example of all his father Azariah had done.
\v 35 However, the high places were not taken away. The people still sacrificed and burned incense at the high places. Jotham built the upper gate of the house of Yahweh.
\v 36 As for the other matters concerning Jotham, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the events of the kings of Judah?
