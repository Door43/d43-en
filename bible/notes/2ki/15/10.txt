\v 10 Shallum son of Jabesh conspired against Zechariah, attacked him in front of the people, and killed him. Then he became king in his place.
\v 11 As for the other matters concerning Zechariah, they are written in The Book of the Events of the Kings of Israel.
\v 12 This was the word of Yahweh that he spoke to Jehu, saying, "Your descendants will sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation." And so it happened.
