===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the high places were not taken away** - This can be stated in active form. "no one took away the high places" or "Azariah did not have anyone take the high places away" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **were not taken away** - Being taken away represents being destroyed. AT: "were not destroyed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * *to the day of his death** - The abstract noun "death" can be expressed with the verb "die." AT: "until the day he died" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
 **Jotham, the king's son, was over the household - The household refers to the people living in the king's palace. Because Azariah was a leper, he had to live in a separate house. So his son, Jotham, took charge over the palace.
  * **was over the household** - Being over the household represents having authority over those in it. AT: "was in charge of the household" or "had authority over those in Azariah's palace" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
