\v 6 As for the other matters concerning Azariah, all that he did, are they not written in The Book of the Events of the Kings of Judah?
\v 7 So Azariah slept with his ancestors; they buried him with his ancestors in the city of David. Jotham, his son, became king in his place.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **are they not written ... Judah?** - This question is used to either inform or remind the readers that the information about Azariah is in this other book. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:2ki:08:22|8:23]]. AT: "they are written in The Book of the Events of the Kings of Judah." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **are they not written ... Judah?** - This can be reworded so that there is no passive "are ... written." AT: "you can read about them in The Book of the Events of the Kings of Judah." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Azariah slept with his ancestors** - Sleeping represents dying. AT: "Azariah died as his ancestors had" or "like his ancestors, Azariah died"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **they buried him with his ancestors** - "his family buried him where his ancestors had been buried"
  * **became king in his place** - The phrase "in his place" is a metaphor meaning "instead of him." AT: "became king instead of Azariah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
