\v 12 Then the king arose in the night and said to his servants, "I will now show you what the Arameans have done to us. They
know that we are hungry, therefore they are gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, "When they come out of the city we will take them alive, and get into the city."
\v 13 And one of the king's servants answered and said, "Let some men take, I ask you, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city. They are as all the multitude of Israel who are left—most are now dead—and let us send and see.
