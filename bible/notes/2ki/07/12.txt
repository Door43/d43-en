\v 12 When the king \add heard it\add*, he got up out of his bed and said to his officials, "I will tell you what the army of Syria is planning to do. They know that we have no food here, so they have left their tents and are hiding in the fields. They think that we will leave the city \add to find some food\add*, and then they will capture us and capture the city."

\v 13 But one of his officials said, "Many of our Israelite people have already died \add from hunger\f + \ft Or: not having anything to eat\add* \f*. If those of us who are still alive all stay here, we also will die anyway. So let's send some men with five of our horses that are still alive to go and see \add what has really happened\add*."

\v 12 It was in the night that the king heard this news. He got up out of his bed and said to his officials, "I will tell you what the army of Aram is planning to do. They know that we have no food here, so they have left their tents and are hiding in the fields. They think that we will leave the city to find some food, and then they will capture us and capture the city."
\p
\v 13 But one of his officials said, "Many of our people have already died from hunger. If those of us who are still alive all stay here, we also will die anyway. So let us send some men with five of our horses that are still alive to go and see what has really happened."

\v 12 Then the king arose at night and said to his servants, "I will tell you now what the Arameans have done to us. They know that we are hungry, so they have gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the fields. They are saying, 'When they come out of the city, we will take them alive, and get into the city.'"
\v 13 One of the king's servants answered and said, "I beg you, let some men take five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city. They are like all the rest of the population of Israel who are left—most are now dead; let us send them and see."

  * **take them alive** - This means that they would capture the people and not kill them.
  * **the horses that remain, which are left in the city** - Many of the horses belonging to the Israelites had died because of the famine. The meaning of this can be made clear. AT: "the horses in the city that are still alive" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **They are like all the rest of the population of Israel who are left** - The men that would go to the Aramean camp would share the same fate as the rest of the Israelites who remained in the city. They would either die from starvation, or possibly be killed by the Arameans.
