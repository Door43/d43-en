===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Go and see** - The implicit information may be added to make the meaning clear. AT: "Go and see if what these lepers have said is true" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **They went after them to the Jordan** - "They followed the path the Aramean army took all the way to the Jordan River"
  * **all the road was full of clothes and equipment** - This is an exaggeration that means the men saw these items scattered along the road as they traveled. AT: "there were clothes and equipment all along the road" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
