\v 7 So the soldiers arose and fled in the twilight; they left their tents, their horses, their donkeys, and the camp as it was, and fled for their lives.
\v 8 When the men with leprosy came to the outermost part of the camp, they went into one tent and ate and drank, and carried
away silver and gold and clothes, and went and hid them. They came back and entered into another tent and carried
