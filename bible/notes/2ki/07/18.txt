\v 18 Elisha had told him that by the next day there would be plenty of food, with the result that anyone could buy ten pounds of fine wheat or twenty pounds of barley for only one piece of silver,
\p
\v 19 and the officer had answered, "That certainly cannot \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* happen! Even if Yahweh himself would open the sky and send down some grain, that could not happen." And Elisha had replied, "\add Because you said that\add*, you \f + \ft synecdoche \f* will see it happen, but you will not be able to eat any of the food!"

\v 19 That officer had answered, "That certainly cannot happen! Even if Yahweh himself would open the sky and send down some grain, that could not happen." And Elisha had replied, "Because you said that, you will see it happen, but you will not be able to eat any of the food!"
\v 20 And that is what happened to him. The people who were rushing out of the city gate trampled on him, and he died.

\v 18 So it happened as the man of God had said to the king, saying, "About this time in the gate of Samaria, two measures of barley will be available for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel." 
\v 19 That captain had answered the man of God and said, "See, even if Yahweh should make windows in heaven, can this thing happen?" Elisha had said, "See, you will watch it happen with your own eyes, but you will not eat any of it."
\v 20 And it happened that way to him, for the people trampled him in the gate, and he died.
