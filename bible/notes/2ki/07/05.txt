\v 5 So they rose up at twilight to go into the Aramean camp; when they arrived at the outermost part of the camp, there was no one there.
\v 6 For the Lord had made the Aramean army hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses—the noise of another large army, and they said to each other, "The king of Israel has hired the kings of the Hittites and Egyptians to come against us."
