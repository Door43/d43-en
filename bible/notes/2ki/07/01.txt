  * **the captain on whose hand the king leaned** - AT: "the king's assistant" or "an officer who helped the king"
  * **windows in heaven** - AT: "openings in the sky that Yahweh himself would make grain fall through" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **can this thing happen?** - AT: "I do not believe it could happen!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **you will watch it happen with your own eyes, but you will not eat any of it** - Because the officer did not believe Yahweh could provide the grain, he would see it happen but would not eat any of it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
