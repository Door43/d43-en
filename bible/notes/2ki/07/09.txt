\v 9 Then they said each other, "We are not doing right. This day is a day of good news, but we are keeping quiet about it. If we wait until daybreak, punishment will overtake us. Now then, come, let us go and tell the king’s household."
\v 10 So they went and called the gatekeepers of the city. They told them, saying, "We went to the camp of the Arameans, but there was no one there, not the sound of anyone, but there were the horses tied, and the donkeys tied, and the tents as they were."
\v 11 And the gatekeepers shouted out the news, and then it was told inside the king’s household.
