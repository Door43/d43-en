\v 9 Then they said one to another, We do not well; this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we wait till
the morning light, punishment will overtake us; now therefore come, let us go and tell the king’s household.
\v 10 So they came and called to the porter of the city; and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and,
behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but the horses tied, and the asses tied, and the tents as they were.
\v 11 And he called the porters; and they told it to the king’s household within.
