\v 4 If we go into the city, we will die there, because there is no food there. If we remain sitting here, we will die here. So let's go to where the army of Syria has set up their tents. If they kill us, we will die. But if they allow us to remain alive, we will not die."

\v 3 Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?
\v 4 If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there; and if we sit still here,
we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall to the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if
they kill us, we shall but die.
