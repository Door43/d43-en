\v 16 Then many of the people of Samaria also went \add out of the city and went\add* to where the army of Syria had previously set up their tents. They entered all the tents and took everything. \add So there was now plenty of everything\add*! As a result people could buy ten pounds of fine wheat or twenty pounds of barley for only one piece of silver, which was what Yahweh had said would happen!
\p
\v 17 The king of Israel had appointed the officer who was his assistant to supervise what was happening at the marketplace. But as he was standing near the gate, all the people \add who were rushing outside the city\add* trampled on him, and he died, which was what Elisha had said would happen to him when Elisha previously went to talk to the king.

\v 16 Then many of the people of Samaria also went out of the city and went to where the army of Aram had set up their tents. They entered all the tents and took everything. So there was now plenty of everything! As a result people could buy seven liters of the best flour for one piece of silver, and fourteen liters of barley for one piece of silver, which was what Yahweh had said would happen!
\p
\v 17 The king of Israel had ordered his assistant, the one who had spoken with Elisha, to supervise what was happening at the city gate. But as he was standing at the gate, all the people who were rushing outside the city trampled on him, and he died, which was what Elisha had said would happen to him.

\v 16 The people went out and plundered the camp of the Arameans. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, just as  the word of Yahweh had said.
\v 17 The king had ordered the captain on whose hand he had leaned to be in charge of the gate, and the people trampled him down in the gateway. He died as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king had came down to him.
