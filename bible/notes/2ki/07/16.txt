\v 16 Then many of the people of Samaria also went \add out of the city and went\add* to where the army of Syria had previously set up their tents. They entered all the tents and took everything. \add So there was now plenty of everything\add*! As a result people could buy ten pounds of fine wheat or twenty pounds of barley for only one piece of silver, which was what Yahweh had said would happen!
\p
\v 17 The king of Israel had appointed the officer who was his assistant to supervise what was happening at the marketplace. But as he was standing near the gate, all the people \add who were rushing outside the city\add* trampled on him, and he died, which was what Elisha had said would happen to him when Elisha previously went to talk to the king.

As a result people could buy seven liters of the best flour for one piece of silver, and fourteen liters of barley for one piece of silver, which was what Yahweh had said would happen!
