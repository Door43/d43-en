\v 6 But he put not their children to death; instead, he acted according to what was written in the Law, in the book of Moses, as Yahweh had commanded, saying, “The fathers must not die for the children, nor must the children die for the fathers. Instead, every person must die for his own sin.”
\v 7 He killed from Edom in the Valley of Salt ten thousand, and took Sela by war, and called the name of it Joktheel, to this day.
