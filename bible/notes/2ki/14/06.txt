\v 6 Yet he did not put the sons of the assassins to death; instead, he acted according to what was written in the law, in the book of Moses, as Yahweh had commanded, saying, "The fathers must not be put to death for their children, neither must the children be put to death for their parents. Instead, every person must be put to death for his own sin."
\v 7 He killed ten thousand soldiers of Edom in the valley of Salt; he also took Sela in war and called it Joktheel, which is what it is called to this day.
