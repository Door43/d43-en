\v 8 Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one
another in the face.
\v 9 And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar
that was in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and
trod down the thistle.
\v 10 You have indeed struck Edom, and your heart has lifted you up: glory thereof, and abide at home; for why should
you meddle to your hurt, that you should fall, even you, and Judah with thee?
