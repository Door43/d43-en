\v 23 When Amaziah had been ruling Judah for almost fifteen years, Jeroboam \add #2\add* became the king of Israel. He ruled in Samaria \add city\add* for forty-one years.
\v 24 He did many things that Yahweh said were evil. He did not stop committing the same kind of sins that Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, committed, sins which induced the Israelite people to sin also.
\v 25 His soldiers conquered again some of the territory that had previously belonged to Israel, from Hamath \add city\add* in the north to the Dead Sea in the south. That is what Yahweh, the God whom the Israelites worshiped, promised the prophet Jonah, the son of Amittai, from Gath-Hepher \add town\add*, would happen.
