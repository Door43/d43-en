\v 11 But Jehoshaphat said, "Is there not here a prophet of Yahweh, that we may consult Yahweh by him?" One of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, "Elisha son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah."
\v 12 Jehoshaphat said, "The word of Yahweh is with him." So the king of Israel, Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom went down to him.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Is there not here a prophet of Yahweh, that we may consult Yahweh by him?** - Jehoshaphat uses a rhetorical question here to state that he is certain that there is a prophet there and to find out where he is. This may be written as a statement. AT: "I am sure there is a prophet of Yahweh here! Tell me where one is, so we may consult Yahweh by him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Shaphat** - This is the name of a man. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **who poured water on the hands of Elijah** - This idiom means that he was Elijah's helper. The phrase "poured water on the hands" is a description of one of the ways he served Elijah. AT: "who was a helper to Elijah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **The word of Yahweh is with him** - This means that he is a prophet and that Yahweh tells him what to say. AT: "He speaks what Yahweh tells him to say" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **went down to him** - They went to see Elijah and to consult with him about what they should do. The full meaning of this statement can be made clear. AT: "went to see Elisha to ask him what they should do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
