\v 26 When the king of Moab realized that his army was being defeated, he took with him seven hundred men who fought with swords, and they tried to force a way through the Israelite lines of soldiers to escape to get help from the king of Edom, whom they hoped would join them, but they were unable to escape.
\v 27 Then the king of Moab took his oldest son, who would have become the next king, and killed him and offered him for a sacrifice to their god Chemosh, burning him on top of the city wall. The anger of these armies became so great against each other that the army of Israel left that city and returned to their own country.

\v 26 When King Mesha of Moab saw that the battle was lost, he took with him seven hundred swordsmen to break through to the king of Edom, but they failed.
\v 27 Then he took his oldest son who should have reigned after him, and offered him as a burnt offering upon the wall. So there was great anger against Israel, and the Israelite army departed from King Mesha and returned to their own land.
