\c 3
\p
\v 1 Now in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Joram son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria; he reigned twelve years.
\v 2 He did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh, but not like his father and his mother; for he removed the sacred stone pillar of Baal that his father had made.
\v 3 Nevertheless he held on to the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin; he did not turn away from them.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah** - This describes the time that Joram began to reign by stating how long the current king of Judah had reigned. The meaning of this statement can be made clear. AT: "in the eighteenth year that Jehoshaphat was king of Judah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the eighteenth year** - "the 18th year" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **Joram son of Ahab** - Sometimes this man is referred to as "Jehoram." This is not the same person as the man mentioned in [[:en:bible:notes:2ki:01:17|1:17]] named "Jehoram."
  * **what was evil in the sight of Yahweh** - Here "sight" refers to Yahweh's thoughts or opinion. AT: "what Yahweh considers to be evil" or "what is evil in Yahweh's judgement" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **but not like his father and his mother** - This compares how much evil he did to being less that the amount that his parents did. AT: "but he did not do as much evil as his father and mother had done" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **the sacred stone pillar of Baal** - This pillar was used in the worship of Baal, though it is unknown what the pillar looked like. AT: "the sacred stone pillar for worshiping Baal" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_possession]])
  * **he held on to the sins** - This is an idiom. Here "holding on" to something means to continue doing it. AT: "he continued to commit the sins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]) 
  * **Nebat** - This is the name of a man. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **he did not turn away from them** - "Turning away" from something is an idiom which means to stop doing it. AT: "he did not stop committing those sins" (UDB) or "he continued committing those sins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
