\v 24 The king of Assyria brought men from Babylon and from Cuthah, and from Avva, and from Hamath and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel. They possessed Samaria and lived in its cities.
\v 25 And so it was, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not Yahweh. Therefore Yahweh sent lions among them, which killed some of them.
\v 26 Therefore they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, "The nations which you have carried away and placed in the cities
of Samaria do not know the law of the god of the land. Therefore he has sent lions among them, and, behold, the lions kill people there because they do not know  the law of the god of the land.
