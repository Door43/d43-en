\v 24 The king of Assyria brought people from Babylon and from Cuthah, and from Avva, and from Hamath and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria in place of the people of Israel. They took over Samaria and lived in its cities.
\v 25 It happened at the beginning of their residence there, that they did not honor Yahweh. So Yahweh sent lions among them, which killed some of them.
\v 26 So they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, "The nations that you have carried away and placed in the cities of Samaria do not know the practices required by  the god of the land. So he has sent lions among them, and, see, the lions are killing people there because they do not know the practices required by the god of the land."
