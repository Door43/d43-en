\v 4 Then king of Assyria realized that Hoshea had been plotting against him, for Hoshea had sent messengers to So, king of Egypt; also, he offered no tribute
to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year. So the king of Assyria shut him up and bound him in prison.
\v 5 Then the king of Assyria attacked throughout all the land, and attacked Samaria and besieged it for three years.
\v 6 In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria took Samaria and carried Israel away to Assyria. He put them in Halah, at the Habor River of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
