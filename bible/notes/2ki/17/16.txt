\v 17 They also burned their own sons and daughters to be sacrifices \add to those gods\add*. They went to fortune-tellers and they practiced sorcery. They continually chose \f + \ft metaphor \f* to do \add all kinds of\add* evil things that caused Yahweh to become angry.

\v 16 They ignored all the commandments of Yahweh their God. They made cast metal figures of two calves to worship. They made an Asherah pole, and they worshiped all the stars of the heavens and Baal.
\v 17 They put their sons and daughters in the fire, used divination and enchantments, sold themselves to do that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and provoked him to anger.
\v 18 Therefore Yahweh was very angry with Israel and removed them out of his sight. There was no one left but the tribe of Judah alone.
