\v 16 They ignored all the commandments of Yahweh their God. They made cast metal figures of two calves to worship. They made an Asherah pole, and they worshiped all the stars of the heavens and Baal.
\v 17 They sacrificed their sons and  daughters in the fire as burnt offerings, used divination and enchantments, sold themselves to do that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and provoked him to anger.
\v 18 Therefore Yahweh was very angry with Israel and removed them out of his sight. There was no one left but the tribe of Judah alone.
