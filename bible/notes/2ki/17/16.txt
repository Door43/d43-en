\v 16 They ignored all the commandments of Yahweh their God and they made cast metal figures of two calves to worship. They made an Asherah pole, they worshipped all the host of heaven, and they worshiped Baal.
\v 17 They sacrificed their sons and  daughters in the fire as burnt offerings, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and provoked him to anger.
\v 18 Therefore Yahweh was very angry with Israel and removed them out of his sight. There was no one left but the tribe of
Judah only!
