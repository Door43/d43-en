===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 But the Israelite people would not pay attention. They were stubborn [IDI] just like their ancestors were. Just like their ancestors did, they refused to believe in Yahweh their God.
\v 15 They rejected Yahweh's laws and the agreement that he had made with their ancestors. They ignored Yahweh's warnings. They worshiped worthless idols and as a result they themselves became worthless. Although Yahweh had commanded them not to imitate the behavior of the people-groups that lived near them, they disobeyed that command.

\v 14 But they would not listen; instead they were very stubborn like their fathers who did not trust in
Yahweh their God.
\v 15 They rejected his statutes and the covenant that he had made with their ancestors, and the threats that he had made to them. They followed useless practices and themselves became futile. They followed the pagan nations who were around them, those that Yahweh had commanded them not to imitate.
