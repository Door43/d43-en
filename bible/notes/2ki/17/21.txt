\v 21 Earlier, when Yahweh allowed the people of Israel to separate\f + \ft Or: break \f* away from the area \f + \ft metonymy \f* that King David \add had estabished\add*, they chose Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, to be their king. Then Jeroboam enticed the people of Israel to stop worshiping Yahweh \add and to worship idols instead\add*. He induced them to commit great sins.
\v 22 And the Israelite people continued to do the evil things that Jeroboam introduced. They did not turn away from those sins,
\v 23 until finally Yahweh got rid of them. That was just what his prophets had warned would happen. The Israelite people were taken away to the land of Assyria, and they still remain there.

\v 21 Earlier, when Yahweh had forced the ten tribes of Israel away from the rule of David's descendants, those tribes had chosen Jeroboam son of Nebat, to be their king. Then Jeroboam enticed the people of Israel to stop worshiping Yahweh and to worship idols instead. He induced them to commit great sins.
\v 22 And the Israelite people continued to do the evil things that Jeroboam introduced. They did not turn away from those sins,
\v 23 so finally Yahweh got rid of them. That was just what his prophets had warned would happen. The Israelite people were taken away to the land of Assyria, and they are still there.

\v 21 He tore Israel from the royal line of David, and they made Jeroboam son of Nebat king. Jeroboam drove Israel away from following Yahweh and made them commit a great sin.
\v 22 The people of Israel followed all the sins of Jeroboam and they did not depart from them,
\v 23 so Yahweh removed Israel from his sight, as he had said through all his servants the prophets that he would. So Israel was carried away out of their own land to Assyria, and it is this way to this present day.
