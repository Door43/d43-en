\v 21 For he tore Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drove Israel from
following Jehovah, and made them sin a great sin.
\v 22 And the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them;
\v 23 until Jehovah removed Israel out of his sight, as he spoke by all his servants the prophets. So Israel was carried away
out of their own land to Assyria to this day.
