\v 21 He tore Israel from the royal line of David, and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king, and Jeroboam drove Israel from following Yahweh, and made them sin a great sin.
\v 22 And the people of Israel followed  all the sins of Jeroboam which he did, and  they did not depart not from them
\v 23 until Yahweh removed Israel out of his sight, as he described through all his servants the prophets. So Israel was carried away out of their own land to Assyria to this day.
