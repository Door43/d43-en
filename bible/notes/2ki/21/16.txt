\v 16 Moreover, Manasseh shed much innocent blood, until he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another with death, besides his sin by which he made Judah to sin, in doing what was evil in the sight of Yahweh.
\v 17 Now the rest of the deeds of Manasseh, all that he did, and his sin that he committed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\v 18 Manasseh slept with his ancestors and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza. Amon, his son, reigned in his place.
