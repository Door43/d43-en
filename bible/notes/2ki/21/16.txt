\p
\v 16 Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; besides his sin
wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.
\v 17 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book
of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\v 18 And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his
son reigned in his stead.
