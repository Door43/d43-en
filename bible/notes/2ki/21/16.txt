\v 16 Moreover, Manasseh shed much innocent blood, until he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another with death. This was in addition to the sin by which he made Judah to sin, when they did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh.
\v 17 As for the other matters concerning Manasseh, all that he did, and the sin that he committed, are they not written in The Book of the Events of the Kings of Judah?
\v 18 Manasseh slept with his ancestors and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza. Amon his son became king in his place.
