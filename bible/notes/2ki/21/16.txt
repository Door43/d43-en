\v 16 Moreover, Manasseh shed much innocent blood, until he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another with death. This was in addition to the sin by which he made Judah to sin, when they did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh.
\v 17 As for the other matters concerning Manasseh, all that he did, and the sin that he committed, are they not written in The Book of the Events of the Kings of Judah?
\v 18 Manasseh slept with his ancestors and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza. Amon his son became king in his place.

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **Moreover** - "In addition to those evil things"
  * **Manasseh shed much innocent blood** - The words "shed much innocent blood" are a metonym for killing people violently. It was probably Manasseh's servants and soldiers, not Manasseh himself, who did the killing. AT: "Manasseh commanded his officials to kill many innocent people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])'
  * **he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another with death** - "the bodies of dead people were lying all over Jerusalem"
  * **evil in the sight of Yahweh** - Here Yahweh's "sight" refers to what he thinks. AT: "what Yahweh said was evil" or "things that Yahweh considers evil" Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:2ki:03:01|3:2]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **are they not written ... Judah?** - This can be expressed in active form and assumes that the answer is positive. The question is rhetorical and is used for emphasis. AT: "they are written ... Judah." or "you can find them ... Judah." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the garden of Uzza** - Possible meanings are 1) "the garden that had once belonged to a man named Uzza" or 2) "Uzza Garden." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Amon** - man's name (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
