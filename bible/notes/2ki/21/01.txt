\v 1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned five and fifty years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s
name was Hephzibah.
\v 2 And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, after the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah cast out before
the children of Israel.
\v 3 For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made an
Asherah, as did Ahab king of Israel, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.
