\v 1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hephzibah.
\v 2 He did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh, like the disgusting things of the nations whom Yahweh had driven out before the people of Israel.
\v 3 For he rebuilt the shrines that Hezekiah, his father, had destroyed, and he built altars for Baal, made an Asherah pole, as Ahab, king of Israel, had done, and he bowed down to all the stars of heaven and worshiped them.
