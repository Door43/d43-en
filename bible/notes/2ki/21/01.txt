\v 1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hephzibah.
\v 2 He did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh, like the disgusting things of the nations whom Yahweh had driven out from before the children of Israel.
\v 3 For he rebuilt the shrines that Hezekiah, his father, had destroyed, and he built altars for Baal, made an Asherah pole, as did Ahab king of Israel, and bowed down to all the stars of heaven and worshiped them.
