===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The story of King Manasseh's reign continues.

  * **It is in Jerusalem that my name will be forever** - The name is a metonym for the person. AT: "Jerusalem is where I will forever make known who I am" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **He built altars for all the stars of heaven in the two courtyards of the house of Yahweh** - It is implied that he built these altars so people could make sacrifices and worship the stars. Also, he would not have built these altars himself, rather he would have commanded his workers to do it. AT: "He had his workers build altars in the two courtyards of the house of Yahweh so that the people could worship the stars and offer them sacrifices" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **He put his son into the fire** - You may need to make explicit why he put his son in the fire and what happened after he did so. AT: "He burned his son to death as an offering to his gods" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **consulted** - "asked for information from"
  * **evil in the sight of Yahweh** - The nominal adjective "evil" can be translated as a relative clause "things that ... evil." Here Yahweh's "sight" refers to how he judges or decides on the value of something. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:2ki:03:01|3:2]]. AT: "He did things that Yahweh said were evil" or "He did the things that Yahweh considers evil" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
