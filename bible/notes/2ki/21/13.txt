\v 13 I will judge and punish the people of Jerusalem as I punished the family of King Ahab of Israel. I will remove the people of Jerusalem as people wipe a plate clean and then turn it upside down to show that they are now satisfied.
\v 14 And I will abandon the people who remain alive, and I will allow their enemies to conquer them and steal everything valuable from their land.
\v 15 I will do this because my people have done things that I say are very evil, things which have caused me to become very angry. They have caused me to become angry continually, ever since the time that their ancestors left Egypt.' "

<usfm>
\v 13 I will stretch over Jerusalem the measuring line used against Samaria, and the plumb line used against the family of Ahab, and I will wipe Jerusalem clean, as a man wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.
\v 14 I will throw off the remnant of my inheritance and hand them over into the hand of their enemies. They will 
become victims and plunder for all their enemies,
\v 15 because they have done what is evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their ancestors came out of Egypt, to this day."
