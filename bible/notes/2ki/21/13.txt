===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 I will judge and punish \f + \ft metaphor \f* the people of Jerusalem like I punished the family of King Ahab \add of Israel\add*. I will wipe Jerusalem clean\f + \ft Or: remove all the people from Jerusalem \f*, like \f + \ft metaphor \f* people wipe a plate and then turn it upside down \add to show that they are now satisfied\add*.
\v 14 And I will abandon the people who remain alive, and I will allow their enemies to conquer them and steal everything valuable from their land.
\v 15 I will do this because my people have done things that I say are very evil, things which have caused me to become very angry. They have caused me to become angry continually, ever since the time that their ancestors left Egypt.'~"

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 I will judge and punish the people of Jerusalem as I punished the family of King Ahab of Israel. I will remove the people of Jerusalem as people wipe a plate clean and then turn it upside down to show that they are now satisfied.
\v 14 And I will abandon the people who remain alive, and I will allow their enemies to conquer them and steal everything valuable from their land.
\v 15 I will do this because my people have done things that I say are very evil, things which have caused me to become very angry. They have caused me to become angry continually, ever since the time that their ancestors left Egypt."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 I will stretch over Jerusalem the measuring line used against Samaria, and the plumb line used against the house of Ahab; I will wipe Jerusalem clean, as a man wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.
\v 14 I will throw off the remnant of my inheritance and give them into the hand of their enemies. They will become victims and plunder for all their enemies,
\v 15 because they have done what is evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their ancestors came out of Egypt, to this day."

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **stretch over Jerusalem the measuring line used against Samaria, and the plumb line used against the house of Ahab** - The words "measuring line" and "plumb line" are metaphors for the standards Yahweh uses to judge people. AT: "judge Jerusalem using the same measure I used when I judged Samaria and the house of Ahab" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **against Samaria** - Samaria is the capital city and it represents all the people of the kingdom of Israel. AT: "against the people of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **plumb line** - a tool made of a heavy weight and a thin rope used to show if a wall is straight
  * **the house of Ahab** - Here "house" represents family. AT: "the family of Ahab" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I will throw off** - "I will abandon" or "I will reject"
  * **give them into the hand of their enemies** - Here the enemies' "hand" refers to their enemies' control. AT: "let their enemies defeat them and take over their land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
