<usfm>
\v 13 I will stretch over Jerusalem the measuring line used against Samaria, and the plumb line used against the family of Ahab, and I will wipe Jerusalem clean, as a man wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.
\v 14 I will throw off the remnant of my inheritance and deliver them into the hand of their enemies. They will 
become victims and plunder to all their enemies,
\v 15 because they have done what is evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their ancestors came out of Egypt, to this day."
