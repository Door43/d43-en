\v 10 So Yahweh spoke by his servants the prophets, saying,
\v 11 "Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these disgusting things, and has acted wickedly more than all that the Amorites who were before him did, and has also made Judah sin with his idols,"
\v 12 therefore Yahweh the God of Israel, says, "Look, I am about to bring such evil on Jerusalem and Judah that whoever hears of it, both his ears will tingle.
