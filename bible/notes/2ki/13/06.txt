\v 6 Nevertheless, they did not depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who  caused Israel to sin, and they continued in them. And the Asherah pole remained in Samaria.
\v 7 The Arameans left Jehoahaz with only fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen, for the king of Aram had destroyed them and made them like the chaff at threshing time.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **they did not depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam** - AT: "Israel continued to commit the same sins as Jeroboam had"
  * **had destroyed them** - AT "the king of the Arameans defeated the army of Jehoahaz" 
  * **made them like the chaff at threshing time** - their destruction was so great, what remained of their army was so small and insignificant that it is compared to wheat chaff that is worthless and easily blown away. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
