\v 6 Nevertheless, they did not depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who  caused Israel to sin, and they continued in them. And the Asherah pole remained in Samaria.
\v 7 The Arameans left Jehoahaz with only fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen, for the king of Aram had destroyed them and made them like the chaff at threshing time.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **they did not turn away from the sins of the house of Jeroboam**  - AT: "Israel continued to commit the same sins as Jeroboam had,"
  * **trampled on them like dust** - their destruction was so great, what remained of their army was defeated so badly, their greater parts were broken into small pieces (like the dust). (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **had destroyed them ** - AT "the king of the Arameans defeated the army of Jehoahaz"
