\v 18 Then Elisha said, "Pick up the other arrows and strike the ground with them!" So the king picked up the arrows and struck the ground three times.
\v 19 But Elisha was angry with him. He exclaimed, "You should have struck the ground five or six times!

But now, \add because you struck the ground only three times\add*, your army will defeat them only three times!"
