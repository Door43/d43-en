\v 17 Then Elisha told him, "\add Have someone\add* open that window toward the east." So they opened it. Then Elisha said, "Shoot!" So the king did. Then Elisha said, "That is the arrow that \add indicates that your army\add* will defeat the Syrian army. Your army will completely defeat their \add army\add* at Aphek \add town\add*."
\p
\v 18 Then Elisha said, "Pick up the other arrows and strike the ground with them!" So the king picked up the arrows and struck the ground three times.
\v 19 But Elisha was angry with him. He exclaimed, "You should have struck the ground five or six times! If you had done that, your army would have defeated the Syrian \add army\add* until they were completely wiped out! But now, \add because you struck the ground only three times\add*, your army will defeat them only three times!"

\v 17 Elisha said, "Open the window eastward," so he opened it. Then Elisha said, "Shoot!", and he shot. Elisha said, "This is Yahweh's arrow of victory, the arrow of victory over Aram, for you will attack the Arameans in Aphek until you have consumed them."
\v 18 Then Elisha said, "Take the arrows," so Joash took them. He said to the king of Israel, "Strike the ground with them," and he struck the ground three times, then stopped.
\v 19 But the man of God was angry with him and said, "You should have hit the ground five or six times. Then you would have attacked Aram until you annihilated it, but now you will attack Aram only three times."
