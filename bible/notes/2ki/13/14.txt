===== translationNotes: =====

  * **wept over him** - "wept because Elisha was sick"
  * **My father, my father** - Elisha was not the king's literal father. King Joash used this term as a sign of respect.
  * **the chariots of Israel and the horsemen are taking you away** - This is a reference to Elijah going to heaven in [[:en:bible:notes:2ki:02:11|2:11-12]]. Joash uses this phrase to say that Elisha was going to die. AT: "the chariots of Israel and the horsemen are taking you to heaven" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the horsemen** - This refers to the men who drove the chariots. This can be made explicit. AT: "the drivers of the chariots" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
