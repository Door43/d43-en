\v 29 But Jehu did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, by which he made Israel sin—that is, the worship of the golden calves in Bethel and in Dan.
\v 30 So Yahweh said to Jehu, "Because you have done well in executing that which is right in my eyes, and have done to the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart, your sons to the fourth generation will sit on the throne of Israel.
\v 31 But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of Yahweh, the God of Israel, with all his heart. He departed not from the sins
of Jeroboam, by which he made Israel sin.
