Do not allow any of them to escape!" So the guards and officers went in and killed them all with their swords. Then they dragged their corpses outside the temple. Then they went into the inner room of the temple,
\v 26 and they carried out the sacred pillar of Baal that was there, and they burned it.
\v 27 So they destroyed that pillar that honored Baal, and then they burned down the temple, and made it a latrine. And it is still a latrine!

\v 25 So then as soon Jehu finished  offering the burnt-offering, he said to the guard and to the captains, "Go in and kill them. Let no one come out." So they struck them with the edge of the sword,  and the guard and the captains cast them out and went into the inner room of the house of Baal.
\v 26 And they drug out the sacred stone pillars that were in the house of Baal, and burned them.
\v 27 They broke down the pillar of Baal, and destroyed the house of Baal and made it a latrine to this day.
\v 28 That is how  Jehu destroyed Baal and drove its worship out of Israel.
