\v 25 As soon as Jehu \add and Jonadab\add* had finished killing the animals that would be completely burned to be an offering to Baal, \add they went outside and\add* said to the guards and officers, "Go in and kill all of them! Do not allow any of them to escape!" So the guards and officers went in and killed them all with their swords. Then they dragged their corpses outside the temple. Then they went into the inner room of the temple,
\v 26 and they carried out the sacred pillar of Baal that was there, and they burned it.
\v 27 So they destroyed that pillar that honored Baal, and then they burned down the temple, and made it a latrine. And it is still a latrine!
\p
\v 28 That is how Jehu got rid of the worship of Baal in Israel.

\v 25 And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the
captains, Go in, and kill them; let none come forth. And they struck them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the
captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal.
\v 26 And they brought forth the pillars that were in the house of Baal, and burned them.
\v 27 And they brake down the pillar of Baal, and brake down the house of Baal, and made it a draught-house, to this day.
\v 28 Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.
