\v 24 Then he and Jonadab prepared to offer sacrifices and other offerings to Baal that would be completely burned \add on the altar that was there in Samaria\add*. But Jehu had stationed eighty of his men outside the temple, and had said to them, "I want you to kill all the people \add who are in the temple\add*.

\v 23 So Jehu went with Jehonadab son of Recab into the house of Baal, and he said to the worshipers of Baal, "Search and make sure that there is no one here with you from the servants of Yahweh, but the worshipers of Baal alone."
\v 24 Then they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had chosen eighty men who were standing outside, and he told them, "If any of the men whom I bring into your hands escapes, whoever lets that man escape, his life will be taken for the life of the one who escaped."
