\v 23 And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal; and he said to the worshippers of Baal, Search,
and look that there be here with you none of the servants of Jehovah, but the worshippers of Baal only.
\v 24 And they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt-offerings. Now Jehu had appointed him fourscore men without, and said, If
any of the men whom I bring into your hands escape, he that lets him
go, his life shall be for the life of him.
