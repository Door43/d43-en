\v 23 So Jehu went with Jehonadab the son of Rechab into the house of Baal, and he said to the worshippers of Baal, "Search and see that there is no one here  with you from the servants of Yahweh, but the worshippers of Baal only."
\v 24 Then they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt-offerings. Now Jehu had chosen eighty men who were outside, and he told them, "If any of the men whom I bring into your hands escapes, he who lets that man 
escape, his life will be taken for the life of he who escaped."
