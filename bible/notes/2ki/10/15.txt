\v 15 When Jehu had left there, he met  Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him. Jehu greeted him and
said to him, "Is your heart with me, as mine is with yours?" Jehonadab answered, "It is." Jehu said, "If it is, give me your hand." And Jehonadab gave him his hand, so Jehu took him up to him into the chariot.
