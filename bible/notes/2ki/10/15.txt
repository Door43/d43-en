\v 15 And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him; and he saluted him, and
said to him, Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me your hand. And
he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.
\v 16 And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for Jehovah. So they made him ride in his chariot.
\v 17 And when he came to Samaria, he struck all that remained to Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the
word of Jehovah, which he spoke to Elijah.
