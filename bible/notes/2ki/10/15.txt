\v 15 When Jehu had left there, he met Jehonadab son of Recab coming to meet him. Jehu greeted him and said to him, "Is your heart with me, as my heart is with yours?" Jehonadab answered, "It is." Jehu said, "If it is, give me your hand." So he gave Jehu his hand, and Jehu took Jehonadab up with him into the chariot.
\v 16 Jehu said, "Come with me and see my zeal for Yahweh." So he had Jonadab ride along with him in his chariot.
\v 17 When he came to Samaria, Jehu killed all who remained from Ahab's descendants in Samaria, until he had destroyed Ahab's royal line, just as was told them before by the word of Yahweh, which he had spoken to Elijah.
