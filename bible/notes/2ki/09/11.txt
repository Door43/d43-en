\v 11 Then Jehu came out to the servants of his master, and one said to him, "Is everything alright?  Why did this mad fellow come to you?" Jehu answered  them, "You know the man and the kinds of things he says."
\v 12 They said, "No, we do not know. Tell us." Jehu answered, "He said this and that to me, and he also said, 'This is what Yahweh says: I have anointed you as king over Israel.'"
