\v 14 So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram was keeping Ramoth-gilead, he and
all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria;
\v 15 but king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with
Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If this be your mind, then let none escape and go forth out of the city, to go to tell it
in Jezreel.
\v 16 So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see
Joram.
