\v 14 So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. Now Joram had been guarding Ramoth-gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Aram,
\v 15 but King Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Arameans had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Aram. 
\p Jehu said to the servants of Joram, "If this is your mind, then let no one escape and go forth out of the city, to go to tell it
in Jezreel."
\v 16 So Jehu rode in a chariot to Jezreel; for Joram was at rest there. And Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram.
