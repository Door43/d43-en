\v 17 Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a
company. And Joram said, Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?
\v 18 So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus says the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What have you to
do with peace? turn you behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he comes not back.
