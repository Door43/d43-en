\v 17 Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, "I see a company." And Joram said, "Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, 'Are you coming in peace?' "
\v 18 So a man was sent on horseback to meet him, and said, "Thus says the king, 'Are coming in peace?' So Jehu said, "What have you to do with peace? Turn and ride behind me." Then the watchman told the king, "The messenger met them, but he is not coming back."
