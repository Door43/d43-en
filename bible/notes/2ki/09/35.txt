\v 35 They went to bury her, but they found no more of her than the skull, the feet, and the palms of her hands.
\v 36 So they came back and told Jehu. He said, "This is the word of Yahweh which he spoke by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, 'In the land at Jezreel the dogs will eat the flesh of Jezebel,
\v 37 and the body of Jezebel shall be like dung the fields in the land at Jezreel, so no one will be able to say, "This is Jezebel."'"
