\v 21 So Joram said, "Make ready." They prepared his chariot, and Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah rode out,
each in his chariot, to meet Jehu. They found him at the property of Naboth the Jezreelite.
\v 22 So when Joram saw Jehu, he said, "Are you coming in peace, Jehu?" He  answered, "What peace, when the
prostitutions of your mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?"
