\v 25 Then Jehu said to Bidkar his captain, "Pick him up and throw him in the field of Naboth the Jezreelite. Think about how when you and I rode together after Ahab his father, Yahweh placed this prophecy against him:
\v 26 'Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons, says Yahweh, and I will repay you in this field,' says Yahweh. Now then, take him and throw him into that place, that field, to bring to pass what we were told would happen by the word of Yahweh."
