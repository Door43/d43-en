\v 25 Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the
Jezreelite; for remember how that, when I and you rode together after Ahab his father, Jehovah laid this burden upon him:
\v 26 Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, says Jehovah; and I will requite you in
this plat, says Jehovah. Now therefore take and cast him into the plat
