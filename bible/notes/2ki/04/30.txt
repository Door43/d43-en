===== translationNotes: =====

  * **As Yahweh lives, and as you live** - "As surely as Yahweh lives and as you live." Here the woman compares the certainty that Yahweh and Elijah are alive to the certainty of what he is saying. This is a way of making a solemn promise. AT: "I solemnly promise that" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **but the child did not speak or hear** - This means that the child was not alive. AT: "but the child did not show any signs of being alive" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **has not awakened** - Here being dead is spoken of as being asleep. AT: "is still dead" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
