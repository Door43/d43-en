\v 42 A man came from Baal-shalishah and brought the man of God bread of the first-fruits, twenty loaves of barley,
and fresh ears of grain in his sack. Then he said, "Give this to the people, that they may eat."
\v 43 His servant said, "What, should I set this before a hundred men?" But Elisha said, "Give this to the people, that they may eat, because Yahweh says, 'They will eat and will have some left.' "
\v 44 So he set it before them and they ate, and left some, according to the word of Yahewh.
