\v 42 One day a man from the city of Baal Shalishah brought to Elisha a sack of freshly cut grain and twenty loaves of barley bread, made from the first grain that they had harvested that year.
\p Elisha said to his servant, "Give it to the group of prophets, so that they can eat it."
\v 43 But his servant exclaimed, "Do you think that we can feed a hundred of us prophets with only that much? How can I place this before them all?"
\p But Elisha replied, "Give it to the prophets so that they can eat it, because Yahweh says that there will be plenty for all of them, and there will be some left over!"
\v 44 After his servant gave it to the prophets, they ate all that they wanted, and there was food left over, just as Yahweh had promised.

\v 42 A man came from Baal Shalishah to the man of God and brought twenty loaves of barley bread in his sack from the new harvest, and fresh ears of grain. He said, "Give this to the people so they can eat."
\v 43 His servant said, "What, should I set this before a hundred men?" But Elisha said, "Give this to the people, so they can eat, because Yahweh says, 'They will eat and will have some left.'"
\v 44 So his servant set it before them; they ate, and left some remaining, just as the word of Yahweh promised.
