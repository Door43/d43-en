\v 42 A man came from Baal Shalishah and brought in his sack the man of God twenty loaves of barley bread from the new harvest, and fresh ears of grain. He said, "Give this to the people so they can eat."
\v 43 His servant said, "What, should I set this before a hundred men?" But Elisha said, "Give this to the people, so they can eat, because Yahweh says, 'They will eat and will have some left.' "
\v 44 So his servant set it before them; they ate, and left some remaining, just as the word of Yahweh promised.
