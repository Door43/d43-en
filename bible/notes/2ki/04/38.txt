\v 38 Then Elisha came again to Gilgal. There was famine in the land, and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him. He said to his servant, "Put the large pot on the fire and cook stew for the sons of the prophets."
\v 39 One of them went out into a field to gather vegetables. He found a wild vine and gathered enough wild gourds to fill the fold of his robe. They cut them up and put them into the stew, but did not know what kind they were.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The sons of the prophets** - This does not mean that they were the sons of prophets, but rather, that they were a group of prophets. See how you translated this phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:2ki:02:03|2:3]]. AT: "the group of men who were prophets" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **stew** - This is a dish that is usually made of meat and vegetables cooked in a pot with liquid.
  * **wild gourds** - These vegetables were growing wild, meaning someone had not planted them.
  * **fill the fold of his robe** - He lifted the bottom edge of his robe up to his waist to make a place to carry more gourds than he could carry with his hands only. 
  * **but did not know what kind they were** - Since they did not know what kind of gourds they were they did not know whether or not they were safe to eat. AT: "but did not know if they were good or bad to eat" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
