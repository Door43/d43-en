\v 17 But the woman conceived and gave birth to a son at the same time in the following year, as Elisha had said to her.
\v 18 When the child had grown, he went out one day to his father, who was with harvesters.
\v 19 He said to his father, "My head, my head." His father said to his servant, "Carry him to his mother."
\v 20 When the servant had picked him up and brought the boy to his mother, the child sat on her knees until noon and then died.
