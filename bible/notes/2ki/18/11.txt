====== 2 Kings 18:11-12 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 The king of Assyria commanded that the people of Israel be taken to Assyria. Some of them were taken to Halah \add town\add*, some were taken to a place near the Habor \add River\add* in the Gozan \add region\add*, and some were taken to cities where the Mede people-group live.
\v 12 That happened because the Israelites did not obey Yahweh their God. They disobeyed the agreement that Yahweh had made with their ancestors, and all the laws that Moses, the man who served Yahweh \add very well\add*, had told them to obey. They would not obey those laws; they would not even listen to them.

\v 11 So the king of Assyria carried Israel away to Assyria and put them in Halah, and at the Habor River in Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
\v 12 He did this because they did not obey the voice of Yahweh their God, but they violated the terms of his covenant, all that Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded. They refused to listen to it or do it.
