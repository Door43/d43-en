\v 4 He removed the shrines, destroyed the sacred stone pillars, and cut down the Asherah poles. He broke to pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made, because in those days the children of Israel were burning incense to it; it was called “Nehushtan.”
\v 5 Hezekiah trusted in Yahweh, the God of Israel, so that after him there was no one like him among all the kings of Judah, nor among the kings who were before him.
