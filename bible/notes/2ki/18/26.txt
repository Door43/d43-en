\v 26 Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah said to the chief commander, "Please speak to your servants in the Aramaic language, for we understand it. Do not speak with us in the language of Judah in the ears of the people who are on the wall."
\v 27 But the chief commander said to them, "Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words? Has he not sent me to the men who sit on the wall, who will have to eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Eliakim ... Hilkiah ... Shebnah ... Joah** - Translate the names of these men as in [[:en:bible:notes:2ki:18:16|18:18]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **in the ears of the people who are on the wall** - "In the ears" is metonymy for being able to listen. AT: "because the people standing on the city wall will hear it and be afraid" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words? Has he not sent me to the men who sit on the wall, who will have to eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?** - He asks these questions assuming the listeners know the answers to emphasize their intention to destroy and humiliate the leaders and people of Jerusalem. AT: "My master sent me not only to you and your master, but also to speak to the people in this city, who will suffer with you when they have to eat their own dung and drink their own urine to survive." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
