\v 19 One of Sennacherib's important officials told them to take this message to Hezekiah:
\p "This is what the king of Assyria, the great king, says: 'What are you trusting in \add to rescue you\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?
\v 20 You say that you have weapons to fight us and some country promises \add to help you\add*, \add and that will enable you to defeat us\add*, but that is only talk \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. Who do you think will help you to rebel against my \add soldiers from Assyria\add*?
\v 21 Listen to me! You are relying on the \add army of\add* Egypt. But that is like \f + \ft metaphor \f* using a broken reed for a walking stick on which you could lean. But it would pierce the hand of anyone who would lean on it! That is what the king of Egypt would be like for anyone who relied on him \add for help\add*.

\v 19 So Rabshakeh said to them to tell Hezekiah what  the great king, the king of Assyria, said: 
"What is the source of your confidence?
\v 20 You speak only useless words, saying  there are allies and strength for war. Now in whom are you trusting? Who has given you courage to rebel against me?
\v 21 Look, you trust in the walking stick of this bruised reed of Egypt, but if a man leans it will stick into his hand and pierce it. That is what Pharaoh king of Egypt is to anyone who trusts in him.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Rabshakeh (see note on [[:en:bible:notes:2ki:18:16|18:17]]) continues telling the message from the king of Assyria to King Hezekiah's men.

    * **Now in whom are you trusting? Who has given you courage to rebel against me?** - The King of Assyria (through his messenger Rabshakeh) does not ask these questions looking for an answer, but wants to make King Hezekiah doubt himself and Egypt's support. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **walking stick of this bruised reed of Egypt** - The King of Assyria compares Egypt to a weak walking stick; you expect that it will support you when you lean on it, but instead it breaks and cuts you. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
